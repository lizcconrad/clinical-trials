      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and local tolerability of multiple dose
      administration of inhaled OligoG in CF subjects. Particular emphasis will be put on local,
      clinical tolerance, pulmonary function and pulmonary adverse events. The secondary purpose is
      to monitor the effect of multiple dose administration of inhaled OligoG on various efficacy
      variables, such as mucolytic activity, lung function, respiratory symptoms, Quality-of-Life
      and microbiological outcome measures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis defined by:

               -  Clinical features consistent with the diagnosis of CF [(Rosenstein BJ and Cutting
                  GR 1998)]; AND

               -  Sweat chloride ≥60 mmol/L by pilocarpine iontophoresis; OR

               -  Genotypic confirmation of CFTR mutation

          -  Aged 18 years or older

          -  Ability to provide samples for microbiological evaluation throughout the study. Note:
             sputum samples are preferred however cough swabs may be performed on occasions where
             sputum cannot be collected.

          -  Positive microbiological finding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in expectorated sputum or
             cough swab documented within 24 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  FEV1 must, at Screening (Visit 1), be between 35%-80% of the predicted normal value
             following adjustment for age, gender, and height according to the Knudson equation
             [(Knudson RJ., Lebowitz MD., et al 1983)].

          -  At Screening (Visit 1), no clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of significant
             pulmonary illness, other than CF, which in the opinion of the investigator would
             preclude participation in the study.

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential and male subjects participating in the
             study who are sexually active must use acceptable contraception. Female subjects
             documented as being of non child-bearing potential (Section 4.2.8) are exempt from the
             contraceptive requirements. For the purpose of this study acceptable contraception is
             defined as:

               -  oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception;OR

               -  placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS);OR

               -  barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository

          -  Provision written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Changes in underlying therapy (e.g., pulmonary massage therapy, bronchodilators,
             NSAIDs, antibiotic agents, pancreatic enzyme preparations, nutritional supplements and
             DNase within the 21 days prior to Day 1 (Visit 2). Subjects must be willing to remain
             on the same underlying stable therapy regimens for the duration of the study until the
             final follow-up visit at Day 111.

          -  Changes in physiotherapy technique or schedule within 14 days prior to Day 1 (Visit
             2).

          -  Prohibited medications within 7 days prior to Day 1 (Visit 2). Prohibited medications
             are described in Section 5.6

          -  Pulmonary exacerbation within 28 days of Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Positive microbiological finding of Burkholderia sp. in expectorated sputum or cough
             swab documented within 12 months prior to Screening (Visit 1).

          -  On-going acute illness. Subjects must not have needed an outpatient visit,
             hospitalization or required any change in therapy for other pulmonary disease between
             Screening (Visit 1) and Day 1 (Visit 2).

          -  History of, or planned organ transplantation.

          -  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in the last 12 months prior to
             Screening (Visit 1), defined as having received treatment for ABPA.

          -  Requirement for continuous (24 hour/day) oxygen supplementation.

          -  Concomitant administration of inhaled mannitol or hypertonic saline within 7 days
             prior to Day 1 (Visit 2).

          -  Initiation of cycled, inhaled tobramycin (TOBI) less than 4 months prior to Screening
             (Visit 1). Note: Chronic TOBI users are allowed to participate in this study, but
             subjects who have recently initiated chronic TOBI should have at least 2 cycles of
             TOBI in the preceding 4 months before being enrolled in this study. Chronic TOBI
             subjects should be starting an 'off- TOBI' period at Day 1 (Visit 2) so there will be
             no concomitant dosing of TOBI and assigned study medication.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal findings on haematology or clinical chemistry. In
             addition, any value ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal will exclude the subject from
             participating in the study.

          -  Subjects unable to perform pulmonary function tests according to the ATS/ERS criteria.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women. A negative urine pregnancy test must be demonstrated
             in females of child-bearing potential (Section 4.2.8) at Screening (Visit 1).

          -  Subjects who have participated in any interventional clinical trial within the 28 days
             prior to Day 1 (Visit 2).

          -  Subjects with documented or suspected, clinically significant, alcohol or drug abuse.
             The determination of clinical significance will be determined by the Investigator.

          -  Known allergies or intolerance to alginates (e.g., foods and food additives based on
             seaweed extracts).

          -  Current malignant disease (with the exception of basal cell carcinoma; BCC).

          -  Any serious or active medical or psychiatric illness, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would interfere with subject treatment, assessment, or compliance with
             the protocol.
