  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with morbid obesity often develop a significant overhanging abdominal pannus.
      Problems associated with an overhanging pannus can include difficulty performing routine
      daily activities as well as exercise due to the cumbersome nature of the excess tissue. In
      addition, the abdominal pannus tissue often becomes infected due to difficulty with hygiene
      and abnormal circulation and lymphatic flow. There may also be a significant contribution
      from the pannus to the patient's underlying cardiopulmonary status which is often compromised
      in morbid obesity patients.

      In addition to weight loss, one of the treatment strategies includes a panniculectomy. A
      panniculectomy involves resection of the excess abdominal skin and fat in a wedge shape from
      the lower abdomen. Purported benefits include increased ability to exercise, better quality
      of life and improved cardiopulmonary function. However, there is a significant morbidity
      associated with panniculectomy surgery, with wound related complications occurring in as much
      as 50% of patients with this procedure.

      The investigators hypothesize that the panniculectomy procedure provides long term benefits
      to this patient population despite significant short term morbidity.

      This is a prospective trial to determine what if any functional and quality of life benefits
      are achieved with a panniculectomy. Patients will be evaluated preoperatively and
      postoperatively with specific interventions aimed at describing their functional status.
      These interventions will include: echocardiogram, pulmonary function testing, arterial blood
      gas, functional capacity evaluation by physical therapy, and a quality of life survey. The
      investigative interventions will be performed postoperatively at 6 months and again at 1 year
      post surgery. Data will also be gathered on complications such as wound infection,
      dehiscence, and cardiopulmonary problems.

      There should be no additional risk to the patient as the surgery and procedures listed are
      already performed routinely on this patient population.

      Study participants will have morbid obesity with significant overhanging pannus that requires
      surgical intervention.

      This study will compare the preoperative values to post operative values taken at 6 months
      and then at 1 year post operative. These values include echocardiograms, pulmonary function
      tests, arterial blood gases and a functional capacity evaluation.
