  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase II study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of sentinel lymph
      node (SLN) identification in patients with breast cancer using near-infrared (NIR)
      fluorescence optical imaging.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty participants consented from Brigham and Women's Hospital (currently enrolling) and Beth
      Israel Deaconess Medical Center (currently non-enrolling), who will be undergoing standard of
      care for breast cancer SLN mapping with Tc-99m will be enrolled in this study.

      Prior to surgery, patients will undergo lymphoscintigraphy as is standard of care. At the
      time of SLN mapping, the patient will be injected with indocyanine green dye (ICG).
      Concurrently, a custom-designed imaging platform that utilizes NIR fluorescence optics will
      be employed to identify the dye and its path through the lymphatic track, and its eventual
      highlighting of the SLN. Both color images and NIR images will be merged to give the
      operating surgeon a clear picture of the ICG track superimposed over anatomical landmarks.
      This technique will identify the SLN and provide an accurate video image of its location. The
      surgeon will resect all SLNs identified by Tc-99m or NIR fluorescence, and then confirm the
      radioactivity and NIR fluorescence signal in each after resection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must have histologically confirmed breast cancer and be deemed an
             appropriate surgical candidate with consent for a sentinel lymph node mapping by their
             oncologic surgeon.

          -  Age minimum: 18 years.

          -  Participant must be receiving a planned lymphoscintigraphy procedure.

          -  Participant must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who choose not to proceed with sentinel lymph node biopsy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to indocyanine green, including those patients with a history of iodide or
             seafood allergy.

          -  Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, as well as those women who are
             breastfeeding, will be excluded from this study.
