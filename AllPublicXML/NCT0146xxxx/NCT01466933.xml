    <textblock>
      Children of mothers in the intervention parenting program are expected to show benefits over
      the standard care control group in terms of better cognitive/language development, less
      recent illness, and better height for age. The mothers assigned to the intervention parenting
      program are expected to evidence higher levels of home stimulation, better health prevention,
      and better dietary diversity, along with more accurate knowledge of child development.
