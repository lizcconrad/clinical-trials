    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label extension study, offering patients who participated and completed
      previous studies 901 and 910 (an extension to 901) to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and
      clinical follow-up, for up to 3 additional years.The aim of the study is to collect safety
      and efficacy data of long term treatment effect of Diapep277.Only patients who completed
      studies 901 or 910 and still have stimulated C-peptide level equal to or above 0.2 nmol/L
      will be eligible for this extension study

      The study is an open-label extension study, offering patients who participated and completed
      previous studies 901 and 910 (an extension to 901) to continue treatment with DiaPep277 and
      clinical follow-up, for up to 2 additional years.The aim of the study is to collect safety
      and efficacy data of long term treatment effect of Diapep277.Only patients who completed
      studies 901 or 910 and still have stimulated C-peptide level equal to or above 0.2 nmol/L
      will be eligible for this extension study. The optimal dose and dosing regimen for this study
      will be the same as applied in the phase 3 study (901) and its extension study protocol
      (910), namely 1.0 mg DiaPep277® administered every 3 months. These conditions were determined
      as optimal based on the outcome of the phase 2 studies. For patients who just completed the
      2-year 901 study, a 3-year extended treatment will be offered with 13 administrations;
      patients who completed the 2-year 910 extension study will be offered a 3rd year of treatment
      with 5 additional administrations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient that participated in Study 901 and received all doses of study medication,
             per protocol or Study 910 and received all doses of study medication, per protocol.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant residual beta-cell function demonstrated by MMTT
             stimulated C-peptide concentrations ≥ 0.20 nmol/L.

          -  If a female is of childbearing potential, the subject is not pregnant or lactating,
             and will use oral hormonal contraception or other equally effective contraceptive

             abnormalities:Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             greater than three times the upper limit of the normal (ULN) at the Screening-Ext
             Visit.Total bilirubin greater than 1.3 times the ULN at the Screening-Ext

             interfere with the assessment of safety and / or efficacy of the study drug, other
             than hyperglycemia and glycosuria at the Screening- Ext Visit.Fasting triglycerides
             &gt;1000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) at the Screening-Ext Visit. Suitable medical therapy for
             treatment of hyperlipidemia is allowed.

          -  The subject is a known or suspected drug abuser.

          -  The subject is known to test positive for HIV antibodies.

          -  The subject has chronic hematologic disease.

          -  The subject has liver disease such as cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis.

          -  The subject has received any investigational drug within 3 months prior to Visit 12,
             other than DiaPep277 that was administered during study 901 or 910.

          -  The subject has had a severe blood loss within 2 months before the first dose of the
