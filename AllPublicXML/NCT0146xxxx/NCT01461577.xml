      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess the efficacy of insulin glargine as measured by changes of HbA1c levels from
           baseline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients following GLP-1 failure.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To determine the change in glycemic control, safety, and treatment satisfaction in
           insulin glargine use in patients following GLP-1 failure.
