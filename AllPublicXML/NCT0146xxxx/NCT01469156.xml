  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I/II study will investigate the safety and tolerability of intravitreally
      administered 0.5mg and 2.0mg Ranibizumab in three monthly doses followed by a 9 month period
      of criteria-based, as-needed retreatment and 12 month of drug safety follow up in subjects
      with exudative polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) for a total of 24 months.

      Twenty eyes will be randomized will receive 3 consecutive monthly intravitreal 2.0 mg/0.5mg
      (3:1 ratio) Ranibizumab injection with the first injection occuring at Day 0 and second and
      third injection occuring at month 1 and month 2 respectively. Retreatment with intravitreal
      Ranibizumab or other therapies will be at the investigators discretion but guidelines for
      recommended retreatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             urine pregnancy testing and be required to use appropriate methods of birth control.

          -  ICG and fluorescein angiographic characteristics consistent with active, leaking PCV
             with subfoveal lesions and/or subfoveal hemorrhage, lipid exudates, PED or fluid
             diagnosed within the past 6 months or diagnosed as newly active within the past 6
             months. Subjects who completed the 24 month follow up in the original FVF3671s
             protocol may enter the study without necessarily demonstrating active exudative PCV at
             enrollment.

          -  Best-Corrected ETDRS Visual Acuity at 4 meters between 20/20 - 20/800.

          -  Lesion size - no limitations.

          -  Lesions Characteristics - leaking lesions consistent with PCV. No limitations on
             hemorrhage, fibrosis or atrophy.

          -  No therapy (includes non foveal laser, PDT, intravitreal steroids, TTT, radiotherapy,
             or anti-VEGF therapy) or intraocular surgery within the past 30 days for any
             condition.

          -  Clear ocular media to allow for photography/angiography.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             demographic features consistent with this diagnosis.

          -  Allergy to Fluorescein, ICG, Iodine, Shellfish.

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test)

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated.

          -  Participation in another simultaneous medical investigation or trial.

          -  Exclude other anti-VEGF agents as therapy options.

          -  History of previous subfoveal laser.

          -  Any condition in the opinion of the investigator that would interfere with disease
             status/progression or jeopardize patients' participation in the study.
