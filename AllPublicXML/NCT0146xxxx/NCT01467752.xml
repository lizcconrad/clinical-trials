    <textblock>
      The metacarpophalangeal joint is vital for hand function. Cartilage loss of the joint is
      central to the development of joint failure in arthritis. Although various treatments have
      been proposed, the management remains a challenging problem.Previous anatomical studies have
      shown that, at the base of the metacarpal, there were nutrient arteries inserting into the
      dorsum of the metacarpal. The nutrient arteries arise from the distal and middle dorsal
      carpal arches that run distally to the first to fourth dorsal metacarpal arteries (DMAs.
      These studies prompt us to use a reverse vascularized cartilage and bone graft based on the
      DMA. The metacarpal consists of a widened proximal base. The joint surface to the capitate is
      convex anteriorly and dorsally concave, where it extends to the styloid process on the
      dorsolateral aspect of the metacarpal base. The unique contour stimulates our imagination and
      creativity to use a portion of the joint surface for reconstruction of metacarpophalangeal
      joint defects. The purpose of this study is to report the novel technique and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the treatment.

    <description>The active motions of the hand were measured by a goniometer. The patients rated their MCP joint pain, the donor joint pain, and scar pain using a line by a visual analogue scale (VAS). We used the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire to assess the hand function.</description>
