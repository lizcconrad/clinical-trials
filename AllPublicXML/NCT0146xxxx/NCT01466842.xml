  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether catheter ablation is more effective than
      antiarrhythmic drugs in the early stages of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In all the
      patients a subcutaneous loop recorder will be implanted.

             electrocardiogram or event recording during the last three years

          -  Never taken antiarrhythmic drugs or at most a pill in the pocket approach

          -  Willingness, ability and commitment to participate in baseline and follow-up
             evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Paroxysmal AF for more than three years

          -  An episode of atrial fibrillation that lasted more than seven days within the past six
             months

          -  Persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation

          -  Atrial fibrillation from reversible cause (i.e. surgery, hyperthyroidism,
             pericarditis)

          -  Documented atrial flutter

          -  Structural heart disease of clinical significance including:

               -  Cardiac surgery within six months of screening

               -  Unstable symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF) including NYHA Class III or
                  IV CHF at screening and/or ejection fraction &lt;30% as measured by echocardiography
                  or catheterization

               -  Unstable angina

               -  Myocardial infarction within six months of screening

               -  Surgically corrected atrial septal defect with a patch or closure device

               -  LA size &gt; 40mm

          -  Prosthetic mitral heart valve

          -  Poor general health that, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not allow the
             patient to be a good study candidate (i.e. other disease processes, mental capacity,
             etc.)

          -  Contraindication to coumadin or heparin

          -  History of pulmonary embolus or stroke within one year of screening

          -  Acute pulmonary edema
