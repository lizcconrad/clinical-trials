  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between cognitive impairment, patient
      self-management, health, and health service use in adults with heart failure (NYHA Class 2
      and 3). The research questions are:

        1. How is cognitive impairment (memory, attention, global and executive function) related
           to various aspects of impaired self-management (knowledge of adherence, adherence to
           sodium restriction and medications, symptom monitoring of weight changes, and decision
           and action to seek care)?

        2. How are these relationships altered when adjusting for medical, demographic, and
           psychosocial factors?

        3. What are the relationships among degree of cognitive impairment, quality
           self-management, health status, and health service use?
