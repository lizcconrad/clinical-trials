  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanism by which macrolide antibiotics have immune modifying effects independent from
      its antibacterial activity has not been well established. In the present work, the
      investigators will analyze the effect of long-term treatment with azithromycin (250 mg three
      times per week during three months) on airway oxidative stress markers in exhaled breath
      condensate of adult patients with stable non-CF bronchiectasis.

      The mechanism by which macrolide antibiotics have immune modifying effects independent from
      its antibacterial activity has not been well established. In the present work, we will
      analyze the effect of long-term treatment with azithromycin (AZ) on airway oxidative stress
      markers in exhaled breath condensate of adult patients with stable non-CF bronchiectasis.
      Patients will be randomized in an open label model to receive AZ 250 mg three times per week
      during three months or nothing.Dyspnea (Borg scale), exacerbations (Nº) in the last three
      months, sputum volume (cc), sputum colour (15-point scale), and health related quality of
      life (Questionnaire St.George) will be measured in both groups before and after treatment.
      Lung function, sputum culture, CT scan (Bhalla score) and inflammatory markers in blood (ESR,
      PCR),exhaled air (Nitric Oxide,) and exhaled condensed air (pH, nitrites, isoprostane) will
      be assessed before and after treatment. Relationships between clinical and inflammatory
      markers will be studied

    <description>Oxidative stress and NO metabolism in airway were investigated by measuring pH and the concentration of 8-isoprostane, nitrites (NO2-) and nitrates (NO3-) in EBC. Exhaled NO was also determined in all patients.</description>

    <description>In order to analyze sputum characteristics, three sterile containers were given to collect all sputum produced during three consecutive days. The average of the three days was calculated and expressed in mL/day. Sputum colour was scored using a scale developed and validated in our laboratory, which ranged from zero to fifteen: transparent (0), white (1), progressive intensities of yellow (2-7), green (8-10) and brown (10-15). Colour scores were decided after agreement between two investigators</description>
