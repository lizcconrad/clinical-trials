  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information regarding the use of Myfortic, Prograf,
      and corticosteroids in new liver transplant recipients. These three medicines help to prevent
      the body from rejecting the transplanted liver. The information the investigators are
      obtaining is data relating to the process of Myfortic absorption by the body, its
      distribution in the body, the breakdown of Myfortic in the body, and its elimination from the
      body. This absorption, distribution, breakdown, and elimination is called pharmacokinetics.

      Myfortic is approved for use in kidney transplant recipients, and has been prescribed by
      doctors for liver transplant recipients. No study has been reported to date evaluating the
      pharmacokinetics of Myfortic in new liver transplant recipients who also take Prograf and
      corticosteroids. During this six month study, a series of blood samples will be obtained
      after subjects take Myfortic, Prograf, and corticosteroids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults &gt; or equal to age 18 years

          -  Planned to receive tacrolimus and corticosteroid therapy posttransplant

          -  Serum creatinine at transplant &lt; or equal to 2.5mg/dL

          -  UCSF tumor staging &lt; 8cm total

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to the baseline visit and are required to practice a reliable method of
             contraception for the duration of the study and for no fewer than 6 weeks after
             completing the study.

          -  Signed informed consent form prior to any research assessment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Induction therapy

          -  Requiring dialysis at the time of transplant

          -  Organ transplant other than liver

          -  Pregnant or nursing females

          -  Women of childbearing potential not practicing reliable methods of contraception.
             Reliable methods for contraception include surgical sterilization (hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation), double-barrier method (such as condom and diaphragm). To be
             considered as post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential, female subjects must
             have experienced 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea.

          -  Require any medications that interfere with metabolism of Myfortic (other than
             corticosteroids)

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to mycophenolate sodium, mycophenolic acid,
             mycophenolate mofetil, or any of its excipients

          -  Participation in a study of investigational drug in the previous 30 days or 5
             half-lives of the investigational drug
