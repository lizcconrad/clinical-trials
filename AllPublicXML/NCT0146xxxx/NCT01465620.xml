      Metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance and possibly metabolic
      syndrome can induce a peripheral neuropathy. To investigate the effect of physical training
      and diet education on neuropathic symptoms and neurophysiological parameters of patients with

      Metabolic disorder such as diabetes mellitus, glucose intolerance and possibly metabolic
      syndrome can induce a peripheral neuropathy. The objectives of the present study are to
      investigate:

        1. the effect of physical training and diet education on neuropathic symptoms and
           neurophysiological parameters

        2. the best coaching modality of education.

      This will be a prospective single blind study (blinded evaluator). Patients will be randomly
      assigned in two groups. The first group will have a one-day therapeutic education program
      followed by a 5-minutes phone call every week for 3 months. The second group will have the
      same one-day therapeutic education program that will be followed by an unique one-hour phone
      call. During the one-day therapeutic education program and the phone calls, hygienic rules
      (ie physical activities) and dietetic regimen advices will be given to patients. Evaluation
      will be done at 3 months.
