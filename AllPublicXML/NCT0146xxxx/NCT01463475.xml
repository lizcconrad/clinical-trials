      The objective of this protocol is to use established standard criteria and methods for the
      collection of hMSC (human mesenchymal stromal cells) from healthy bone marrow donors. The
      hMSC collected from the donors will use to develop well-defined and reproducible cell banks.
      Standard manufacturing procedures and quality control testing methods will be used to
      characterize and evaluate the final cell product. After the cell banks are created, these
      cell products will be used in future translational or clinical research.
