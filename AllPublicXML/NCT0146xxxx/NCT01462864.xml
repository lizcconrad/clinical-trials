  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal imbalance affecting about 12% of women
      in the UK. The number of women with PCOS is rising. They suffer from a combination of
      symptoms including excess hair, irregular/absent periods, and infertility. About 70% of women
      with PCOS are obese or overweight, 10% develop type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and 30-40% have some
      degrees of abnormality in controlling (metabolising) blood sugar. Studies have shown that if
      women with PCOS make change to their lifestyle (diet and activity), they may reduce their
      risk of getting diabetes and heart disease in the future. This study aims to develop and test
      a programme that can be run in groups (structured education), to support women with PCOS make
      the lifestyle changes needed to improve their PCOS and prevent future associated health
      problems. Structured education programmes are suitable for use within the NHS and are already
      recommended for individuals with T2DM, but have not been tested as a method of treatment for
      PCOS which is a high risk condition for T2DM.

      The investigators aim to initially develop a specific education programme for women with PCOS
      using their expertise in their disease and defining their needs. The next step is to test
      this programme on 160 women with PCOS who will be selected from the investigators database or
      clinics. They will be divided randomly to two groups to receive either this programme or
      routine care.

      The investigators will give them an accelerometer (a very small portable device). This will
      measure their physical activity and counts their daily steps. The investigators aim is to
      increase their step count by at least 2000 steps per day after one year.

      The investigators believe that the group given the structured education will show some
      evidence of improvement in their glucose metabolism, and consequently decreased chance of
      developing diabetes.

      Overview of project plan:

      Development of the structured education course: Year 1 (Phases 1&amp;2)

      Phase 1:

      The SUCCESS intervention (structured education programme to improve cardiovascular risk in
      women with PCOS) will be developed and piloted in line with the Medical Research Council's
      framework for complex interventions. This will involve recruiting participants for focus
      groups and interviews to allow the research group to develop a detailed understanding of what
      the requirements of the structured education course are.

      Inclusion criteria for patients in this phase is women with a clear diagnosis of PCOS based
      on Rotterdam 2003 Criteria or National Institute of Health 1992 And 18&lt; age &lt;70 years
      Participants will be recruited from a database of patients in our speciality clinic and also
      primary care if needed and the interviews/ focus groups will be held in locations close to
      the participant, or over the telephone.

      Analysis of these sessions will provide invaluable data for the development of the structured
      education course.

      As part of this phase of the study we will perform a systematic review of the literature on
      the previous lifestyle interventions in the PCOS.

      We will also perform a demographic analysis of almost 2400 patients with diagnosis of PCOS in
      University Hospitals of Leicester database. We already have the ethical approval for the
      conducting routine database linkage studies including a linkage with the hospital admission
      database in local Health Informatics Service. Demographic distribution of diagnosis,
      complications of PCOS, cardiovascular outcomes, and reported comorbidities besides other
      information such as deprivation score will inform us of the important issues need to be
      considered in development of an education intervention for women with PCOS in phase 2 and 3.

      Phase 2

      Once the course has been designed, it will be piloted in one or two groups of women with PCOS
      to get feedback on the content and delivery. These feedbacks will be incorporated in the
      course and contents will be refreshed and refined.

      For the above mentioned pilot sessions, patients will only attend a 3.5 hours education
      session and no test or measurement will be done.

      After each session their views on the content and delivery of the education will be sought.
      We will continue to run these pilot sessions until we get no further new comments. Previous
      experience with other similar interventions has shown that two pilot sessions are enough.

      When the education programme is ready we can test its efficacy in a randomised controlled
      trial.

      Phase 3Í¾ Randomised controlled trial: Years 2 &amp; 3

      The primary hypothesis of the randomised controlled trial is:

      &quot;Structured education can increase physical activity measured as walking steps in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome.&quot;

      Study design:

      This is a randomised controlled community based trial. Participants will be randomised to
      either the intervention or control group at the beginning. A controlled design for the
      current study is essential given that it is unknown whether structured education is effective
      at initiating a lifestyle change and whether it translates into improvements in important
      markers of metabolic and vascular health. Therefore in order to inform health policy evidence
      is needed from high quality randomized controlled trials carried out in a community setting.

      Our study intervention will not interfere with the routine care of a woman diagnosed with
      PCOS, whether the patient is recruited from speciality clinics or in primary care.

    <description>It has been shown that 1 mmol/L drop in 2 hours glucose tolerance test following lifestyle intervention is significantly effective in diabetes prevention equal to 50% reduction in progression to T2DM. A previous similar intervention in people with IGR by our group in Leicester achieved a significant drop of 1.31 mmol/L (SD 2 mmol/L) in 2 hours glucose tolerance through an increase of 2000 steps per day in walking activity (SD 4000 steps/day).</description>

    <description>PCOSQ is the only specified health related quality of life questionnaire developed and tested for this condition (Cronin 1998), which has been validated in UK (Jones 2004). It contains 26 items measuring 5 areas; emotions, body hair, weight, infertility problems, and menstrual problems.</description>

    <measure>Exercise and Barrier Self Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>It will be measured using the 100% confidence rating scale (from 0% = no confidence to 100% = complete confidence) (Keller 1999). This self-efficacy questionnaire measures participants' confidence in their ability to undertake any form of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity for 10 minute periods, increasing incrementally from 10 minutes to one hour each day. An overall score is calculated by summing the efficacy scores for each time period and dividing by the number of time periods.</description>

    <description>The risk of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) has been reported to be 5 to even 30 fold higher in women with PCOS (Nitsche 2010). Epworth Sleepiness Scale is the standard questionnaire developed for clinical assessment of behavioural morbidity associated with OSA and can assess the degree of sleepiness reliably as an screening tool.

    <description>In a sub-study of the SUCCESS study population, a whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and a single section abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan taken in the L3-L4 region will be used to measure soft tissue body composition and visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat distribution respectively.</description>

    <description>This nine item validated instrument uses an 11 point Likert scale (0 = no effect, 10 = complete effect) to measure five cognitive illness representations (consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, and identity), two emotional representations (concern and emotion) and illness comprehensibility (perceived knowledge). The BIPQ has been shown to have reasonable test-retest reliability and concurrent validity (Broadbent 2006).</description>
