  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a non-randomized pilot study to assess the feasibility and
      effectiveness of using urban beauty salons as settings for culturally-competent health
      education about HPV vaccination. The educational messages will engage individual women, their
      peer group, their family members and community influencers in a way that is authentic and
      share-able. Involving women in give-and-take discussions with people they trust and
      respect—their hairdressers—will be essential to increasing the number of them who consider
      the HPV vaccine for themselves and for those they care about. The investigators believe that
      it is only after women who are opinion leaders among their peers begin positively supporting
      HPV prevention that it will gain wider acceptance.

      The investigators plan to recruit eight (8) predominantly African American beauty salons in
      Philadelphia and train multiple stylists in each salon to act as in-salon educators and
      facilitators for client recruitment to sexual health education sessions. These education
      sessions will be run by trained health educators (also African American females) and take
      place during &quot;down times&quot; in each of the salons, on a rotating basis.

        -  The investigators hypothesize the ability to successfully recruit eight (8) beauty
           salons for participation

        -  The investigators hypothesize the ability to successfully train multiple stylists per
           site to talk to their clients about HPV and its impact on women of color

        -  The investigators hypothesize that knowledge and awareness of HPV, as well as intentions
           to vaccinate will significantly improve among women who attend a salon-based health
           education session

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To increase knowledge and awareness about HPV, as well as intentions to vaccinate among beauty salon clients. Intentions to vaccinate will be measured with a single item using the following wording &quot;How likely are you (or your daughter) to start the HPV vaccine series in the next 6 months?&quot;. Response options range from &quot;very likely&quot; to &quot;very unlikely&quot; using a 5-point Likert scale.</description>
