    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of low dose rate radiation therapy plus
      temozolomide. This will be in patients with High Grade Glioma (to only include Anaplastic
      Astrocytoma or Glioblastoma Multiforme) who have previously been treated with surgery
      followed by radiation surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy plus
      temozolomide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that low dose fractionated radiation therapy
      (LDFRT) may be used to potentiate full dose chemotherapy, decreasing the development of
      resistance found with standard doses of radiation and chemotherapy. This is a nonrandomized,
      open label, single institution phase II trial with a safety run-in to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of LDFRT plus temozolomide in patients with High Grade Glioma (to only include
      Anaplastic Astrocytoma or Glioblastoma Multiforme) previously treated with surgical resection
      followed by adjuvant radiation therapy plus temozolomide. The primary objective of the phase
      II study is to estimate response rate in patients treated with twice daily fractions of low
      dose radiation plus temozolomide chemotherapy.

    <description>All patients will receive temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28 day cycle) for a total of 1 year or until the time of disease progression.
All patients will receive 0.5 Gy of radiation therapy twice daily. This study will include a safety run-in component. If &gt; 33% of patients in the initial cohort of 6 experience grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicity according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4, then a dose reduction will occur following the schedule listed below. Otherwise, following a 1 month waiting period after the first cycle of adjuvant LDFRT plus temozolomide for the first cohort of patients, the phase 2 study will open for full accrual. Patients will receive radiation with the first six 28-day cycles of temozolomide.</description>
