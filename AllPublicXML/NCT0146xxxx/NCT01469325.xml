  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sequential left prefrontal Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS), with high
      frequency, for Treatment-Resistant Depression have been shown to have antidepressant effects.
      but doubts remain about the magnitude of previously demonstrated treatment effects.The aim of
      this study is To test whether daily weekday left prefrontal rTMS safely and effectively
      treats Resistant Depression disorder compared to sham controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design:

      Prospective, randomized, active sham-controlled (1:1 randomization), duration-adaptive design
      with 3 weeks of daily weekday treatment (fixed-dose phase) followed by continued blinded
      treatment for up to another 3 weeks in improvers.

      Setting:

      University psychiatric hospitals in Tehran including Roozbeh Hospital, Rasool Hospital and
      Imam Hossein General Hospital will refer clients to Iranian National Center for Addiction
      Studies, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

      Patients:

      About 60 patients with unipolar nonpsychotic major depressive disorder, according to DSM-IV,
      resistant to treatment.

      INTERVENTION:

      We delivered rTMS to the left prefrontal cortex at 120% motor threshold (10 Hz, 4-second
      train duration, and 26-second intertrain interval) for 37.5 minutes (3000 pulses per session)
      using a figure-eight solid-core coil. Sham rTMS used a similar coil with a metal insert
      blocking the magnetic field and scalp electrodes that delivered matched somatosensory
      sensations.
