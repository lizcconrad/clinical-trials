  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an illness characterized by progressive decline in
      lung function and premature death from respiratory failure. Fibrocytes are a novel population
      of bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells that have been shown to traffic to the
      lungs and contribute to fibrosis in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis, and whose numbers
      correlate with the degree of fibrosis and with survival in human pulmonary fibrosis. The
      investigators propose to test the hypothesis that therapy with the mTOR inhibitor, sirolimus,
      reduces the number of circulating fibrocytes in patients with IPF. The investigators propose
      to test this hypothesis in short-term pilot trial of sirolimus in patients with IPF to
      determine its effect on the number and phenotype of circulating fibrocytes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients 21-85 years of age

          2. Individuals diagnosed with IPF, based on:

               -  clinical symptoms consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) of &gt; 3
                  months duration, plus

               -  histologically diagnosed UIP or diagnostic chest high resolution CT features of
                  UIP, plus

               -  negative workup for known causes of UIP

          3. Ability to understand a written informed consent form and comply with the requirements
             of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical features or known diagnosis of an active infection, including untreated
             latent tuberculosis

          2. Clinical features or known diagnosis of malignancy

          3. Known diagnosis of an interstitial lung disease other than IPF including but not

             pneumonia (NSIP).

          4. History of clinically significant environmental exposures known to cause interstitial
             lung disease (including but not limited to drugs, asbestos, silica, beryllium,
             radiation, domestic birds, etc).

          5. Diagnosis of any connective tissue disease (including but not limited to scleroderma,
