  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL) expression on Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (CLL) cells will predict a more aggressive clinical course. The results from this
      proposal will validate the use of a novel antibody developed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock in CLL
      and will predict CLL patients that have a more aggressive form of the disease. The
      investigators work will also provide direct evidence that LPL is expressed on CLL cells and
      provides a critical source of fatty acids required by the CLL cells to grow and survive.
      Fatty acid metabolism may become a therapeutic target in CLL in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to use a novel antibody developed at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
      Center to characterize the expression of LPL in CLL. Peripheral blood from CLL patients will
      be analyzed by flow cytometry to detect the expression of LPL and to investigate if LPL
      expression correlates with a more aggressive type of CLL. The investigators propose that LPL
      protein expression on CLL cells is prognostic and that LPL and other proteins involved in
      fatty acid metabolism are critical for CLL cells to survive.
