  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the exploratory study is to compare dose related effects of LAS41004 formulations
      in a non-occlusive PPT.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Going for a non-occlusive application design will allow to draw practical conclusions as
      being similar to a real treatment situation (compared with a occluded design to maximise
      effects)

             application meeting the following criteria:

               1. located at trunk and/or extremities (plaques located on the head, palms, or sole

               2. Where more than one plaque is to be used, plaques that are comparable, with at
                  least &quot;2&quot; in each score for scaling, erythema and induration.

               3. No more than 3 points difference in total score (sum of scores for scaling,
                  erythema and induration)

        and during conduct of study Biologics 6 months prior to study day 1 and during conduct of

        during study

          -  Topical treatment of all other body regions with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants
             where more than 20 % of the body surface area is treated

          -  Treatment with any non-marketed drug substance within 4 weeks prior to study day 1

          -  Topical treatment of the test area without adequate time for washout

        dermatitis in test area Moderate or severe illness within the last two weeks before first
        exposure Other known infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis or AIDS) Other skin diseases that
        may confound the evaluation of psoriasis

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any ingredients of the study drugs,

          -  Known calcium metabolism disorders

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system
