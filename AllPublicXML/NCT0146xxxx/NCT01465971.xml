  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major challenges in adapting to high altitudes is that with increasing altitude
      sleeping quality declines rapidly. Thus, the night sleep can only provide limited to none
      regeneration. It usually takes a prolonged stay at a constant altitude to adapt sufficiently
      to the altitude and to have a refreshing night sleep. 1975 Reit et. al showed in their
      EEG-recordings that the sleep architecture (the regular succession of the particular sleep
      phases) is disturbed by repeating arousals which occur due to an irregularity in the
      breathing rhythm.

      The purpose of this study is to create a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms
      that lead to failed acclimatization and AMS, due to sleep disturbance.

      Under sea level conditions humans breath between 10 and 12 times per minute. The breathing
      cycle in high altitude is accelerated. If the conscious breathing control vanishes during
      sleep a periodic breathing with alternating episodes of hyperventilation and apnea is the
      result. This circumstance causes repetitive arousals that do not allow a normal sleep
      pattern. The associated adverse effects are fatigue, slow or failed acclimatization,
      weakening of the immune system, lack of motivation and the disability to make rational
      decisions.

      Sleep deprivation is a common reason for the abortion of a trip, accidents and severe forms
      of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS).
