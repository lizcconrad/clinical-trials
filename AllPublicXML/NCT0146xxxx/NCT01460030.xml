      This is an intra-individual titration study of KRN1493 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      KRN1493 for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma or
      intractable primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet any one of the following. Patients with a diagnosis of parathyroid
             carcinoma and corrected serum calcium &gt; 11.3 mg/dL at the latest screening test.
             Patients with intractable PHPT (defined as follows: impossible to localize parathyroid
             tumor before initial surgery or in relapse after surgery, or impossible to perform
             parathyroidectomy (PTx) for complications, and corrected serum calcium is &gt; 12.5 mg/dL
             at the screening test).

          -  Patients who provided their voluntary written informed consent to participate in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with malignant tumor except for parathyroid carcinoma, nonmelanoma
             skin cancer, and carcinoma in situ of the cervix within 5 years before enrollment.

          -  Patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy except for the treatment of parathyroid
             carcinoma.

          -  Patients diagnosed with hypercalcemia associated with malignant tumors other than
             parathyroid carcinoma.

          -  Patients who had hypersensitivities to cinacalcet HCl preparations or vehicles.
