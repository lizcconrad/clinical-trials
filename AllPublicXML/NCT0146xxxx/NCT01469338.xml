      This phase II trial studies how well octreotide works in reducing diarrhea in patients
      receiving cabazitaxel and prednisone for hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) previously
      treated with docetaxel. Octreotide may prevent diarrhea by blocking the secretion of several
      hormones in patients receiving chemotherapy for prostate cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the impact of octreotide in reducing the incidence of grade 2 or greater
      diarrhea in men receiving cabazitaxel plus prednisone for castration-resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC) after docetaxel therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS).

      II. Progression-free survival (PFS) (defined as the time between treatment start and the
      first date of progression as measured by objective tumor progression using the Response
      Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), pain progression or death).

      III. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate.

      IV. Objective response rate.

      V. Pain response.

      VI. Toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabazitaxel as intravenous (IV) infusion over 1 hour on day 1, prednisone by
      mouth (PO) every day (QD), and octreotide pamoate given as intramuscular (IM) injection on
      day 1. Patients also receive octreotide acetate as a subcutaneous (SC) injection three times
      a day (TID) on days 1-14 of course 1 only. Treatment with cabazitaxel repeats every 21 days
      and treatment with prednisone and octreotide pamoate repeats every 4 weeks for up to 10
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of
      study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 3 months until disease
      progression, and then every 6 months thereafter.

    <description>Defined by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 criteria as an increase in frequency of 4 or greater stools per day over baseline, incontinence, diarrhea warranting hospitalization or diarrhea limiting self-care activities of daily living (ADL). Baseline frequency will be defined in the pre-treatment assessment from cycle 1 as the maximum number of stools in one 24 hour period during the past 2 weeks. Any incidence of grade 2 or greater diarrhea during treatment or for up to 21 days after the last administration of cabazitaxel will be included in this endpoint.</description>
