      Objectives: The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is an association
      between respiratory problems and dental caries in children who exhibit the habit of bruxism.

      Method: Patient histories were taken and clinical exams were performed on 90 children for
      selection and allocation to one of two groups. For the determination of bruxism, a
      questionnaire was administered to parents/guardians and an oral clinical exam was performed
      based on the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Thirty-three male and female
      children between four and seven years of age participated in the present study - 14 children
      with bruxism and 19 children without bruxism. The data were statistically analyzed using the
      chi-square test, with level of significance set at 5% (p &lt; 0.05).

        Children with either the complete primary or mixed dentition who were not in dental
        treatment were included in the study and divided into two groups: those with bruxism and
        those without bruxism. For the diagnosis of bruxism, a questionnaire was administered to
        determine the occurrence of teeth clenching/grinding and a physical exam was performed for
        the determination of dental wear based on the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep
        Medicine. Dental caries were determined based on the criteria of the World Health
        Organization
