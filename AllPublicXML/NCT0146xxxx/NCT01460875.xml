    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies recombinant interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with
      melanoma. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and
      slow the growth of melanoma

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether selection of the optimal IFN-alpha-2b (recombinant interferon
      alfa-2b) dose can be made using signal transduction data.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability of adjuvant IFN-alpha-2b administered at an optimized dose
      in terms of the toxicities that are observed and the ability of patients to receive a full
      year of therapy.

      II. The transcription of a panel of IFN-alpha-induced genes previously identified by
      microarray analysis will be determined by Real-Time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction (RT PCR) in order that the correlation between signal transducer and activator of
      transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation and IFN-alpha gene regulation can be evaluated.

      III. Microarray analysis of patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be used
      to evaluate the effect of dose-reduction on IFN-alpha gene expression.

      IV. In order to define the clinical role of tumor sensitivity to IFN-alpha, patient tumor
      biopsies taken prior to the administration of IFN-alpha will be systematically evaluated for
      cellular levels of janus kinase (Jak)-STAT signaling intermediates.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) thrice weekly. Treatment
      continues for 11 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be considered a candidate for adjuvant IFN-alpha-2b therapy after having
             undergone successful surgery for high-risk melanoma (Breslow thickness &gt; 4 mm or lymph
             node disease) or complete resection of metastatic disease; definitive surgery should
             have been accomplished no greater than 90 days prior to start of treatment with
             intravenous IFN-alpha-2b

          -  Patients must have completed 20 treatments of intravenous IFN-alpha-2b according to
             standard practice within 2 months of beginning treatment on this study

          -  Patients must have not have any evidence of persistent or recurrent disease as
             determined by the appropriate radiologic imaging techniques

          -  Patients may have received prior IFN-alpha therapy for metastatic disease, but more
             than 6 months must have passed between the last dose of IFN-alpha therapy for
             metastatic disease and the first dose of intravenous IFN-alpha-2b; patients who have
             had prior interleukin (IL)-2 are eligible for this study

          -  Patients may have received radiation therapy after intravenous IFN-alpha-2b; they may
             begin subcutaneous dosing of IFN-alpha-2b on this study after the radiation therapy
             has been completed; the patient may initiate dose reductions after the last radiation
             treatment as long as the appropriate amount of time has passed

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 70%)

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/ul

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ul

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/ul

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.0 (Gilbert's disease permitted)

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) &lt;
             3 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 and stable OR

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL.min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above
             normal

          -  Pulse oximetry &gt;= 90% on room air at rest

          -  Serum pregnancy test negative

          -  The effects of interferon alpha-2b on the developing human fetus at the recommended
             therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, and because interferons are known to be
             teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             provide written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines; a copy of the informed consent document signed by the patient must be
             given to the patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds that are similar to interferon
             alpha-2b

          -  Patients known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HbsAg) or hepatitis C antibody

          -  Patients with organ allografts or immunodeficiency syndromes

          -  Patients with prior malignancies may participate provided they have been free of
             disease for at least 2 years except for tumors with a negligible risk for metastasis
             or death, such as adequately controlled basal cell carcinoma or squamous-cell
             carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements; a history of depression in and of itself is not an exclusion to
             going participating provided the patient and physician believe the depression is
             controlled and the patient will discontinue the IFN-alpha should symptoms recur

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because interferon alpha-2b is an agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with IFN-alpha, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with IFN-alpha

          -  Prisoners will be excluded due to the need for multiple timed visits
