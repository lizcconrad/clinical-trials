  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess [18F] CFPyPB PET imaging as a tool to evaluate
      the activity of the GlyT1 receptors in the brain of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Alzheimer
      Disease (AD) research participants.

      Approximately 6 subjects with Parkinson disease, 6 subjects with Alzheimer disease and 20
      healthy control subjects will be recruited to participate in this study. All subjects will
      undergo written informed consent and a screening evaluation including baseline clinical
      laboratory testing, a baseline physical and neurological evaluation and baseline cognitive
      evaluations. Subjects will be asked to undergo a bolus injection of [18F] CFPyPB followed by
      serial PET imaging scans and plasma sampling for measurement of [18F] CFPyPB in plasma (both
      protein bound and free) over a period of up to 4 hours. The imaging analyses will be
      performed by an image-processing specialist who will remain masked to the procedures employed
      with each imaging acquisition. The primary imaging outcome measure will be the brain regional
      distribution volumes expressed as a brain tissue to plasma ratio of the radioligand, [18F]
      CFPyPB. Time to the peak uptake and amplitude of the peak uptake will be evaluated for all
      brain regions and the results for the PD and AD subjects will be compared with the HC
      subjects.

      At least 2 weeks following the initial imaging visit subjects (up to 2 PD subjects, up to 2
      AD subjects and up to 5 HC subjects) may be asked to return for a second injection and
      scanning procedure to evaluate the reproducibility of the imaging measure using this
      procedure. Subjects may decline participation in the second scan. Subjects will be requested
      to return for this second scan until enough second scan data is collected to evaluate the
      imaging outcome measure for reproducibility.
