  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50% of Head and Neck cancers are locally advanced at presentation. Although
      surgery, in combination with other modalities like radiation therapy can achieve 40-50% five
      year survival rates, resection in the head and neck region can leave patients with poor
      functional and cosmetic outcomes.

      Due to these concerns about quality of life after surgery, there has been a lot of interest
      in non surgical alternatives of treatment. Various combinations of radiation, chemotherapy
      and biologics has showed promising results. However, questions still remain about the ideal
      combination treatment regimen.

      Based on assimilation of data from multiple sources, our study tries to identify the role of
      a potentially highly effective multi-modality regimen based on induction chemotherapy
      (Cisplatin, Docetaxel and 5 Fluorouracil) followed by combination of a biologic agent,
      Cetuximab, and radiation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be given two cycles of induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin, Docetaxel and
      Fluorouracil. This will be followed by six weeks of radiation therapy along with Cetuximab.
      Patients will get two more cycles of chemotherapy with the same agents after the completion
      of radiation therapy course. Patients will be watched very closely during the trial period,
      with close follow up of treatment responses and monitoring of any adverse effects.

    <description>3D conformal radiation therapy or Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with or without Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) will be used for all patients. Radiotherapy will be delivered in 1.8 to 2.25 Gy fractions daily, five days per week excluding holidays, for a total of 66-72 Gy delivered to the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV, defined below) plus appropriate margin and 44-59.4 Gy to at-risk lymph nodes as determined by primary tumor characteristics. Alternative fractionation and dosing schema may be used as deemed appropriate for an individual case. For IMRT, the minimum Planning Target Volume (PTV) dose should be 90% of the prescription dose and a minimum of 95% of the PTV should receive the prescribed dose.</description>
