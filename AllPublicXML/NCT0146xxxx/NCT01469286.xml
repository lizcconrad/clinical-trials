  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is a common disease defined as delayed emptying of the stomach. It is present
      in at least 20% of about 150 million patients with diabetes worldwide and in more than 20% of
      patients with functional dyspepsia that affects about 10%-25% of the general population.
      Gastroparesis is a refractory disease with a lack of therapeutic options. Common symptoms of
      gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety and abdominal bloating.

      Electroacupuncture (EA) is a combined procedure with acupuncture and electrical current
      stimulation instead of manual manipulations of the needles. Recent studies in our lab with EA
      or transcutaneous EA (TEA) have suggested a therapeutic role of EA or TEA for gastric
      motility disorders. Improvement has been observed with EA or TEA in gastric emptying as well
      as dyspeptic symptoms. In this project, a micro-stimulator is designed and developed for the
      TEA therapy. The micro-stimulator is small enough so that it can be attached to the skin next
      to the stimulation electrodes and therefore the patient can resume normal daily activity
      while being treated by TEA. This is not only attractive but also more effective since TEA can
      be performed more often and for longer durations.

      This exploratory project is designed to study the feasibility, efficacy and certain
      mechanisms of the proposed method of &quot;wireless&quot; TEA in patients with gastroparesis. Firstly
      the feasibility of the chronic use the proposed micro-stimulator will be studied. Secondly,
      the efficacy of the TEA in improving delayed gastric emptying and symptoms of gastroparesis
      will be investigated in a double-blinded crossover design in patients with diabetic or
      idiopathic gastroparesis. Thirdly, possible mechanisms involving pathogeneses of
      gastroparesis with TEA will be investigated.

    <description>Gastroparetic symptom questionnaire will use the previously validated gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI), including 9 symptoms: nausea (feeling sick to your stomach as if you were going to vomit or throw up), retching (heaving as if to vomit, but nothing comes up), vomiting, stomach fullness, not able to finish a normal sized meal, feeling excessively full after meals, loss of appetite, bloating (feeling like you need to loose your clothes) and stomach or belly visibly larger. Each symptom will be graded from 0 to 5 (none, very mild, mild, moderate, severe and very severe).</description>
