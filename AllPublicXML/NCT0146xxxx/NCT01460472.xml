    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open label, parallel-group, multicenter phase III study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of active specific immunotherapy with racotumomab plus best
      supportive care versus best supportive care in patients with advanced NSCLC who have achieved
      an Objective Response (Partial or Complete Response) or Stable Disease with standard
      first-line treatment. Also immunological parameters will be evaluated. Best supportive
      therapy will be administered to all patients in the study according to institutional
      standards and includes any subsequent onco-specific therapies. 1082 patients will be included
      in the study, with non-small cell lung cancer in stages IIIA (non-resectable), IIIB or IV.
