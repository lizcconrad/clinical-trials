    <measure>Percentage of Blood Glucose Measurements Within the Blood Glucose Target Range From Screening to Baseline and From Week 23 to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants measured their blood glucose at least 3-4 times daily throughout the study. The mean blood glucose level was calculated for each 3-day period from Baseline to Week 24 and the percentage of 3-day blood glucose levels with the target range of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10 mmol/L) was calculated for the 2 reporting periods of Screening to Baseline and Week 23 to Week 24.</description>

    <measure>Number of Symptomatic Hypoglycemic Episodes Per Subject Year From Screening to Baseline and From Week 23 to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>A symptomatic hypoglycemic episode was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia which was confirmed by a blood glucose reading &lt; 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Symptoms might include but were not limited to sweating, dizziness, lightheadedness, tremors, nervousness, hunger, headaches, and weakness or tiredness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Mean Amplitude of Glucose Excursion (MAGE) From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days prior to Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Approximately half of the investigational sites monitored glucose levels in participants enrolled in this study using the DexCom Seven® Plus Continuous Glucose Monitoring device. The device provides glucose measurements every 5 minutes for up to 7 days. The system contains a sensor, transmitter, and receiver. The sensor is a flexible round wire that goes under the skin to read glucose levels. The transmitter snaps into the sensor and wirelessly sends glucose readings to the receiver. Data was obtained from approximately one-third of participants and was used to calculate MAGE. Data were collected in the 3 days prior to Baseline and the Week 24 visit. The standard deviation of the blood glucose measurements in each 3-day period was calculated. For each glucose measurement, the difference from the previous reading was calculated. Absolute differences smaller than the standard deviation were discarded. MAGE is the mean of the remaining difference scores.</description>

    <measure>Correct and Incorrect Use of Insulin:Carbohydrate Ratio (I:CHO) and Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) Advice by Participants Using the Aviva Nano Blood Glucose Meter During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants using the Aviva Nano blood glucose meter received individualized advice in how to use their insulin:carbohydrate ratio (I:CHO) and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) values to determine their insulin dose. The I:CHO ratio advice was considered to have been used correctly if the meal bolus dose the participant indicated in his/her patient diary was in accordance with the dose which could be calculated based upon the participant's total carbohydrate intake and the I:CHO ratio. The ISF advice was considered to have been correctly used if the correction bolus dose the participant indicated in his/her patient diary was in accordance with the dose which could be calculated based upon the participant's blood glucose target, current blood glucose value, and the ISF.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Carbohydrate Counting Accuracy From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to assess the carbohydrate content (grams) of 10 standardized meals by using a set of Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) plates, which provide standardized photographs of meals with known carbohydrate values. The mean meal error (MME), an indicator of accuracy, and mean meal absolute error (MMAE), an indicator of variability were calculated from their responses. The MME is defined as the mean of the differences between the estimated carbohydrate content and the actual carbohydrate content over the 10 DAFNE plates. A negative MME indicates an underestimation and a positive MME indicates an overestimation of the actual carbohydrate content. The MMAE is defined as the mean of the absolute value of the differences between the estimated carbohydrate content and the actual carbohydrate content over the 10 DAFNE plates. The MMAE is ≥ 0 with a lower value indicating a better ability to estimate the actual carbohydrate content.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) Score From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) contains 8 items which can be rated from 0='not at all' to 3='nearly every day'. The total PHQ-8 score is the sum of the responses to the 8 items and ranges from 0 to 24. A lower score indicates less depression. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With None, Mild, Moderate, Moderately Severe, and Severe Depression at Baseline and Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Major Depression Disorder (MDD) scale is derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) and was used to categorize participants in regard to the severity of their depression. There are 5 categories on the MDD scale: None, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe. The category for each participant is determined from their PHQ-8 score. A total PHQ-8 score of 0 to 4 represents no significant depressive symptoms. A total PHQ-8 score of 5 to 9 represents mild depressive symptoms; 10 to 14, moderate; 15 to 19, moderately severe; and 20 to 24, severe. A higher score indicates more depression.</description>

        <title>Change in the Mean Amplitude of Glucose Excursion (MAGE) From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>Approximately half of the investigational sites monitored glucose levels in participants enrolled in this study using the DexCom Seven® Plus Continuous Glucose Monitoring device. The device provides glucose measurements every 5 minutes for up to 7 days. The system contains a sensor, transmitter, and receiver. The sensor is a flexible round wire that goes under the skin to read glucose levels. The transmitter snaps into the sensor and wirelessly sends glucose readings to the receiver. Data was obtained from approximately one-third of participants and was used to calculate MAGE. Data were collected in the 3 days prior to Baseline and the Week 24 visit. The standard deviation of the blood glucose measurements in each 3-day period was calculated. For each glucose measurement, the difference from the previous reading was calculated. Absolute differences smaller than the standard deviation were discarded. MAGE is the mean of the remaining difference scores.</description>

        <description>Participants using the Aviva Nano blood glucose meter received individualized advice in how to use their insulin:carbohydrate ratio (I:CHO) and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) values to determine their insulin dose. The I:CHO ratio advice was considered to have been used correctly if the meal bolus dose the participant indicated in his/her patient diary was in accordance with the dose which could be calculated based upon the participant’s total carbohydrate intake and the I:CHO ratio. The ISF advice was considered to have been correctly used if the correction bolus dose the participant indicated in his/her patient diary was in accordance with the dose which could be calculated based upon the participant’s blood glucose target, current blood glucose value, and the ISF.</description>

        <title>Change in Carbohydrate Counting Accuracy From Baseline to Week 24</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to assess the carbohydrate content (grams) of 10 standardized meals by using a set of Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) plates, which provide standardized photographs of meals with known carbohydrate values. The mean meal error (MME), an indicator of accuracy, and mean meal absolute error (MMAE), an indicator of variability were calculated from their responses. The MME is defined as the mean of the differences between the estimated carbohydrate content and the actual carbohydrate content over the 10 DAFNE plates. A negative MME indicates an underestimation and a positive MME indicates an overestimation of the actual carbohydrate content. The MMAE is defined as the mean of the absolute value of the differences between the estimated carbohydrate content and the actual carbohydrate content over the 10 DAFNE plates. The MMAE is ≥ 0 with a lower value indicating a better ability to estimate the actual carbohydrate content.</description>

          <title>Change in the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) Score From Baseline to Week 24</title>
          <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) contains 8 items which can be rated from 0='not at all' to 3='nearly every day'. The total PHQ-8 score is the sum of the responses to the 8 items and ranges from 0 to 24. A lower score indicates less depression. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With None, Mild, Moderate, Moderately Severe, and Severe Depression at Baseline and Week 24</title>
        <description>The Major Depression Disorder (MDD) scale is derived from the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) and was used to categorize participants in regard to the severity of their depression. There are 5 categories on the MDD scale: None, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe. The category for each participant is determined from their PHQ-8 score. A total PHQ-8 score of 0 to 4 represents no significant depressive symptoms. A total PHQ-8 score of 5 to 9 represents mild depressive symptoms; 10 to 14, moderate; 15 to 19, moderately severe; and 20 to 24, severe. A higher score indicates more depression.</description>
