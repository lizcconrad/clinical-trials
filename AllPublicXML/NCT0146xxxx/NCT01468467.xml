      This is a two-part, sequential group dose escalation study.

      In Part 1, subjects will be enrolled into successive cohorts to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation decision will be made based on dose limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) that occur in subjects treated to date at a given dose level. In Part 2, a
      confirmation cohort will be opened to confirm the safety at the MTD.

      Subjects who have had an allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) will enter
      treatment with AC220 between 30 to 60 days after receiving allogeneic HSCT. AC220 will be
      administered every day, with 28 consecutive days defined as a treatment cycle. Subjects may
      receive up to 24 continuous treatment cycles. Subjects will have study visits each week for
      the first 2 cycles, and then on Day 1 of each cycle after that.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) according to WHO
             classification (2008) and has received a high dose or a reduced intensity conditioning
             allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) during first or second remission
