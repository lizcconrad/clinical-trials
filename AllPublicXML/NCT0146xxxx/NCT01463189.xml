      Development of an interactive, online pain self-management program for adults who suffer from
      pain associated with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, and other
      arthritic conditions (e.g., psoriatic arthritis) using principles from Social Cognitive
      Theory (Bandura, 1977). This online health intervention, painACTION: Arthritis, will provide
      clinically reliable information about diagnosis, treatment, and management of arthritis,
      written for health consumers in a clear and engaging manner to help increase their skills and
      confidence to use self-management strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of every five adults in the United States (46.4 million people) is affected by arthritis.
      Increasing the number of days individuals are free of arthritis pain is one of the Healthy
      People 2010 objectives. Although there are a variety of medical treatments and medications
      available, self-management is a critical component in helping arthritis sufferers learn how
      to identify, avoid, and help manage their pain. Unfortunately, clinicians face significant
      time pressure, leaving little time for desired patient-provider education and collaboration.
      This is an important omission as tailored advice (e.g., specific exercises to reduce pain)
      from health providers could enable behavior change and improve outcomes. Therefore, widely
      accessible and tailored interventions that address motivational issues are needed to
      facilitate self-management education among arthritis patients. Because of its reach across
      demographic groups, the Internet is an excellent vehicle for offering a self-management
      program to arthritis sufferers. The investigators propose to develop an interactive, online
      pain self-management program for adults who suffer from pain associated with osteoarthritis,
      rheumatoid arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, and other arthritic conditions (e.g., psoriatic
      arthritis) using principles from Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura, 1977). This online health
      intervention, painACTION: Arthritis, will provide clinically reliable information about
      diagnosis, treatment, and management of arthritis, written for health consumers in a clear
      and engaging manner to help increase their skills and confidence to use self-management
      strategies. Moreover, it will be designed to complement and connect to our other
      SBIR-supported pain online health interventions (chronic back pain, migraine pain,
      neuropathic pain) to be a more comprehensive resource for those seeking pain management
      assistance. The most unique aspect of painACTION: Arthritis is that it includes three
      technological innovations -- a Web 2.0-enabled platform, a Custom Recommendation Engine, and
      Dynamic Lessons - to help people self manage their arthritis pain. In Phase I the
      investigators accomplished two important objectives: 1) established the feasibility of
      painACTION: Arthritis as an intervention and a technical project and 2) generated preliminary
      plans for the content, design, and technical development of painACTION: Arthritis. In Phase
      II the investigators will produce the program and test its efficacy.

    <description>Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale (Lorig et al., 1989) is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses a patient's ability to determine self-efficacy.
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) (Sullivan et al., 1995) was developed to assess three components of catastrophizing: rumination, magnification, and helplessness. The scale consists of 13 items rated from 0-4 (0 = not at all, 4 = all the time).
Pain Awareness Questionnaire (Berman et al., 2009) is a 7-item questionnaire that assesses a patient's awareness of their current pain.</description>

    <description>Exercise Behaviors (Lorig et al., 1996) is a 6-item questionnaire assessing the total time a patient had participated in various forms of exercise (e.g., stretching).
Cognitive Symptom Management (Lorig et al., 1996) is a 6-item questionnaire assessing a patient's ability to manage their symptoms. This scale is rated on a 0 to 5 scale: 0 = never to 5 = always.
Communication with Physicians (Lorig et al., 1996) is a 3-item scale assessing a patient's communication with their physicians. This scale is rated on a 0 to 5 scale: 0 = never to 5 = always.</description>

    <description>Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI-SF) (Cleeland, 1991) uses a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale to obtain information on the intensity of pain, the degree to which pain interferes with function, pain relief, pain quality, and the patient's perception of the cause of pain (6 items).</description>

    <description>The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale-2-SF (Guillemin et al., 1997) is a 26-item scale that measures 5-domains of health status (e.g., physical, role, work, and social functioning.) Six additional items from the Ankylosing Spondylitis-AIMS will be added for additional validity of spine and mobility functioning for the participants with AS (Guillemin et al., 1999).
Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (Guy, 1976) is an outcome measure of global improvement with treatment and consists of a single-item self-rating.</description>
