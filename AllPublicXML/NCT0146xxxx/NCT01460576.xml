  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of IMPROV is to identify molecular mechanisms that contribute to lung injury and
      long-term breathing problems in preterm infants by investigating two interrelated biochemical
      pathways: the urea cycle-nitric oxide pathway and the glutathione pathway. The investigators
      hypothesize that prematurity-related limitations in the function of these important
      biochemical pathways contribute to respiratory disease risk over the first year of life.

      The primary goal of the IMPROV/PROP study is to identify biomarkers (biochemical,
      physiological and genetic) and clinical variables that are associated with and thus
      potentially predictive of pulmonary status in preterm infants at 1 year corrected age. IMPROV
      will test the hypothesis that biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the
      urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways influence the development and
      severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that affects
      more than 10,000 premature infants each year in the US. IMPROV will also test the hypothesis
      that the duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD
      severity and correlates with persistence of lung problems after NICU discharge. Our
      hypothesis implicates (a) an immature liver and gastrointestinal ability to make citrulline
      and GSH, (b) inadequacy of nutritional amino acid substrate and (c) common genetic variations
      in the UC-NO and the GSH pathways in the pathogenesis of BPD. These factors limit the ability
      of the anatomically and functionally immature lung to respond to the physiologic and
      environmental stress of preterm birth. As part of the PROP multi-center study, novel
      approaches to characterizing lung status with non-invasive respiratory measures prior to NICU
      discharge will be employed. A composite primary outcome of morbidity that is based on serial
      parental reports of respiratory symptoms, medications, hospitalizations and dependence on
      technology during the first year of life has been developed.
