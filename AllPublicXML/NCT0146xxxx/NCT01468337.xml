    <textblock>
      Background:

      - In the eye disease central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), fluid collects under the retina
      at the back of the eye. CSC can resolve on its own, but in some people it lasts for several
      months or can come back. The fluid buildup during CSC can cause vision loss. The drug
      interferon gamma-1b can help reduce fluid accumulation in the retina. Researchers want to see
      if interferon gamma-1b can help treat and prevent vision loss from CSC.

      Objectives:

      - To see if interferon gamma-1b eye drops are a safe and effective treatment for CSC.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have CSC in at least one eye.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have an eye exam and blood tests.

        -  This study will require at least ten visits to the National Institutes of Health eye
           clinic over a total of 52 weeks (one year). Most visits will last up to 4 hours.

        -  Participants will return to the eye clinic 2 days after the first visit and 1, 2, 4, 8,
           12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks after starting the study eye drops. These visits will involve
           blood tests and eye exams.

        -  Participants will receive the study eye drops at the initial visit. The drops must be
           used three or four times a day for 2 weeks. They must be stored in a cool place (like a
           refrigerator). The doses will follow an escalation schedule with the first participant
           receiving 2 drops three times a day and the last participant receiving 4 drops four
           times a day. To maximize safety, the most-recently enrolled participant will complete
           Week 4 before the next participant can enroll (e.g., the second enrolled participant
           will not be enrolled until the first has completed the Week 4 visit).

        -  If the CSC does not improve after the first 2 weeks, participants will receive another 2
           weeks of eye drops. This set of drops will start 4 weeks after the initial study visit.

        -  If the CSC does not improve after the 8-week study period, participants may receive
           additional eye drops at the maximum dose of 4 drops four times daily.

        -  The study will end for each participant at one year (48 weeks after the initial study
           visit).

      Objective: Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) is a retinal disorder characterized by an
      accumulation of serous fluid under the retina thought to be due to excessive choroidal
      hyperpermeability. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) plays a critical role in removing
      fluid from the subretinal space. This RPE &quot;pump&quot; is believed to be a key player in the
      reabsorption of subretinal fluid and maintenance of retinal attachment. Fluid transport
      assays have examined whether interferon gamma induces changes in fluid transport across human
      fetal RPE monolayers and showed an increase in fluid absorption from the retinal to the
      choroidal side of the tissue. An in vivo rodent model of retinal detachment has been used to
      measure the effect of interferon gamma on re-absorption following retinal detachment and
      showed that the addition of interferon gamma to the anterior eye surface caused a
      significant, rapid decrease in retinal detachment volume in the first hour of observation.
      This pilot study will investigate the safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of serial
      ocular instillations of topical interferon gamma-1b for classic CSC.

      Study Population: Five participants with subretinal fluid due to classic CSC will initially
      be enrolled. However, up to an additional two participants may be enrolled in order to obtain
      the five participants to be included in the analysis if any participants withdraw from the
      study.

      Design: In this Phase I/II, non-randomized, prospective, uncontrolled, dose-escalation,
      single-center pilot study, a series of ocular instillations of topical interferon gamma-1b
      will be administered in the study eye over a two-week period. If the fluid re-accumulates or
      increases, participants will be eligible for re-challenging with topical interferon gamma-1b
      in the study eye at Week 4. Participants will be followed for one year. Participants may be
      eligible for additional re-challenges after the initial eight week study period ends if their
      fluid re-accumulates or increases further.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure related to the safety and tolerability of
      serial ocular instillations of topical interferon gamma-1b will be assessed by the number and
      severity of adverse events (AEs) related to the investigational product and the number of
      withdrawals. Secondary efficacy outcomes include changes in best-corrected visual acuity
      (BCVA), central retinal thickness and maximum lesion volume as measured on optical coherence
      tomography (OCT), leakage as observed on fluorescein angiograms (FA), autofluorescence
      patterns as observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging and mean macular sensitivity as
      assessed by microperimetry.

    <description>Interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune®, InterMune, Inc, Brisbane, CA 94005) was supplied to participants in single-use dropperettes. A single dropperette contains 1 mL of topical interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune®) at a concentration of 200 µg/mL, which is equivalent to 28 drops. Each drop provides a dose of 7 µg of investigational product.
All participants will receive interferon gamma-1b for two weeks. Doses of interferon gamma-1b eye drops will be escalated among participants during this initial 2-week period; however, additional doses will be dispensed to participants if needed at Week 4 or after the initial 8-week study period. Participants eligible for additional doses after 8 weeks will be administered the maximum dose of 4 drops 4 times daily for a total daily dose of 112 μg.</description>

          <description>Interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune®, InterMune, Inc, Brisbane, CA 94005) was supplied to participants in single-use dropperettes. A single dropperette contains 1 mL of topical interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune®) at a concentration of 200 µg/mL, which is equivalent to 28 drops. Each drop provides a dose of 7 µg of investigational product.
All participants will receive interferon gamma-1b for two weeks. Doses of interferon gamma-1b eye drops will be escalated among participants during this initial 2-week period; however, additional doses will be dispensed to participants if needed at Week 4 or after the initial 8-week study period. Participants eligible for additional doses after 8 weeks will be administered the maximum dose of 4 drops 4 times daily for a total daily dose of 112 μg.</description>

        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
A positive change value indicates improvement of the outcome. A negative change value indicates worsening of the outcome.</description>

        <title>Changes in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Fellow Eye at Week 2 Compared to Baseline</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) protocol. Acuity is measured as letters read on an ETDRS eye chart and the letters read equate to Snellen measurements. For example, if a participant reads between 84 and 88 letters, the equivalent Snellen measurement is 20/20.
A positive change value indicates improvement of the outcome. A negative change value indicates worsening of the outcome.</description>

            <description>Interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune®, InterMune, Inc, Brisbane, CA 94005) was supplied to participants in single-use dropperettes. A single dropperette contains 1 mL of topical interferon gamma-1b (Actimmune®) at a concentration of 200 µg/mL, which is equivalent to 28 drops. Each drop provides a dose of 7 µg of investigational product.
All participants will receive interferon gamma-1b for two weeks. Doses of interferon gamma-1b eye drops will be escalated among participants during this initial 2-week period; however, additional doses will be dispensed to participants if needed at Week 4 or after the initial 8-week study period. Participants eligible for additional doses after 8 weeks will be administered the maximum dose of 4 drops 4 times daily for a total daily dose of 112 μg.</description>
