    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies freeze-dried black raspberries in treating patients with
      oral squamous cell cancer undergoing surgery. Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to
      keep cancer from forming. Eating freeze-dried black raspberries may help prevent or treat
      oral cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the relationship between the length of short-term lyophilized black
      raspberries (LBR) administration to human oral cancer patients and the modulation, in oral
      cavity tissues, of a subset of specific genes previously identified by us to be
      &quot;LBR-responsive&quot; and associated with LBR's chemopreventive activity.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of LBR administration in humans on cell proliferation, apoptosis,
      and angiogenesis in oral cavity tissues using various established biomarkers including Ki-67
      or proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), caspase-3, vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

      II. To assess the feasibility of administering lyophilized freeze-dried black raspberries in
      oral troche form to pre-surgical patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral
      cavity (compliance, tolerance, adverse events).

    <description>Statistical summaries of biopsy to surgery changes in quantitative real-time RT-PCR data made on the log scale (geometric mean of percent changes +/- s.e. expressed as a percentage).Confidence intervals produced and significance of the correlation between real-time RT-PCR values and period of treatment (i.e. time from biopsy to surgery) using Fisher's transformation of Spearman's rank correlation tested. Semi-quantitative IHC analyzed using an ordinal logistic model to determine significance of associations between period of treatment and change in staining from biopsy to surgery.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven previously untreated squamous cell
             carcinoma (SCC) of the oral cavity (stages I - IV); suspected cases of SCC will be
             allowed if biopsy is performed and results of SCC confirmed on subsequent
             histopathologic analysis (i.e. frozen section) prior to enrollment and initiation of
             LBR administration

          -  Patients must already be planned for surgical resection of their tumor (prior to being
             considered eligible for this study)

          -  Patients must be able to take nutrition/medications orally

          -  No prior history of intolerance or allergy to berry or berry-containing products

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of intolerance (including hypersensitivity or allergy) to berry or
             berry-containing products

          -  Known history of bleeding disorder or patient on systemic anticoagulation therapy
             (i.e. coumadin, heparin) for purposes of the study biopsy

          -  Pregnant women; although there are no known adverse effects of black raspberries upon
             the fetus, if patients become pregnant during period of LBR administration, then LBR
             will be discontinued and patient will be removed from the study

          -  Inability to grant informed consent

          -  Patients must not be planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to
             their surgery or this will affect endpoint analysis and these patients will be
             excluded from the study

          -  Patients taking cyclooxygenase (COX)-I or COX-2 inhibitors, who cannot be taken off
             the medication due to their clinical condition will be excluded given that these
             agents may interfere with biomarkers studied

          -  Vegetarians will be excluded from the study since we anticipate that this patient
             population will have difficulty adhering to a low-phenolic diet (restricts basically
             all plant-based foods)
