  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In July 2008, the lapatinib (Tykerb) Prescribing Information (label) was updated to include a
      boxed warning related to hepatotoxcity and detailed instructions for monitoring liver
      function before and during lapatanib exposure. For patient safety, it is of interest to know
      the extent to which providers are adherent with these guidelines for hepatic monitoring of
      lapatanib users.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to determine if physicians conduct liver function testing
      prior to prescribing lapatanib and at regular intervals during exposure, and if they withdraw
      lapatanib, and do not re-treat, for patients who demonstrate severe liver enzyme elevations
      while exposed. These aims will be tested in the &quot;Pre-label&quot; (prior to the boxed warning) and
      &quot;Post-label&quot; (after the boxed warning) periods to determine if physician adherence to the
      guidelines changed as a result of the warning.

      Specifically, the boxed warning provided the following guidance:

      &quot;Hepatotoxicity (alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase &gt;3 times the upper limit of
      normal and total bilirubin &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal) has been observed in
      clinical trials (&lt;1% of patients) and postmarketing experience. The hepatotoxicity may be
      severe and deaths have been reported. Causality of the deaths is uncertain. The
      hepatotoxicity may occur days to several months after initiation of treatment. Liver function
      tests (transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) should be monitored before
      initiation of treatment, every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment, and as clinically indicated. If
      changes in liver function are severe, therapy with lapatanib should be discontinued and
      patients should not be re-treated with lapatanib&quot;

      The following objectives will be assessed and compared among patients prescribed lapatanib
      before and after the addition of detailed guidance on liver function testing to the product
      label on July 9, 2008:

        1. Objective 1: Determine if physicians perform liver funtion tests (LFTs) prior to
           prescribing lapatanib (baseline)

        2. Objective 2: Describe the prevalence of LFT elevations at baseline

        3. Objective 3: Determine if physicians routinely perform LFTs during the duration of
           lapatanib exposure

        4. Objective 4: Describe the cumulative incidence and incidence rate of LFT elevations
           during lapatanib exposure

        5. Objective 5: Describe patients that experience severe LFT elevations during lapatanib
           exposure and calculate the proportion that have lapatanib discontinued and are not
           re-treated

      To achieve these objectives, an observational retrospective cohort study will be conducted
      using the United States Oncology Electronic Medical Records database. The study population
      will consist of females with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and a documented order
      for Lapatanib from January 1, 2007 - December 31, 2009. Patients will be categorized by
      whether they initiated Lapatanib before or after the July 9, 2008 label change.

      'Pre Label': Initiated lapatanib between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007. Follow-up
      time for this group will continue until June 30, 2008 to allow these patients to have at
      least six months of follow-up time prior to the label change.

      'Post Label': Initiated lapatanib between July 9, 2008 and December 31, 2009. Follow-up time
      for this group will continue until June 30, 2010 to allow these patients to have at least six
      month of follow-up.

      The exposure in this study is lapatanib oral medication. The date of initiation of lapatanib
      will be the index date. Lapatanib exposure period(s) will be defined from the index date
      through to the end of the study period (June 30, 2008 for pre-label group or June 30, 2010
      for post-label group).

      The project will use proportions and two estimates of incidence (cumulative incidence and
      incidence rates using person-time) to describe the outcomes of interest among the users of
      Lapatanib before and after the label change. The following LFTs will be considered:

        -  alanine transaminase (ALT)

        -  aspartate transaminase (AST)

        -  alkaline phosphatise (ALP)
