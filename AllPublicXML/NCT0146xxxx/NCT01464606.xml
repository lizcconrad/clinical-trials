    <textblock>
      Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) is very rare and there is no established &quot;standard&quot; or &quot;best&quot;
      therapy. For many years, children with PPB around the world have been treated according to
      decisions made case-by-case in many different hospitals by many different physicians. No
      treatment has been tested in a large group of PPB patients.

      The goal is to treat many children with one treatment program and to learn the results of the
      treatment.

      This Registry will collect family medical history and establishes a collection of specimens
      from PPB patients and their parents for future research. Primary goals of the biology
      research are (1) to identify new scientific ways to learn about PPB and the best way to treat
      it in the future and (2) to establish a collection of PPB biologic specimens for future
      research.

      Background: PPB is a rare cancer of the lung presenting in early childhood, mostly from birth
      to age ~72 months. PPB occurs within the lung or between the lung and the chest wall. There
      are three forms of PPB called Types I, II, and III PPB. Children with Type I PPB require
      surgery and sometimes chemotherapy. Children with Types II and III PPB, require surgery,
      chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy. Because there has never been a consensus as to
      the best treatment for PPB, the Registry will provide treatment guidelines. It is the goal of
      the Treatment and Biology Registry that by offering specific regimens the Registry will be
      able to prospectively review and analyze the regimen for the first time.

      Design:

        -  Diagnostic central pathology review will be required for patients who will be
           prospectively evaluated.

        -  This Treatment Registry will offer surgery and chemotherapy regimen guidelines, and
           optional radiation therapy guidelines for prospectively enrolled patients.

        -  The Treatment and Biology Registry will create a PPB biologic specimens reference bank
           for tumor.

      Methods:

        -  For Type I PPB, surgery is necessary. Some doctors use chemotherapy after surgery. If
           chemotherapy is used the Registry will suggest that it be combination chemotherapy with
           vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide (VAC ).

        -  For Types II and III PPB patients surgery is necessary, followed by chemotherapy. The
           Registry will suggest that subjects receive combination chemotherapy with Ifosphamide,
           Vincristine, Actinomycin-D and Doxorubicin (IVADo). Second look and possible 3rd look
           surgery may be required. Radiation therapy is recommended only for residual disease
           after maximum surgery.

      Analysis: Statistical data analysis will include only centrally confirmed cases. Additionally
      only patients with PPB Type II or Type III who were enrolled and treated with IVADo as per
      the regimen will be compared to historical controls. No statistical analysis is planned for
      patients with Type I PPB. Future treatment will be compared to the IVADo regimen in order to
      measure improvements.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age : Patients from birth to &lt; 21 years of age at the time of diagnosis will be
             included in the Treatment and Biology Registry.

             Patients of any age will be included in the Associated Diseases arm of this study.

          2. Pathology Diagnosis: Patients with newly-diagnosed PPB Types I, II or III. Diagnosis
             is made by the local pathologist. Real-time central pathology review is encouraged but
             is not required. All cases must be submitted for central pathology review. Only
             centrally-reviewed cases confirmed as PPB will be analyzed prospectively.

             Cases in which the initial diagnosis is &quot;suggestive&quot; or &quot;supportive&quot; of PPB, but not
             diagnostic, and in which later resection specimens, including resections following
             chemotherapy, confirm a PPB diagnosis will be included. Patients diagnosed by fine
             needle aspiration biopsy will be included only if a later resection specimen,
             including resections following chemotherapy, is diagnostic of PPB.

             Diagnostic pathology for cases of diseases associated with PPB will also require
             registry central pathology review.

          3. Prior Therapy: PPB Type I: All patients are eligible and will be followed in the
             study.

             PPB Types II or III: Newly-diagnosed Types II and III PPB patients will be included in
             the Treatment and Biology Registry.

             DICER1-related condition and DICER1 gene mutation: all patients are eligible and will
             be followed in the study.

          4. Prior corticosteroid therapy is allowed.

          5. Patients who have received other chemotherapy regimens or radiation therapy will not
             be statistical analysis.

          6. Types II and III PPB patients with PRIOR Type I PPB diagnosis: Types II and III PPB
             cases which are recurrences of an earlier Type I PPB are included.

          7. Informed consent by patient or parent/guardian. (also, where appropriate: assent and
             HIPPA consent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability of patient, or parent/guardian to obtain informed consent.

          2. Patients who have their PPB diagnosed ruled out by Registry central pathology review.
