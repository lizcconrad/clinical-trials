  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The next four decades will see a marked expansion of the elderly population in Ireland, in
      particular people aged over 80 yrs. Persons aged over 80 are the highest consumers of
      prescription medicines in Ireland and have the highest prevalence rates of major
      polypharmacy. Polypharmacy is intimately linked with serious adverse drug events (ADEs) and
      consequent major morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data from the United States
      indicate that ADEs is the fifth most common cause of death nationally. Experts suggest that
      effective evidence based interventions can be applied to this major public health problem.

      Recent research data indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between inappropriate
      prescription medicines and serious ADEs in older people in hospital. To date, Beers' criteria
      have been the dominant set of criteria for defining potentially inappropriate medicines
      (PIMs) in late life. Research data collected by this group show that the recently validated
      STOPP/START criteria (Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions and Screening Tool to
      Alert doctors to Right Treatment) identify ADEs that are causal or contributory to acute
      hospital admission in older people 2.7 times more frequently than Beers' criteria. Based on
      these findings, our hypothesis is that STOPP/START criteria have the potential to be used as
      a regular intervention for the purpose of ADE prevention in older people. A recent single
      centre randomised control trial (RCT) undertaken at Cork University Hospital showed that
      prospective application of STOPP/START criteria led to a highly significant improvement in
      medication appropriateness in older hospitalised patients compared with standard inpatient
      pharmaceutical care. Significantly, the improvement in medication appropriateness was
      maintained to the end of the study follow-up i.e. 6 months post-discharge. However, the
      ability of STOPP/START criteria to significantly reduce ADEs in a prospective RCT has yet to
      be demonstrated.

    <description>The researcher will apply the STOPP/START criteria to the cases randomised to this intervention. This will occur at the point of recruitment into the study and consists of applying STOPP/START criteria to the list of prescribed medications the patient is taking at that time point.
Where potentially inappropriate medications (PIM's) are identified using the intervention, these are highlighted to the medical team with primary responsibility for the patient both verbally and in writing. The relevant registrar will be contacted in person or via telephone by the researcher and informed of the PIM's in addition to a standard medication advice form inserted into the patients' notes also highlighting the PIM's.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients aged 65 years and over presenting to CUH Accident and Emergency Departments
        with acute illness for admission under a medical or surgical team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 65 years.

          2. Patient to be admitted under the care of a Geriatrician Psychiatrist of Old Age or
             Clinical Pharmacologist, or having been admitted under these services or attended
             their outpatient clinics in the previous 12 months. (These doctor groups are likely to
             minimise inappropriate medications in this population).

          3. Terminally ill patient attended by palliative care team.

          4. Critically ill patient e.g. admitted to Intensive Care Unit.

          5. Patients who do not wish to participate in the study.

          6. Patients whose hospital physician does not wish to participate in the study.
