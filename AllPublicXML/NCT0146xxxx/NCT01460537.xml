    <textblock>
      This open label Phase I study involves treating subjects with advanced cancer with Copanlisib
      in combination with either gemcitabine or cisplatin plus gemcitabine. It will determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Copanlisib in combination
      with gemcitabine and Copanlisib in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine. The trial will
      involve multiple participating sites from the US. Up to a maximum of 70 subjects will be
      enrolled in the study.

    <description>Treatment consists of repetitive 21 day cycles for a maximum of 8 cycles. Treatment continues until disease progression, DLT or completion of 8 cycles. After 8 cycles, gemcitabine and Copanlisib, without cisplatin, may continue at the discretion of the Investigator until disease progression or DLT if a clinical benefit is noted (response or stable disease for 3 months). Treatment is administered on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days as follows: - Hour 0 to 1: Cisplatin IV infusion over 60 min (One liter of 0.9% NaCl including 25 mg/m2 cisplatin, 20 mmol of potassium chloride, and 8 mmol of magnesium sulfate) - Hour 1 to 1.5: IV infusion of 500 ml of 0.9% NaCl over 30 min - Hour 1.5 to 2: Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 as 30 min IV infusion) - Hour 3 to 4: Copanlisib IV infusion at the MTD determined in Treatment A over 60 min. [If Treatment A MTD is not tolerable, further subject enrollment will begin at one Copanlisib Dose Level lower with the cisplatin-gemcitabine doses remaining constant.]</description>
