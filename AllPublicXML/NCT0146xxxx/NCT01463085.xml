  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if increased consumption of low-fat dairy can
      reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function in men and women with pre or stage-1
      hypertension.

    <description>Subjects will be fasted overnight and endothelial function will be determined using the EndoPAT System according to the manufacturer's instructions. The measurements will occur in the index fingers of both hands, simultaneously and will be taken with subjects in a sitting position while in a quiet, thermo- neutral room.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a female or male, 20-69 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Subject has a BMI of 18.5 to 39.9 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Subject has resting blood pressure measurements meeting the criteria for
             pre-hypertension (SBP = 120 to 139 mm Hg and/or DBP = 80 to 89 mm Hg) or stage 1
             hypertension (SBP = 140 to 159 mm Hg or DBP = 90 to 99 mm Hg)

          -  Subject reports history of consuming, on average, ≤2 servings/d of dairy foods as part
             of their normal diet

          -  Subject is willing to consume ≤1 serving/d of dairy foods (other than the study
             products provided) during each treatment phase.

          -  Subject is willing to maintain a stable body weight and habitual diet and physical
             activity patterns throughout the trial, with the exception of specific study
             instructions related to study product intake, alcohol intake, and physical activity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known coronary heart disease (CHD) or a CHD risk equivalent

          -  Subject has a history of any major trauma or major surgical event

          -  Subject has digital deformities that would prevent EndoPAT measurements.

          -  Subject has used medications known to alter body weight

          -  Subject has used medications or dietary supplements that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, have strong potential to influence blood pressure or endothelial
             function

          -  Subject has extreme dietary habits (e.g., Atkins diet, very high protein/low
             carbohydrate).
