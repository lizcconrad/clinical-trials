  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes occur in as many as two thirds of U.S. women during menopause and are severe
      enough to require treatment in 20%. Although postmenopausal hormone therapy is effective in
      suppressing hot flashes, it is associated with increased risk for a variety of serious
      adverse effects. There is an urgent need for alternative treatments that are effective, safe,
      and easy to use. In this study, the investigators will compare two different types of
      behavioral relaxation therapies, paced respiration and music therapy, for treatment of
      menopausal hot flashes. Effects on frequency of hot flashes, other symptom and
      quality-of-life outcomes associated with hot flashes, and physiologic measures of
      sympathetic/parasympathetic activity will be examined.
