      Copy numbers of bcr-abl mRNA in patients with dasatinib treatment will be measured by
      real-time RT-PCR to evaluate the efficiency of dasatinib.

      For patients resistant to dasatinib therapy, DNA mutation analysis of the bcr-abl gene
      associated with drug-resistancy will be performed.
