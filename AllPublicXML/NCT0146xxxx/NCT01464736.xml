  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the following tests, there would be a greater increase in the functionality of COPD
      patients who underwent combined therapy than in those who only exercised: a set of activities
      of daily living (ADLs), the six-minute walk test (6MWT), an incremental symptom-limited
      cardiopulmonary test (CPT), and the physical functioning scale of the Short-Form 36 quality
      of life questionnaire (SF-36).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impact of aerobic exercise plus noninvasive ventilation (NIV) on the functionality of
      patients with COPD. Thirty patients (70.5 - 8.5 years) with COPD (forced expiratory volume in
      the first second 48.5 - 15.4% of predicted) were randomized into either a physical training
      group involving aerobic treadmill exercise (PTG, n=12) or an exercise plus bilevel
      ventilation group (PTGNIV, n=11) with sessions three times a week for six weeks.

    <description>This group performed aerobic physical training associated with ventilation in the bilevel modality (BiPAP®), using a nasal mask as an interface.
On evaluation day, the levels of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) (between 10 and 15cmH2O) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) (between 4 and 6cmH2O) were defined, varying according to the comfort level of each patient.</description>

    <description>For both groups, the approximately hour-long sessions occurred three times a week on alternate days for six consecutive weeks (18 sessions). Each session began with five minutes of stretching that included the cervical muscles and the upper and lower limbs, which was followed by five minutes of warm-up on a treadmill at 2Km/h and 30 minutes of aerobic physical training at a constant 3% incline.</description>
