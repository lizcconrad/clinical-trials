    <textblock>
      This was a 52-week, multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, Phase 3 long-term safety study
      in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control with
      monotherapy of oral antihyperglycemic medication (OAM).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE was defined as an event that first occurs or worsens (increases in severity) after baseline, regardless of causality or severity. The percentage of participants with TEAEs was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 TEAE over the 52-week treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Hypoglycemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 52 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with hypoglycemic episodes was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 hypoglycemic episode over the 52-week treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%. All classifications of hypoglycemia (documented symptomatic, asymptomatic, severe, nocturnal, non-nocturnal, probable symptomatic, relative, and unspecified) were included, except for episodes of relative hypoglycemia that were not severe. A summary of serious and other non-serious adverse events, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 7-Point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 26 weeks and up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were to test and record SMBG concentrations in their study diaries before each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), approximately 2 hours after the start of each meal. For the mean of all 7-point blood glucose values, the daily mean was calculated as the average of 7 blood glucose values collected on a particular day. The mean of all 7-point blood glucose values at each visit was calculated as the average of 2 daily means. The change from baseline was calculated as the mean of all 7-point blood glucose values at endpoint minus the mean of all 7-point blood glucose values at baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to 26 weeks and up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The HOMA2 is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) and to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. The change from baseline for fasting insulin concentrations are presented as insulin secretion (HOMA2-%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S).</description>

        <description>A TEAE was defined as an event that first occurs or worsens (increases in severity) after baseline, regardless of causality or severity. The percentage of participants with TEAEs was calculated by dividing the number of participants with at least 1 TEAE over the 52-week treatment period by the total number of participants analyzed, multiplied by 100%.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Updated Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA2)</title>
        <description>The HOMA2 is a computer model that uses fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations to estimate steady state pancreatic beta cell function (%B) and to estimate insulin sensitivity (%S) as a percentage of a normal reference population (normal young adults). The normal reference population was set at 100%. The change from baseline for fasting insulin concentrations are presented as insulin secretion (HOMA2-%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S).</description>
