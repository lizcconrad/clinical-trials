      Open single-center, explorative, Phase I pilot study including patients treated with AXL1717
      in addition to standard chemotherapy of gemcitabine HCL and carboplatin. Patients will be
      treated within the study for 2 treatment cycles of 3 weeks each. Survival data will be
      obtained. Tumor assessment will be conducted at baseline and then at the end of the study
      period. Concomitant supportive therapies will be allowed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced, or metastatic
             squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (stage IIIB or IV) and scheduled for treatment
             with cytotoxic chemotherapy (Gemcitabine HCL/Carboplatin)

          3. Preserved major organ functions, i.e:

               -  B-Leukocyte count ≥ 3.0 x 109/L

               -  B-Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  B-Platelet count ≥ 75 x109/L

               -  B-Haemoglobin ≥ 100 g/L (transfusions are allowed)

               -  P-Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 times the upper institutional limit of the &quot;normal&quot;
                  (i.e. reference)range

               -  P-ASAT or P-ALAT ≤ 2.5 times upper institutional limit of the &quot;normal&quot; range, ≤5
                  times if liver metastases have been documented

               -  P-Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times upper institutional limit of the &quot;normal&quot; range

               -  12-lead ECG with normal tracings; or clinically nonsignificant changes that did
                  not require medical intervention

          4. Signed written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any of the following criteria will exclude the patient from
             participating in the study:

               -  Ongoing infection or other major recent or ongoing disease that, according to the
                  investigator, poses an unacceptable risk to the patient

               -  Grade 3 or higher constipation within the past 28 days or grade 2 constipation
                  within the past 14 days before randomization. (Patients with grade 2 constipation
                  within the past 14 days could be re-screened if constipation decreases to ≤ grade
                  1 with optimal management of constipation.)

               -  Known malignancy in Central Nervous System (CNS)

               -  Disease and dementia and neuropathy grade more than 1

                  include any female who has experienced menarche and who is not postmenopausal.
                  Post menopause is defined as: Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another
                  cause

               -  Pregnancy or lactation

               -  Current participation in any other interventional clinical trial

               -  Performance status &gt; ECOG 2 after optimization of analgesics

               -  Life expectancy less than 3 months

                  hypersensitivity.

               -  Lack of suitability for participation in the trial, for any reason, as judged by
