      This is an Open-Label, Dose Escalation with 2 Dose Levels, Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial of
      Ambroxol for the Treatment of Patients with Type I Gaucher Disease.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial involving 20 evaluable patients affected with Type
      1 Gaucher disease who are responsive to Ambroxol in vitro. There are 2 treatment groups,
      involving 2 dose levels of Ambroxol (187.5 and 225 mg/day), given once daily PO for 2 months
      in both groups. The 187.5-mg/day dose level will be tested first. If there are no significant
      adverse events, defined as &gt;Grade 3 toxicity according to the latest version of the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), the 225-mg/day dose level will be
      tested.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biochemically and genetically confirmed diagnosis of Gaucher disease caused by
             β-glucocerebrosidase deficiency resulting from mutations in the GBA genes, which have
             been shown to respond to Ambroxol according to in vitro screening assay.

          -  Must be 16 years of age or older at the time of study initiation.

          -  With an intact, enlarged spleen.

          -  A hemoglobin level of at least 10 g/L.

          -  Able to understand and cooperate with the requirements of the study protocol.

          -  Mentally competent, have ability to understand and willingness to sign the informed
             consent form.

          -  Able to travel to a participating study site.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must use accepted contraceptive methods, and must
             have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within one week prior to treatment
             initiation. An additional pregnancy test is to be performed, and results obtained,
             prior to administration of the first dose of Ambroxol.

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study period,
             unless documentation of infertility exists.

          -  Body weight &gt;40 kg (88 lbs).

        Exclusion Criteria:
