      The American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management, Chronic Pain section,
      recommended Phenol neurolysis when other techniques have failed to provide adequate pain
      control. In this study we sought to Compare the pain relieve on a Lower Back and Limbs
      obtained from Methylprednisolone and Phenol 8% Treatment given by Trans Sacral Approach. The
      study includes patients who suffers from a chronic low back and/or limbs pain which were
      referred to be given epidural as a treatment. Control group receives 80 mg Methylprednisolone
      while the test group receives phenol 8%.
