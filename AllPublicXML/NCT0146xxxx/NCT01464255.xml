      This study is designed to evaluate 2 daily disposable contact lenses that are both currently
      cleared for the USA market. Study of the ocufilcon D lens compared to the ocufilcon B lens in
      a 1-week crossover, daily wear regimen. The primary objective is the comparison of fitting
      characteristics. The secondary objective is the comparison of comfort, end of day comfort and
      dryness measures.
