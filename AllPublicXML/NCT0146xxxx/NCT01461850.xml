  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III C) and highly disseminated tumor will
      be randomized into two arms: primary debulking surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy vs.
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS). The primary end point
      is the evaluation and comparison of the surgical complications of primary surgery and IDS and
      the evaluation of the progression free survival (PFS)

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to undergo either PDS followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, or NACT followed by IDS. Random assignment will be centralised at the Institutional clinical trial center using a block-randomisation computer-generated list (maximum allowable percentage deviation = 10%). Allocation will be concealed to patients and investigators. Patients and investigators will not be masked to group assignment.</intervention_model_description>

These will be complete at study entry, at the 4th cycle or before IDS (in arm A and arm B, respectively), at the 6th cycle, and 6 months after the last cycle of chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>All patients with suspicion of advanced ovarian carcinoma (FIGO stage IIIC) will undergo to a diagnostic laparoscopy in order to obtain a laparoscopic score (PIV) based on seven parameters: omental cake, peritoneal and diaphragmatic extensive carcinosis, mesenteric retraction, bowel and stomach infiltration, spleen and/or liver superficial metastasis, as previously published (Fagotti et al, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 2008) Patients with PIV ≥ 8 and ≤ 12 randomized in this group will be submitted to an attempt of primary debulking surgery in order to obtain RT &lt; 1 cm, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Patients with suspected advanced ovarian cancer (FIGO stage IIIC) will undergo only to diagnostic laparoscopy. Omental cake, diaphragmatic or peritoneal extensive carcinomatosis, tumor diffusion to the small and large curvature of the stomach, large and/or small bowel mesentery disease, spleen and/or liver metastases will be investigated in order to obtain a laparoscopic score. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy interval debulking surgery will be performed: total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, radical omentectomy, appendectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, eventual bowel resection, eventual bladder resection, eventual splenectomy, eventual parietal and diaphragmatic peritonectomy, eventual gastric resection, eventual hepatic resection, eventual pancreas resection, eventual cholecystectomy.</description>

Omental cake, diaphragmatic or peritoneal extensive carcinomatosis, tumor diffusion to the small and large curvature of the stomach, large and/or small bowel mesentery disease, spleen and/or liver metastases will be investigated in order to obtain a laparoscopic score.
