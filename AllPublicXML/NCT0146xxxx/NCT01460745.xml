  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-centre retrospective observational research study which will be
      conducted in UK centres with specialised liver surgical services.

      The study will involve retrospective review of medical records of patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) with metastases confined to the liver, defined locally as
      unresectable without downsizing therapy at first review by a Hepatobiliary Multi Disciplinary
      Team (HPB MDT). Erbitux is available for use in combination with chemotherapy as a downsizing
      treatment for patients with previously unresectable metastases.

      The study aims to examine liver resection rates achieved in normal clinical practice in order
      to inform National Health Service (NHS) clinical and policy decision making and to further
      understanding of how cetuximab is used in a standard clinical setting. This study intends to
      estimate the proportion of patients with unresectable liver metastases who undergo liver
      resection following downsizing treatment with chemotherapy plus cetuximab.
