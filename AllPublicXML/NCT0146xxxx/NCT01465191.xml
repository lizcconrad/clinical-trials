      HYPOTHESIS: The response to a given dose of morphine given via a spinal anesthetic for
      cesarean section will be affected by the genetics of the woman's mu-opioid receptor

      Most women undergoing elective cesarean section (CS) receive spinal anesthesia, and most
      receive a dose of preservative free morphine with the spinal anesthetic.
      Spinally-administered morphine provides 16-24 hours of high quality pain relief. The dose
      administered is usually 75-200 micrograms, but surprisingly few dose-response studies exist.

      The mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1 gene)is the site of action of endogenous opioid peptides and
      opioid analgesic drugs like morphine. There is a common genetic variant of this receptor at
      the 40th amino acid of the protein, with asparagine and asparate being present in different
      people. The less common variant (aspartate), present in 25-30% of the overall American
      population (higher in Asian populations, lower in Blacks) at codon 40 that has been shown in
      many studies to affect opioid analgesia.

      This will be a randomized, blinded study of 3 doses of spinal morphine (50, 100, 150
      micrograms) given to women undergoing elective cesarean section at term pregnancy. 300 women
      will be studied (100 per dose). Blood will be obtained for genotyping of OPRM1 and other
      genes that may affect pain and analgesic responses. The primary outcome will be the amount of
      intravenous morphine patients self-administer in the 24 hours postsurgery.

      The primary outcome (use of intravenous morphine) will be analyzed by dose, and within each
      dose group by genotype of OPRM1. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores every 6 hours,
      satisfaction with analgesia, side effects (itching, nausea/vomiting) by dose and genotype.

      It is anticipated that there will be an interim data analysis at 150 evaluable subjects for
      assessment of the dose response to morphine in the overall population; then a final analysis
      at 300 subjects for the genetic effect assessment.
