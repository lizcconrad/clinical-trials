      Introduction: Protein loss during critical illness is an important problem and is shown to
      predict overall survival. In animal studies, infusion of leucine is shown to increase the
      synthesis of muscle protein by 30-40% and decrease protein degradation by 30%.

      Objectives: Compared to saline, an amino acid or 3hydroxybutyrate infusion in the femoral
      artery will promote protein synthesis and inhibit breakdown assessed with local a/v
      phenylalanine and tyrosine tracer kinetics in healthy volunteers. These effects will include
      distinct alterations in muscle signal events, in particular mTOR.

      Methods: n = 10 healthy male subjects are equipped with catheters in aa. femorals and vv.
      femorals bilaterally under local anaesthetics. Each study comprises a 3-hour basal period and
      a 3-hour period with hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. During the test, samples of
      arterial and venous blood and 4 muscle biopsies are obtained. The intervention contain
      continues saline infusion compared to either amino acids (Vamin) or 3hydroxybutyrate solution
      FFa-3OHB.

      Perspectives: This study elucidates the direct effect of aminoacids and ketone bodies on
      muscle protein metabolism in humans and contribute to further development of nutritional
      therapy in human catabolic states.
