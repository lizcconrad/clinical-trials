  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following surgery for female urinary incontinence and/or pelvic organ prolapse, women are
      sometimes temporarily unable to empty their bladders and are sent home with a transurethral
      indwelling catheter attached to a bag which holds urine. The goal of this study is to compare
      a new type of patient-operated catheter without a bag to the catheter with a bag for ease of
      use, comfort and quality of life for patients during the postoperative recovery period. This
      new catheter, the OPTION-vf, is approved by the FDA and is available on the market.

    <time_frame>5-10 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The mean scores for the first 5 questions of the Post Operative Questionnaire were used to calculate a Composite Satisfaction Score.
Total Pain (0 none, 10 worst)
Total Catheter Related Pain Range Scale (0 none, 10 worst)
Ease of catheter use (0 easy, 10 difficult)
Feeling of frustration (0 none, 10 very much)
Limited social activities (0 none, 10 very much) All subjects were given and appointment for an outpatient voiding trial after hospital discharge. The Post Operative Questionnaire was completed by the subject one time at that appointment.</description>
