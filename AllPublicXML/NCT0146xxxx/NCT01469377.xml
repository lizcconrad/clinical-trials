    <textblock>
      An outpatient study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cariprazine as adjunct to
      antidepressant therapy (ADT) in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have an
      inadequate response to ADT alone. This clinical study compared cariprazine + ADT with placebo
      + ADT in outpatients with a diagnosis of MDD and an inadequate response to ADT. The study
      consisted of approximately 2 weeks of screening and washout followed by 8 weeks of
      double-blind treatment followed by a 1 week safety follow-up.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale to assess depressive symptomatology during the preceding week. Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more depression. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS measures an individual's perception of the extent to which his or her emotional symptoms are disrupting his or her functioning in 3 domains, work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities. The participant is asked to rate the degree to which their functioning is impaired on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Scores of 0 to 3 indicate mild functional impairment, 4 to 6 indicate moderate functional impairment, and 7 to 9 indicate marked functional impairment. The scores for the 3 domains are summed into a total score that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). A higher score indicates greater impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>Participants received cariprazine orally once a day for 8 weeks. Participants received cariprazine 0.5 mg on Days 1 and 2 and 1.0 mg on Days 3-7. At the investigator's discretion dose levels could be increased during Week 2. Dose levels allowed during Week 2 were 1.0 or 1.5 mg. A second dose increase was allowed starting at Week 3. Dose levels allowed during Week 3 and the remainder of the treatment period were 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg.

At the investigator's discretion dose levels could be increased during Week 2. Dose levels allowed during Week 2 were 2.0 or 3.0 mg. A second dose increase was allowed starting at Week 3.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The MADRS is a clinician-rated scale to assess depressive symptomatology during the preceding week. Participants are rated on 10 items (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and lack of interest) each on a 7-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score ranges from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating more depression. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Week 8</title>
        <description>The SDS measures an individualâ€™s perception of the extent to which his or her emotional symptoms are disrupting his or her functioning in 3 domains, work/school, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities. The participant is asked to rate the degree to which their functioning is impaired on an 11-point scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). Scores of 0 to 3 indicate mild functional impairment, 4 to 6 indicate moderate functional impairment, and 7 to 9 indicate marked functional impairment. The scores for the 3 domains are summed into a total score that ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired). A higher score indicates greater impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat population consisted of all patients in the Safety Population who had at least 1 post-baseline assessment of the MADRS total score. Only participants with scores for all 3 domains were included in the analysis.</population>
