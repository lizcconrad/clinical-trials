    <textblock>
      In this study, MEK162 will be administered to Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors
      whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy exists.
      The trial will investigate the safety and tolerability and determine the MTD of MEK162 in
      Japanese patients.

    <description>MEK162 will be administered orally once on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and continuously on a BID schedule, starting on Day 2 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles. Each cycle will be 28 days in duration. Dose will be escalated and starting dose is 30 mg. Any doses that are missed should be skipped and should not be replaced or made up during the evening dosing or on a subsequent day, whichever applies.
The prescribed BID doses should be taken 12 ± 2 hrs apart.</description>
