  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabozantinib works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels that feed a tumor. In addition
      to blocking the formation of new blood cells in tumors, cabozantinib also blocks pathways
      that may be responsible for allowing cancers cells to become resistant to other
      &quot;anti-angiogenic&quot; drugs. Cabozantinib has been studied or is being study in research studies
      as a possible treatment for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, brain cancer,
      thyroid cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators wish to learn if cabozantinib is effective in
      treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors.

      Subjects will take cabozantinib orally, once per day, in cycles of 28 days.

      During each cycle subjects will have the following procedures:

        -  Physical examination, including measurement of weight and vital signs

        -  Questions regarding any side effects

        -  Blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) for routine laboratory tests of blood cell counts,
           blood chemistries, organ function and blood clotting

        -  Blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for research test to measure biomarkers to assess the
           response to study drug

        -  Urine sample for routine urine tests to monitor health

      On Day 15 (beginning of week 3) during the first 3 cycles:

        -  Physical examination, including measurement of weight and vital signs

        -  Questions regarding any side effects

        -  Blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) for routine laboratory tests of blood cell counts,
           blood chemistries, organ function and blood clotting

        -  Blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for research test to measure biomarkers to assess the
           response to study drug Subjects will receive a CT scan or MRI every two cycles (every
           two months) to evaluate disease.

             3 years or any currently active malignancy

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the treatment
             protocol, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated on protocol.
