  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immediately following tooth removal, a healing process begins that affects the eventual
      alveolar bone volume and architecture of the alveolar ridge. Satisfactory and timely healing
      are essential to obtain ideal functional reconstruction. Traumatic removal of a tooth, or a
      poor healing response, may lead to excessive bone loss delaying tooth replacement, requiring
      expensive and time-consuming reconstructive surgeries, or even the inability to be corrected.
      The Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF-Endoret) has shown its therapeutic potential effect
      to minimize the consequences of this aggression, promoting the regeneration of both hard and
      soft involved tissues.
