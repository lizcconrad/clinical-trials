    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the onset of action of two commercially available
      over-the-counter antihistamines (Loratadine and

      Fexofenadine) in a model of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Participants undergo
      sensitization exposures to Mountain Cedar (juniperus ashei) pollen in a Biogenics Research
      Chamber; those who demonstrate an adequate allergic response determined by the Major Symptom
      Complex (MSC) score will then receive drug.

    <measure>Mean Major Symptom Complex (MSC) Score by Post-Treatment Evaluation Time Point (From 180 Minutes to 300 Minutes)</measure>
    <time_frame>From time of sensitization (time 0) to end of visit (~8 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>The MSC Score is calculated as the sum of 5 individual symptom scores for Runny Nose, Itchy Nose, Sneezing, Watery Eyes, and Itchy Eyes. Each individual symptom is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The total MSC score ranges from 0 - 25. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

             during the trial. Xolair (omalizumab) may not be used within 4 years prior to trial
             participation.

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to loratadine, desloratadine, or fexofenadine.

          -  History of rhinitis medicamentosa.

          -  Use of systemic (oral, rectal, injectable), topical (up to 1% topical hydrocortisone
             is permitted), or nasal corticosteroids in the last 30 days or current or expected use

        <title>Mean Major Symptom Complex (MSC) Score by Post-Treatment Evaluation Time Point (From 180 Minutes to 300 Minutes)</title>
        <description>The MSC Score is calculated as the sum of 5 individual symptom scores for Runny Nose, Itchy Nose, Sneezing, Watery Eyes, and Itchy Eyes. Each individual symptom is rated on a 5-point scale of severity: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The total MSC score ranges from 0 - 25. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <description>The individual symptom score for Itchy Nose was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Itchy Nose symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <description>The individual symptom score for Sneezing was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Sneezing symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <title>Mean Individual Symptom Scores for Watery Eyes by Post-Treatment Evaluation Time Point</title>
        <description>The individual symptom score for Water Eyes was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Watery Eyes symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

          <title>Mean Individual Symptom Scores for Watery Eyes by Post-Treatment Evaluation Time Point</title>
          <description>The individual symptom score for Water Eyes was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Watery Eyes symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <title>Mean Individual Symptom Scores for Itchy Eyes by Post-Treatment Evaluation Time Point</title>
        <description>The individual symptom score for Itchy Eyes was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Itchy Eyes symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <description>The individual symptom score for Nasal Congestion was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Nasal Congestion symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>

        <description>The individual symptom score for Itchy Mouth/Throat/Ears was rated on a 5-point
scale of severity using the following scale: 0 = None (No symptoms), 1 = MILD (Symptom is present, but easily tolerated), 2 = MODERATE (Awareness of symptoms, bothersome, but tolerable), 3 = SEVERE (Definite awareness of symptoms, difficult to tolerate but does not interfere with activities), 4 = VERY SEVERE (Difficult to tolerate and interferes with the activities of daily living). The Itchy Mouth/Throat/Ears symptom score ranges from 0 - 5. Increasing scores are associated with increasing severity.</description>
