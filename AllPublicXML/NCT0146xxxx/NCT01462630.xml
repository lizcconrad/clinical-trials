  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with
      advanced angiosarcoma. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) at 3 months and response rate defined as
      complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) in angiosarcoma patients treated with
      pazopanib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess overall survival of patients treated with pazopanib. II. To gather more safety
      data for pazopanib in this patient population. III. To explore the ability of [F-18]
      fludeoxyglucose (FDG) (positron emission tomography [PET])/computed tomography (CT) imaging
      to assess response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
