    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of lidocaine, delivered into subcutaneous
      tissue for tumescent local anesthesia, on platelet activation following the tumescent
      liposuction.

      The current research study is intended to examine this hypothesis by determining if tumescent
      lidocaine increases the results of a test which measures the volume of bleeding which occurs
      when a tiny standardized incision is made on the forearm. This test is the BA test. The
      investigators will do BA tests before and after infiltration of lidocaine in the form of
      tumescent local anesthesia for liposuction and then compare the differences of these BA test
      results.

      The purpose of the present research project is to study how platelet function after surgical
      trauma (liposuction) is affected by tumescent lidocaine. The investigators hypothesize that
      lidocaine, delivered in the form of tumescent local anesthesia, inhibits surgical
      trauma-induced platelet activation as measured by the in-vivo Klein Bleeding Area test
      (www.onlinePFT).

      The Klein Bleeding Area (BA) test is an extension of the classic Ivy Bleeding Time (BT) test.
      The BT test, an in-vivo test for an abnormal bleeding tendency, involves making a small
      standardized cut in the skin and measuring the duration of bleeding. The BA test has
      significantly more sensitivity and specificity than the BT Test.

      This research project is a dosage-response clinical trial in which the predictor variable is
      the milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) dosage of tumescent lidocaine and the response variable is
      the Bleeding Area (BA). A result indicating that tumescent lidocaine does indeed impair
      post-operative platelet function would justify a subsequent randomized clinical trial of
      tumescent lidocaine for preventing post-operative thromboembolism.
