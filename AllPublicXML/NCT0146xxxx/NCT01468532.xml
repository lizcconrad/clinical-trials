      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of pasireotide and to see how
      well it works when given together with docetaxel and prednisone in treating patients with
      metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel
      and prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Pasireotide may inhibit the secretion of
      hormones. Giving pasireotide together with docetaxel and prednisone may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level of SOM 230 (pasireotide) in
      combination with docetaxel and prednisone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination in metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

      II. To evaluate preliminary efficacy of the combination of SOM 230 and docetaxel and
      prednisone as defined by response rates (measurable and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]),
      time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. IV. To assess the
      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the combination as seen by baseline levels of and changes in
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, serum chromogranin A (SCA), and neuron specific enolase
      (NSE), and to associate them with TTP and OS.

      V. To assess the pretherapy circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts and change in CTC after
      therapy, and to associate them with TTP and OS.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of pasireotide followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive pasireotide intramuscularly (IM) on day 1, docetaxel intravenously (IV) over
      1 hour, and prednisone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) continuously. Courses with docetaxel
      repeat every 21 days and courses with pasireotide repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
