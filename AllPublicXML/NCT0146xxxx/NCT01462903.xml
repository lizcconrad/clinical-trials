      Background: T cell based adoptive immunotherapy including CTL and TIL may stimulated the
      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing.

      Objective: Phase I clinical trial to investigate the toxicity and immune response of therapy
      with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as adjuvant treatment for metastatic
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma after primary operation, radiotherapy
      and chemotherapy.

      Methodology: Phase I clinical trial in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
      hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and other solid cancers. The investigators isolated
      lymphocytes from fresh tumor tissues, activated and expanded TILs in vitro; and infused the
      enough number (10e9 to 10e10) of TIL back patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were isolated from tumor tissues from tumor biopsy or
      operation. These TILs were cultured in human IL-2 medium for 2 to 3 weeks, and reactivated by
      OKT3, irradiated feeder cells from the PBMCs of healthy donors and LCL set from
      EBV-transformed normal B cells, and expanded in human IL-2 medium for another 15 days. 10e9
      to 10e10 TILs were yielded. The phenotype, function and sterile were detected before these
      TILs infused patients. After accepting operation or first round of routine chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy, the patients were treated with autologous TILs 10e9-10e10 via intravenous in 30
      min, q weekX2 weeks, and followed by two weeks with daily sc low-dose interleukine-2.

      Patients will be evaluated for toxicity and immune response. Peripheral blood of patients
      using multimer analysis and/or ELISPOT assays. Additional, we will be able to determine
      anti-tumor effects from immunotherapy by evaluating the clinical response of patients with
      stable or progressive disease at the time of TILs infusion. Lastly, we will assess additional
      tumor markers in patients with relapsed/refractory disease by immunohistochemical staining of
      tumor sections from previous diagnostic or therapeutic biopsy samples to determine the
      incidence of additional tumor antigen targets that may be used in future studies.

    <description>Twenty of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability according to standard NIH criteria including fever, mucositis, dermatitis, vomiting and hematologic toxicity leucopenia, neutropenia and lymphocytoponia etc. and a Quality of Life assessment. Adverse events will be reported on the case report form. The problility of observing at least one subject experience an adverse event in a sample of 20 subjects is 0.99, if the probability of the event occurring is assumed to be 0.2. There will be 95% power to detect a change in the proportion of adverse events in the group from 0 before treatment to 0.2 after treatment.</description>
