    <textblock>
      In the present study, serum pentraxin 3 level and its relationship with insulin resistance
      were determined in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS. It was found that PTX3
      level is increased in patients with PCOS and it is positively correlated with HOMA-IR.
