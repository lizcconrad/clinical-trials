      Part A: The purpose of Part A of the study is to look at the electrocardiogram (ECG) effects
      due to blood sugar changes after a meal compared to when LY2409021 is also given with a meal.

      Part B: The purpose of Part B is to evaluate the effect of LY2409021, when given at a dose
      level much higher than what would normally be given, on the electrical activity of the heart
      as measured by ECG in relation to placebo and moxifloxacin.

      This is a 2 part study. Part A is a single-dose study to compare the effects of a meal on
      glucose, insulin and QT in healthy participants with and without LY2409021. Part B of this
      study is a randomized, 3-period, crossover design, in which participants and investigators
      are blinded to placebo and LY2409021, and will assess the electrophysiological effects of a
      single supratherapeutic dose of LY2409021 compared to a positive control (moxifloxacin) and
      placebo.
