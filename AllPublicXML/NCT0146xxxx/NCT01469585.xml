  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects (good and bad) of subantimicrobial dose
      doxycycline on the irregular bleeding women experience when taking continuous oral
      contraceptive pills. This research is being done because currently, there is no effective
      treatment for this condition. Findings from this study could help to decrease the side
      effects of birth control pills and decrease unplanned pregnancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Continuous oral contraceptive administration entails women taking hormonally active pills for
      28 days without a seven day placebo week to avoid hormonal withdrawal bleeding.
      Unfortunately, with continuous administration, timed, regular bleeding can be replace by
      irregular, unscheduled bleeding, which often leads to dissatisfaction, discontinuation and
      the possibility of unplanned pregnancy.

      MMPs, a group of zinc-dependant proteases, are hypothesized to play a role in endometrial
      degradation. The purpose of this study is to describe the expression of MMPs in endometrial
      biopsy (EMB) specimens collected 1) prior to initiating oral contraceptives 2) while taking
      cyclic oral contraceptive 3) while taking continuous oral contraceptives and 4) while taking
      continuous oral contraceptives along with sub-antimicrobial doxycycline.

    <description>Baseline MMP expression will be determined on day 19-21 of cycle 1. During cycle 2, when women are taking the cyclic oral contraceptive, the EMB will be performed between cycle day 19-21 (study day 47-49), prior to endometrial degradation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effect of sub-antimicrobial doxycycline on MMP expression and activity in continuous oral contraceptive users.</measure>
    <time_frame>84 days</time_frame>
    <description>Based on doxycycline's action as an MMP inhibitor, it is hypothesized that MMP expression and activity will be decreased in women taking sub-antimicrobial doxycycline compared to women on continuous oral contraceptives only. Because it is expensive to take sub-antimicrobial doxycycline for longer than 28 days, if it is to be clinically useful, it should have an appreciable effect on endometrial MMP levels after 28 days.</description>
