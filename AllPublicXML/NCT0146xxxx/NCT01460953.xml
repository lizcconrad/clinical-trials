      1. Briefly describe the purpose of this protocol: This study is designed to evaluate the
           effectiveness of an educational training video on the topic of health literacy for
           medical students.

        2. Briefly summarize how participants are recruited: OHSU medical students attending
           mandatory trainings on the topic of health literacy during the 1st and 2nd years of
           medical school will be invited to participate in the study.

        3. Briefly describe the procedures subjects will undergo: Completion of a short
           self-administered anonymous survey before and after viewing a 23-minute video about
           health literacy.

        4. If applicable, briefly describe survey/interview instruments used: A 12-item pre-test
           questionnaire and 13-item post-test questionnaire designed to assess individuals'
           knowledge about health literacy, and intended clinical practices with respect to health
           literacy.

        5. If this is a clinical trial using an experimental drug and/or device, or an approved
           drug and/or device used for an unapproved purpose, briefly describe the drug and/or
           device: n/a

        6. Briefly describe how the data will be analyzed to address the purpose of the protocol:
           Demographics and responses to individual items will be reported as frequencies and
           percentages within the sample. The investigators will use a chi-square analysis to
           stratify responses by demographic groups and t-tests to measure possible changes over
           time.
