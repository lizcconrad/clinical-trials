      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryoablation therapy combined with
      radiation therapy for the relief of pain associated with metastatic bone tumors.

      Patients with painful bone metastases who meet the eligibility criteria and who have been
      determined to be an appropriate candidate for cryoablation therapy and radiation therapy will
      be offered enrollment into the study. Cryoablation is the process of destroying tissue by the
      application of extremely cold temperatures. Galil Medical Cryoablation Systems are used as a
      surgical tool in the fields of general surgery, dermatology (skin), neurology (nerves), chest
      surgery (including lung), Ears-Nose-Throat (ENT), gynecology, oncology (cancer), proctology
      (colon/rectal) and urology (kidney). Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, uses
      carefully targeted doses of high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation is used to
      treat many kinds of cancer.

      Patients agreeing to participate will read and sign an informed consent form and thus become
      subjects in the study. Treatment will be performed using a Galil Medical cryoablation system
      and Galil Medical cryoablation needles. Subjects will be followed for up to 24 weeks (6
      months) for palliation of pain, quality of life and analgesic usage. Baseline and follow-up
      data will be collected for each subject via a web-based electronic data collection tool.

    <description>Radiation therapy is usually performed with 6-18 Megavolt photons from a linear accelerator. The proposed dose and frequency of radiation for this protocol are: 8 Gray in 1 fraction, 30 Gray in 10 fractions, or 37.5 Gray in 15 fractions. These proposed doses or other doses will be prescribed at the discretion of the investigator. It is anticipated that subjects will begin the radiation therapy approximately within one to three weeks after the cryoablation procedure. The doses and frequency of the radiation treatment will be collected as well as toxicities.</description>
