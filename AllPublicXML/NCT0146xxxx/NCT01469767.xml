      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of short-term treatment with fluocinonide
      cream 0.1% (Vanos®) in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Our hypothesis is that
      subjects will have a reduction in Investigator's Global Assessment scores at Day 7 and Day 14
      compared to Baseline.

      Secondary objectives include the use of actigraphy monitoring to determine the ability of
      Vanos® cream to reduce itch, and thus nocturnal scratching, in AD. Our hypothesis is that
      subjects will have a reduction in nocturnal scratching activity, as measured by actigraphy
      movement count per hour, at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline. Other secondary outcome
      measures include Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, body surface area involvement
      and Visual Analog Scale for itch. The investigators hypothesize that each of these measures
      will be improved at Day 7 and Day 14 compared to Baseline.

    <description>Investigator's Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis integrates all lesions for overall score. This measure is commonly used to quantify disease severity and most resembles assessments performed in the clinic setting. Score ranges from '0' = Clear to '5' = Very Severe Disease</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Actigraphy</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Actigraphy Movement Count per Hour:Subjects will be asked to wear an actigraphy monitor on each wrist for the duration of the 14-day study. These monitors appear and function similarly to a wristwatch. The actigraph provides a continuous measure of wrist activity and may be used to quantify nocturnal scratching behavior. A piezoelectric accelerometer records the integration of intensity, amount, and duration of stimuli in all 3 dimensions of wrist movement. Measurements are taken at 32 Hz and a summation value is recorded at the end of each 30-second epoch. The number of 30-second epochs with movement (in which acceleration was detected irrespective of the magnitude of the acceleration) is recorded and summed to give a movement score. This is divided by the duration of time in bed to produce a movement count per hour, which is a sensitive quantitative measure of scratch-associated activity.</description>

    <measure>EASI</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Eczema Area and Severity Index Score:Disease severity will be assessed with the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI).This measure is commonly used and well validated instrument of eczema severity. It is weighted for area in each of the four body regions and scores erythema, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification. The total are summed for one total EASI score. .The total scores range from 0 (no Eczema) -72 (most severe Eczema).&quot;</description>

    <measure>BSA</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Body Surface Area of atopic dermatitis. The BSA is measured as the total percent of the entire body with atopic dermatitis involved, so the scores range from 0% to 100% of total body involvement.</description>

    <measure>VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale for itch: A 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to measure itch intensity. VAS is a self-report tool that is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. VAS data is recorded as the number of mm from the left of the line with the range 0-100 mm. The Visual Analog Scale is anchored with the verbal descriptions of &quot;no itch&quot; on the left and &quot;the most intense itch imaginable&quot; on the right.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female with mild to severe atopic dermatitis, 12 years of age or older, that
             agree to participate and provide written consent (parent permission and assent if
             applicable).

          -  Have an Investigator Global Assessment of mild to severe atopic dermatitis (IGA rating
             of 2 through 4 in the Investigator Global Assessment).

          -  Visual Analog Scale of Itch score at Baseline must be greater than or equal to 50 on a
             100-point scale.

          -  Percentage of overall body surface area of involvement (BSA) must be ≥2%.

          -  Women of childbearing potential will be allowed to participate in the study, and will
             be required to use at least one form of birth control.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use within four weeks from Baseline any systemic anti‐inflammatory medication, which
             may influence study outcome, such as systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Application or use within two weeks of Baseline topical corticosteroid medications or
             topical anti‐inflammatory medication, which may influence study outcome.

          -  Presence of a concurrent medical condition, which is determined by the investigator to
             potentially interfere with study outcomes or patient assessments.

          -  Introduction of any other prescription medication, topical or systemic, for atopic
             dermatitis while participating in the study.

          -  Use of anti-histamines while participating in the study will not be permitted unless
             the subject meets criteria for anti-histamine use on the VAS scale. Additionally, the
             subject must remain on a stable dose of anti-histamine throughout the study period. If
             a patient meets such criteria for anti-histamine use, this will be noted in the
             subject's chart.

          -  Amount of disease involvement that would require &gt;60 gm of cream in a 1 week period.

          -  Subjects with known allergy or sensitivity to topical Vanos® cream or components.

          -  Pregnant women

          <description>Investigator's Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis integrates all lesions for overall score. This measure is commonly used to quantify disease severity and most resembles assessments performed in the clinic setting. Score ranges from ‘0’ = Clear to ‘5’ = Very Severe Disease</description>

        <title>Actigraphy</title>
        <description>Actigraphy Movement Count per Hour:Subjects will be asked to wear an actigraphy monitor on each wrist for the duration of the 14-day study. These monitors appear and function similarly to a wristwatch. The actigraph provides a continuous measure of wrist activity and may be used to quantify nocturnal scratching behavior. A piezoelectric accelerometer records the integration of intensity, amount, and duration of stimuli in all 3 dimensions of wrist movement. Measurements are taken at 32 Hz and a summation value is recorded at the end of each 30-second epoch. The number of 30-second epochs with movement (in which acceleration was detected irrespective of the magnitude of the acceleration) is recorded and summed to give a movement score. This is divided by the duration of time in bed to produce a movement count per hour, which is a sensitive quantitative measure of scratch-associated activity.</description>

        <description>Visual Analog Scale for itch: A 100 millimeter (mm) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to measure itch intensity. VAS is a self-report tool that is designed to present to the respondent a rating scale with minimum constraints. VAS data is recorded as the number of mm from the left of the line with the range 0-100 mm. The Visual Analog Scale is anchored with the verbal descriptions of “no itch” on the left and “the most intense itch imaginable” on the right.</description>
