  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol is commonly used IV anesthetic, it has been formulated in a concentration of 10
      mg/ml in a fat emulsion consisting of 10% soybean oil (long-chain triglycerides). When used
      for anesthetic induction, propofol causes pain on injection in 28%-90% of patients. pain
      probably results from a direct irritant effect. Several methods have been used to reduce this
      pain. Lidocaine pretreatment has been commonly proposed to decrease propofol induced pain,
      but its failure rate is between 13-32%. Dexmedetomidine is highly selective alfa-2
      adrenoreceptor agonist. Alpha-2 receptors are located on blood vessels where they inhibit
      norepinephrine release. Investigators, therefore, speculated that dexmedetomidine could
      attenuate the pain due to injection of propofol. Investigators conducted a study to determine
      the efficacy of dexmedetomidine in decreasing pain due to injection of propofol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Propofol solution is fat emulsion consisting of soyabean oil. When used for anesthetic
      induction, propofol causes pain or discomfort on injection. Many factors appear to affect the
      incidence of pain, which includes site of injection, size of vein, speed of injection,
      buffering effect of blood, temperature and composition of propofol solution and concomitant
      use of drugs such as local anaesthetics and opiates.

      Pain on injection of propofol can be immediate or delayed. Immediate pain probably results
      from a direct irritant effect whereas delayed pain probably results from an indirect effect
      via the kinin cascade. Delayed pain has latency of between 10 and 20 s. The pain produced is
      usually described as tingling, cold, or numbing, at its worst, a severe burning pain proximal
      to the site of injection. This sensation tends to occur within 10-20 s of injection and lasts
      only for the duration of injection. Despite this discomfort, the incidence of phlebitis is
      less than 1%.

      Several methods have been used to reduce this pain with limited success. Lidocaine
      pretreatment is commonly used to decrease propofol induced pain, but its failure rate is
      between 13-32%.

      Dexmedetomidine is an selective alfa-2 adrenoreceptor agonist with supraspinal, spinal, and
      peripheral actions. Alpha-2 receptors are located on blood vessels where they inhibit
      norepinephrine release. Investigators, therefore, speculated that dexmedetomidine could
      attenuate the pain due to injection of propofol.

    <description>After injecting study drugs the pain score after propofol was assessed by using visual rating scale and given score according to severity of pain 0 = no pain,
= mild pain or soreness,
= moderate pain and
= severe pain associated with facial grimacing, arm withdrawal, movement or both.</description>

    <time_frame>Upto 24 hrs.</time_frame>
    <description>All patient were observed for 2-hrs in recovery room and were asked to recall if there was pain during injection of propofol in the recovery room and incidence of pain was graded as
0-No recall of pain
1-Recall of pain present.</description>
