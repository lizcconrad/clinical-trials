  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether exploring the request for help
      more thoroughly improves patient satisfaction in general practice (primary care).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction has been an important topic of interest in primary health care during
      the last decade(s). Many factors during the consultation influence patient satisfaction. One
      of the aspects in a consultation is the request for help; especially in primary care the
      request for help has been recognised as an important aspect influencing patient satisfaction.
      The investigators hypothesized that exploring the request for help more thoroughly would
      improve patient satisfaction in general practice.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the 'Professional Care' (PC) scale of the 'Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire' (CSQ). In a previous study the score on the PC were 88.2 en 80.9 in the intervention and control groups, respectively. The standard deviations were 11.8 en 16.1. For our sample size calculation we used an expected standard deviation of 15. The sample size required to detect a difference of 7 on the PC scale between the intervention and control group, with a power of 90%, and alpha of 5% (two-tailed), and a standard deviation of 15, was 196 patients. We rounded this number off to 200.</description>

    <description>Patients in the intervention group were told that the practice was participating in a patient satisfaction study, and they were given an envelope with information about the 'doorknob phenomenon' and a request card. The envelope for the control group only consisted of information about a patient satisfaction study, without any information on the 'doorknob phenomenon', and without a request card. Both groups received the same letter with patient information about the study.</description>
