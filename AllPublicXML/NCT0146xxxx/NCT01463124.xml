  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent overweight and obesity have increased dramatically in the past several decades.
      High schools are well-positioned to deliver weight loss treatment to overweight and obese
      adolescents, as they have the facilities and staff to deliver a physical activity program,
      school nurses with the skills to provide counseling, and are easily accessible by
      adolescents. This exploratory study will test the feasibility and ability of a school-based
      intervention, consisting of school nurse counseling and a school-based exercise program, to
      reduce BMI and improve dietary quality, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors in
      overweight and obese adolescents. If effective, this could prove to be a cost-effective and
      relatively easy intervention to disseminate widely for significant public health impact.

    <description>LGFG participants will report greater improvements in dietary quality, physical activity and sedentary behavior than IC participants at 8 month follow-up, as measured by 24-hour dietary recall (24HDR), accelerometers, and measures of specific diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviors targeted by the intervention. Improvements will mediate the relationship between condition and BMI.</description>
