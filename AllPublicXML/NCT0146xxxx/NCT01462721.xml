      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patency rates of the external Saphenous Vein Support
      (eSVS) Mesh Saphenous Vein Grafts (SVG) and Control SVG at 3-6 months and 24 months.

      The study will enroll up to 200 patients at up to 6 sites. Patients will be enrolled upon
      meeting entrance criteria, including obtaining written informed consent. Eligible patients
      must be clinically indicated for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using autologous
      saphenous vein grafts (SVG). The study is a prospective, randomized, repeated measure
      controlled trial based on each patient receiving one control SVG and one external Saphenous
      Vein Support (eSVS) Mesh treated SVG. Each patient will be their own control.
