  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic renal disease have to be vaccinated as soon as dialysis is forestalled
      and this could improve seroconversion rate of hepatitis B vaccination.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to compare seroconversion rates and immune response
      rates using four doses of 40 μg and three doses of 20 μg of Euvax B recombinant hepatitis B
      surface antigen (HBsAg) vaccine given to predialysis CKD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an open, randomized clinical trial, the investigators compared seroconversion rates in 51
      predialysis patients with mild and moderate chronic renal failure using either 40 μg 4 doses
      or 20 μg 3 doses of Euvax B recombinant hepatitis B vaccine administered at 0, 1, 2, 6 and 0,
      1, 6 months respectively.

    <description>Anti-HBs titres less than 10 mIU/ml were defined as non-seroconversion or non-responder. Anti-HBs titres greater than or equal to 10 mIU/ml but less than 100 mIU/ml were defined as seroconversion with low level antibody. Anti- HBs titres greater than or equal to100 mIU/ml were defined as seroconversion with protective levels of hepatitis B antibody.</description>
