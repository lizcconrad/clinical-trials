  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will demonstrate the accuracy of the chromosomal aberration and gene
      mutation markers of the AMLProfiler molecular diagnostic assay and generate clinical
      performance data to support a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) submission to the Food and Drug
      Administration for in vitro diagnostic use within the United States of America.

      The objective is to demonstrate the positive and negative percent agreement of each marker by
      comparing AMLProfiler results from multiple clinical participating sites with data generated
      using a laboratory developed bi-directional sequencing method generated at the molecular
      diagnostic reference lab.

      The AMLProfiler assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of AML or
      APL specific chromosomal aberrations (specific recurrent translocations and inversions), as
      well as expression of specific genetic markers in RNA extracted from bone marrow aspirates of
      patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia.

        Bone marrow samples will be used in the study only from AML,APL or RAEB subjects. Written
        informed consent by subjects will be obtained for use of their bone marrow samples in this
        study. Each site will follow their own bone marrow aspiration procedure.
