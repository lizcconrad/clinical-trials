    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of spironolactone on collagen markers
      in a large number of patients with pulmonary hypertension. In addition, safety and
      tolerability of spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist, in patients with
      pulmonary arterial hypertension, will be determined.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an orphan disease characterized by pulmonary artery
      hypertrophy, and resulting vascular remodeling of involved vessels, often leading to right
      heart failure. Accumulating evidence from vascular biology, animal models, and therapeutic
      drug trials suggests significant contributions of the neurohormonal milieu to the disease
      process, morbidity, and mortality. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an
      important neurohormonal pathway that induces collagen synthesis in the myocardium and
      systemic vasculature. There is paucity of data regarding the contribution of RAAS in the
      pathogenesis of PAH and the effects of aldosterone blockade in the amelioration of PAH. Thus,
      the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the contribution of RAAS to the
      pathogenesis of PAH, and to explore the effects of an aldosterone blocker, spironolactone, in
      PAH.

    <description>50 participants will be enrolled in a 16-week study, and each subject will receive placebo or active drug in a random order. At the end of week 8, treatment arm for each subject will be blindly switched. Biomarker levels will be drawn 3 times (baseline, week 8, and week 16) during the study period for each subject.</description>

    <description>Composite end-point predefined as greater than 10% increase in walk distance, improvement by at least one functional class and absence of clinical worsening. Clinical worsening will be defined as hospitalization for worsening PAH, all-cause death, addition of prostacyclin therapy, lung transplantation, or atrial septostomy.</description>

So if a study patient received placebo for the first 8 weeks then he/she will be switched to receive active drug (spironolactone) for the next 8 weeks.</description>
