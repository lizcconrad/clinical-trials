    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see the safety and activity of using pasireotide, everolimus
      and radioembolization (Selective Internal Radioembolization Therapy-SIRT) in the treatment of
      neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid) that has spread to the liver. Both everolimus or
      radioembolization are considered &quot;standard of care&quot; regimens in patients with liver lesions
      from neuroendocrine tumors. However, the use of the combination of everolimus and
      radioembolization has not been formally evaluated in the setting of a clinical trial.
      Pasireotide is a medication that is intended to block the hormonal secretions from the
      neuroendocrine tumors.

      This study is divided into two parts. In the first part, the aim of the study is to determine
      the safety of combining everolimus, pasireotide, and radioembolization. For this part of the
      study the investigators will enroll up to 18 patients. After the investigators confirm the
      safety of the combination, they will conduct the second part of the study which will focus on
      evaluating the effectiveness of the combination. For this part of the study the investigators
      intend to enroll a total of 37 patients.

      Liver metastasis remain a major challenge in the care of patients with Neuroendocrine Tumors
      (NET). This study is evaluating the combination of systemic therapies plus radioembolization
      for the treatment of liver metastasis from NET. The study allows pancreatic and intestinal
      NET that have spread to the liver.
