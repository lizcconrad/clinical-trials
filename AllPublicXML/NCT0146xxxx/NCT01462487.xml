  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Zanamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that has demonstrated effectiveness against the
      pandemic H1N1 virus. Zanamivir was first authorized in Sweden in June 1999 and is approved in
      the European Union (EU) through mutual recognition. It is indicated for treatment and
      prevention of influenza in adults and children over the age of 5 years.

      Zanamivir animal studies, conducted primarily in rabbits, showed a trend towards increased
      post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and increased minor fetal skeletal
      changes, although these effects were not statistically significant. Given the frequency,
      pattern and distribution of these effects, it was concluded that they were not related to
      zanamivir treatment. The summary of product characteristics for zanamivir states that it
      should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother justifies the
      risk to the fetus.

      Postmarketing data have shown no higher risk of malformation with oseltamivir than in the
      general population, but data on zanamivir are scarcer. Limited data are available on
      pregnancy outcomes with maternal exposure to zanamivir during pregnancy. From 01 August 2003
      through 31 January 2009, 133 women were reported to have been treated with zanamivir while
      pregnant. Of these 133 pregnancies, 83 pregnancies were on-going or had been lost to
      follow-up (62.4%) at the time of the report; 43 resulted in a live birth with no apparent
      congenital anomalies (32.3%), 4 represented spontaneous abortions with no apparent congenital
      anomalies (3.0%), 2 were elective terminations with no apparent congenital anomalies (1.5%),
      and 1 was an ectopic pregnancy (&lt;1%). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has concluded that
      exposure to zanamivir during pregnancy does not represent a new safety risk to the fetus.

      Published research has suggested that early antiviral treatment of pregnant H1N1 patients can
      improve outcomes. In a Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance
      population of 788 pregnant influenza patients with disease onset between April and August
      2009, the 384 with data on timing of antiviral treatment were observed to have significantly
      higher risk of adverse outcomes with later treatment ('intermediate', i.e. 3-4 days, n=84;
      'late', i.e. &gt; 4 days: n=81) than with early treatment (&lt; 2 days: n=219). Compared with those
      given early treatment, those given intermediate treatment had almost 10 times the risk of
      death, and those given late treatment, more than 50 times. Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      admission showed more than a 2-fold risk elevation with intermediate treatment and a six-fold
      elevation with late treatment, Respective elevations in risk of need for mechanical
      ventilation were almost 4-fold and more than 12-fold. The authors noted that the reason for
      treatment delays in this population are unknown, but could include reluctance on the part of
      clinicians and patients to expose the fetus to antiviral medications, as well as use of rapid
      influenza tests, which have shown low (10%-70%) sensitivity for H1N1.

      As part of their ongoing epidemiologic safety monitoring initiatives requested by the EMA
      during the influenza pandemic of 2009-2010, GSK seeks to conduct a pregnancy safety study to
      better understand the safety of zanamivir in women exposed during pregnancy for either the
      treatment or prevention of influenza. This safety study will collect information from
      existing European databases with records of pregnant women exposed to these products and
      their pregnancy outcomes in order to assess the safety of these treatments in this
      population.

      GSK is working with PPD as the contract research organization (CRO) to oversee conduct of
      this study, including data source management and payment, study design input, epidemiological
      advice, data transfer oversight and overall project management. The CRO will keep a record of
      all relevant personnel involved in the study. Additionally, PPD has a strategic alliance with
      World Health Information Science Consultants, LLC (WHISCON) (www.whiscon.com), an
      internationally recognized organization conducting post-approval drug safety and risk
      management epidemiology. WHISCON will be providing services related to protocol development
      as well as database-specific work plans, and will assist in analysis and interpretation of
      data.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of zanamivir taken during
      pregnancy on 1) the outcome of the pregnancy, 2) congenital anomalies identifiable at or
      shortly after birth, and 3) treatment-emergent diagnoses in the mother occurring within 28
      days of receipt of zanamivir.

      The secondary objectives of this study are 1) to develop techniques for identifying
      influenza-like illness (ILI) in the participating data sources, and 2) to identify the
      characteristics of zanamivir recipients.

        The observed population will include pregnant women who have received zanamivir and
        pregnant women who have not received influenza antiviral therapy.

        Subject pregnancies will be identified on the basis of pregnancy completion occurring from
        December 2009 through November 2010 and zanamivir exposure (or the absence of it).
        Follow-up data on live-born infants will be obtained at the time of delivery and for a
        maximum of 28 days after birth.

        The subject pregnancies' data will be obtained from the following four European data
        systems: Danish National Linked Databases, CSD MR UK (formerly known as EPIC), a subsidiary
        of Cegedim Strategic Data, PHARMO Network (Institute for Drug Outcomes Research), and
        Swedish Medical Birth Register.
