  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To study the effect of acute pulmonary vasodilatation on cerebral tissue oxygenation (CTO)
      and cerebral blood flow (CBF) as indicator for cerebrovascular autoregulation in comparison
      to the effects of supplemental oxygen, decreased carbon dioxide by hyperventilation and
      exercise in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) undergoing clinically indicated right
      heart catheterisation (RHC).

      Oxygenation and hemodynamic parameters will be assessed during RHC according to standard
      procedures. Non-invasive near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a nasal canula will be
      additionally applied to measure CTO, CBF and endtidal CO2 (EtCO2). All parameters will be
      obtained at rest breathing room air, during an oxygen challenge, during standardized
      hyperventilation, under vasodilatation testing and during exercise in random, single-blinded
      sequences (except for exercise and hyperventilation). Pulmonary, systemic and cerebral
      oxygenation parameters and hemodynamics will be correlated with each other and functional
      class, quality of life, exercise and cognitive assessments at the time of the RHC and after
      three month.

    <description>Oxygenation and hemodynamic parameters will be assessed during RHC according to standard procedures. All measurements will be noted as usual for PH assessment including: at rest breathing room air, during an oxygen challenge, under vasodilator testing with NO and/or during exercise. Room air, supplemental oxygen and NO will be applied over common breathing mask while patient is in a supine position. Oxygen will be taken as usual from the common adjustable hospital wall access, NO will be taken according to usual clinical practice during RHC from a gas cylinder connected to a reservoir, where adequate ppm concentration can be regulated. A dose of 40 ppm NO will be used according to common practise. Oxygen delivery to maintain the peripheral oxygen saturation between 88% and 90% will be adjusted over a 3 minute period of time.</description>
