  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following myocardial infarct, cellular therapy is a potential approach to repopulate the
      injured myocardium, to treat heart failure and restore cardiac function. The purpose of this
      study is to assess the safety, feasibility and efficacy of intramyocardial delivery of
      selected autologous CD133+ bone marrow stem cells at the time of coronary artery bypass
      grafting in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD133+ are well characterized distinct early progenitor group of stem cells that possess high
      engraftment, pluripotent and angiogenic capacity and proved to be valuable for cardiac repair
      by promoting neovascularization, inhibition of apoptosis and cardiomyogenesis.

      The investigators proposed research protocol involves patients with chronic ischemic heart
      disease and left ventricular dysfunction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
      In this phase II clinical trial, prospective, randomized, 2 arm, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study, the investigators will assess the safety, feasibility and
      functional effect of intra-myocardial injection of highly selected autologous CD133+ bone
      marrow stem cells to placebo.

             Cardiovascular Society (CCS) class II or greater angina, and/or New York Heart
