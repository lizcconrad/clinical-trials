  <brief_title>A Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) Tablets of Canagliflozin and Metformin Immediate Release (IR) With Respect to the Individual Components of Canagliflozin and Metformin IR Tablets in Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Single-Dose, Open-Label, Randomized, 2-Way Crossover Pivotal Study to Assess the Bioequivalence of FDC Tablets of Canagliflozin and Metformin IR (2x150 mg/1000 mg) With Respect to the Individual Components of Canagliflozin (1x300 mg) and Metformin IR (2x1000 mg) Tablets in Healthy Fed Subjects</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the bioequivalence of a fixed dose combination (FDC)
      tablet of canagliflozin and metformin immediate release (IR) in comparison with the
      individual components of canagliflozin and metformin IR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff),
      single-center study to evaluate the bioequivalence of canagliflozin and metformin IR when
      administered orally (by mouth) as individual components (ie, separate tablets of
      canagliflozin and metformin IR) (Treatment A) and when administered as a fixed dose
      combination (FDC) tablet (ie, canagliflozin and metformin IR in the same tablet) (Treatment
      B). Healthy volunteers participating in the study will be randomly (by chance) assigned to
      receive Treatment A followed by Treatment B or Treatment B followed by Treatment A with a
      period of approximately 15 days between treatments.
