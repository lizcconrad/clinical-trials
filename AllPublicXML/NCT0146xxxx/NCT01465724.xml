  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current prevalence of hypertension as part of the metabolic syndrome is substantial and
      is increasing with the rise of obesity worldwide. Chronic elevation of sympathetic nervous
      system (SNS) activity has been identified as a common and key factor in disease states as
      obesity-related hypertension (ORH). The renal sympathetic nerves are a major contributor to
      the complex pathophysiology of this elevated SNS activity. Percutaneous renal denervation
      (PRDN), the deliberate disruption of the nerves connecting the kidneys with the central
      nervous system, has been shown to be an effective means of modulating elevated SNS activity.

      This current study is an observational feasibility study, with the aim to investigate the
      effect of renal denervation on changes in insulin resistance and blood pressure in patients
      with obesity related hypertension. The investigators will study different variables: a
      laboratorial set, a set of blood pressure measurements and a set of investigations in the
      vascular laboratory.

      Hypothesis

        -  The investigators hypothesize that renal denervation has a beneficial effect on insulin
           resistance.

        -  The investigators hypothesize that there will be no complications related to the device
           or procedure.

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are: to compare changes in insulin resistance in
      patients with ORH after RDN; to evaluate the safety of PRDN in this patient group; to compare
      changes in blood pressure, laboratory parameters, arterial stiffness and SNS-activity after
      PRDN.

      Study design: Prospective observational feasibility-study.

      Study population: Patients with a high fasting glucose (fasting serum glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L(100
      mg/dL)) and with an ambulatory systolic blood pressure &gt;130mmHg.

      Major endpoints: The effect of RDN on: insulin resistance, blood pressure and major adverse
      events.
