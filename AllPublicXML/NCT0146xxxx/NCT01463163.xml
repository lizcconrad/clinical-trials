    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, investigator-initiated, pharmacodynamic
      study with a parallel design. Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, undergoing
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention will be randomized after informed consent, in a
      1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups:

      Group Α: Ticagrelor 180mg loading dose (LD), followed by a 90mg x2 maintenance dose
      (MD)starting 12±6 hours post LD, until Day 5 (5 days after randomization) Group Β: Prasugrel
      60 mg LD followed by 10mg x1 MD starting 24 hours post LD, until Day 5 (5 days after
      randomization).

      Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed at randomization (Hour 0) and at 1, 2, 6, 24
      hours after randomization, and on Day 5. Documentation of major adverse cardiac events
      (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure with PCI or CABG)and
      serious adverse events (bleeding, other adverse events)will be performed until Day 5.
