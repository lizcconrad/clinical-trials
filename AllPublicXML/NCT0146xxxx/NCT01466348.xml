  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reduction in alertness and lower levels of performance are commonly associated with the
      common cold. Paracetamol has been shown to be more effective than placebo in treating
      symptoms associated with upper respiratory tract infection; caffeine has been shown to
      increase levels of alertness and improve performance of people suffering from colds. This
      study will investigate any improvement in alertness and performance based on cognitive
      function and mood assessment in subjects suffering from the common cold, when taking a novel
      paracetamol and caffeine combination verses paracetamol alone.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Number of Valid Responses to Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) Cognitive Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 30 minutes post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <description>The RVIP assessed the performance of visual attention mechanisms in remaining vigilant to periodically occurring events. Participants monitored a series of single numbers (0-9) appearing in the centre of the screen. During the RVIP task, participants responded to consecutive sequences of three odd or three even numbers by pressing the corresponding response button as quickly and accurately as possible. The test lasted approximately 9 minutes and mean number of valid responses to stimulus was calculated.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Number of Valid Responses to Sustained Attention Tasks (SAT) Cognitive Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <description>Auditory and visual attention of participants was evaluated using a validated Sustained Attention task. For the sustained visual attention task, participants were required to respond to the letter 's' every time it appears in a continuous stream of letters presented on a screen. For the sustained auditory attention task, participants responded to the number '8' every time it appears in a continuous stream of numbers presented through headphones. Total test duration was approximately 6 minutes. Mean values of valid responses to visual and auditory tests were calculated.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes post treatment administration</time_frame>
    <description>Mood patterns was evaluated using the Mood, Alertness and Physical Sensation Scales (MAPSS) which comprised of 23 questions describing moods and physical sensations, on a 9-point scale anchored at the left hand end with 'not at all' and the right hand end with 'extremely'. For each question, '9' represented the 'best' score and '1' represented the 'worst' score. Mean score was calculated by summing the responses and dividing by the number of questions answered. MAPSS Questionnaire was further divided into three main clusters: Alertness; Anxiety and Headache as per the questions.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Number of Valid Responses to Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVIP) Cognitive Test</title>
        <description>The RVIP assessed the performance of visual attention mechanisms in remaining vigilant to periodically occurring events. Participants monitored a series of single numbers (0-9) appearing in the centre of the screen. During the RVIP task, participants responded to consecutive sequences of three odd or three even numbers by pressing the corresponding response button as quickly and accurately as possible. The test lasted approximately 9 minutes and mean number of valid responses to stimulus was calculated.</description>

The test lasted approximately 9 minutes and mean number of valid responses to stimulus was calculated.</description>

For the sustained visual attention task, participants were required to respond to the letter ‘s’ every time it appears in a continuous stream of letters presented on a screen. For the sustained auditory attention task, participants responded to the number ‘8’ every time it appears in a continuous stream of numbers presented through headphones. Total test duration was approximately 6 minutes. Mean values of valid responses to visual and auditory tests were calculated.</description>

For the sustained visual attention task, participants were required to respond to the letter ‘s’ every time it appears in a continuous stream of letters presented on a screen. For the sustained auditory attention task, participants responded to the number ‘8’ every time it appears in a continuous stream of numbers presented through headphones. Total test duration was approximately 6 minutes. Mean values of incorrect and missed responses to visual and auditory tests were calculated.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Mood Alertness and Physical Sensation Scales (MAPSS) Cognitive Test</title>
        <description>Mood patterns was evaluated using the Mood, Alertness and Physical Sensation Scales (MAPSS) which comprised of 23 questions describing moods and physical sensations, on a 9-point scale anchored at the left hand end with ‘not at all’ and the right hand end with ‘extremely’. For each question, ‘9’ represented the ‘best’ score and ‘1’ represented the ‘worst’ score. Mean score was calculated by summing the responses and dividing by the number of questions answered. MAPSS Questionnaire was further divided into three main clusters: Alertness; Anxiety and Headache as per the questions.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>GSK agreements may vary with individual investigators, but will not prohibit any investigator from publishing. GSK supports the publication of results from all centers of a multi-center trial but requests that reports based on single-site data not precede the primary publication of the entire clinical trial.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Apparent carryover effect from the paracetamol/ caffeine treatment taken in Period 1 into the baseline assessment of Period 2 was observed, hence the statistical analysis was amended after unblinding the statistician.</limitations_and_caveats>
