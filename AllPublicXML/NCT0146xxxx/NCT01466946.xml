    <description>A qualitative study of MSKCC lung cancer patients of Hispanic/Latino descent by collecting retrospective patient narratives to understand the processes that led them to seek medical help when they did, their experiences in seeking and receiving medical guidance, as well as their decisions regarding lung cancer treatment. In addition, we will explore how these patients' representations of lung cancer with its associated risk factors and symptoms affected their treatment decisions.</description>

    <description>Use semi-structured interview methods to gather narrative data from research participants, as more open-ended interviews allow participants to share information that is most relevant to their own experiences (Patton, 2002; Rubin &amp; Rubin, 2005; Kvale, 1996). Semi-structured interviewing can generate a rich understanding of a participant's life routines, experiences, and attitudes related to a topic of inquiry, and can yield a nuanced and thorough description of a research participant's life story and belief systems.</description>
