  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus (RV) is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis (GE) in young children. The
      cumulative risk of GE hospitalizations and hospital stays of &lt; 24 hours is 1/25, which would
      amount to 13,600 Canadian children &lt; 5 years. The incidence of nosocomial RV infections is an
      average of 8/10,000 patient-days in children &lt; 5 years. An immunization program with a
      live-attenuated monovalent oral RV vaccine (RV1 - Rotarix® from GSK) will be implemented,
      free of charge, in the Province of Quebec in November 2011. To provide an accurate portrait
      of the disease and give critical information to the public health agencies as they struggle
      to control costs, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of surveillance for RV and other diseases
      with similar characteristics; estimate selection bias in passive laboratory-based
      surveillance; and estimate the agreement between surveillance time-series created from
      passive and active surveillance data sources.

      In November 2011, Quebec implemented a publicly-funded RV1 vaccination program with its
      routine administration at 2 and 4 months of age. From February 1, 2012 - May 31, 2014, we
      conducted prospective, active surveillance for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis at The
      Montreal Children's Hospital and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, located in
      Montreal, and Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, located in Sherbrooke. Active
      surveillance was approved by Research Ethics Boards at each hospital.

    <description>RV1 vaccine effectiveness (VE) was investigated using a subset of active surveillance participants age-eligible to receive 2-doses of RV1 vaccine, defined as participants (i) &lt;15 weeks of age as of program implementation (November 1, 2011), and (ii) ≥16 weeks of age at symptom onset. These ages corresponded to the maximum recommended age of administration for the first RV1 dose at program implementation, and the recommended age of second dose administration, respectively.
We estimated RV1 VE of 2- versus 0-doses and ≥1- versus 0-doseto prevent rotavirus hospitalization or emergency visits. Only valid RV1 vaccinations administered ≥14 days prior to symptom onset were considered. Children vaccinated with RV5 (private market,minimal penetrance) were excluded.</description>

Only valid RV1 vaccinations administered ≥14 days prior to symptom onset were considered. RV1 VE was estimated as (1 − exposure odds ratio) × 100. Based upon our sampling scheme, the exposure odds ratio from our analyses approximates the rate ratio.</description>

        The Montreal Children's Hospital and the CHU Sainte-Justine are the 2 main pediatric
        hospitals in Montreal. With these 3 sites, 30% of the Quebec birth cohort will be captured
        and, given the concentration of children in the Montreal area, the participating hospitals
        will ensure that the study remains efficient in terms of resources. We elected Sherbrooke
        as an intermediate area; Montreal will represent an urban population.

        <title>Matched VE Participants</title>
        <description>RV1 vaccine effectiveness (VE) was investigated using a subset of active surveillance participants age-eligible to receive 2-doses of RV1 vaccine, defined as participants (i) &lt;15 weeks of age as of program implementation (November 1, 2011), and (ii) ≥16 weeks of age at symptom onset. These ages corresponded to the maximum recommended age of administration for the first RV1 dose at program implementation, and the recommended age of second dose administration, respectively.
We estimated RV1 VE of 2- versus 0-doses and ≥1- versus 0-doseto prevent rotavirus hospitalization or emergency visits. Only valid RV1 vaccinations administered ≥14 days prior to symptom onset were considered. Children vaccinated with RV5 (private market,minimal penetrance) were excluded.</description>

Only valid RV1 vaccinations administered ≥14 days prior to symptom onset were considered. RV1 VE was estimated as (1 − exposure odds ratio) × 100. Based upon our sampling scheme, the exposure odds ratio from our analyses approximates the rate ratio.</description>
