  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if observing a virtual arm decreases phantom limb
      pain (PLP) in upper extremity amputees.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly all traumatic limb amputees will experience cognizance of a phantom limb and perceive
      a vivid impression that their lost limb is not only fully present, but also painful. The John
      Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Virtual Integration Environment (VIE) is a
      highly flexible and adaptable virtual reality system that allows patients to observe movement
      of a 3D virtual arm. Using the VIE, recorded signals from the residual limb will be
      correlated to the desired motion of the phantom limb. We hope to correlate the consistency of
      these patterns with PLP to determine if increased control of the phantom limb leads to
      decreased PLP.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Phantom Limb Pain Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks) and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of PLP will be assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), which wil consist of a 10-cm horizontal line across which subjects will place a mark corresponding to the level of phantom limb pain he or she experiences. The distance in centimeters from the low end of the VAS to the subject's mark will be used as a numeric index of pain severity. The VAS score over 4 weeks of VIE treatment will be averaged and compared to the baseline VAS score at the start of treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consistency of sEMG recordings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (0 weeks) and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The activation patterns of muscles on an around the residual limb will be recorded during the initial VIE therapy session using surface electrodes. The sEMG recordings after 4 weeks will be compared to the initial sEMG recordings at the start of VIE treatment. The change in sEMG signals over time will indicate how well patients are able to replicate muscle activation patterns between sessions in which they attempt to move the phantom arm in the same manner as the virtual arm.</description>

      <textblock>
        Seven unilateral, upper-extremity amputees completed the study. These subjects were either
        trans-radial (n=4) or trans-humeral (n=3) amputees.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, 18 to 65 years of age, active duty military, beneficiary, or
             retiree.

          -  Written informed consent and written authorization for use or release of health and
             research study information.

          -  At least one upper-limb amputation (trans radial or trans humeral) at any time prior
             to enrollment.

          -  No prior history of vertebral disk disease/condition, sciatica or radiculopathy.

          -  Normal neurological examination with the exception of limb amputation.

          -  Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.

          -  Experiencing PLP at least 3 times a week at an intensity of at least 3 out of 10 at
             the time of enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of mild to severe traumatic brain injury - permanent or temporary impairments
             of cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functions with an associated diminished or
             altered state of consciousness - as indicated by neuropsychological screening that is
             currently performed routinely on patients by the traumatic brain injury (TBI) program
             at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and noted in the patient's
             medical record.

          -  Known uncontrolled systemic disease

          -  Participation (either concurrently or in the 30 days prior to enrollment) in another
             study for treatment of PLP

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, confound study results, or interfere significantly with the
             subject's participation in the study.

          -  Significant Axis I or II diagnosis determined by a neurologist or psychiatrist in the
             6 months prior to entry into the study

          -  Subjects with lack of effort as determined by the neurologist or psychiatrist.
             Subjects will be screened for effort using the Test of Memory Malingering (TOMM) in
             order to exclude those with blatant exaggeration or malingering. Subjects who score
             lower than 42/50 on the TOMM-2 will not continue in the study
