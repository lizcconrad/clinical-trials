      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of the IPL system 650advance handpiece
      with the alexandrite laser for the purposes of female facial hair reduction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised (splitface)controlled trial, comparing the use of the Intense Pulsed
      Light (IPL) system 650 advance handpiece against the Alexandrite Laser for the purposes of
      female facial hair reduction. Previous studies have shown that the alexandrite laser is
      superior to IPL in achieving hair reduction. A new handpiece (Lynton, Lumina 650 advance)
      available for the IPL system is designed to further optimise its use in removing female
      facial hair (particularly those hair colours previously unresponsive to treatment). This
      study will compare the alexandrite laser to the IPL system using the new handpiece. This may
      lead to improvements in the treatment of female patients with male pattern facial hair.
      Female patients referred to our facial hair reduction service will be recruited to this
      study. 1/2 their face will be treated with IPL and 1/2 with alexandrite laser. Each
      participant will receive 6 full treatments at approximately 6 weekly intervals. Participants
      will be asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire and have clinical photographs taken pre
      treatment and at 1 and 3months post final treatment. All treatments will be carried out in
      our dedicated laser suite at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
