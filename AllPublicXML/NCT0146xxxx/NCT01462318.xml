  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the immunogenicity of Daclizumab High Yield
      Process (DAC HYP) 150 mg administered every 4 weeks by subcutaneous (SC) injection using the
      pre-filled syringe (PFS) in participants with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).
      The secondary objectives of this study are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DAC
      HYP following single and multiple doses of DAC HYP administered by the PFS in a subset of
      participants with RRMS and to evaluate the effect of DAC HYP on the PK of probe drugs for
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a screening period, participants will receive DAC HYP over a 24-week treatment
      period (6 monthly injections) and then enter a 20-week washout period for assessment of
      immunogenicity, PK, pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability. The 20-week washout is
      necessary to ensure measurement of anti-DAC HYP binding antibodies (ADAbs) and neutralizing
      antibodies (NAbs) in the absence of drug interference. After washout, the participants may
      resume monthly treatment with DAC HYP 150 mg for an additional 3 years. All participants will
      be followed for 6 months after their last dose for safety monitoring. Additionally, two
      sub-studies will be performed: (1) an intensive serial PK sampling performed over the first
      and last dosing interval following DAC HYP doses administered at week 0 and at week 20, and
      (2) a therapeutic protein-drug interaction (TP-DI) sub-study, during which a probe drug
      cocktail will be administered at weeks 43 and 53 followed by serial probe-drug PK sampling up
      to 96 hours after probe-drug administration. A maximum of 20 participants will be enrolled in
      the TP-DI sub-study.
