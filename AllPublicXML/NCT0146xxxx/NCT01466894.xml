  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-selection,
      multiple dose administration study comprising three groups, with up to 40 patients in each
      active treatment and placebo group. Patients with biopsy proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH) and elevated liver enzymes will be randomized to undergo a liver MRI scan and to
      receive Imm 124-E or placebo for 24 weeks. During this period, patients will be followed for
      clinical and laboratory effects. At the end of 24 weeks of treatment, patients will undergo a
      second liver MRI scan. Patients will be followed for an additional 4 weeks for safety after
      completion of treatment.
