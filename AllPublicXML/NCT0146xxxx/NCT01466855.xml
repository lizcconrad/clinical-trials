  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test if giving topotecan directly into the blood vessel of the eye will
      improve the treatment of retinoblastoma. This method is referred to as &quot;selective
      intra-ophthalmic artery chemotherapy&quot; (SIOAC).

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To find out if topotecan is an effective treatment for retinoblastoma when delivered
           directly to the ophthalmic artery (SIOAC delivery)

        -  To find out what kind of effects (good and bad) can be expected when topotecan is given
           by SIOAC

        -  To assess visual pathway function before and after the study therapy

        -  To learn more about the pharmacology (how your body handles the drug) of topotecan when
           delivered directly to the ophthalmic artery
