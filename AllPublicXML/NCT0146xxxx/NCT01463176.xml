  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many young children undergo medical procedures that are painful and distressing. Negative
      experiences during medical procedures can have serious long-term effects, including fear and
      avoidance of medical procedures during adulthood. Distraction interventions can help prevent
      children from forming negative memories of medical procedures. Live music therapy has been
      shown to alleviate pediatric distress during both invasive and non-invasive procedures. The
      objective of this study is to examine the effects of music therapy on the child's distress
      behaviors and time to calm, as well as the length of the procedure and use of restraint, and
      parents' and healthcare staffs' behaviors during the procedure, for young children undergoing
      immunizations and influenza vaccinations. It is hypothesized that children receiving music
      therapy will show fewer distress behaviors, calm more quickly, and have shorter procedures
      with fewer instances of restraint compared to children who receive standard care. In
      addition, it is predicted that adults (parents and staff) will show fewer distress-promoting
      behaviors during, before, and after the procedures.
