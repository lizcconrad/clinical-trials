      Comparative evaluation of recurrence-free survival (RFS) time and 3 year overall survival

      This trial is designed for patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC), who have
      undergone a complete resection of their primary tumor and recent resection of their liver
      metastases (R0 or R1) with curative intent. No generally accepted standard care is available
      following curative-intent resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients.
      L-BLP25 is a cancer vaccine that targets MUC1, a well known tumor-associated antigen.
      Recently, it has been shown that MUC1 is associated with cellular transformation as
      demonstrated by tumorigenicity and can confer resistance to genotoxic agents. High levels of
      MUC1 cell surface expression, reported immunosuppressive activities of its released
      ectodomain, and anti-adhesive properties all contribute to the ability of the MUC1 antigen to
      protect and promote tumor cell growth and survival, and make MUC1 an attractive target for
      cancer immunotherapy.

      Based on these results, L BLP25 may have potential as adjuvant therapy after curative
      resection of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer patients.

    <description>The primary variable of this trial is recurrence free survival (RFS) time. RFS time will be measured from the date of randomization to the date of recurrence. For subjects not known to have experienced recurrence or death at the time of analysis, the time between the date of randomization and the date of last evaluation for recurrence will be calculated and used as a censored observation in the analysis.</description>

             female partners of childbearing potential) must be willing to use an adequate method
             of contraception for 4 weeks prior to, during and 12 weeks after the last dose of
             trial medication. A negative pregnancy test is required for female subjects. Adequate
             contraception for female subjects is defined as two barrier methods, or one barrier
             method with a spermicide, or intrauterine device or use of hormonal female
             contraceptive.
