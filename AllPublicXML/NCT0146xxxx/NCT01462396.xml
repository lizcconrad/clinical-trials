  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic stem cell transplantation has been explored for patients with high risk
      neuroblastoma. Results have been mixed, with only small series and case reports. Recent
      reports, however, especially with haploidentical transplantation have been more encouraging.
      Eradication of neuroblastoma may be mediated by both components of the innate immune system
      (natural killer cells) and through the adaptive immune system via T-cell cytotoxicity and the
      development of a humoral response to tumor specific antigens and minor histocompatibility
      antigens. To overcome restrictions created by unavailability of Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
      matched donors, stem cell grafts from haploidentical related donors have been explored.
      Historically, the use of full haplotype mismatched family member donors has been limited by
      the development of severe graft-versus-host disease and the high rate of graft failure. Graft
      failure can now be overcome by increasing immunosuppression and increasing the number of
      transplanted stem cells. The most effective means of graft versus host disease (GVHD)
      prophylaxis is T cell depletion of the donor marrow. A 3-4 log depletion will reduce the risk
      of developing significant GVHD to less than 10%. Methods to mobilize stem cells from the bone
      marrow into the peripheral blood and collect these stem cells by apheresis now increase the
      availability of stem cells by a magnitude. Selection devices have been developed that will
      prepare extremely pure populations of these CD34 cells with upwards of 5 logs depletion of
      contaminating T cells. The CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System is a medical device designed to
      select CD34+ hematopoietic cells from heterogeneous hematologic cell populations. The
      investigators intend to provide mismatched related hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to
      up to 10 patients with relapsed refractory neuroblastoma. Harnessing the potential for innate
      and adaptive immune responses through allogeneic Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) may provide cure for some patients with this tumor.
