    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare OnDose® based pharmacokinetic administration of 5-FU
      versus standard Body Surface Area (BSA) based administration of 5-FU in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer treated with mFOLFOX6, with or without bevacizumab, to determine
      if the use of OnDose® achieves an improvement in the Overall Response Rate (ORR) relative to
      BSA dosing response.

    <description>Patients will receive FOLFOX6 with or without bevacizumab (Avastin). Patients' 5-FU dose will be optimized by measuring the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 5-FU by the commercially available OnDose® assay and their dose for subsequent cycles adjusted following a pre-established dose adjustment algorithm.</description>

             10 mm (if spiral CT scan)

          -  ECOG Performance Status (ECOG-PS) status ≤ 2

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal
             to 3x the upper limit of normal (≤ 5.0 x ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor
             involvement) (ALT normal range: &lt; 41 iu/L (male), &lt; 31 iu/L (female); AST normal
             range: &lt; 37 iu/L (male), &lt; 31 iu/L (female)).
