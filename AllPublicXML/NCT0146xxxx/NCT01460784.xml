    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a cross-sectional study of 60 participants who are 18-30
      years of age to undergo research PET/CT. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      relationships between Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), the adiponectin/leptin (A/L) ratio, and
      components of the metabolic syndrome in young adults.

      We propose to conduct a cross-sectional study of 60 participants who are 18-30 years of age
      to undergo research PET/CT. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships
      between Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), the adiponectin/leptin (A/L) ratio, and components of the
      metabolic syndrome in young adults. This study is part of a larger study aimed at
      understanding the mechanism of brown adipose tissue as a potential protective factor against
      metabolic dysfunction.
