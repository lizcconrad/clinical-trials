  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imagery Rescripting (IR)is a promising treatment for PTSD in adult survivors of early,
      chronic, interpersonal trauma (e.g. Smucker &amp; Dancu, 1999). So far, this protocol has not
      been investigated within a controlled setting with patients with PTSD following early,
      chronic, interpersonal trauma. The aim of the proposed study is to 1. investigate the
      efficacy of Imagery Rescripting and 2. check whether the efficacy of Imagery Rescripting can
      be improved by adding a stabilization phase (Skills training in affective and interpersonal
      regulation, STAIR) prior to this treatment. In a randomized controlled trial three conditions
      will be compared:

        1. Imagery Rescripting

        2. STAIR + Imagery Rescripting

        3. Wait-list control
