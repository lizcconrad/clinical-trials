  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment response of mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) to continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) therapy and oral appliance (OA) is still controversial. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the effect of CPAP and OA treatment on: objective and subjective sleepiness,
      cognitive deficits, mood changes, quality of life, inflammatory profile and metabolic
      cardiovascular and hormonal alterations in mild OSA subjects. Subjects with mild OSA (apnea
      -hypopnea index of 5 or more events per hour of sleep and less than 15), both genders, body
      mass index lower than 35Kg/m2 and age between 18 to 65 years will be included. They also must
      have a minimum mandibular protrusion of 7mm. Subjects will be randomly distributed in three
      groups: group 1 with CPAP, group 2 with OA and group 3 will be the control. At baseline
      evaluation, six months, one year and three years, all subjects will be submitted to sleep
      questionnaires, physical examination, ear-nose and throat evaluation, baseline
      polysomnography (and with CPAP for groups 1), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Karolinska Sleepiness
      Scale, Stanford Sleepiness Scale, Maintenance of Wakefulness Test, Chalder Fatigue Scale,
      Neurocognitive testing, Beck Inventories of anxiety and depression, Functional Outcomes of
      Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), WHOQOL-BREF quality of life questionnaire, Short Form-36 quality
      of life questionnaire, questionnaire for sexual dysfunction, blood analysis for inflammatory,
      metabolic and hormonal evaluation, assessment of heart rate variability, 24 hour blood
      pressure monitoring and endothelial dysfunction. Sleep hygiene care was offer to three
      groups. Analysis mean and standard deviation will be used for descriptive statistical and a
      general linear model will be applied for analysis within groups on different time.
