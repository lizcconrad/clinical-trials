      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NU100 in patients with
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) as compared to placebo and an active
      comparator. The primary clinical objective selected for this Phase 3 study, the cumulative
      number of new combined unique active lesions (CALs; defined as new gadolinium T1-weighted
      lesions and non-enhancing new and newly enlarging T2-weighted lesions) on magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) scans over the course of 4 and 12 months of treatment to demonstrate the
      superiority of NU100 to placebo and the non-inferiority of NU100 to Betaferon®, respectively.

          2. Signed and dated statement of informed consent

          3. Diagnosis of RRMS according to McDonald's Criteria - revision 2010 (Polman et al.,
             2011)

          4. Interferon (IFN) beta-1b naïve

          5. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of &lt; 5.5

          6. At least 1 documented relapse in the past year (defined as the appearance of a new
             clinical sign/symptom [one that had been stable for at least 30 days] that persisted
             for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever) ---or--- a subclinical sign/symptom
             (defined as a Gd-enhancing lesion or a new T2 lesion demonstrated on MRI examination
             on a prior MRI that has been completed within 1 year of the screening MRI). The
             Screening (V-1) MRI should not be used for this determination.

          7. No relapse in the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit (V-1).
