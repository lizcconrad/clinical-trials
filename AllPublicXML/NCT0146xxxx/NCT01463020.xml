  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to test the effects of a smartphone-delivered behavioural activation
      treatment. Also, a moderator analysis of low and high severity of depressive symptoms will be
      made. We expect the behavioural activation intervention to be superior to the mindfulness
      intervention for the participants suffering from high severity of depressive symptoms - and
      the mindfulness intervention to be better or at least as good as the behavioural activation
      intervention for the participants suffering from low severity of depressive symptoms.

    <textblock>
      Major depression is expected to be the disorder with the highest disease burden in
      high-income countries by the year 2030. The efficacy of behavioural activation in the
      treatment of major depressive disorders has been established in a number of studies over the
      last four decades. Furthermore, behavioural activation is an intervention that can largely
      benefit from the use of new mobile technologies (e.g. smartphones). One important feature of
      mobile technology is the possibility for the therapist to reach the patient between sessions
      and thus create direct incentives for behavioural activation in everyday life. Therefore,
      developing smartphone-based behavioural activation interventions might be a way to develop a
      cost-effective treatment for people suffering from major depressive disorders.
