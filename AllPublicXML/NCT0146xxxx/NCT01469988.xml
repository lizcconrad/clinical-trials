      Background:Heart failure is a prevalent condition of major public health importance that
      leads to significant morbidity and mortality despite the use of current evidence-based
      therapy. Further development of novel therapies to alleviate symptoms, improve functional
      status and ultimately clinical outcomes are needed. Cardiac function alone cannot explain all
      aspects of the heart failure syndrome: hence a search for peripheral mechanisms and
      inter-connected cardiac and non-cardiac pathways has ensued. Testosterone plays an integral
      role in multiple organ systems for growth, development and maintenance of health with known
      effects on peripheral musculature, vasculature, sympathetic tone, endothelial function and
      restoration of muscle metabolic function which would be beneficial in HF. Chronic HF has been
      associated with reduced testosterone levels, and low testosterone levels have been linked to
      reduced VO2, increased BNP and ANP levels, and worse clinical outcomes. Testosterone
      supplementation acts as a peripheral vasodilator and acutely increases cardiac output,which
      would improve oxygen delivery to skeletal muscles and secondarily delay transfer to anaerobic
      metabolism and depletion of high-energy phosphates. The increase in muscle mass associated
      with testosterone therapy may also result in increased endurance and decreased muscle
      fatigability in HF patients. Early small trials demonstrate safety, tolerability and an
      improvement in exercise walking distance in patients with HF. We contend that the time is now
      ripe for an adequately-powered phase II trial in order to test if this therapy can improve
      symptoms and functional status for patients with heart failure.

      Specific Aim:Evaluate the efficacy and safety of testosterone supplementation on functional
      capacity, biomarkers, quality of life and clinical outcomes for patients with heart failure.

      Synopsis:We propose a phase II randomized controlled, multi-center, double-blind trial, &quot;The
      VO2Increase with Testosterone Addition - Heart Failure (VITA-HF) Trial&quot;. We plan to enroll
      318 patients with chronic HF and NYHA II-III in a 1:1 trial of testosterone therapy (versus
      placebo): our primary objective is to test the effects on peak VO2 at 26 weeks (a commonly
      used surrogate outcome in phase II HFRCTthat represents both central and peripheral effects
      of our interventions). Given the assumptions made (a peak VO2 standard deviation of 2.7
      mls/kg/min, paired t-test, and 2-sided alpha 0.05), 318 patients will have 85% power to
      detect a 1.0 ml/kg/min difference between the groups in the change in peak VO2 over 26 weeks.
      The minimally clinically important difference for peak VO2 may be as small as 0.26 mls/kg/min
      but is possibly higher and therefore, we have taken a conservative approach similar to that
      of other CIHR and NIH trials. Additional measures of quality of life, biomarkers (BNP) and
      clinical outcomes will be performed at 26 and 52 weeks. Quantitative measurement of core
      laboratory echocardiographic imaging will also assess the effect on left ventricular
      remodeling and markers of systolic and diastolic function. Assessment at 26 weeks will allow
      for the early effects to be demonstrated whereas our secondary endpoint evaluated at 52 weeks
      will demonstrate clinical and other outcomes important for phase III planning (including
      clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic endpoints).Androgel 5g was selected due to
      compliance and prior RCT dosing to ensure efficacy with a broad safety margin.

      Feasibility:The investigators on this grant are attending physicians in large, tertiary care
      heart failure clinics with large patient populations and extensive experience with recruiting
      patients into clinical studies. The 7 sites selected have both experience and expertise in
      enrolling HF patients in CIHR and NIH trials.

      Importance:Our proposed trial (VITA-HF) tests a novel strategic target which could enhance
      the quality and potentially the quantity of life of patients with heart failure by modulating
      complementary peripheral and central HF mechanisms.

    <measure>In patients with chronic heart failure, does 26 weeks of treatment with transdermal testosterone improve peak VO2?</measure>
    <time_frame>26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint is change in peak VO2 measured at baseline and 26 weeks. The timing of the primary endpoint was chosen to allow for effects of either therapy to be seen within a reasonable timeframe, and to minimize loss to follow up, withdrawal due to clinical or adverse events and published data thus far supporting that an effect could be seen within 26 weeks.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>In patients with chronic heart failure, does 26 or 52 weeks of treatment with transdermal testosterone improve quality of life, biomarker (b-type natriuretic peptide, fasting glucose) or echocardiographic measures (LVEF, LVEDD, LVESD, SV)?</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Includes total hospitalizations or ED visits (total, CV and HF), change in serum BNP at 26 and 52 weeks, change in quality of life assessed by KCCQ and FACIT-F, and changes in echocardiographic parameters (change from baseline in LVEDD, LVESD, LVEF, or SV). The FACIT-F was developed to assess fatigue, and has been validated and used in RCT. Markers of testosterone status will be evaluated to evaluate that the levels of these individual markers are attained relative to the doses used.</description>

    <measure>In patients with chronic heart failure, does 52 weeks of treatment with transdermal testosterone reduce ED visits or hospitalization for heart failure, or total mortality?</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Incorporates clinical endpoints and quality of life to determine if patients are improved, unchanged or worsened at 52 weeks. All patients will be ranked sequentially into a ranking stratified to 3 tiers: (1) Death [time to death from randomization date with earliest death given lowest rank]; (2) Cardiovascular hospitalization or ED visit [time to hospitalization or ED visit from randomization date, if alive]; and (3) Change in KCCQ score [if alive and no hospitalization or ED visit, then patients with least change are ranked lowest, unchanged ranked next and improvement ranked highest].</description>
