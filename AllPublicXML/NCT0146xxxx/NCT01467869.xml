      Following spinal cord injury, most men are infertile and require medical assistance to father
      children. The conditions that contribute to their infertility are erectile dysfunction,
      ejaculatory dysfunction, and semen abnormalities. The Miami Project Male Fertility Program is
      a research study designed to understand and improve impairments to male fertility resulting
      from spinal cord injury.

    <measure>spinal cord injury (SCI) subjects will learn the best method to obtain their semen and of their possible options for assisted conception.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 visits; subjects will provide samples each month up to an average of 2-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Studies in the male fertility program will investigate the fertility potential of spinal cord injured men by retrieving semen which will be analyzed for sperm count, motility, morphology, etc., and correlated with patient variables such as age, time of injury, level of injury, bladder management, history of UTI's, hormonal status, etc. the outcome of the research will improve fertility in men with spinal cord injury.</description>
