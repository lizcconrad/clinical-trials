  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed site-level randomized trial will test the effectiveness of a work site
      intervention based on an ecological framework at preventing weight gain among high school
      employees in Massachusetts. The investigators hypothesis is that the intervention will
      positively impact healthy dietary patterns and physical activity, perceived organizational
      commitment, coworker influences, social support, self-efficacy, and self-control, which in
      turn will positively mediate or moderate the positive associations between the intervention
      and the primary outcomes (change in weight, BMI, and waist circumference). If effective, the
      intervention is designed to be generalizable to high school settings across the country and
      has the potential to reduce the morbidity, mortality and economic costs of overweight and
      obesity in this important population.
