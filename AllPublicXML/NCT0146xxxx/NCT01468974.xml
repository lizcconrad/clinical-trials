             For subjects with bilateral lesions, the higher Rutherford-Becker Clinical Category
             limb will be considered the target extremity to be treated in this trial.

             If both limbs are of the same Rutherford Becker Clinical Category, the target
             extremity will be selected based on investigator discretion.

          3. Subject or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of the
             study, agrees to its provisions, and is able to provide informed consent.

          4. Subject agrees to undergo all protocol-required follow-up examinations and
             requirements at the investigational site.

          5. Female subject of childbearing potential must: have had a negative pregnancy test
             within 14 days before treatment; not be nursing at the time of the study procedure and
             agree at time of consent to use birth control during participation in this trial.

          6. Subject has life expectancy &gt; 12 months.

          7. Subject is able to take clopidogrel or prasugrel (or ticlopidine, if the subject
             cannot take clopidogrel or prasugrel) and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin).

          8. Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical investigation for a period
             of 12 months following the index procedure. This includes clinical trials of
             medications and invasive procedures. Questionnaire-based studies, or other studies
             that are non-invasive and do not require medication are allowed.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. A single de novo native disease segment of the superficial femoral (SFA) or common or
             external iliac arteries of the target extremity located within the following
             anatomical parameters:

             Iliac

               -  Proximal margin of target lesion is ≥ 2.5 cm distal to the aortic bifurcation in
                  common iliac artery

               -  Distal margin of target lesion is ≥ 1.5 cm proximal to the location of inguinal
                  ligament

             SFA

               -  Proximal margin of target lesion is ≥ 1 cm distal to the common femoral artery
                  bifurcation

               -  Distal margin of target lesion is ≤ 25 cm distal to the common femoral artery
                  bifurcation

          2. Vessel diameter from ≥ 5.5 mm to ≤ 6.5 mm evaluated by on-line quantitative vascular
             angiography (QVA) after pre-dilatation per core laboratory guidelines

          3. Target lesion is ≥ 50% DS

          4. Target lesion length ≤ 50 mm

          5. Patent inflow artery free from significant lesion (≥ 50% DS and &lt; 100% DS) as
             confirmed by angiography (treatment of the target lesion acceptable after successful
             treatment of inflow artery lesion)

          6. Patent popliteal artery free from significant lesion (≥ 50% DS) with at least one
             patent distal outflow artery (anterior tibial, posterior tibial, or peroneal) that
             provides in-line circulation to the lower leg and foot, as confirmed by angiography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3; a white blood cell count
             (WBC) &lt;3,000 cells/mm3; or hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL

          2. Acute or chronic renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dl or &gt;176μmol/L)

          3. Severe liver impairment as defined by total bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dl or two times increase
             over the normal level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) or serum
             glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT).

          4. Known allergies to the following: aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticlopidine,
             heparin, contrast agent (that cannot be adequately premedicated), or drugs similar to
             everolimus (i.e. tacrolimus, sirolimus, zotarolimus) or other macrolides.

          5. Subject requires planned procedure that would necessitate the discontinuation of
             clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticlopidine.

          6. Subject has had or will require treatment with drug eluting stent (DES) or drug coated
             balloon (DCB) within 6 months pre- or post-index procedure.

         14. Subject has unstable angina defined as rest angina with ECG changes.

         15. Subject has a groin infection, or an acute systemic infection that has not been
             treated successfully or is currently under treatment.

         16. Subject has acute thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis in either extremity.

         17. Subject has other medical illnesses (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) that
             may cause the subject to be non-compliant with protocol requirements, confound the
             data interpretation or is associated with limited life-expectancy, i.e., less than 12
             months.

         18. Subject is currently participating in an investigational drug, biologic, or device
             study that has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with
             the current study endpoints. (Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products
             that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not
             considered investigational trials.)

         19. Subject is unable to understand or unwilling to cooperate with study procedures.

         20. Subject requires general anesthesia for the procedure.

         21. Subject has ischemic or neuropathic ulcers on either foot.

         22. Subject has prior minor or major amputation of either lower extremity.

         23. Subject is part of a vulnerable population who, in the judgment of the investigator,
             is unable to give informed consent for reasons of incapacity, immaturity, adverse
             personal circumstances or lack of autonomy. This may include: Individuals with mental
             disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, subjects in
             emergency situations, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of
             giving informed consent. Vulnerable populations also may include members of a group
             with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and
             laboratory personnel, employees of the sponsor, members of the armed forces, and
             persons kept in detention.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          1. Contralateral lesion distal to the location of inguinal ligament that requires
             treatment within 30 days before or after the procedure. (Contralateral iliac artery
             lesions may be treated during the procedure if necessary for contralateral approach to
             the target lesion).

          2. Target extremity has an angiographically significant (&gt; 50% DS) lesion located distal
             to the target lesion.

          3. Acute ischemia of the target extremity

          4. Target extremity has been previously treated with any of the following: surgical
             bypass or endarterectomy.

          5. Target vessel has been previously treated with any of the following: stent, laser,
             atherectomy, surgical bypass, or endarterectomy.

          6. Total occlusion (100% DS) of the ipsilateral inflow artery.

          7. Angiographic evidence of thrombus in target vessel.

          8. The target lesion requires treatment with a device other than percutaneous
             transluminal angioplasty (PTA) (e.g. but not limited to, directional atherectomy,
             excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, brachytherapy, cryoplasty, etc.)

          9. Target lesion is within or adjacent to an aneurysm.

         10. Subject has angiographic evidence of thromboembolism or atheroembolism from treatment
             of an ipsilateral iliac lesion, or from crossing or pre-dilating the target lesion.

         11. Target lesion has moderate-to-severe calcification with either of the following
             characteristics:

               -  Circumferential orientation

               -  Thickness &gt; 2 mm in either radial or longitudinal direction

         12. Subject has an abdominal aortic aneurysm &gt; 3 cm or history of aortic
             revascularization.
