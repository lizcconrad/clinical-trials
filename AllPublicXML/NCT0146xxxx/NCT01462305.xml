    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of light therapy using a narrow
      467nm light compared to a 580nm light in subjects with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). It
      is hypothesized that the 467nm light will improve the symptoms of SAD better than the 580nm
      light.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a 467nm light or a 580nm light.
      Participants will use the light every day for six weeks for 30 minutes. Multiple assessments
      and questionnaires will be given weekly to assess the efficacy of the treatment.
