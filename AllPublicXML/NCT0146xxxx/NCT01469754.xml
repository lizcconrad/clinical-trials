    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a well-documented phenomenon that occurs in cancer
      survivors. PTSD is known to cause problems with anxiety, depression, and quality of life.
      Furthermore, there is little treatment available for cancer survivors who suffer from PTSD.

      Posttraumatic Growth, however, is a lesser known phenomenon that also occurs in cancer
      survivors. It is a positive psychological phenomenon that occurs in some people who have
      suffered a traumatic event--the people who are able to note a &quot;greater appreciation for
      life&quot;, a &quot;stronger relationship with their family/friends,&quot; or a &quot;new found level of
      spirituality&quot; are examples of instances of posttraumatic growth.

      Coping with Lymphoma to Enhance Adjustment and Reduce Stress in Survivors (CLEAR Stress) is a
      study designed to compare the development of PTSD versus the development of Posttraumatic
      Growth in lymphoma patients at any stage of the cancer experience, regardless of treatment.
      The hypothesis is that posttraumatic growth, if it is significant, can reduce the impact of
      PTSD symptoms in the survivor.
