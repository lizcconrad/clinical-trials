    <textblock>
      The study serves the identification of early forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
      in connective tissue disease and the hemodynamic follow-up of the investigated patients. The
      basic hypothesis is that PAH may start with a remodeling of small pulmonary arteries, which
      leads to a stiffening of the vessels, indicated by the inability to vasodilatation and thus a
      disproportional increase in pulmonary pressure during exercise. Recent studies have shown
      that a proportion of such patients may develop manifest PAH within a few years. The early
      identification of these patients and the understanding of the natural course of the disease
      may improve prognosis. The aim of the present study is to investigate hemodynamic and
      clinical changes in patients with connective tissue disease in a time interval of 3-5 years
      with a focus on the development of pulmonary hypertension.
