      The program of stretching, strengthening and proprioception is more effective than stretching
      and strengthening program in nursing, with rotator cuff disorder, according to indicators of
      quality of life and job satisfaction.

      The study will be conducted at the Rehabilitation Centre of the Hospital of the Medical
      School of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo (USP-HCFMRP).

      The study will be conducted with nursing staff (nurses, technicians and nursing assistants)
      HCFMRP-USP.

      The sample will consist of nursing workers sent by request for referral to a medical
      diagnosis of rotator cuff disorder in the period May 2010 to August 2011.

      There was no sample size calculation for this study because the number of subjects directly
      depends on the demand of patients referred to the Department of Physical Therapy
      Rehabilitation Center (CER) in the period of data collection. All patients who met the study
      inclusion criteria were invited to participate.

      So, once met the inclusion criteria of the sample, the subjects were randomly allocated to
      Group 1 (control) or 2 (experimental).

      Group 1 was formed by the subjects in the control group in which they were performed
      stretching exercises, cryotherapy and strengthening the shoulder.

      Group 2 was formed by the subjects in the experimental group were performed in which
      stretching exercises, strengthening, and cryotherapy proprioceção shoulder.

    <measure>Indicators of quality of life (WORC - Western Ontario Rotator Cuff The Index)</measure>
    <time_frame>This scale is applied one day before and one day after the application of physical therapy intervention programs</time_frame>
    <description>The WORC was selected to be a reliable tool for measuring quality of life for patients with rotator cuff disorder,available in Portuguese and validated for Brazilian culture by Lopes et al (2008).
The WORC consists of 21 items and has five fields, and you can get the total for each domain separately. The domains are: physical symptoms, sports and recreation, work, lifestyle and emotions. The total score ranges from zero to 2100. Thus, zero implies no reduction in quality of life and the worst score is 2100.</description>

    <measure>Questionnaire used was the Job Satisfaction Scale - Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI).</measure>
    <time_frame>This scale is applied one day before and one day after the application of physical therapy intervention programs</time_frame>
    <description>This scale allows for the measurement of satisfaction with 22 aspects of psychosocial work using Likert scales of six points, ranging from huge to enormous satisfaction dissatisfaction. Such a tool available in Portuguese was validated by Cooper, Sloan and Williams (1988).
The sum of these measures provides an indicator of job satisfaction given by a global score that ranges from 22 to 123 points. There's a cutoff point defined herein</description>
