  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weaning of mechanical ventilation (MV) is an essential part in management of patients with
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) when critically ill. The best strategy to be
      used has not been established.

      Objective: To compare the Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT) in Pressure Support Ventilation
      with SBT through &quot;T&quot; tube in weaning of MV in patients with COPD.

      Design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Methods: This study will include patients with COPD,
      admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceição, undergoing MV for
      at least 48 hours. When considered by the care team ready for SBT, they will be randomized to
      one of the following strategies: SBT in Pressure Support or SBT through &quot;T&quot; Tube. The primary
      endpoint of this study will be the reduction in the days spent on MV. Other outcomes measured
      will be mortality, extubation and success rate, time to weaning of MV, length of ICU stay and
      incidence of tracheostomy.
