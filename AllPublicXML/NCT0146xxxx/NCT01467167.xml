  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, a new software program for anesthesia has been developed, called Smart Pilot View.
      This program monitors the patient, the anesthetic drugs given, and the calculated depth of
      the anesthesia. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of this program
      improves the quality of anesthesia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anesthesia Quality Score</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week From start of induction until discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
    <description>Anesthesia Quality Score (AQS) is defined as the percentage of time the BIS is within the range of 40-60 AND the mean arterial pressure is within the range of 60-80 mmHg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total anesthetic drug doses</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week From start of induction until discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean intra-operative Noxious Stimulation Response Index (NSRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day During surgery (until skin closure)</time_frame>
    <description>The Noxious Stimulation Response Index (NSRI) is based on a hierarchical interaction propofol-remifentanil model. With this model, the predicted propofol and remifentanyl concentrations can make a prediction about a respons to a certain stimulus, such as shaking and shouting, or a noxious stimulus.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of doses of vasoactive substances</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week From start of induction until discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of doses of vasoactive substances given to maintain an adequate perfusion pressure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of events with motor and vegetative (tearing, sweating) responses</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week From start of induction until discharge from post-anesthesia care unit</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of events in which the patient displays vegetative reactions such as tearing and sweating, in respons to a noxious stimulus during surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recovery times (skin closure to extubation; skin closure to orientation)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 week From end of surgery (skin closure) until discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
    <description>The time it takes for the patient to recover from anesthesia: the time from skin closure until the patient is sufficiently awake to be extubated, and the time from skin closure until full orientation of the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early postoperative pain control measured by visual analog scale and total morphine dose</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day From end of surgery (skin closure) until discharge from post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the adequacy of pain control during the early postoperative stage, measured by the visual analog scale and the total dose of morphine immediately postoperatively and during PACU stay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Workload of anesthesist, measured by the NASA Taskload Index</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 day From start of induction until transportation to PACU</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the workload the anesthetist experiences while working with the Smart Pilot View</description>
