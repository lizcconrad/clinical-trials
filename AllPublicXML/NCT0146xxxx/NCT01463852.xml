  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-principle study, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), who are
      scheduled to initiate treatment per the recommendations of their primary oncologist, will
      receive a single dose of vincristine 2 milligrams (mg). The objective is to determine if this
      single dose will induce rapid cell death in isolated CLL cells.

      Vincristine 2 mg will be administered to the participants intravenously over 5 minutes. Blood
      samples will be collected from an intravenous line inserted into the contralateral limb to
      that where the vincristine was given, at time zero (pre-vincristine treatment), immediately
      after vincristine administration (within 2-10 minutes upon completion of administration) and
      at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-vincristine treatment. Patients will then at a later date receive
      chemotherapy treatment as prescribed by their primary oncologist.

      Within 7 days of vincristine administration, participants will receive a phone call from the
      research nurse to discuss potential toxicities. At the time of the initiation of standard
      chemotherapy treatment, the Principal Investigator will also meet with the participant to
      collect information regarding adverse events.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18 years old or older.

          2. A diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL) which is CD5/CD19/CD23 positive,
             confirmed by peripheral blood immunophenotyping and/or lymph node biopsy and
             immunophenotyping and/or bone marrow biopsy and immunophenotyping. CD23-negative CLL
             cases are eligible, however additional diagnostic confirmation should include absence
             of Cyclin D1 rearrangement [t(11;14)] as determined by standard laboratory methods
             (such as fluorescent in situ hybridization).

          3. Patients are planning to start chemotherapy for CLL recommended and prescribed by
             their primary oncologist.

          4. Peripheral blood lymphocyte count above 20,000/mm3

          5. Be able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          2. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to vincristine.

          4. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          5. Liver function test abnormalities of ≥ grade 3 (total bilirubin &gt;3 ULN (upper limit of
             normal), AST&gt; 5 ULN, ALT&gt; 5 ULN) as per CTCAE 4.0 criteria, or direct bilirubin ≥ 3.0
             mg/dL

          6. Pre-existing neuropathy grade 2 or greater as per CTCAE 4.0 criteria (moderate
             symptoms limiting instrumental activities of daily living - ADLs)

          7. Patients who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during their participation in
             the study.
