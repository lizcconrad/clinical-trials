      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of treatment with
      FOLFIRI-aflibercept compared to initial treatment with FOLFIRI-aflibercept (for 6 cycles)
      followed by maintenance with 5FU-aflibercept, in an elderly population with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) after failure of an oxaliplatin-based regimen
