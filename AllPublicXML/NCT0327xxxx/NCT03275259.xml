      PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of shock waves extracorporea in improving body
      contour,decrease fat localized and appearance of gynoid lipodystrophy.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective and comparative longitudinal clinical study will be
      performed in 30 women with localized fat and gynoid lipodystrophy. Patients will be submitted
      data collection and assessments and before and after treatment.

      HYPOTHESES: It is expected that the patients will present improvement in the body contour,
      decrease fat localized and in the picture of the gynoid lipodystrophy after of the therapies.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A descriptive analysis will be done before and after
      vibration-oscillatory therapy, with frequency tables for categorical and descriptive
      variables (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values) for continuous or
      numerical variables. In order to compare the main variables between the groups and the
      collection times, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements will be used.
      Tukey's test will be used to compare groups. The level of significance adopted for the
      statistical tests will be 5% or p &lt;0.05.

      After signing the informed consent, the participants will be evaluated by two
      physiotherapists where the data collected will be personal data, anthropometrics and
      complementary diagnostic tests, such as: ultrasound diagnosis to evaluate the thickness of
      the adipose tissue and Cutomiter analysis of the Viscoelasticity of skin. They then started
      treatment with another physiotherapist who will perform the following study protocol: placing
      a light layer of neutral gel on the treatment area, applying extracorporeal shock waves with
      the stainless steel tip with 180mJ of energy totaling 4 thousand shots , in abdomens,
      buttocks and posterior thigh and 2 thousand shots in flanks, then performs the change of the
      tip to the plastic and performs 2 thousand shots in the regions of abdomens, buttocks,
      posterior thigh emil shots in the region of flanks. The protocol will be performed twice a
      week for 1 and 20 hours each, totaling 10 sessions.
