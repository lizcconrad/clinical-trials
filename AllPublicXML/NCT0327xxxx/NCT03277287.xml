      This is a prospective comparative study on 120 patients divided to three groups. Group A: 40
      patients laser will be applied 3 weeks post-surgical. Group B: 40 patients laser will be
      applied 3 months post surgical. Group C: 40 patients as a control not treated with laser from
      2017 to 2020 which will be conducted on patients with post-surgical cleft lip repair scaring.

      All patients will have 5-7 sessions with 4 weeks interval.

      Photographic documentation and evaluation of the scar will occur every 4 weeks.

    <textblock>
      The carbon dioxide laser (CO2 Laser) was one of the earliest gas lasers to be developed. It
      was invented by Kumar Patel of Bell Labs in 1964.

      CO2 laser is the highest power continuous wave lasers that are currently available which
      produces a beam of infrared light with the principal wavelength bands centering on 9.4 and
      10.6 micrometers. Patel, C. K. N. (1964).

      When CO2 beam of light is selectively applied to the skin, it heats and vaporizes various
      layers of skin, instantly treating damaged skin and wrinkles while smoothing out the surface
      of the skin.

      The skin remodeling occurs with new skin and collagen growth. The healing typically involves
      an open surface which takes weeks to heal and typically results in loss of the baseline
      pigmentation leading to variable lightening of skin. Dover, J. S. (2012) Fractional CO2 laser
      resurfacing is a revolutionary delivery system that provides dramatic skin improvement
      without surgery. Matrix combines the benefits of CO2 laser by using micro laser columns
      &quot;points of light&quot; to treat the epidermis and dermal layers of your skin.

      Bernstein et al, (1997) Cleft lip is a form of lip malformation that occurs very early in
      pregnancy, the incidence of cleft lip in the population is approximately 0.5-2 in 1000 live
      births. Male children are affected more often than female children.

      Michalski AM et al, (2015). Because each cleft is unique, definitive repair of the cleft lip
      should be individualized as Mirault, Le Mesurier, Tennison, and Millard.
