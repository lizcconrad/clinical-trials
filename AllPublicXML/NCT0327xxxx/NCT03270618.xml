  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose was to assess the accuracy and clinical validation of virtual planning and
      surgical template in mandible distraction osteogenesis. Patients with hemifacial microsomia
      were enrolled. Virtual planning and simulation were performed on three-dimensional models.
      Distraction was simulated on virtual model and the new morphology of the mandible was
      predicted. The position and direction of the distractor was determined to achieve the optimal
      morphology. The templates were designed based on virtual planning and manufactured using
      three-dimensional printing technique. The template is designed to assist the surgeon to
      perform the osteotomy and predrill the screw holes to guide the distractor position. The
      outcome evaluation was completed by comparing planned outcomes with postoperative outcomes.
      Linear and angular differences for the distractor was measured.
