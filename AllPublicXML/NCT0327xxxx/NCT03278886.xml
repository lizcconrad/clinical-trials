  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the feasibility, tolerability,
      and safety of using opioid receptor antagonists (naltrexone and nalmefene) to treat pain
      among HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common co-morbidity for HIV-infected patients. Prevalence studies suggest that, on
      average, half of all HIV-infected persons suffer pain. Chronic pain can lead to heavy alcohol
      use among HIV-infected persons, which may in turn be a barrier to treatment/control of HIV
      and contribute to spread of HIV. Thus there is an urgent need to address pain among persons
      with HIV. Opioid receptor antagonists such as naltrexone and nalmefene, which are licensed
      for treatment of alcohol use disorders, show promise as being effective and safe treatments
      for chronic pain among persons with HIV. This study will pilot test novel pharmacotherapies
      (opioid receptor antagonists) to improve chronic pain among HIV-infected heavy drinkers. The
      specific aims of the research is to assess the feasibility, tolerability and safety of using
      opioid receptor antagonists (low-dose naltrexone and nalmefene) to treat pain among
      HIV-infected persons with heavy alcohol use and chronic pain.

Participants will be asked to indicate on a scale of 0-100, how well they have tolerated the study medication with 0 anchored as &quot;cannot tolerate at all&quot; and 100 as &quot;tolerate perfectly well.&quot; Higher numbers will be indicative of higher tolerability of the medication.</description>
