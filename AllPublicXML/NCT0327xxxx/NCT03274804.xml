  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a monocentric, single arm, prospective, open-label trial of a combination treatment
      consisting of pembrolizumab and maraviroc in previously treated subjects who have refractory
      microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects will receive pembrolizumab beginning on Day 1 of each 3-week dosing cycle
      (d1, qd22) together with maraviroc administered perorally on day 1 to 21 of each cycle
      (d1-21; qd22).

      Treatment with pembrolizumab / maraviroc combination will continue until progressive disease
      (PD), unacceptable adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further
      administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject
      withdraws consent, pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure
      requirements, administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment, or completion of
      treatment per protocol.

      Subjects with a treatment response or stable disease after completion of the first treatment
      phase of eight cycles (core treatment period) will be offered, at the discretion of the
      investigator, participation in a maintenance phase consisting of up to 24 additional
      treatment cycles of pembrolizumab monotherapy (total treatment duration up to 24 months).

      Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than PD will have post-treatment follow-up for
      disease status until PD, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or
      becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed for overall survival (OS) until
      death, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study.

      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for AE monitoring.
      Serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of special interest (AESIs) will be collected for 90
      days after the end of treatment or for 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject
      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.

    <description>Biomarker research related secondary endpoints are to assess the immune response in whole blood and tumor tissue as well as the identification of biomarkers that correlate with clinical response and/or clinical outcome.
Therefore, blood-based biomarkers (e.g. changes in the cytokine profile) and tissue-based biomarkers in the biopsies of a metastatic lesion (e.g. T-cell infiltration, cytokines, tumor cell apoptosis) will be analyzed.
Blood and tissue based changes in the immune response will be correlated with clinical response patterns.</description>

             is confirmed by PCR or immunohistochemistry.

          2. Patient failed standard therapy or refused standard therapy or is intolerable towards
             standard therapy which must include a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan,

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;9 g/dl

               -  Thrombocytes &gt; 100.000/μl

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or GFR ≥60 mL/min for
                  subject with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x institutional ULN

                  present)

               -  Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL

          7. Adequate coagulation functions as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR)
             ≤1.5, and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 5 seconds above the ULN (unless
             receiving anticoagulation therapy). Patients receiving warfarin/ phenprocoumon must be
             switched to low molecular weight heparin and have achieved stable coagulation profile.

             consistently employed as the subject's preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered
             acceptable by local regulatory agencies and ERCs/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
             calendar, ovulation, sympto-thermal, post-ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception. Female patients with childbearing potential
             need to have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days before study start.

          9. Patient able and willing to provide written informed consent and to comply with the

          6. Any condition requiring continuous systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;10
             mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks
             prior to first dose of study treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids and physiological
             replacement doses of up to 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent are permitted in the
             absence of active autoimmune disease.

          7. Secondary malignant disease during the last 5 years (exceptions include basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer
             that has undergone potentially curative therapy).

          8. Clinical relevant comorbidity also including significant psychiatric disease

             required during the remainder of the study Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for
             injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal
             influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not
             allowed.
