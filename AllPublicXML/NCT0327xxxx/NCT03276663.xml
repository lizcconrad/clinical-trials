        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Having obtained his/her parents' (or his/her legally accepted representative's

             of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          2. Age ≤ 14 days after birth (date of birth = Day 0).

          3. Full-term gestational birth (≥ 37 and ≤ 42 weeks).

          4. Weight at birth ≥ 2500 g and ≤ 4200 g

          5. Born to mothers with (normal) pre-pregnancy BMI ≥ 18.5 to &lt; 26 kg/m2.

          6. For formula-fed infants: born to mothers who independently elected, before study
             enrollment, not to breastfeed, but having received any HM is permitted (not applicable
             for infants in the HM-fed group)

          7. For HM-fed infants: mothers intend to provide breast milk until age 6 months

          8. Infant's parent(s)/LAR is of legal age of consent, has sufficient command of the
             French language to complete the informed consent and other study documents, and is
             willing and able to fulfill the requirements of the study protocol.

          9. Infant's parent(s)/LAR is able to be contacted directly by telephone throughout the
             study.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Born to mothers with hormonal or metabolic disease (e.g. Type-1, Type-2, or
             gestational diabetes diagnosed according to standardized criteria).

          2. Born to mothers who smoked &gt; 10 cigarettes per day during pregnancy.

          3. Born to mothers who used illicit drugs (e.g. marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, or
             heroin) or alcohol (&gt; 3 alcoholic beverages per week) during pregnancy.

          4. Cognitive or physical developmental disorders (e.g., malabsorptive disorders such as
             short bowel syndrome; neurological and congenital disorders that may delay growth such
             as cerebral palsy, agenesis of the corpus callosum, spina bifida, Down syndrome, Cri
             Du Chat; disorders that may lead to obesity such as Prader Willi syndrome, Angelman
             syndrome; other renal, hepatic, pancreatic, or cardiovascular disorders).

          5. Participation in any other clinical trial prior to enrollment.

          6. Infants or infant's family who in the Investigator's judgment cannot be expected to
             comply with the protocol or study procedures.
