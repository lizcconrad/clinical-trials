      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and feasibility of an integrated,
      prescriptive, and trackable wellness intervention combining five wellness elements including
      exercise, mindfulness, sleep, social connectedness, and nutrition in First Year Beloit
      College students self-selected into a wellness focused first year initiative. This program is
      called &quot;WILD 5 Wellness: A 30-Day Intervention&quot;. Results for this study will be quantified
      through the use of standardized self-report questionnaires administered prior to and after
      students complete the WILD 5 program. Data will be collected to evaluate participants'
      adherence and response to each element of WILD 5, a 5-pronged 30-day wellness intervention.
      It is expected that this 30-day integrated, prescriptive, and trackable program will be found
      to be an efficacious wellness intervention for First Year Beloit College students.
