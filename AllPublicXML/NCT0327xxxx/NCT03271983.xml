      This research study is intended to develop models for in vitro/in vivo correlation (IVIVC) of
      drug absorption from dermal products. This study will use metronidazole products that have
      already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are already sold to
      customers in the United States; will not include any placebos.
