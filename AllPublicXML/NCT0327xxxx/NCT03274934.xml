  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized control trial is to examine effectiveness of individually tailored
      web- and mobile-based Acceptance- and Commitment Therapy interventions to promote
      adolescents' well-being and life-control and subsequently support their successful transition
      from basic education to upper secondary education. Our additional aim is to examine to what
      extent the effectiveness of the intervention varies according to intervention intensity and
      according to risk for school failure. The five-week structured intervention is delivered
      using the novel web-and mobile-based program Youth COMPASS following the principles of the
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The Internet context is assumed to be particularly
      motivating for youth who enjoy spending time online using different social media.
      Internet-based interventions have several advantages; they can include more information and
      treatment components than traditionally delivered treatments and that intervention programs
      are accessible at any time and at any place. Another unique aspect of the Youth COMPASS is
      the fact that it is individually-tailored. Each participant have an individually assigned
      online coach who provides support and encouragement, reminds about Youth COMPASS, sends
      individualized feedback, and recommends different exercises. The study hypothetizes that the
      Youth COMPASS is more effective than school counseling as usual. More specifically, the Youth
      COMPASS is expected to be more effective when it is combined with face-to-face support than
      when support and feedback are provided only via the Internet. Also, the Youth COMPASS with no
      face-to-face support (online only) is expected to be more effective than receiving only
      regular school counseling. Finally, the Youth COMPASS is expected to be more effective for
      students at risk for school failure than for students without risk for school failure,
      especially when at risk-adolescents receive more intensive support (i.e., both online and
      face-to-face support).

      selected from the participants of the broader longitudinal STAIRWAY (TIKAPUU in Finnish) -
      From Primary School to Secondary School study, which follows a community sample of Finnish
      adolescents (n~850) across critical educational transitions. The overall aim of the STAIRWAY
      project is to broaden our understanding of the individual- and environment-related factors
      that promote learning, well-being and successful educational transitions.

    <description>Behavioral: Structured web- and mobile-based intervention with Youth COMPASS program to support adolescents' well-being, career preparation and life-control and subsequently support successful transition to upper secondary education. The Youth COMPASS is the five-week online program according to principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy aiming to enhance adolescents' psychological flexibility by guiding adolescents in exploring their values and setting goals and changing behaviors according to their goals (week 1), and learning acceptance defusion and mindfulness skills (weeks 2-3) and integrating these skills into their personal life (weeks 4-5). The participants in this condition receive weekly online support and feedback from their individually assigned coach. In addition, they meet their coach twice in the face-to-face meetings. The aim of the meetings is to increase adolescents' internal motivation and thereby participation in the program.</description>

After 10 years of the data collection, those parts of the data that are not too sensitive (e.g., part of the questionnaire data), will be prepared in collaboration with a Finnish Social Science data Archive in a format that is easily accessible for other researchers.
