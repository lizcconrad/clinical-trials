  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is recommended that individuals perform a combination of resistance exercise (RE) and
      endurance exercise. Lack of time is often cited as a reason for being unable to meet current
      exercise guidelines. Therefore, combining both forms in one session may be beneficial.
      However, research continues to elucidate whether interference of adaptive outcomes occurs
      when RE and endurance exercise are performed concurrently. A proposed interference effect
      suggests that concurrent training may dampen RE-induced adaptations (e.g., muscle strength
      and growth) compared to RE only.

      The propose of this investigation is to determine the effects of concurrent RE and
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT), compared to RE only, on muscle health and
      cardiovascular risk in sedentary, middle-aged (40-65 years) who are overweight/obese with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The investigators will measure the effects on muscle
      strength, muscle growth, cardiovascular fitness, glycaemic control and markers of
      cardiovascular risk before and after an 8-week training program. Data will be obtained
      through the analysis of skeletal muscle samples, blood samples, magnetic resonance imaging,
      questionnaires and exercise performance tests.It is hypothesized that concurrent RE + HIIT
      will amplify the exercise-induced muscle growth response, which will result in greater
      satellite cell content, compared to RE alone. As a result, this will lead to greater skeletal
      muscle mass and strength after RE + HIIT compared to RE in isolation.

      A finding that concurrent resistance training and HIIT does not impede muscle adaptations
      could offer future strategies to minimize exercise time commitment whilst still maximizing
      the physiological benefits of both resistance and endurance exercise through a single
      training session. This may therefore provide an effective exercise strategy in the prevention
      and/or treatment of T2DM.

      Data analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS statistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, New
      York, USA). All data will be checked for normality and appropriate log transformations
      applied prior to analysis of variance (ANOVA) for primary and secondary outcomes. Satellite
      cell content will be compared using a two-way, mixed-model ANOVA with one within (2 levels;
      pre- and post-training) and one between factor (2 level; exercise group) with significance
      set at P &lt; 0.05.

      Based on a mixed ANOVA with between- and within-participant factors, and previously published
      data (Babcock et al. 2012), a sample size of 24 participants (12 per group) will provide a
      power of 84%. This sample size will allow detection of a mean change in satellite cell
      content of 2.35, assuming standard deviations of the change from pre- to post-training as
      2.266 and 1.331 in the two exercise groups. Sample size calculation was performed with an
      alpha error of 0.05. SamplePower 2.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) software was used to
      determine sample size.

      This study will combine data collected at the University of Birmingham with previously
      collected data from an identical study design performed by a co-investigator (Dr Pugh) in
      Rome, Italy. The previous study has collected data from 10 participants across both exercise
      groups (RE, N = 7; RE + HIIT, N = 3). Therefore, it is necessary for the present study to
      recruit a further 14 participants (RE, N = 5, RE + HIIT, N = 9) in order to achieve a sample
      size of 24 participants (12 per group). However, based on an assumption of a 25% drop-out
      rate, the total minimal sample necessary will be 19 participants (RE, N = 7; RE + HIIT, N =
      12).
