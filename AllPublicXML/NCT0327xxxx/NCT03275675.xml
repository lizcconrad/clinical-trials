  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacist, as a specialist of medications, occupies a strategic position: he
      participates in a global care of their patients. Dispensation is the pharmaceutical act which
      associates with the dispensing of medications &quot;the pharmaceutical analysis of the medical
      prescription if it exists, the possible preparation of the doses to be administered and the
      provisions of the information and advices necessary for the proper use of medications&quot;. The
      pharmacist ensures that the quality and safety of the dispensation is guaranteed at all times
      by limiting as far as possible the risks associated with an error in delivery, prescription,
      drug interactions or undetected contraindications, inadequate dosages or non-compliance with
      treatment. The longer the patient feels satisfied with the stage of delivery of his
      treatment, the better his adherence to treatment is, and the less he will encounter poor
      compliance. Oncology has particularly benefited in recent years from the introduction of
      numerous drugs with the aim of extending the duration of response in a growing number of
      indications. Traditionally in oncology, chemotherapy treatments are administered
      intravenously by trained personnel and rarely managed by the patient at home. Recently, there
      has been a growing choice of oral formulations, whether for conventional hormonal, anticancer
      therapies or targeted therapies. These specialties are now widely available in community
      pharmacies. Oral administration puts the patient at the center of his therapeutic management.
      He must take his medication alone. Adherence and compliance are therefore particularly
      important here for an optimal risk-benefit ratio. This study project is designed to evaluate
      the satisfaction of patients undergoing oral chemotherapy treated for a cancer pathology and
      whose treatment is provided by their community pharmacies. It also needs to provide
      information about the reasons for their poor adherence to treatment (personal factors,
      factors attributable to treatment, factors attributable to the care system). Patients will be
      recruited and interviewed by contacting several departments of the Clermont-Ferrand
      University Hospital (CHU de Clermont-Ferrand), who are used to caring for patients with
      cancerous diseases (hematology, urology, respiratory, gastro-enterology). The data collected
      in this study may be used for subsequent studies evaluating new management strategies or
      therapeutic education to improve adherence to patient treatment.

      This observational and transversal study will be conducted as a survey by contacting each
      eligible patients after complete information by the oncologist. After acceptance, the
      patients will received a postal mail with the questionnaire and a stamped envelope for the
      return of completed questionnaire. All the completed questionnaires will be recorded in a
      specific REDCap database for analysis.
