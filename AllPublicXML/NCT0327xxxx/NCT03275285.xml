      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the benefit of isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone in
      the prolongation of Progression Free Survival (PFS) as compared to carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) previously
      treated with 1 to 3 lines of therapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the Overall Response Rate (ORR), rate of very good partial response (VGPR)
           or better and complete response (CR) rate in both arms using International Myeloma
           Working Group (IMWG) criteria.

        -  To evaluate rate of VGPR or better with minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in
           both arms using IMWG criteria.

        -  To evaluate the Overall Survival (OS) in both arms.

        -  To evaluate safety in both arms.

        -  To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in both arms.

        -  To evaluate the Time To Progression (TTP) in both arms.

        -  To evaluate the Second Progression Free Survival (PFS2) in both arms.

        -  To determine the Pharmacokinetic profile of isatuximab in combination with carfilzomib.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of isatuximab in isatuximab arm.

        -  To assess disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life (HRQL), disease
           and treatment-related symptoms, health state utility, and health status in both arms.

      The duration of the study for the patients will include a period for screening of up to 3
      weeks. Patients will continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse
      reaction, patients' wish or other reason of discontinuation. During follow-up, patients who
      discontinue the study treatment due to progression of the disease will be followed every 3
      months (12 weeks) for further anti-myeloma therapies, progression free survival to the second
      progression and survival, until death or the cut-off date, whichever comes first. Patients
      who discontinue the study treatment prior to documentation of disease progression will be
      followed-up every 4 weeks until confirmation of disease progression, and then every 3 months
      (12 weeks) for further anti-myeloma therapies, progression free survival to the second
      progression and survival, until death or the cut-off date, whichever comes first. After
      progression free survival analysis, patients will be followed yearly for 3 years for
      survival.
