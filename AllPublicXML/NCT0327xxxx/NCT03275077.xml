  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Coagulopathy in chronic kidney disease is multifactorial. Both hypocoaguability
      and hypercoaguability are seen. Conventional tests of coagulation (CCTs) end at the formation
      of thrombin, and do not take into account the interaction of coagulation factors, platelets,
      RBC etc. By overcoming the above deficiencies, thromboelastography provides a holistic
      picture of blood coagulation. The present study evaluated the TEG profile of ESRD patients
      and compared it to CCTs and to controls.

      Methods: 50 ESRD patients and 50 controls were recruited for the study. Venous samples were
      withdrawn and platelet count, INR and fibrinogen levels were measured. Simultaneously a
      Thromboelastography was performed. All samples were drawn prior to initiation of dialysis.

    <measure>To compare the maximum amplitude on a thromboelastography in patients of chronic kidney disease stage 5 with normal controls.</measure>

    <measure>To correlate the maximum amplitude with platelet count and fibrinogen levels in patients of chronic kidney disease</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately following recruitmemt.</time_frame>
    <description>the maximum amplitude obtained on an thromboelastography denotes clot strength which depends on platelet count and fibrinogen levels. thus an attempt will be made to corelate these values with fibrinogen levels and platelet count.</description>

        A total of 100 patients were recruited for the study based on the above criteria.Following
        enrollment, patients were divided into two groups as follows Group 1(Control Group): 50
        patients who were healthy voluntary donors belonging to ASA PSI or ASA PSII Group 2(ESRD
        Group): 50 patients suffering from end stage renal disease i.e. CKD stage 5 (Defined by
        KDIGO 2012) who never received renal replacement therapy (RRT
