  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient care in Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP) requires a close and regular monitoring
      of the evolution of the estradiol rate. This monitoring allows the dose and duration of
      treatment to be accurately adjusted for each woman (every 24 or 48 hours) up to 10 to 15 days
      of treatment with gonadotrophins. Oestradiol (E2) is secreted by the growing ovarian
      follicles and reflects their growth and maturity. Its plasma dosage makes it possible to
      monitor the ovarian response to stimulation.

      This monitoring involves several constraints amongst which disruption of work life, stress,
      fatigue that can alter the response to treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to improve the comfort of patients already under severe stress, simplification of
      this monitoring is proposed. The development of an immediate-release whole blood test for
      simplified monitoring of estradiol levels will provide considerable comfort in the management
      of patients. These patients are subjected to significant emotional and physical stress and
      the development of this test will reduce the negative consequences that result.

    <description>The study is based on a concept using capillary blood tests using lateral flow by migration on membrane similarly to a pregnancy test, patented by a french company (NGBiotech).
This study is therefore a feasibility study of a rapid test for oestradiol dosage during monitoring of ovarian stimulation.</description>
