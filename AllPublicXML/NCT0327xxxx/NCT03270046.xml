      The purpose of this study is to compare the preparation quality by using Ottawa Bowel
      Preparation Scale between the standard PEG preparation and the addition of water enema in
      participants scheduled for CRC screening

      Background : Good bowel preparation improves the rate of polyp detection and the time of
      caecal intubation during colorectal cancer (CRC) screening.

      Suboptimal bowel preparation can results in adenoma miss rate up to 42% (95% CI, 35-49) and
      advanced adenoma miss rate up to 27% (95% CI, 17-41) The European Society of Gastrointestinal
      Endoscopy (ESGE) Guideline recommends a split regimen of 4L of polyethylene glycol (PEG)
      solution (or a same-day regimen in the case of afternoon colonoscopy) for a routine bowel
      preparation and the delay between the last dose of bowel preparation and colonoscopy should
      be minimized and no longer than 4 hours.

      The investigators hypothesize that the addition of water enema to the standard PEG bowel
      preparation could provide the better quality of bowel preparation and then result in
      improvement in the rate of adenoma detection among participants scheduled for CRC screening
      with preparation to procedure interval &gt; 8 hr.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the preparation quality using Ottawa Bowel
      Preparation Scale between the standard PEG preparation and the addition of water enema in
      participants scheduled for CRC screening. The secondary aim is to compare the effect of the
      standard PEG bowel preparation and the addition of water enema in terms of adenoma detection
      rate, the completeness of the examination, total and withdrawal time, safety and adverse
      events among those scheduled for CRC screening.

    <description>Consecutive participants will be randomly assigned to take a preparation regimen of 3 liter of PEG 8-16 hr. before colonoscopy without water enema.
Before the procedure, investigators record baseline parameters. Colonoscopies underwent by experienced endoscopists and by GI fellows. During the colonoscopy, the investigators recorded video, cecal intubation and withdraw time, amount and position of polyps, rate of complete examination and complication. The video was sent to other 2 endoscopists who did not known which participant was enema to evaluate the quality of bowel cleansing by using Ottawa bowel preparation scale and Likert scale for evaluation of side effect, complication during PEG ingestion, enema and colonoscopy, and participant satisfactory.</description>
