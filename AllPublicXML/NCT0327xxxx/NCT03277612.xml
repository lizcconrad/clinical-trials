      For this study, the investigators are enrolling women who are pregnant with their second
      child who are planning to have a planned C-section or a spontaneous vaginal birth after
      C-section. The investigators will see the pregnant mom at 36 weeks pregnant and then have the
      mom and the baby return for a visit at 2 weeks postnatal.
