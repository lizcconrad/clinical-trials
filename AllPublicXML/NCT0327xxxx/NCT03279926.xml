  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this proposal is to develop and test early childhood education
      setting-based physical activity (PA) interventions that are innovative by using wearable
      technology to facilitate monitoring, feedback and motivation for physical activity across
      multiple levels (child, parent, educator). We posit that our intervention strategies will
      promote behavior changes in parents and educators, leading to greater awareness and
      communication about physical activity, more active play opportunities, and ultimately more
      physical activity for preschoolers. In the R21, we will test the acceptability, feasibility
      and initial efficacy of three 6 month early childhood education setting- based, multi-level
      interventions to promote preschoolers' PA using wearable technology and additional behavior
      change techniques to engage educators and parents. The results of this study will inform a
      larger intervention trial.
