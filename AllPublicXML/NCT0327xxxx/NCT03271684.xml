      The effectiveness of the adapted Bridge's self-management programme in South African
      community-dwelling stroke survivors: A randomized controlled trial with two arms will be
      used, with the intervention group receiving self-management sessions delivered by experienced
      therapists and usual care and control group will only receive usual care which includes a
      information booklet.

    <textblock>
      This study aim to determine the effectiveness of the Adapted bridges self-management
      intervention on South African stroke patients' functional activity, self-efficacy, and
      participation. Method: This experimental study will make use of a randomized controlled
      design (RCT), consisting of one hundred and sixty eight stroke survivors recruited from
      different health care facilities within the Cape Metropolitan area. The study participants
      will be divided randomly into two groups, with one receiving the intervention - the
      experimental group - and the other receiving an educational booklet - the control group.
      Participants will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention (six weeks), three
      and sixth-month post intervention, using standardized outcome measures (both subjective
      outcome measures and objective clinical tools). Ethical clearance and permission to conduct
      the study will be obtained and patient information will be kept confidential. Analyses will
      be conducted using descriptive statistics of frequencies and percentages for categorical
      variables and mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. Given the assumptions of
      equal variance, a two-way full factorial ANOVA will be computed in order to assess
      interaction between groups and intervention type.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroke Self-Efficacy Questionnaire(SSEQ):</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The SSEQ is a 13 point questionnaire developed by Jones et al (2008) and is aimed to determine the individuals perceived level of self-efficacy in completing a range of relevant functional tasks, such as walking, getting comfortable in bed, as well as several self-management tasks</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Rivermead Mobility Index:</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>is a 15 point index with various topics and questions aimed at objectively determining the participant's mobility level. According to Lennon &amp; Johnson (2000) highly reliable between raters (ICC = 0.98, p &lt; 0.001) with high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rivermead Activities of Daily Living Scale:</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>is a 31 point scale used to determine the level of independence a participant has with self-care and household tasks of varying difficulty. It has an excellent overall test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.96) (Chen et al, 2007) and an excellent concurrent validity at 180 days post stroke (r = 0.93) (Hsueh et al, 2003).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mini-BESTest:</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>is a 14-item clinical test that covers four components of balance control (anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation and stability in gait). Each item is scored from 0 (unable or requiring help) to 2 (normal) and the maximal score is 28 points. The Mini-BESTest has an excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.96), with an excellent convergent validity (r = 0.96) (Godi et al, 2013).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Subjective Index of Physical and Social Outcome scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>a 10 point rating index aimed at determining the participants' perceived extent of participation within the community, with its main domains as perceived functioning and social connectedness. SIPSO has been shown to present an excellent test-retest reliability with ICC = 0.96 and has indicated a proven validity (Trigg &amp; Wood, 2003).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>National Institute for Health Stroke Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>is a 15 item neurologic examination that provides a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. According to Kasner et al, (1999) reliability Agreement between pairs of raters was also very good to excellent, with ICCs ranging from 0.70 to 0.89.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Action Research Arm Test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>is a 19 item scale divided into four subscales: grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement. The items within each subscale are arranged on a 4-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 3, with 3 indicating normal performance on each item. The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points According to McDonnell, 2008 Inter-rater and retest reliability have been shown to be high (ICC &gt; 0.98) in studies involving patients with stroke and Concurrent validity has been confirmed by comparison with the upper limb component of the Fugl- Meyer Assessment and the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to the 6 months after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Functional ability will be assessed using the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), a reliable and valid measure for the stroke population. Participants will be instructed to walk at a comfortable pace on a 30-m measured walkway for 6 minutes. The outcome will be the total distance covered during testing. 6MWT exhibits excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.973; 95 % CI = 0.925 to 0.988), it presents a minimal detectable change of 54.1 m, and an acceptable concurrent validity (r = 0.52 to 0.89) (Fulk et al, 2008).</description>

These behaviors include enabling patients to work out ways of taking control of their daily lives by setting small targets, recording their progress and problem-solving. The content of the sessions is determined by the patient and their personal goals rather than being professionally directed</description>
