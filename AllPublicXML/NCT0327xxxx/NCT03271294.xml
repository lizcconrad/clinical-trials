  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to assess the role of the Exair transvaginal mesh system to correct
      pelvic organ prolapse from a subjective and objective standpoint. Subjects treated with the
      Exair transvaginal mesh for prolapse between June 2013 and August 2015 was analyzed. Subjects
      with uterine prolapse underwent vaginal mesh hysteropexy. There were no hysterectomies done
      for uterine prolapse in this study. A composite score that included subjective criteria of
      absence of a bothersome bulge, no prolapse below the hymen and no retreatment was used to
      assess success.Transvaginal Exair mesh hysteropexy offers a good option for the management of
      large uterine prolapses precluding the need for a hysterectomy.

    <description>Subjects who underwent the Exair transvaginal mesh surgery were followed post-operatively to determine mesh procedure success at 12 months. A composite score that included subjective criteria of absence of a bothersome bulge, no prolapse below the hymen and no retreatment was used to assess success. Subjects treated with the Exair transvaginal mesh for prolapse between June 2013 and August 2015 was analyzed. The aim of the study was to assess the role of the Exair transvaginal mesh system to correct pelvic organ prolapse from a subjective and objective standpoint.</description>

    <description>This is a prospective study done in 80 consecutive subjects who underwent the Exair transvaginal mesh surgery from June 2013 to August 2015. The subjects were followed at 4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively. All eligible subjects underwent a detailed urogynecologic history and examination including a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system assessment (POP-Q).</description>
