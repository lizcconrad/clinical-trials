  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate the impact and the related mechanism of
      metformin treatment on cognitive impairment of schizophrenia co-morbid metabolic syndrome
      (Sch-MetS). The study will recruit 40 Sch-MetS patients, 40 patients with schizophrenia only,
      and 40 patients with schizophrenia and higher risk factors for MetS. Then these patients will
      be randomized to metformin group or non-metformin control group (20 patients per arm) for 24
      weeks clinic trial. Clinical assessment will be done at screen/baseline, 4 week, 12 weeks and
      24 week. The specific aims are to compare metformin group versus controls on: 1) clinical
      core symptoms; 2) cognition. Biological samples also will be collected, and stored to
      research related mechanisms.

      In this study, the investigators will investigate the impact and the related mechanism of
      metformin treatment on cognitive impairment of schizophrenia co-morbid metabolic syndrome
      (Sch-MetS). The study will recruit 40 Sch-MetS patients, 40 patients with schizophrenia but
      without MetS, and 40 patients with schizophrenia and higher risk factors for MetS. Then these
      patients will be randomized to metformin group or non-metformin control group (20 patients
      per arm) for 12 weeks clinic trial. Clinical assessment will be done at screen/baseline, 4
      week, 12 week and 24 week. The specific aims are to compare metformin group versus controls
      on: 1) clinical core symptoms; 2) cognition. Biological samples also will be collected, and
      stored to research related mechanisms. Clinical symptoms will be measured by the Positive and
      Negative Syndrome Scale, and Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (Chinese version).
      Cognitive function will be assessed by the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery.

      The investigators hypothesize that 1) metformin may improve cognitive impairment of patients
      with Sch-MetS; 2) metformin could prevent cognitive decline of patients with schizophrenia
      only and patients with schizophrenia and higher risk factors for MetS; 3) metformin may alter
      oxidative stress indexes or inflammatory biomarkers thus influence the oxidative and
      inflammatory mechanism, and the structure and function of hippocampus that may be
      significantly associated with cognitive function.
