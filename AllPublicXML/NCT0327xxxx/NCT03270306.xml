      This case-control study aims to compare the differences in eating behaviours, nutritional
      status, diet quality and gastrointestinal (GI) health between Chinese children aged 3-6 years
      with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (n=65) and typically developing children (TDC) (n=65).

      Objective: To compare the differences in eating behaviours, nutritional status, diet quality
      and gastrointestinal (GI) health between Chinese children aged 3-6 years with autism spectrum
      disorders (ASD) and typically developing children (TDC).

      Hypotheses:

        1. Children with ASD will show more problematic mealtime behaviours as represented by
           higher scores of 'limited variety' and 'food refusal' domains of the BAMBI compared to
           typically developing children

        2. Children with ASD will have more GI symptoms, in particular constipation and diarrhea
           compared to typically developing children

        3. Children with ASD will have a lower ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes than the
           typical control children

        4. Children with ASD will have less desirable diet quality in terms of lower dietary index,
           lower dietary diversity score and lower intake of fibre, iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin
           C compared to typically developing children

        5. A better diet quality will be associated with a more favourable gut microbial
           composition in children with and without ASD

      Design and subjects: Case-control study including 65 families with children of ASD and 65
      families with TDC matched by child's age and sex.

      Outcomes: The primary outcomes will be the difference in mean scores of 'limited variety' and
      'food refusal' domains of the Chinese version of BAMBI between children with ASD and
      typically developing children. The secondary outcomes will be the difference in the
      occurrence of GI symptoms in terms of constipation and diarrhea, as well as the difference in
      the gut microbiota profile in terms of the Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes ratio between children
      with ASD and typically developing children. The tertiary outcome will be the difference in
      the diet quality in terms of lower dietary index, lower dietary diversity score and lower
      intake of fibre, iron, calcium, zinc and vitamin C in children with ASD and typically
      developing children.

        Sixty five families with children of ASD of Chinese origin aged between 3 and 6 years and
        65 control families with typically developing children matched by child's age (within 6
        months) and sex will be recruited through invitation letters using a convenience sampling
        method in nurseries and kindergartens, in particular those with integrated programmes for
        ASD children. Some other possible channels for recruiting families with ASD children will
        include non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and some ASD family supporting groups.

        Inclusion Criteria for Cases:

        Families with their children diagnosed with ASD by paediatrician or clinical psychologist
        according to the standard of the fourth or fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
        Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV or DSM-V) will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria for Cases:

        Families will be excluded if their children have the following conditions.

          -  Diagnosed with chronic seizures

          -  Suffered from recent infection 1-month prior to data and sample collection

          -  With diseases or disorders that affect dietary/physical activity habits (e.g.
             diabetes, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy)

          -  Usage of antibiotics and antifungal medications 1-month prior to data and sample
             collection

          -  Currently participating or have recently participated (i.e. 1-month prior to data and
             sample collection) in any trials or dietary intervention programs

          -  With other major medical or psychological illness, as judged by the investigators as
             ineligible to participate

        Inclusion Criteria for Controls:

        Families with typically developing children matched by child's age (i.e. within 6 months of
        age) and sex will be included. Children without ASD, delays in motor and language
        development, as well as behaviors as reported by their parents, and those do not have
        first-degree relatives with ASD will be included. Parents will also be asked to complete
        the Chinese validated version of Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS). For children who are
        screened with positive results, they will be further assessed by a developmental
        pediatrician to ascertain the autistic status. Only those who are screened negative, or
        those who are screened positive but subsequently ascertained by the developmental
        pediatrician being free from autistic symptoms will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria for Controls:

        The exclusion criteria will be same as those for the families with children of ASD.
