  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of pneumonia remains difficult in intensive care unit (ICU), notably after cardiac
      surgery. Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been successfully used for diagnosis of pneumonia,
      but its usefulness and reliability was never evaluated after cardiac surgery. This study
      investigates the clinical relevance of LUS for pneumonia diagnoses in cardiac ICU.

    <description>Pneumonia or excluded pneumonia, was determined by consensus of 3 investigators, after an independent post hoc review of the medical records. Pneumonia diagnosis was based on concordance of clinical and radiological criteria (≥ 2 criteria including fever&gt; 38.5 ° C or T &lt;36 ° C, leukocytosis&gt; 10 ^ 9 / L or leukopenia &lt;4.10 ^ 8 / L, purulent tracheal secretions and the appearance or persistence of an infiltrate on the CXR).
It should be confirmed by culture of a respiratory specimen: protected distal sampling with a threshold of significance ≥ 10 ^ 3 colony forming unit/mL or bronchoalveolar lavage with a threshold of significance ≥ 10 ^ 4 CFU/mL.</description>

    <description>Patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) less than 72 hours after a major cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass
ARF was defined as one of the following conditions:
If mechanical ventilation, a partial pressure of oxygen/ inspired oxygen fraction ratio (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 200, or failure of weaning (failure of spontaneous ventilation test, re-intubation in the first 24 hours), or need for non-invasive ventilation immediately after extubation,
If spontaneous ventilation: clinical signs of acute respiratory distress (dyspnea at least exertion, cyanosis, polypnea&gt; 25/min, upper or intercostal swallowing, abdominal swing ...), pulse oximetry (SpO2) &lt; 90% or PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg despite oxygen therapy ≥ 3 L/min.</description>
