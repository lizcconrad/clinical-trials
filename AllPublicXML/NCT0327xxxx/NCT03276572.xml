  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open−label, single−center Phase I dose escalation study designed to determine the
      dose−limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 225Ac−J591 in a single
      dose regimen.

      This clinical trial is for men with advanced prostate cancer. The purpose of this study is to
      find the highest dose level of the study drug, 225Ac-J591 that can be given without severe
      side effects. The research study is being done because the standard treatments for prostate
      cancer that has spread beyond the prostate gland are intended to minimize the adverse effects
      of the disease. These treatments, however, are not curative. Patients who choose to
      participate in this study will have a screening visit to determine whether or not they are
      eligible to participate in the study. The treatment phase is comprised of 8 visits over
      approximately 12 weeks. The study medication is called 225Ac-J591, and participants will
      receive an infusion of the study drug on the Treatment visit of the study. During the other
      study visits, participants will undergo routine tests and procedures, such as physical
      examinations, and routine blood tests. Some blood tests will be done for research purposes
      only, and participants will also undergo a research PET/CT scan at screening and end of
      study. After completion of therapy, participants may be contacted on a periodic basis to see
      how they are doing.

      Key eligibility:

        -  Open to men age 18 and older.

        -  Diagnosis of progressive metastatic prostate cancer

        -  Have been previously treated for their disease with particular types of therapy.
