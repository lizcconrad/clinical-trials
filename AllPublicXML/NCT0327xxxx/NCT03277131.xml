      The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of DURAFIBER Ag and to assess how many
      bacteria are present in infected wounds over an 8 week period.

      DURAFIBER Ag is a commercially available absorbent, non-woven, silver-containing
      antimicrobial dressing for use on a variety of exuding wounds and is widely used in routine
      clinical practice within the UK.

      The primary outcome will be the quantitative reduction in bacterial load, based on a wound
      biopsy, from baseline to week 8. Secondary objectives will include the quantitative reduction
      in bacterial load, based on biopsy, from initial assessment to week 4, and the
      semi-quantitative reduction in bacterial load, based on swab analysis, from baseline to weeks
      4 and 8. Additionally dressing performance measures will be assessed as well as all adverse
      events and device deficiencies.

      In total 20 evaluable participants with an infected venous leg ulcer will be recruited into
      the trial. All participants will have their wound dressed using DURAFIBER Ag and will be
      followed-up for 8 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria to be confirmed at the initial assessment

          -  The subject or must provide written informed consent.

          -  Subjects must be at least eighteen (18) years of age.

          -  Willing and able to make all required study visits.

          -  Able to follow instructions.

          -  Subjects must have a VLU, an ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) taken within the
             last 28 days of 0.8-1.3, and must be treated with compression therapy.

          -  The subject must have a wound with an area ≥ 2cm².

          -  The subject's wound must have moderate or high exudate levels.

          -  The subject's reference wound must, in the opinion of the Healthcare Professional,
             show signs of infection warranting treatment with DURAFIBER Ag.

          -  In the clinician's opinion the subject's wound has an initial bacterial count of &gt; 104
             cfu/g (which will be confirmed following the initial wound biopsy).

        Inclusion criteria to be confirmed when the biopsy result is recorded:

        -The subject's wound has a confirmed initial bacterial count of &gt; 104 cfu/g

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the DURAFIBER Ag, ancillary
             products or their components (e.g. known sensitivity to silver).

          -  Participation in the treatment period of another clinical trial within thirty (30)
             days of the date of consent.

          -  Subjects with skin features (e.g. tattoos, skin colour, pre-existing scarring) which,
             in the opinion of the Investigator, will interfere with the study assessments.

          -  Subjects receiving topical antimicrobials or oil-based products (such as petrolatum)
             at the reference wound surface.

          -  Subjects being treated with immunosuppressive drugs or corticosteroids.

          -  Subjects who have participated previously in this clinical trial and who have healed
             or been withdrawn.

          -  Subjects with a known history of poor compliance with medical treatment.

          -  Subjects with a medical or physical condition that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would preclude safe subject participation in the study.
