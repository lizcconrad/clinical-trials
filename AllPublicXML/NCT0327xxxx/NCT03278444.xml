      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of arginine hydrochloride
      combined with trimetazidine hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the second leading cause
      of cancer-related deaths in the world. Because HCC is insidious and early diagnosis is
      difficult, most patients have locally advanced or distant metastasis at the time of
      diagnosis. So they are not suitable candidates for curative treatments by resection or
      transplantation. Currently, Sorafenib is the only choice approved by FDA for advanced HCC,
      although it prolongs the survival for less than 3 months. Recently, metabolomics studies of
      HCC have shown that typical Warburg effect was observed in hepatoma carcinoma cells. Arginine
      hydrochloride is a new anticancer drug in the treatment of liver cancer, which is mainly
      aimed at the pathway of energy metabolism. Trimetazidine hydrochloride may play an anti-tumor
      role by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation. The investigators have been proceeding this trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of arginine hydrochloride combined with trimetazidine
      hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
