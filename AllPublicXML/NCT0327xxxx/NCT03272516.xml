  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is done to evaluate the effects of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for
      primary care patients that have mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety. Half of
      the study participants will receive treatment as usual (TAU), and the other half will receive
      TAU plus MBCT. The investigators will be comparing changes in symptoms of depression and
      anxiety between the groups, and hypothesize that the TAU plus MBCT group will have
      significantly lower symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to TAU group
      post-intervention

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients that show mild to moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety are common in the
      primary care setting. These patients are often treated with antidepressant or anxiolytic
      medication instead of cognitive therapy, which is the first choice of treatment according to
      clinical guidelines in Iceland. Although these patients are often referred to cognitive
      therapy, there are long waiting lists for group therapy and personal therapy is expensive.
      MBCT has been shown to have good effects on people with recurrent depression and on patients
      suffering from anxiety. Therefore, the investigators main objective is to assess whether MBCT
      is applicable and effective in the primary care setting for patients with mild symptoms of
      anxiety and depression and compare it´s effect to TAU.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized clinical trial, where patients are randomized to two groups. Group 1 receives treatment as usual, group 2 receives treatment as usual plus Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for symptoms of mild to moderate depression or anxiety.
Our primary aim is to investigate whether MBCT added to TAU is more effective than TAU alone in reducing mild to moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety among primary care patients.
Our secondary aim is to investigate whether MBCT added to TAU is more effective than TAU alone in:
Increasing subjective wellbeing
Reducing antidepressant/anxiolytica use for primary care patients, with mild to moderate symptoms of depression and/or anxiety.</intervention_model_description>
