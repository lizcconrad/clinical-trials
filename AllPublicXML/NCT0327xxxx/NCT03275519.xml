  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypospadias is a common condition where the opening of the penis is not located at the tip,
      but along the underside of the penis. It is estimated to occur in 1/300 live male births,
      making it one of the most common birth defects. Degrees of hypospadias ranged from minor to
      severe depending on the location of the opening. Surgical repair is often required and
      involves placement of a catheter for the urine to drain with known urinary colonization found
      on prior retrospective studies. The current practice of using preventative antibiotics as
      long as the catheter is in place is conflicting with resent studies that show antibiotics may
      not be necessary to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

      The purpose of this study was to see how common symptomatic UTIs were after hypospadias
      repair surgery; and to see whether routine antibiotic use after surgery affected the rate of
      UTIs. Subjects were randomized to either receive antibiotics or no antibiotics after distal
      hypospadias repair. The research coordinator made follow-up phone calls with the family and
      the primary care provider (PCP) after stent removal, 30 days post surgery and after the 3
      month post surgical visit.

      Males undergoing distal hypospadias repair involving stent placement were randomized to
      either receive or not to receive antibiotics post-operative. All subjects did not receive
      intra-operative antibiotics. Routine follow-up included having the stent removed one week
      post-op and a return visit at 3 months. The research nurse made follow-up phone calls to the
      family or the (PCP) one week after the stent was removed and at one month post-op to see how
      things were going with the child and again after teh 3 month post surgical visit, if the
      subject did not return after multiple rescheduling attempts.

    <description>Surgical site infections (SSIs) are measured using physical assessments at the stent removal visit. Complications of hypospadias repair (urethral fistula, meatal stenosis, dehiscence, and diverticulum) are measured using physical assessments at the stent removal visit and/or contact with the family or the PCP office 1 week after the stent removal; at the 30 day post operative time point; and at the 3 month follow-op visit.</description>
