  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although colonoscopy with polypectomy can prevent up to 80% of colorectal cancers, a
      significant adenoma miss rate still exists, particularly in the right colon. Optimizing the
      detection of adenomas and sessile serrated lesions in the right colon is crucial to increase
      the effectiveness of colonoscopy in colorectal cancer prevention.

      Last generation Fuji videocolonscopes incorporates the Linked Color Imaging (LCI), a recently
      developed technology that differentiates the red colour spectrum more effectively than White
      Light imaging thanks to its optimal pre-process composition of light spectrum and advanced
      signal processing. The increased colour contrast results in more accurate delineation of
      abnormal inflammatory or neoplastic findings of colonic mucosa. Preliminary data suggest that
      LCI may be improve the detection of neoplastic lesion of colon.

      The investigators performe a tandem prospective study to compare the right colon adenoma miss
      rates of LCI colonoscopy with those of conventional white light colonoscopy.

      Therefore participants scheduled for colonoscopy for the assessment of symptoms or for
      colorectal cancer screening/surveillance receive the examination of the right colon twice, in
      a back to back fashion, with standard white light (WL) and with LCI. Patients are randomly
      assigned (1:1), via computer-generated randomisation with block size of 20, to which
      procedure is done first. The endoscopist are masked to group allocation until immediately
      before the cecum is reached. Examinations are performed with Fuji videocolonscopes series 700
      (EC-760R, EC-760ZP).
