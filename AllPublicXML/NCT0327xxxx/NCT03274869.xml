  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scrub typhus infection has been considered as seasonal and endemic infectious disorder with
      benign feature. However, the increasing mortality rate of scrub typhus has been recently
      reported in Southeast Asia and cause of death could be a fetal complicating cardiovascular
      disease. Therefore, the association and predictors for scrub typhus induced cardiovascular
      disease should be investigated to provide a timely and appropriate diagnosis and to reduce
      the mortality rate of complicated scrub typhus infection. Therefore, we prospectively
      investigate the association and predictors of cardiovascular disease in patients with scrub
      typhus infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scrub typhus is a zoonotic disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi confined to East Asia
      including South Korea. It is characterized by fever, headache, rash, and eschar and the
      majority of patients without complications can recover with an early diagnosis and proper
      management with antibiotics. However, the increasing mortality rate of scrub typhus has been
      recently reported in Southeast Asia. Severe complications can be manifested by respiratory
      distress syndrome, renal failure, hepatic failure, and cardiovascular disease. Especially,
      cardiovascular complications can lead to cardiogenic shock and sudden cardiac arrest.
      Therefore, the association and predictors for scrub typhus induced cardiovascular disease
      should be investigated to provide a timely and appropriate diagnosis and to reduce the
      mortality rate of complicated scrub typhus infection. Therefore, we prospectively investigate
      the association and predictors of cardiovascular disease in patients with scrub typhus
      infection admitted to 3rd referral centers in South Korea.
