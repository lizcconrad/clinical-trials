  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover
      clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of dietary supplementation with Bifidobacterium
      infantis NLS super strain among celiac disease patients on a gluten-free who have persistent
      gastrointestinal symptoms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with celiac disease demonstrate substantial clinical improvement during the
      first few weeks after the onset of the consumption of a gluten-free diet. However, between
      30-50% of patients with celiac disease have persistent gastrointestinal symptoms despite
      consuming a gluten-free diet and presenting negative antibodies. It has recently been
      reported that celiac disease patients treated with a gluten-free diet that still have
      persistent symptoms possess different intestinal microbiota patterns than patients without
      persistent symptoms. Furthermore, a pilot study showed that dietary supplementation with
      probiotics (Bifidobacterium infantis NLS super strain - Natren LIFESTART®) in untreated
      celiac disease patients was associated with a significant improvement in symptoms as compared
      to placebo. Collectively, these findings contribute to the hypothesis that celiac disease
      patients on a gluten-free diet in whom gastrointestinal symptoms persist may benefit from the
      supplementation of Bifidobacterium infantis NLS super strain.

      Participants in this double-blinded crossover trial will be randomized to receive either
      placebo or Bifidobacterium infantis NLS super strain for 3 weeks, followed by a 2 week
      washout period, and then followed by 3 weeks of the other of either placebo or probiotic
      supplementation.
