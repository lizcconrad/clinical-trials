  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback is an increasingly researched technique for the treatment of many psychological
      disorders, such as attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (AD / HD), depression, or
      substance abuse. This technique would allow patients to regulate their cortical
      electroencephalographic activity while receiving a visual or auditory feedback on the
      cortical electroencephalographic activity. Changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) would
      thus be correlated with changes in cortical activity and thus with symptoms.

      On the electroencephalographic plane, the depression appears associated with relatively more
      alpha activity (in &quot;resting state&quot;, 8-13 Hz) in left than in right frontal cortex. This
      difference in alpha activity between frontal regions is known as alpha asymmetry in
      depression. As a reminder, increased alpha activity indicates a decrease in cortical
      activation. This alpha asymmetry appears to be associated with a decrease in sensitivity to
      reward.

      It is on these bases that the modification of the alpha asymmetry has become one of the most
      frequent objectives of the studies on the use of neurofeedback in depression.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) also offers a non-invasive and painless method of
      effective cerebral stimulation in psychiatric disorders and especially depression. It
      received a favorable opinion from the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States
      for the treatment of this pathology. This treatment is still under evaluation in France. The
      results are promising but improvements must be done to increase its effectiveness.

      TMS offers stimulation of brain tissue in a localized and non-invasive manner. The principle
      consists of a brief electric current passing through a coil which generates a transient
      magnetic field inducing an electric field through conductive fabrics. TMS modifies neuronal
      activity in target superficial brain structures, but also modulates neuronal circuit
      activity.

      In recent years, the concept of &quot;state dependency TMS&quot; has been developed. It suggests that
      the activation state of neuronal circuits before and after stimulation alters the effect of
      stimulation. Thus, the efficacy of TMS could be amplified in depression by taking into
      account the cerebral activity during the stimulation sessions, in particular on the
      electroencephalographic plane.

      However, TMS may also help patients increase their EEG response during Neurofeedback
      sessions.

      The combination of stimulation techniques and brain-machine interfaces such as neurofeedback
      is still little studied at present.

      A study on the combined use of TMS and Neurofeedback by EEG in depression would therefore be
      an innovative approach and in line with the latest data from the literature.

      Design : Prospective, monocentric, non-randomized, non-comparative, unblinded study.

      Primary objective : To demonstrate a decrease in the intensity of depressive symptomatology
      following EEG-neurofeedback training in association with TMS and see if there is a
      correlation with a change in frontal asymmetry.

      Secondary objective : To demonstrate a cognitive improvement in patients with respect to
      motivation and control of thoughts, as well as perceived health, self-esteem and anxiety
      following EEG-neurofeedback training in association with TMS and to see if there is a
      correlation between the change in scores on psychometric scales with a change in frontal
      asymmetry.

      The expected outcomes of this study are:

        -  Better characterization of the pathophysiological processes involved in depressive
           disorder;

        -  An evaluation of the effectiveness of EEG-Neurofeedback training in recurrent depressive
           disorder in association with TMS, both emotionally and cognitively;

        -  The development of innovative technologies in the field of brain-machine interfaces and
           optimization of procedures.
