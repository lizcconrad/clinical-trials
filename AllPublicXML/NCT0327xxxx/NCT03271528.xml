  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial that will test
      the effect of lacosamide on alcohol self-administration and craving following a priming dose
      of alcohol. The specific objective of this proposal is to determine whether lacosamide, a
      novel anticonvulsant that is FDA-approved for treating partial seizures, has effects on
      alcohol consumption.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present proposal is intended to answer the call for accelerating drug development by
      exploring the potential of a novel anticonvulsant, lacosamide as a candidate medication for
      the treatment of AUD. This drug, which is approved for the treatment of seizure disorders,
      has unique pharmacological actions that include enhancement of slow sodium channel
      inactivation and inhibition of collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2). Alcohol
      consumption in mice that had knockdown of CRMP-2 within the nucleus accumbens was decreased
      from levels seen in control animals. In rodent studies, lacosamide administration has
      produced reductions in 'excessive' drinking and has experimentally-induced decreased
      expression of the CRMP-2 protein. These findings implicate CRMP-2 as playing a role in the
      regulation of alcohol consumption. None of the FDA-approved AUD medications or medications
      commonly used off-label to treat AUD target this CRMP-2 pathway, making lacosamide a
      promising compound for AUD drug development. The aims of this study are to: 1) test the
      effects of lacosamide on alcohol self-administration and craving, 2) test the effects of 5
      days of lacosamide administration on cognitive function, and 3) test the effects of
      lacosamide on alcohol consumption and craving during a 8-day period of exposure. The effects
      of 8-days of locasamide (300mg) or placebo will be evaluated in a human laboratory using an
      alcohol self-administration methodology. In this within-subjects crossover design, heavy
      drinkers (N=28) will be randomized to the order of exposure (lacosamide or placebo) prior to
      completing two alcohol self-administration trials. Subjects will receive a priming drink of
      alcohol and will have access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a 2-hour period. The investigators
      anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol during an alcohol self-administration
      trial when receiving lacosamide compared to when they are receiving placebo. Significant
      lacosamide-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol self-administered will be considered
      to be an indication that this drug may have value as an AUD medication. This study may
      provide a rationale for phase II clinical studies testing lacosamide with a treatment-seeking
      AUD population. These results should also help to spur further pre-clinical investigation
      into the role play by CRMP-2 in regulating both alcohol consumption and alcohol seeking
      behaviors.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol consumption will be measured by using a graduated cylinder to determine the amount of alcohol given to the subject that was not consumed. This outcome will be measured as standard drink units. A standard drink contains approximately 0.6 fluid ounces of pure alcohol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Cravings</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol craving will be measured by self report with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a straight line with one end meaning no alcohol craving and the other end meaning intense alcohol craving. The Participant marks a point on the line that matches their amount of alcohol craving.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol Urge</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Alcohol Urge questionnaire (AUQ) is an 8 item measure of self-reported urges to drink in human laboratory studies that assesses the participant's urge for an alcoholic drink at the time the questionnaire is completed, Questions are in the form of a 7-point Likert scale (from strongly disagree to strongly disagree) and participants select the extent to which they disagree or agree with the 8 statements relating to desire to drink, expectation of a desired outcome from drinking, and inability to avoid drinking if alcohol was available. Lower scores are associated with less urge for an alcoholic drink.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Verbal Fluency</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Controlled Word Association (COWAT) is a verbal fluency test that measures spontaneous production of words belonging to the same category or beginning with some designated letter. The participant is asked to name words beginning with a letter, excluding proper nouns, for one minute and this procedure is repeated three times. The most commons letters used are FAS because of their frequency in the English language. The examiner writes down the words provided by the participant on a piece of paper. It usually takes 5-10 minutes. The more words, the subject generates, the better the fluency.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-5) Spatial and Digit Span tests will be used to assess subjects' working memory. Subjects will be asked to repeat back an increasing number of digits. Higher scores are indicative of higher levels of working memory and lower scores are indicative of lesser working memory function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol craving at titration</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used to assess alcohol craving during the medication titration period. The VAS is a 10 cm straight line with one end meaning no alcohol craving and the other end meaning intense alcohol craving. The Participant marks a point on the line that matches their amount of alcohol craving. The point is measured from baseline (mm) to yield a scale score between 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive aspects of alcohol craving</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) is a quick and reliable 14 item self-rating instrument that provides a total and two subscale scores (obsessive and compulsive) that measure some cognitive aspects of alcohol &quot;craving&quot;. Each item is scored from 0 to 4 with lower scores indicating less obsessive or compulsive drinking.</description>
