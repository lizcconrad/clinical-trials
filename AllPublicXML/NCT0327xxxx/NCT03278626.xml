    <textblock>
      In this multi-institution phase I/II trial, the investigators have chosen paclitaxel and
      carboplatin using a schedule and doses identical to those used in the CROSS trial. Following
      a run-in with nivolumab alone at 240 mg IVPB every 2 weeks for 2 doses, nivolumab at 240 mg
      every 2 weeks will be added to paclitaxel and carboplatin, which will be dosed according to
      the standard of care established by the CROSS trial: paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks
      and carboplatin AUC 2 weekly for 6 weeks. Concurrent radiation will be administered with
      chemotherapy at 1.8 Gy/fraction × 28 fractions to a total dose of 50.4 Gy, the standard
      radiation dose administered in the United States for trimodality therapy that includes
      concurrent therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. A decrease in dose to 41.4 Gy per the
      protocol established by van Hagen, et al. will be permitted before discontinuing therapy due
      to unacceptable toxicity. While the CROSS study administered only 5 weekly doses of
      chemotherapy during the 5 weeks of radiation, the higher dose of 50.4 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction ×28
      fractions over 5½ weeks) utilized in this study permits for a sixth dose during the
      additional week of radiation.

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or

             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          -  As there is potential for hepatic toxicity with nivolumab or nivolumab non-drugs with
             a predisposition to hepatoxicity should be used with caution in patients treated with
             nivolumab-containing regimen.
