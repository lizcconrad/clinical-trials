    <textblock>
      This project will examine the impact of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes in a
      complex tobacco and nicotine product marketplace. We will compare the number of cigarettes
      smoked, use of alternative nicotine-containing products, biomarkers of toxicant exposure and
      days abstinence from cigarettes in an experimental marketplace that contains VLNC cigarettes
      versus normal nicotine content (NNC) cigarettes.

      This randomized, open label, controlled, multi-site study will simulate a &quot;real world&quot;
      tobacco environment by providing participants access to an experimental marketplace where
      they will be given vouchers for a specified number of points that can be exchanged for study
      cigarettes (varying in nicotine content described below) and non-combusted tobacco/nicotine
      products (smokeless tobacco, snus, electronic cigarette, medicinal nicotine replacement) or
      cash. More specifically, subjects (N=350 in each group) will be randomly assigned to: 1) very
      low nicotine content cigarettes (VLNC; 0.4 mg/g) along with non-combusted tobacco/nicotine
      products or 2) normal nicotine content cigarettes (NNC; 15.8 mg/g) along with non-combusted
      tobacco/nicotine products.

      Smokers will undergo an orientation visit for screening and then enter a three phase
      experimental trial:

        1. Phase 1 - Baseline: Two week baseline assessment period during usual brand cigarette
           smoking.

        2. Phase 2 - Marketplace Adaptation: Two week period where subjects have access to the
           marketplace that provides their preferred usual brand cigarettes and selected
           non-combusted tobacco products to allow the subject to adjust to the marketplace prior
           to randomization;

        3. Phase 3 - Intervention: Randomization to a marketplace with access to either VLNC or NNC
           cigarettes plus non-combusted products for a 12 week period.

      Biomarker samples are collected at baseline, end of Phase 2 and end of week 12 (Phase 3).

    <intervention_model_description>Phase III randomized, open label, multi-center study that will examine the impact of very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes using an experimental marketplace that contains and nicotine products, simulating a real world environment. There are three phases: Phase 1 is smoking usual brand cigarettes. Phase 2 is access to a marketplace with usual brand cigarettes and other non-combusted nicotine and tobacco products. Phase 3 involves access to a marketplace with study cigarettes and other non-combusted nicotine and tobacco products.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>Intend to share findings from this research through publications and presentations. Institutions and individuals wishing to access any resources or data must contact the Principal Investigator (Hatsukami). Data will be available in two formats. One will be a summary of the data, with graphs and tables, posted as pdf files and as raw individual-level data for analysis. Data generated by this grant will be made to outside investigators, according to NIH Guidance. When data are shared, there will be no limits placed on how the data will be used. Users will agree, however, that the recipient must not transfer the data to other users and that the data are only to be used for research purposes. A record of transfer of data and a copy of the dataset that was distributed will be kept by University of Minnesota.</ipd_description>
