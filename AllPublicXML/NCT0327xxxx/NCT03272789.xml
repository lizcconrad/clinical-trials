  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes, certain patients, while the treatment comes to an end and while a remission is
      possible, present psychological and emotional difficulties. The return in a &quot; new life &quot; is
      lived as a factor of often unexpected stress which force the patients, from the end of the
      treatment, to reconsider their future orientation, their roles and social identities, their
      interpersonal relations, and the quality of their life.

      Often, they feel a strong feeling of isolation and a shape of social marginalization stressed
      by the fact that forgiveness lead automatically to a spacing of the stays to the hospital,
      which were for them a source of social interactions. Often incapable to deal with these
      negative emotional situations, they live profound depressive episodes known to be associated
      to a lesser survival.

      The investigators think that a support of type onco-coaching of sport- inspirated could allow
      these survivors to find a certain quality of life to see certain well-being.

      In a recent study, It was analyzed the leadership &quot; which works &quot; in the high-level sport in
      France. Five selectors of national teams of team sports were questioned about their
      conceptions on the best practices of management and management of the people. They grant a
      quite particular attention on the individual consideration of the athlete and the
      implementation of a relationship of trust, to the delegation of the power and the sharing
      regulated by the decision-making which strengthen the sportsman in a feeling of autonomy and
      skill, catalysts of an intrinsic motivation.

      These needs were satisfied, they give meaning to the share and get a psychological
      well-being. The satisfaction of these needs is generally made through the realization of
      purposes, results wished by an action, which can sometimes enter in contradiction with the
      satisfaction of the fundamental needs and thus damage the well-being. The role of the coach
      is to help the coached to target its purposes, to decide on a strategy to affect him and keep
      an intact motivation throughout the process. Without being therapeutic, the questioning and
      the action of the coach would allow the coached to reach gradually the satisfaction of its
      fundamental psychological needs and thus a real well-being.

      The intention is to make them benefit knowledge and expertise in the field of the coaching
      and by a logic of research inter disciplinary to set up steps of support individualized to
      propose adapted answers and assist them at best in their company on returning to the life by
      making a significant contribution with the patients to help them to find of the autonomy in
      their own decision-making, to find their social identity (refusal and discharge of positive
      or negative discrimination), to accompany the therapeutic education of the patient towards a
      stake in social reeducation and finally, to highlight and to strengthen its interests and
      social concerns.

      In terms of public health, this approach, facilitating the transition of the treatment in the
      complete remission, could be subjected and so improve the quality of the services of support
      proposed until then.

      If the hypotheses of research see each other confirmed, this device coaching of
      sport-inspired of the patients in remission could then be transferable in other oncologic
      fields.
