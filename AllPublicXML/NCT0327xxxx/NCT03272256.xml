             existing conventional therapies.

          4. Patients with a measurable or evaluable lesion by the RECIST v1.1 [for patients with
             recurrent glioblastoma, the RANO guideline is applied].

          5. Patients with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or

             (In case of hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL, the patient can be enrolled if the value is
             reversed to ≥ 9.0 g/dL. However, blood transfusion to meet this criterion within 1
             week is not allowed.)

             ② Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal (ULN)

             ③ Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X UNL, AST, ALT ≤ 3 ×ULN (for patients with liver disease ≤ 5
             ×ULN)

             ④ Fasting serum glucose ≤ 160 mg/dL

          7. Patients with the life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks.

          8. Patients who have agreed to use acceptable methods for contraception during the study
             treatment period.

             (e.g.: sterilization of the patient and his/her partner, intrauterine device of the
             partner, barrier contraception, combination with diaphragm or condom)

             insulin and/or oral antidiabetic therapy.

          3. Patients with a history of serious gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 weeks prior to
             screening or patients with any disease possibly affecting the absorption of oral
             agents. (malabsorption syndrome, hemorrhagic gastric ulcer, etc.)

          4. At the time of screening,

                  the last treatment day. (6 weeks for nitrosurea compounds).

               -  For patients treated with biologic agents including hormone therapy, at least 5
                  half-lives or 3 weeks, whichever is shorter.

          5. Patients who have not been recovered from the toxicities to grade 1 of the therapy
             received prior to screening.

          6. Pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          7. Patients who were administered another investigational product within 3 weeks prior to
             screening.

          8. Patients with uncontrolled metastasis to the central nervous system. However, patients
             with treated and stable brain metastases (stable at least for 30 days on radiology
             imaging) are allowed to enroll.

          9. Patients with suspected serious infectious diseases, intestinal paralysis, bowel
             obstruction, interstitial pneumonia, or pulmonary fibrosis.

         10. Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders likely to threaten the compliance

             unstable angina, other serious cardiac disorders) or patients with comorbidities of
             other serious internal disorders (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disorder, renal failure, etc.) on investigator's judgment.

         16. Patients who are otherwise considered to be ineligible for this study on
