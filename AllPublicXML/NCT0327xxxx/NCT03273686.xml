    <textblock>
      Nasogastric decompression is standard practice after esophageal resection in most centers
      because it is expected to reduce the incidence of esophagogastric anastomotic leakage by
      preventing overdistension of the gastric conduit. Most esophageal surgeons have been
      reluctant to move away from this tradition because of the considerable morbidity of
      anastomotic leaks after esophagectomy. However, a contrarian view is that the use of
      prolonged NGD may increase the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications by
      promoting aspiration. Considering the numerous complications caused by using the tube and the
      uncertainty about its usefulness and the scarcity of studies conducted on the subject,
      particularly in patients with esophageal cancer, the necessity of using the tube in these
      types of cases is investigated in the present study.

      Methods In this clinical trial, patients with esophageal cancer were randomized into groups
      with NG tube and without NG tube after surgery. Sequence generation was performed using a
      computer-generated sequence of random numbers with permuted blocks. Standard postoperative
      management protocols were followed in both groups to avoid potential bias, which including
      preoperation nasogastric decompression. Thoracic esophageal mobilization and mediastinal
      lymphadenectomy were performed by open thoracotomy surgery. The abdominal part of the surgery
      was performed by laparotomy, gastric tube reconstruction was performed using linear staplers,
      and the conduit was brought up to the neck through the posterior mediastinal route. A
      cervical esophagogastric anastomosis was performed by stapled (linear) techniques. All
      patients were mobilized early, began early enteral feeding through jejunostomy tubes.
      Randomization was performed during the surgery. The group without NG tube after surgery will
      discharge the NG tube during the surgery. While the control group(group with NG tube after
      surgery) will discharge the NG tube 6-7days after surgery. The variables recorded for each
      patient included pulmonary complications, wound complications, anastomosis leak as well as
      the duration of postoperative hospitalization and the need for placing replacing the NG tube.
