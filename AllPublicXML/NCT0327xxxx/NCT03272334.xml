  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal uses HER2Bi armed activated T-cells (HER2 BATs) to target breast cancer in
      combination with pembrolizumab (PBZ) in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Phase I
      will determine a safe dose of the combination of PBZ and HER2 BATs in 3 to 18 patients. In
      the phase II portion, an additional 12 patients will be treated at the selected dose to
      further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy.

      Study treatment includes a combination of 8 infusions of BATs using a previously established
      schedule and one to three infusions of PBZ (200 mg per dose). PBZ will be added to 8
      infusions of BATs in 3 schedules: #1) after the 8th BATs infusion; #2) after the 4th and 8th
      BATs infusions; and then, #3) before the 1st and after the 4th and 8th BATs infusions.

      Once subjects are determined eligible, white blood cells (lymphocytes) are collected via
      leukapheresis procedure. Depending on arm/schedule, about 4-5 weeks later, study treatment
      will begin. For HER2 BATs, the white blood cells, specifically T cells, are then mixed with
      two proteins - OKT3 and IL-2 -- which activates the cells to multiply. After approximately 14
      days in culture, the activated T cells are coated with OKT3 and trastuzumab/Herceptin
      (HER2Bi), and washed to remove excess Herceptin in order to produce bispecific antibody armed
      T cells (BATs). Cells are then frozen and stored until scheduled to be infused.

      Follow-up appointment schedule will include clinic visits 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6
      months after the last dose of Pembrolizumab.

             metastatic setting

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The patient must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to leukapheresis.

          2. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          3. Hypersensitivity to PBZ or any of its excipients.

             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of study treatment.

          5. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 14 days prior to
             apheresis or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. (Subjects with ≤ Grade 2
             neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study)

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, monoclonal antibody
             therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis.

               -  Note: If currently receiving hormonal therapy or chemotherapy, this treatment
                  must be stopped at least 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis. Hormonal therapy may be
                  restarted after the restaging scan 1 month after the 8th BATs infusion.

               -  Note: Radiation therapy to the axial skeleton must be completed at least 2 weeks
                  prior to leukapheresis

          7. Has history of another malignancy within the past 5 years. Exceptions include basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin that has undergone
             potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          8. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to leukapheresis. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          9. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         11. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive children within the projected
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120
             days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         14. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         15. Has Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies) or known active Hepatitis
             B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).

         16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of apheresis. Note: Seasonal influenza
             vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however
             intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are
             not allowed.

         17. Has a history of significant cardiac disease, including:

               -  History of a recent myocardial infarction (within one year), a past myocardial
                  infarction (more than one year ago) along with current coronary symptoms
                  requiring medications and/or evidence of depressed left ventricular function
                  (LVEF &lt; 45% by MUGA or ECHO).

               -  Current history of angina/coronary symptoms requiring medications and/or evidence
                  of depressed left ventricular function (LVEF &lt; 45% by MUGA or ECHO)

               -  Clinical evidence of congestive heart failure requiring medical management
                  (irrespective of ECHO results).

         18. Pt may be excluded if, in the opinion of the PI and investigator team, the pt is not
             capable of being compliant.
