      This is a randomized open-label phase II study assessing the activity of bevacizumab combined
      with atezolizumab compared to atezolizumab alone in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients
      who are ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy.

      This is a multi-center trial.

      INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Eligible patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with either:

        -  Arm A: atezolizumab 1200 mg IV flat dose plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 21 days

        -  Arm B: atezolizumab 1200 mg IV flat dose every 21 days

      For both treatment arms, 21 days equals 1 cycle of therapy and patients will be eligible to
      continue treatment until progressive disease by RECIST v1.1 or unacceptable toxicity for up
      to 24 months.

      To demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs must be obtained within 14 days
      prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) of treatment:

        -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC): ≥ 1,000 K/mm^3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb): ≥ 9.0 g/dL

        -  Platelet Count: ≥ 100,000/uL

      Renal:

        -  Calculated Creatinine Clearance: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 or ≥ 30 cc/min using a direct
           method or the Cockcroft-Gault formula

        -  Urinary Albumin Excretion: &lt; 1.0 g/24 hours (as estimated by urine protein-creatinine
           ratio)

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) (patients with known Gilbert's Disease
           who have serum bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN may be enrolled)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): ≤ 2.5 × ULN (5.0 x ULN if liver involvement)

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): ≤ 2.5 × ULN (5.0 x ULN if liver involvement)

        -  Serum Albumin: ≥ 2.5 g/dL

      Coagulation:

        -  International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT); Activated Partial
           Thromboplastin Time (aPTT): ≤ 1.5 × ULN (NOTE: This applies only to patients who are not
           receiving therapeutic anticoagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation
           should be on a stable dose)
