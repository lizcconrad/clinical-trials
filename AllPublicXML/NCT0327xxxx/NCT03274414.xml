    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of one the following cancer types:

               -  Squamous cell carcinoma

               -  Esthesioneuroblastoma

               -  Adenoid cystic carcinoma

               -  Adenocarcinoma

          -  Paranasal sinus/nasal cavity malignancy is considered unresectable with negative
             margins surgery or resection would be considered excessively morbid. This could
             include lesions with:

               -  Carotid involvement

               -  Cavernous sinus invasion

               -  Brain invasion

               -  Orbital apex

               -  Intraconal space

               -  Pterygoid musculature involvement

               -  Invasion of the clivus

          -  Resection of at least 80% of the volume of the tumor is feasible. Resectability will
             be determined by the surgeon and radiologist after discussion among the
             multidisciplinary team.

          -  Patients must be a candidate for surgery (as per treating surgeon) and be able to
             tolerate proton radiation and chemotherapy (as per treating radiation oncologist and
             medical oncologist).

          -  Karnofsky performance statue &gt;/= 70

          -  The subject has organ and marrow function and laboratory values rendering safe
             administration of Cisplatin:

               -  The ANC &gt;/= 1000/mm3 without colony stimulating factor support

               -  Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL

               -  Bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dL the ULM. For subjects with Gilbert's disease, bilirubin
                  &lt;/= 3.0 mg/dL

               -  Serum albumin &gt;/= 2.8 g/dl

               -  Creatinine clearance (CrCl) &gt;/= 60 mL/min. For creatinine clearance estimation,
                  the Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used:

               -  Male: CrCl (mL/min) = (140 = age) x wt (kg) / (serum creatinine x 72)

               -  Female: Multiply above result by 0.85

               -  ALT and AST &lt;/= 3.0 ULN

               -  Serum phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium &gt;/= LLN

          -  No evidence of intercurrent infection

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential (&lt;51 years of age) as per
             institutional policy.

          -  Patients with distant metastatic disease may not be included.

          -  Patient must be able to read and write in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Tumor is deemed to be resectable with negative margins by conventional surgical
             standards.

          -  Patients not able to receive standard-dose cisplatin based on the judgement of the
             treating medical oncologist.

          -  Patients with chronic kidney disease (GFR &lt;60), uncontrolled hypertension, congestive
             heart failure, pre-existing bone marrow dysfunction, or cytopenias.

             Â° Congestive heart failure (CHF): New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV at the
             time of screening

          -  Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg
             systolic or &gt; 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7
             days of the first dose of study treatment; If severe hearing impairment is measured or
             if significant neuropathy is reported at baseline the treating physician will discuss
             the risks for further permanent hearing loss and neuropathy with the patient.

          -  Patients not able to have a MRI (due to pacemaker, claustrophobia, etc.).

          -  Inability to return to MSKCC for frequent scheduled hydration sessions
             post-chemotherapy.

          -  Inability to comply with requirements for cisplatin administration anti-emetic
             regimens post-treatment.

          -  Patients not able or unwilling to travel for proton therapy.
