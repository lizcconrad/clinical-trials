Participants with anti-rHuPH20 antibody titer ≥ 160 during the study and/or at the last measurement will continue in Epoch 2 for an additional two years of HYQVIA treatment and observation, and complete the study completion visits at the next possible occasion following the 36-months visit.</description>

             (PI) involving a defect in antibody formation and requiring gammaglobulin replacement,
             as defined according to the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS)
             Scientific Committee 2015 1 prior to enrollment. The diagnosis must be confirmed by

             administered in compliance with the respective product information for a period of at
             least three months prior to screening. The average minimum pre-study dose over that
             interval was equivalent to 300 mg/kg BW / 4 weeks and a maximum dose equivalent to
             1000 mg/kg body weight (BW) / 4 weeks.

             Globulin (ISG) infusions.

          5. Participant has severe Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency (less than 7.0 mg/dL) with

          8. Participant has a bleeding disorder or a platelet count less than 20,000/μL, or who,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would be at significant risk of increased bleeding
             or bruising as a result of SC therapy.

          9. Participant has severe dermatitis that would preclude adequate sites for safe product
             administration in the opinion of the investigator.

         10. Participant has participated in another clinical study involving an IP or
             investigational device within 30 days prior to enrollment or is scheduled to
             participate in another clinical study involving an IP or investigational device during
             the course of this study.

         11. Participant is a family member or employee of the investigator.
