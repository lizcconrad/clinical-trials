  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, multinational,
      prospective study in patients with operable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension
      (CTEPH) prior to pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) with high preoperative pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR). Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive riociguat or matching
      placebo for 3 months before undergoing PEA. The primary objective of this study is to assess
      the efficacy of riociguat on preoperative PVR compared to placebo in patients with operable
      CTEPH.
