  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the rate of clinically relevant
      complications associated with CyPass Micro-Stent placement and stability using the CyPass
      241-S applier, as determined at 36 months in the postmarket setting, is less than the
      pre-specified performance target, which is based on experience with the CyPass Model E
      applier in the COMPASS (TMI-09-01) Trial.

      Each subject's expected participation in the study is up to 37.5 months which includes up to
      42 days between the screening and surgery visits, and 36 months of post-surgery follow-up.
      Only one eye per subject will be implanted.
