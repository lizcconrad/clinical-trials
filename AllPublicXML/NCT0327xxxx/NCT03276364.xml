  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been found to be useful for aiding in the prediction of
      fluid responsiveness. It is unknown if trainees can effectively utilize this tool to improve
      their assessment of fluid responsiveness.

      In this prospective, observational study, pulmonary and critical care fellows are asked to
      make 2 assessments of fluid responsiveness in adults with shock: (1) based on clinical exam
      alone (Clinical) and (2) after performing a POCUS (Clinical + US). The accuracy of their pre-
      and post-ultrasound assessments are compared using a bioreactance monitor and passive leg
      raise test as the gold standard of fluid responsiveness in this study.

        -  Could undergo both a POCUS and bioreactance assessment within 6 hours of admission
             from the emergency department or transfer from a medical floor.

          -  Shock was defined as either systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or 40 mmHg below
             baseline, necessity for vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure greater than
             65 mmHg, or any evidence of acute organ hypoperfusion that was evident at the time of
             study enrollment as judged by the treating physician.

          -  The patient needed to be in shock at the time of POCUS and bioreactance testing at
             time of enrollment in order to be included.
