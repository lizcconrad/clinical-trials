    <textblock>
      Identification of new retention solutes associated with cardiovascular (CV) toxicity in
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients will help to better understand the pathophysiological
      mechanisms at stake and to prevent CKD-associated mortality and morbidity. For a molecule to
      be defined as a toxic retention solute, plasma accumulation in the course of CKD has to be
      demonstrated but also proof needs to be made that plasma accumulation during CKD is indeed
      associated with an increased risk of CV complications. Moreover, precise determination of the
      plasma concentration has to be performed in order to later study in vitro and in vivo the
      toxic mechanisms involved. Based on previous results of plasma proteome analysis using mass
      spectrometry, a previous study has selected 10 promising protein candidates. These proteins
      accumulated in the plasma of patients during CKD progression and are known to be associated
      with CV events in non-CKD patients. The objective of the present study is now to 1) evaluate
      the association of the plasma accumulation of the 10 retention solutes with CV complications
      in CKD patients and 2) determine their plasma concentration using ELISA. One hundred and
      seventy six patients with advanced CKD will be included and divided in 2 groups: 44 patients
      with history of CV complications in the past 4 years and 132 patients free of any CV
      complications.
