  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilonidal disease is a common painful condition that affects 26 per 100,000 people with an
      incidence of 1.1% in the young male population. Recurrence rates of pilonidal disease after
      initial incision and drainage and after resection have been reported to be 16% and 11%
      respectively. Furthermore, wound issues after resection with primary closure have been
      reported to be as high as 30%. In several retrospective studies and small prospective
      studies, laser hair removal has shown promise as an adjunct therapy to decrease recurrent
      infections and decrease the need for repeat surgery in adults and older adolescents. We are
      performing a randomized control trial of laser hair depilation plus chemical/mechanical
      depilation to examine outcomes related to recurrence of pilonidal disease.

    <description>Laser depilation to the natal cleft (pilonidal region) every 4-6 weeks for 5 treatments with either an 810nm or Nd:YAG laser dependent on Fitzpatrick skin type and tolerability. Patients and families in the intervention group will also be taught hair removal techniques and asked to perform either chemical or mechanical depilation as needed to keep the area hair-free between clinic treatments.</description>

    <description>Fitzpatrick skin type classification will be assessed during the initial visit. The Fitzpatrick skin type classification is based on the level of pigmentation of the skin and its response to ultraviolet light (See Appendix). It will be used to select the best laser to perform hair removal for each patient. The laser treatment group will consist of an 810 nm (for Fitzpatrick skin types I-IV) or Nd:YAG (for Fitzpatrick skin types V-VI) 28 joule application at auto pulse duration for 400 ms. A cooling platform and application of 7% lidocaine/ 7% tetracaine cream, applied 45 minutes prior to treatment, will minimize any discomfort associated with the heat of the laser treatments.</description>
