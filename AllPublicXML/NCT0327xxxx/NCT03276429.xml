    <textblock>
      In the light of a new era in the management of lung cancer this non-interventional study
      intend to capture all the epidemiological, clinical, pathological, molecular and treatment
      parameters of non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell (SCLC) lung cancer patients from a
      tertiary Oncology Clinic in an Electronic Data Base (EDB).

      Investigators intend to build an electronic database which will record the epidemiological,
      clinical, pathological, molecular data and treatment parameters of lung cancer patients
      (NSCLC and SCLC) who are referred to a tertiary Oncology Clinic. Documentation will include:
      a) Patient demographics, co- morbidities, tobacco exposure in pack-years, b) Disease related
      parameters: method of diagnosis, histological type, disease staging (according to 7th edition
      of TNM for lung cancer) and metastatic sites if any, c) Molecular status: mutation status for
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), Proto-oncogene
      tyrosine-protein kinase ROS, Hepatocyte Growth Factor Receptor (HGFRor cMET), Human Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2), proto-oncogene B-Raf, and Programmed-Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1)
      testing when available, d) Type of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted
      therapies, immune-therapy), and Line of treatment (neo-adjuvant, adjuvant, 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
      palliation therapy), e) Clinical outcome: Overall Survival (OS), Response Rate (RR), and
      Progression Free Survival (PFS).
