    <textblock>
      Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a serious and often chronical eating disorder characterized by an
      extreme effort for weight loss and intense fear of becoming fat despite the obvious thinness.
      The treatment is very difficult and not always effective. ThatÂ´s the reason why we are
      looking for new ways of the therapeutic approach.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulation technique, which
      modulates the neuronal excitability. According to previous research it has a potential to
      help people with Anorexia Nervosa.

      The device for the tDCS has two electrodes, an anode (the excitatory one) and a cathode (the
      inhibitory one). We put them on the skull into the different positions, in dependence on the
      fact, if we want to excite or on to inhibit the parts of the brain under the electrodes.

      There are several hypothesis how could the tDCS help in patients with AN. One of them speaks
      about the hyperactivity of the right hemisphere in Anorexia Nervosa. Therefore could the
      anodal (excitatory) tDCS over the left hemisphere and the cathodal (inhibitory one) help in
      resetting the inter-hemispheric balance.

      Stimulation of 2 milliampere is applied for 30 minutes in every real session. Together there
      are 10 sessions, the application is every workday within 2 weeks.

      All measurements and questionnaires are made 4 times:

        1. Before the stimulation

        2. On the day of the last stimulation

        3. 14 days after the last stimulation

        4. 28 days after the last stimulation
