  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have found a beneficial effect of tea consumption on the reduction of risk of
      cognitive impairment and dementia in older aged populations. However, there is a paucity of
      data on these associations in the very old defined as individuals aged 85 years and over.
      Therefore, we hypothesized that higher tea consumption was associated with better global and
      domain-specific cognitive function. We investigated the relationship between tea consumption
      in the very old and measures of global cognitive function, memory, attention and psychomotor
      speed.

      The Newcastle 85+ Study was a longitudinal (5-years), population-based cohort study of
      individuals aged 85+ years in North East England, United Kingdom. The final sample included
      676 community-dwelling and institutionalized men and women recruited through general medical
      practices.

      Baseline tea consumption was assessed through a 2x24-hr multiple pass recall and longitudinal
      measures of global and domain specific (memory, speed and attention) cognitive function
      through the standardized mini-mental state examination and the cognitive drug research
      system. Linear mixed models, controlling for demographic (e.g. age, sex and education) and
      health variables were used to determine whether tea consumption was protective against
      cognitive decline.

The CDR tasks were presented on a hi-resolution Windows-based laptop computer (Motion Computing LE1600 Tablet PC with keyboard accessory) and participants responded using a two-button (NO/YES) response box. Target digit is randomly selected and constantly displayed to the right of the screen. A series of digits (0-9) are presented in the centre of the screen at the rate of 150 per minute. The participant is required to press the &quot;YES&quot; button as quickly as possible every time the digit in the series matches the target digit. There are 300 digits in the series and the task lasts for 2 minutes. (ms)</description>

The CDR tasks were presented on a hi-resolution Windows-based laptop computer (Motion Computing LE1600 Tablet PC with keyboard accessory) and participants responded using a two-button (NO/YES) response box. A list of words is presented on screen for the subject to remember. Immediately after the presentation the subject is asked to recall as many words as possible. 20 minutes later, the same list of words is presented with added distracter words. For each word, the subject is asked to indicate whether or not it belongs o the original list by pressing 'YES' or 'NO'.</description>
