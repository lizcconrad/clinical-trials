  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for High Grade Meningioma.

      The drug involved in this study is an immunotherapy drug called pembrolizumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for this
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying pembrolizumab in participants with
      meningioma. Research studies have shown that meningioma tumor cells express a gene called
      PD-L1. The investigators will be looking to determine whether the study drug may may stop
      meningioma tumors from growing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Documentation Of Disease

        --Histologic Documentation: Histologically proven recurrent or residual intracranial or
        metastatic meningioma or meningioma with extracranial spread

        Progressive OR residual disease, as defined by the following:

          -  Progressive disease, as defined as an increase in size of the measurable primary
             lesion on imaging by 25% or more (bidirectional area). The change must occur between
             scans separated by no more than 24 months.

          -  Residual measurable disease: For Grade II or III meningioma, residual measurable
             disease immediately after surgery without requirement for progression. Residual
             measurable disease will be defined by bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly
             defined margins by MRI scans, with a minimum diameter of 10mm in both dimensions.

          -  Post radiation patients: Patients with measurable and progressive meningioma who have
             received radiation are potentially eligible, but need to show evidence of progressive
             disease in the radiated field after completion of radiation. At least 24 weeks must
             have elapsed from completion of radiation to registration. Patients that have
             progressive disease outside of the radiation field do not need to wait 24 weeks from
             completion of radiation.

               -  Measurable Disease: Measurable disease is defined by a bidimensionally measurable
                  main lesion on MRI or CT images (MRI preferred) with clearly defined margins and
                  ≥ 10 mm. Multifocal disease is allowed as long as one lesion meets criteria for
                  measurable disease and progressive disease.

             (chemotherapy, radiation) while on study.

          -  For patients treated with external beam radiation, interstitial brachytherapy or
             radiosurgery, an interval &gt; 24 weeks must have elapsed from completion of XRT to
             registration.

          -  Stable dose of dexamethasone 2mg or less for 7 days prior to initiation of treatment

                  time in the preceding 12 consecutive months). Female subject of childbearing
                  potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior
                  to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or

                  subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
                  control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the

             Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 2
             weeks earlier. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion
             and may qualify for the study. If subject received major surgery, they must have
             recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention
             prior to starting therapy.

          -  Participants with brainstem lesions

             corticosteroids as described in Section 5.7, within three months of start of study
             drug

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or
             stable NF-related neoplasms (Section 3.1.7).

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
             HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab. In addition,
             these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  Unable to undergo brain MRI.
