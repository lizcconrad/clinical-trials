  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiangiogenesis therapy plays an important role in cancer treatment. Apatinib showed good
      safety and efficacy as third-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer.We conducted this trial
      to investigate the safety and efficacy of apatinib combined with S1 after failure of
      first-line chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma
      patients.
