      Compound danshen dripping pills is mainly used for the treatment and prevention of coronary
      heart disease and high-risk groups ,consists of Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), Sanqi
      (Radix Notoginseng) and borneol.Danshen is the main drug efficacy of stasis, nourishing the
      nerves.Pharmacological studies have shown that Danshen can improve the oxygen carrying
      capacity of blood, increase oxygen supply to vital organs, effectively reduce hypoxia-induced
      heart and other vital organs, brain and kidney damage. Danshen can activate the fibrinolytic
      system, reduce blood viscosity, clear the microcirculation, promote blood circulation,
      increasing the amount of tissue oxygen by inhibiting platelet aggregation.This study is being
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of compound danshen dripping pills in
      preventing and treating acute mountain sickness, when compared with placebo.
