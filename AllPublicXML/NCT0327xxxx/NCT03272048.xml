  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year in the United States (U.S.), over 40,000 individuals die by suicide, and
      approximately half of these deaths occur by intentional, self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Given
      these staggering statistics, efforts to minimize individuals' access to firearms during
      at-risk periods has been identified as a critical if fraught suicide prevention strategy.
      Among individuals at risk for suicide who present to clinical settings, a crucial component
      of the clinical management of suicide risk is to ask about firearm ownership/access and
      counsel on firearm safety (e.g., encourage an at-risk person to transfer the firearm to a
      loved one until risk abates). Despite the clinical, ethical, and in some cases legal mandate
      of this intervention, a substantial proportion of clinicians are woefully undertrained and
      therefore unprepared to manage suicide risk and appropriately deliver counseling on firearm
      safety. Clinical and empirical evidence suggests that even among patients identified to be at
      increased risk for suicide, few clinicians ask about firearms or provide counseling on
      firearm safety. One key reason for this fissure between recommendations and actual
      implementation of recommendations is that strategies for discussing firearm safety in a way
      that is impactful and yields patient adherence to recommendations have yet to be established.

      One common approach to attempt to garner pro-health behavior change is the use of fear
      appeals; however, research on the utility of this approach across non-firearm-related health
      interventions has been equivocal. Given the cultural importance placed on firearms in the
      U.S., the investigators contend that fear-based approaches to lethal means counseling may be
      counter-productive by creating defensive avoidance, thereby detracting from the purpose of
      counseling on firearm safety (i.e., patient safety).

      Further, patient adherence to recommendations to limit access to a firearm during at-risk
      periods may be increased when clinicians emphasize that limits on firearm access will decline
      when suicide risk abates (i.e., limits on firearm access will likely not be permanent).
      However, research has yet to determine if varying the level of fear messaging and/or emphasis
      on temporariness is actually useful and acceptable.

      To address this gap, the investigators will randomly assign participants to one of four
      experimental conditions: (1) low-fear/not-temporary; (2) low-fear/temporary; (3)
      high-fear/not-temporary; and (4) high-fear/temporary. Participants include undergraduate
      students who are vulnerable to suicide and reported owning or previously owning a firearm,
      reported access to a firearm, or reported possibly obtaining a firearm in the future. The
      investigators hypothesized that individuals randomly assigned to the low-fear/temporary group
      will (1) report greater intentions to adhere to recommendations to limit access to firearms
      during at-risk periods than the other groups at both post-intervention and one-month
      follow-up; (2) report greater actual adherence to recommendations at one-month follow-up; and
      (3) rate the lethal means counseling session as more acceptable than the other groups.
      Exploratory aims examined if the effects differed for individuals reporting actual current
      firearm ownership or access, membership in the National Rifle Association (NRA) or a similar
      organization, political affiliation, political ideology, greater personal importance of the
      Second Amendment, or severity of suicidal symptoms. Findings have the potential to inform
      clinical and public health approaches to limit at-risk individuals' access to firearms for
      safety purposes.

    <intervention_name>Lethal Means Counseling</intervention_name>
    <description>Lethal means counseling is broadly defined as clinician-initiated discussions that encourage an individual at risk for suicide to safely store his or her firearms. Examples in this domain include applying a gun lock, separating the gun from its ammunition, dismantling the firearm and keeping its components locked and/or separated, or safely transferring the firearm to a trusted loved one, friend, or police station until risk abates (Bryan, Stone, &amp; Rudd, 2011; Jin, Khazem, &amp; Anestis, 2016). Further, given that recent purchasers of firearms are at markedly increased risk of death by suicide (Wintemute, Parham, Beaumont, Wright, &amp; Drake, 1999), anticipatory counseling on firearm safety should also be considered for at-risk individuals who do not report currently owning or having access to a firearm, but who report prior firearm ownership/access or intentions of obtaining a firearm in the future (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, 2017).</description>
