  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a randomized controlled design to test whether 30 days of cannabis
      abstinence, compared to 30 days of monitoring, is associated with improvements in cognitive
      functioning. Non-using controls will also be enrolled to determine the clinical significance
      of any cognitive improvements with abstinence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year randomized, longitudinal trial of cannabis abstinence designed to determine
      (1) if performance improves with abstinence beyond that observed with continued cannabis use,
      and if so, (2) when during abstinence cognitive improvement occurs, and (3) whether
      performance in abstinent individuals &quot;returns&quot; to performance levels observed in non-using
      peers. We hypothesized that abstinent adolescent cannabis users would have more
      neurocognitive improvement over four weeks compared to non-abstinent cannabis users, and
      performance would continuously improve throughout four weeks of abstinence. We will recruit
      210 adolescents with and without regular cannabis use. Eligible cannabis users will be
      randomized to either a contingency management intervention which will incentivize 4 weeks of
      cannabis abstinence (n = 70), or non-contingent monitoring with no abstinence requirement (n
      = 70). All participants (including non-users; n = 70) will complete cognitive assessments,
      toxicology testing, self-report questionnaires and semi-structured mood and substance use
      interviews during the 4-week study as well as one 30-day follow-up visit. Abstinence will be
      indexed by decreasing levels of cannabis metabolites in urine.
