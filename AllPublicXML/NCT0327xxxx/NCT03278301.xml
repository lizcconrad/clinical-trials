  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect data on the routine patterns of use, safety and effectiveness, including the
      clinical and technical performance of the CorPath GRX System, in the delivery and
      manipulation of coronary guidewires and stent/balloon catheters, and manipulation of guide
      catheters during PCI procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center patient registry of the CorPath GRX System to
      examine its performance during PCI procedures and patient outcomes through 72 hours
      post-procedure or hospital discharge, whichever occurs first.
