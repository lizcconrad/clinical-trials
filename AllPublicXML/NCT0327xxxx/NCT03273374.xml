    <textblock>
      This phase II study is designed to investigate the efficacy of IORT for patients with
      resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The purpose of the study is to show the local
      recurrence rate after surgical resection and IORT is superior to that of surgical resection
      alone from the historical control. A total of 42 patients will be enrolled, and these
      patients will receive IORT of 10 Gy at 5 millimeter depth of the tumor bed, followed by 6
      cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      Treatment outcomes of pancreatic cancer are poor even after surgical resection, thus patients
      may receive adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)
      with low energy (50 kV) x-ray allows delivery of a high dose radiation to the tumor bed
      during surgery while effectively sparing adjacent critical organs. Another advantage of IORT
      is that delivery of IORT does not interfere with the scheduled administration of adjuvant
      chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Here we investigate the efficacy of IORT for patients with
      resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma by comparing the local recurrence rate after surical
      resection and IORT with that of surgical resection alone from the historical control. A total
      of 42 patients will be enrolled in this phase II trial, and these patients will receive IORT
      of 10 Gy at 5 millimeter depth of the tumor bed, followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine
      chemotherapy.
