  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza infection results in an estimated 31 million outpatient visits, 55,000 to 974,200
      hospitalizations, and 3,000 to 49,000 deaths. Membership in household in which someone else
      has influenza is the major risk factor for contracting influenza. The household secondary
      attack rate (SAR) is as high as 19% based on laboratory-confirmed influenza and 30% based on
      symptoms. Non-pharmaceutical preventive measures, including education, may play a role in
      decreasing transmission, but are only effective if started within 36 hours of symptom onset
      in index cases. Yet, most interventions are delayed because they are not initiated until care
      is sought. The investigators have demonstrated in one primarily Latino, urban community
      sample, that text messaging can be used to rapidly identify community members with
      influenza-like illness (ILI) early in an illness. This early identification would enable
      implementation of an educational intervention in the optimal time frame to reduce influenza
      transmission. Providing education within a text message is a proven successful strategy to
      influence behavior. Text messaging itself is scalable, low-cost, and can be used in low
      literacy populations. However, using text-message based surveillance to trigger a real-time
      text-message behavioral educational intervention to decrease household influenza transmission
      has not been assessed.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 households with ≥1 child recruited from four
      contiguous communities in New York City. Households will be randomized, stratified by
      community 1:1 to receive surveillance-only (no text message education) vs. surveillance plus
      text message educational intervention. For symptom surveillance, households in both arms will
      receive text messages 3x/week during each influenza season and report if someone in the
      household has ILI symptoms. For those in the educational intervention arm, when an ILI/acute
      respiratory infections (ARI) is reported, a series of educational text messages will be sent
      with information to decrease household transmission.
