  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FoG) is a common and debilitating condition in Parkinson's Disease (PD)
      patients. FoG is described as an episodic inability to walk, which often triggers falls,
      hospitalization and is an important predictor of poor quality of life. As locomotor regions
      degenerate in PD, gait automaticity is impaired. Patients compensate by increasing volitional
      control of gait, however, this adaptation has been found to worsen FoG severity. We
      hypothesize that increased cortical control of gait is maladaptive, and therapies to improve
      gait automaticity will not be effective unless cortical control of gait is reduced. The
      long-term goal of this project is to develop a therapeutic approach for FoG that
      simultaneously reduces cortical control and increases automaticity of gait. The objective is
      to determine the locomotor network abnormalities responsible for FoG and demonstrate how
      neuromodulation and rehabilitation can modulate the network. The rationale of this study is
      that increased connectivity between brainstem locomotor regions and cortical structures
      represents increased cortical governance of gait, and it can be reversed by the proposed
      intervention. We will accomplish this by combining a course of inhibitory rTMS (1Hz) to the
      cortex (supplementary motor area) with a rehabilitation protocol designed to increase gait
      automaticity (dual task training). We have designed a study that will carefully assess the
      locomotor network of freezers with resting state functional, diffusion and interleaved
      TMS/BOLD MRI studies, before and after intervention. Behavioral measures including gait
      analysis, cognitive and motor assessments will also be conducted at baseline and post
      treatment. The study aims to determine the effects of our intervention on the locomotor
      network (assessed with imaging), as well as on FoG severity as quantified through multiple
      markers obtained through gait analysis. At the conclusion of the study we expect to have
      determined the network changes central to the pathophysiology of FoG, the effects of 1Hz rTMS
      + rehabilitation on this network, and on FoG severity.

      The relevance of this study to public health is to develop a non-invasive effective
      therapeutic option for one of the most debilitating and untreatable conditions affecting the
      lives of one million Americans suffering from PD; freezing of gait.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects meeting diagnostic criteria for PD and documented freezing of gait will be recruited
      from the MUSC Movement Disorder Clinic by clinical staff. Subjects will undergo identical
      imaging protocols before and after intervention. Subjects will undergo ten, 20 minute, dual
      task training sessions immediately following each rTMS session. Subjects will be randomized
      to either active rTMS + rehabilitation or rehabilitation alone at a 2:1 ratio (10 active: 5
      control). The primary outcome measure will be dual task interference for turning.
