  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Alcohol use disorders represent a major health burden. Efforts aiming at reducing
      alcohol-related harm include early detection of those with risky drinking habits as well
      detection of early relapse in patients with alcohol dependence who are detoxified and
      committed to abstinence. Recently, ethyl glucuronide has been proved to be a good biomarker
      for the detection of recent drinking. However, to date, no randomized diagnostic trial has
      tested its impact on drinking outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess, with a
      randomized design, the implications of ethyl glucuronide screening on alcohol outcomes,
      compared to screening with a low-sensitivity biomarker such as ethanol.

      Methods: alcohol dependent outpatients were randomized to either 24 weeks of continuous
      screening with ethyl glucuronide or ethanol. Patients were aware of screening methods and
      results. After 24 weeks, all participants were screened with ethyl glucuronide. Self-reports
      were also gathered. A logistic regression model was performed comparing the rate of ethyl
      glucuronide positive results at study end between groups. Generalized estimating equations
      were performed to evaluate the descending rate of EtG positive patients in the EtG group,
      measured month to month.
