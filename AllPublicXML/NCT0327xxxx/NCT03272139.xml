      Sparing the phrenic nerve by administering ultrasound-guided low volume superior trunk block
      (STB) and interscalene block (ISB) for arthroscopic shoulder surgery (labral repair,
      stabilization, rotator cuff repair).

    <description>The interscalene block will be done using an ultrasound-guided, in-plane approach. The anesthesiologists will target below the C5 nerve root. A 22 gauge 1.5-2 inch needle is advanced in-plane from lateral to medial through the middle scalene muscle until the needle tip is positioned in the interscalene groove between the C5 and C6 nerve roots. 15 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected.</description>

    <arm_group_label>superior trunk block (STB)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The superior trunk block will be performed at the point immediately distal to the roots when the c5-c6 form the superior trunk and lies anterior to the middle scalene muscle and below the deep cervical fascia, before the suprascapular nerve arises and goes into the omohyoid. A 22g 1.5-2inch needle will be advanced in-plane from lateral to medial. The needle tip will be placed lateral to the superior trunk and 15 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine will be injected just inferior to the deep cervical fasica. Local circumferential spread will be achieved both anterior and posterior to the superior trunk.</description>
