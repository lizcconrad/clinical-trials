  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common side effect of many forms of
      chemotherapy having a negative impact on the quality of life for cancer survivors due to
      numbness, decreased sensation, pain (of various intensities in the extremities), gait/balance
      problems, and difficulty with fine motor skills of the hands and fingers.To date, there are
      no preventive modalities to mitigate CIPN development.When CIPN becomes intolerable, optimal
      doses of chemotherapy have to be reduced or discontinued, which may affect a patient's
      overall survival. Intraneural facilitation (INF) is a technique developed by physical
      therapists at Loma Linda University after careful study of the structure, pathophysiology and
      biomechanics of peripheral nerves. The focus of INF is restoration of circulation to an
      ischemic nerve. INF has been offered to subjects receiving treatment at LLUCC with anecdotal
      success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate INF as a treatment modality under the rigor
      of scientific inquiry to determine its effectiveness as a viable treatment option for breast
      cancer patients with CIPN.

      STUDY OUTLINE: This is a single institution study. Patients with newly diagnosed breast
      cancer stages I to III with any biomarker status (ER, PR and HER), without preexisting
      peripheral neuropathy planning to receive treatment with platinum-based compounds
      (Carboplatin and Cisplatin) and/or taxanes (Docetaxel and Paclitaxel) are potential study
      patients.

      Subjects will be randomized into one of two treatment arms within 3 weeks of starting the
      offending chemotherapy agents after fulfilling the other study eligibility requirements. Arm
      1 (investigational) will receive INF twice a week for six weeks by the same treating physical
      therapist (physical therapist #1). Arm 2 (control) will receive a standardized program of
      muscle stretching and strengthening exercises twice a week for 6 weeks under the supervision
      of treating physical therapist #1. Actual treatment time for both modalities is approximately
      45 minutes. Measurements used to detect the presence and degree of peripheral neuropathy will
      be administered by the same assessment physical therapist (physical therapist #2) at baseline
      and at the end of weeks 3, 6, and 3 months post last physical therapy treatment. Assessment
      tools are: ultrasound imaging on the popliteal and posterior tibia artery, the 20-item Pain
      Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS, specifically addresses neuropathological symptomatology), the
      National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Distress thermometer (DT), and the Michigan
      Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) will be assessed and recorded along with treatment
      adherence. Treating physician will be recording National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) neuropathy score and performance status at routine
      intervals during and after chemotherapy.

      Objectives

      Primary objective

      • To compare the degree of neuropathy between Arm 1 receiving INF therapy compared to Arm 2
      receiving usual care of muscle stretching and strengthening exercises based on standardized
      measurements (PQAS, MNSI, NCCN DT, and AE assessment).

      Secondary objectives

        -  To compare the Ultrasound measurements of peak systolic velocity of popliteal and
           posterior tibia artery between the two treatment arms for assessing differences in
           vascular perfusion.

        -  To compare the rate of any dose reductions and premature chemotherapy discontinuation
           rates due to peripheral neuropathy between Arm 1 receiving INF therapy compared to Arm 2
           receiving standardized program of muscle stretching and strengthening exercises.

        -  To compare subject acceptability, burden and satisfaction with the assigned physical
           therapy modality between the two arms based on patient satisfaction questionnaire
           administered at the end of treatment.

    <description>Intraneural Facilitation (INF) treatment is an effective way to restore blood flow to damaged nerves as neuropathy is strongly impacted by reduced blood flow. INF utilizes three holds or positions, which widens tiny openings in arteries surrounding nerves and improves blood flow to targeted nerves. The improved blood flow in these nerves stimulates healing and reduces or even stops nerve pain.
INF treatment will be administered twice a week for six weeks under the supervision of treating physical therapist.</description>
