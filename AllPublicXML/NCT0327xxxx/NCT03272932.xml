    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the prevalence of Asthma COPD Overlap in subjects with diagnosed
      asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The subsequent morbidity and
      mortality of subjects will be followed up for 3 years.

      Rationale:

      Around 15 to 20% of COPD patients have features of asthma. These patients have more frequent
      and more severe exacerbations, and higher medical utilization. The Global Initiative for
      Asthma (GINA) and Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines
      have given joint recommendations on the identification, diagnosis and treatment of these
      patients having Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO). These are at present expert opinions and further
      studies are needed to establish the optimal definitions and treatment options. The
      recommendations proposed by the guidelines have been adapted for use in the Asia area
      countries. Nonetheless, the application to clinical practice has not been well established
      and there are no prevalence data available on the COPD with asthma symptom population or
      asthma with COPD symptoms population based on the recommended features for identification.
      This is the current data gap in Asia.

      Primary objective:

      To determine the proportion and clinical characteristics of patients with ACO as defined by
      the joint GINA and GOLD recommendation amongst diagnosed COPD and asthma patients seen at the
      out-patient clinics

      Blood will be stored for future genetic studies. As there is currently no good biomarker or
      genetic tests that can identify the cause or suggest the diagnosis of Asthma COPD overlap,
      this study would like to explore into this.

             on the medical records) 1 or asthma (defined as those with a consistent history and
             prior documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction, with evidence of an
             increase in FEV1 greater than 12% or 400 mL following bronchodilator or bronchial
             hyperresponsiveness on bronchial provocation testing, when stable) 6
