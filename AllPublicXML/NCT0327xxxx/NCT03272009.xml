  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bile acids regulating farnesoid X receptor (FXR) interact with hepatitis B virus replication.
      EYP001a is a selective, synthetic FXR agonist under development for the treatment of
      hepatitis B.

      This Phase 1b study is designed primarily to determine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of EYP001a in chronically HBV infected subjects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-part trial.

      In Part A, EYP001a will be administered as 29 days monotherapy. Three dose-levels and 2
      dosing regimens of EYP001a will be explored against placebo. The design also includes an
      open-label standard of care Entecavir monotherapy arm (comparator). Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of the 6 treatment arms:

        -  Treatment A: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment B: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment C: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment D: oral EYP001a

        -  Treatment E: oral placebo

        -  Treatment F: oral Entecavir

      In Part B, EYP001a or placebo will be administered as 29 days combination therapy with the
      standard of care Peg-IFNα2a. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 3 treatment
      arms:

        -  Treatment G: oral EYP001a plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous
           injection

        -  Treatment H: oral EYP001a plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous
           injection

        -  Treatment I: oral placebo plus open label Peg-INFα2a administered as subcutaneous
           injection

      Subjects enrolled in Part A are eligible for participation in Part B.

      Participation will include a 40 day screening period, a 29 day treatment period and a 6 day
      follow-up evaluation period. For subjects who participate in both Parts A and B, a 14 washout
      period between Parts A and B will be included.

      The safety and tolerability of EYP001a will be assessed by evaluating physical examinations,
      vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters, and adverse events.

             allowable limits (with the exception of alanine aminotransferase [ALT]); see inclusion
             criterion #10); if there is an out of range value, the result must be considered
             clinically non-significant by the investigator in order to be eligible.

          8. Vital signs after at least 5 minutes resting in supine position at screening within
             the following ranges:

          9. Have no clinically significant abnormal 12-lead automatic electrocardiogram (ECG)
             (incomplete right bundle branch block can be accepted) at screening: PR interval
             between 120 ms -and 210 ms, QRS-duration &lt; 120 ms, QTc-interval (Fridericia's) ≤ 450

             medications (such as hormonal contraceptives for females, vitamins prescribed per
             label dosages and paracetamol). On a case-by-case basis, regular co-medication either
             as defined on the medication exception list or as documented by written approval from
             the sponsor as acceptable prior to randomization, will not be considered as a
             deviation from this criterion.

         12. At screening, females must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, or of non-childbearing
             potential (either surgically sterilized or physiologically incapable of becoming
             pregnant, or at least 1 year post-menopausal [amenorrhea duration of 12 consecutive
             months); non-pregnancy will be confirmed for all females by a pregnancy test conducted
             at screening and at follow-up visit.

         13. Female subjects of child-bearing potential, with a fertile male sexual partner, should
             be willing to use adequate contraception from screening until 90 days after the
             follow-up visit. Adequate contraception is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or
             an intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of
             contraception: a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in
             accordance with the lifestyle of the subject, is acceptable.

         14. Male subjects, if not surgically sterilized, should be willing to use adequate
             contraception and not donate sperm from the Day 1 visit to the clinical research
             centre until 90 days after the follow-up visit. Adequate contraception for the male
             subject (and his female partner) is defined as using hormonal contraceptives or an
             intrauterine device combined with at least 1 of the following forms of contraception:
             a diaphragm or cervical cap, or a condom. Also, total abstinence, in accordance with
             the lifestyle of the subject is acceptable.

         15. At screening, has no recent (&lt;3 months) history of any clinically significant
             conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigator, would jeopardize the safety of
             the subject or impact the validity of the study results.

         16. Willingness to abstain from alcohol from 48 hours prior to each study visit to the
             clinical research centre.

             they are assessed at study visits.

         10. Has any known pre-existing medical or psychiatric condition that could interfere with
