        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the Investigator, based on a
             complete medical history, physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse
             rate), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Subjects with a partner who is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be
             willing to use male contraception (condom or sexual abstinence) from the first
             administration of trial medication until 30 days after last administration of trial
             medication

          -  Age of 18 to 45 years (incl.) at screening

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.) at screening

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation - Good Clinical Practice
             (ICH-GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate or
             Electrocardiogram (ECG)) deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant by
             the Investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             Investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy and
             simple hernia repair) that could interfere with the PK of the trial medication

          -  Diseases of the Central Nervous System (CNS) (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or acute infections which are of relevance in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients)

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Tobacco usage (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes per day)

          -  Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than 30 g per day)

          -  Drug abuse or positive drug screening

          -  Blood donation of more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended donation during the trial

          -  Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the Investigator; for instance, is
             considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a
             condition that would not allow safe participation in the study

          -  Unwillingness to adhere to the rules of UV-light protection
