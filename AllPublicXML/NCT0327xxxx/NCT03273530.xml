  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial, the researchers investigated the effectiveness of
      integrated supported employment (ISE) as compared with individual placement and support (IPS)
      and traditional vocational rehabilitation (TVR) for people with schizophrenia in mainland
      China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and sixty-two participants with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to ISE (n =
      54), IPS (n = 54), and or TVR (n = 54). Blinded assessments of employment status, job tenure,
      and psychological outcomes were conducted at admission, completion of the 3-mo program, and
      follow-up at 7, 11, and 15 mo.
