  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apparent Life-Threatening Events (ALTE) in infants often lead to severe neurological
      complications or to sudden death. In such situations, cardio-pediatricians and intensive care
      physicians have no specific diagnosis or treatment. In a recent translational research
      (INSERM-DHOS), our team has reported a myocardiac abnormality in a rabbit model of vagal
      hyperreactivity which is also present in the human hearts of infants deceased from sudden
      death, i.e. increased M2 muscarinic receptors (M2R) density associated with compensative
      increased enzymatic activity and overexpression of acetylcholine esterase (AchE). In a recent
      PHRC-I study (article in preparation), these abnormalities have also been observed in the
      blood of patients, infants as well as adults, exhibiting severe vagal syncopes. We observed,
      even more importantly, similar abnormalities in infants under 1 year of age with very severe
      idiopathic ALTE (iALTE) compared with normal subjects and with patients who presented ALTE
      with identified etiologies (JAMA Pediatric, 2016 May). The aim of this present study is to
      validate the overexpression of M2R as a marker of risk of iALTE in infant under 1 year.
