      Efficacy and Tolerance Evaluation of an Anti-age Food Supplement: a Randomized, Controlled
      Clinical Study Versus Untreated Group
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-age activity of &quot;Pre-Hyaluron 465 Innēov&quot; a food
      supplement, composed with a precursor of HA (glucosamine) and an enzymatic co-factor of HA
      synthesis (manganese), taken for 4 consecutive months by female subjects aged 35-60 years
      (with preference for subjects over 45 years), with moderate-severe skin aging/photoaging
      according to a reference photographic scale.

      The study foresaw the evaluation of the study product activity versus a control group,
      untreated.
