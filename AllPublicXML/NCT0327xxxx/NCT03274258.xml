      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if a combination of nivolumab and
      ipilimumab can help to control locally advanced or metastatic (has spread) renal medullary
      carcinoma (RMC).

      This is an investigational study. Nivolumab is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat many types of cancer, including renal cell cancer after patients have received therapy
      to control blood vessel growth. Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat metastatic melanoma. It is considered investigational to use nivolumab and ipilimumab
      to treat RMC.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      During the combination phase of this study, each study cycle is 21 days (3 weeks). During the
      maintenance phase of this study, each study cycle is 28 days (4 weeks).

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, during the combination phase, you
      will receive nivolumab by vein over about 60 minutes and ipilimumab by vein over about 90
      minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-4. After that,the maintenance phase begins. During the
      maintenance phase, you will receive nivolumab alone by vein over about 60 minutes on Day 1 of
      each cycle.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may receive the study drugs in combination for up to 4 cycles. After that, you may
      receive nivolumab alone for up to 2 years or until the disease gets worse, whichever comes
      first. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Treatment Beyond Progression (Worsening):

      If the disease appears to be getting worse or the tumors appear to be getting larger, you may
      still be able to receive nivolumab alone or in combination with ipilimumab if you and your
      doctor decide it is in your best interest. This is because sometimes the disease appears to
      get worse but the study drug(s) are actually working.

      However, there are risks of continuing to receive the study drug(s). For example, the disease
      may actually be getting worse and may reach the point that you are no longer able to receive
      other treatments. You are still at risk for side effects due to the study drug(s). This could
      also delay starting other treatments.

      If you choose to receive the study drug(s) after the disease appears to get worse, you will
      continue to have study visits as described above. The study doctor will discuss this option
      with you.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine testing.

        -  Your blood oxygen level will be tested by a clip on your finger.

      At Weeks 6, 12, and then every 8 weeks after that (Weeks 20, 28, 36 and so on):

        -  You will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If needed, you may also have bones/skeletal survey
           or bone scan. A bone/skeletal survey is a series of X-rays.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) and urine will be drawn for routine testing.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 30 days and 90 days after your last dose of study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your blood oxygen level will be tested by a clip on your finger.

        -  If you stopped taking the study drugs because of a side effect and depending on when
           your last scan was, you will have an MRI and/or CT scan. If needed, you may also have an
           x-ray or bone scan.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      You will be called by a member of the study staff every 3 months to ask how you are doing and
      if you have started any new anti-cancer treatments. This information may be collected from
      your medical record instead. If called, this phone call should take about 5-10 minutes.

             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of ipilimumab or nivolumab or that
             might affect the interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at
             high risk from treatment complications.

         15. Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated live vaccines within one week
             (7 days) of study entry or during study period; Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for
