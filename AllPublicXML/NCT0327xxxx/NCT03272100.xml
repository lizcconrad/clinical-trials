  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is assumed that the reduction of the flap dimension could provide a reduction of surgical
      time, post surgical complications and patient's discomfort when compared with the traditional
      surgical approach.

      16 edentulous patients in maxillary posterior area were treated with a bilateral sinus lift
      procedure. Once enrolled in the study impressions were realised and the radiographic stent
      prepared, with radio-opaque references fixed in the positions where the implants should be
      inserted. Pre-surgical CT scan was executed after placing the stent in its proper position in
      patient's mouth. If no surgical contra-indications were detected at CT evaluation, patients
      were involved in the study.

        all the involved patients were edentulous in the maxillary posterior area , bilaterally,
        with a residual bone heigh of less then 4 mm; for this reason they required a surgical bone
        reconstruction for implant placement.
