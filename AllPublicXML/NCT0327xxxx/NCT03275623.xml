    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if treatment of pregnant women with urine cultures
      with a low level of bacteria (less than 100,000 colony forming units (CFU)) may decrease
      adverse pregnancy outcomes.

    <description>Those randomized for treatment will be prescribed the most commonly used antibiotic for urinary tract infections in pregnancy. This includes: Nitrofurantoin, Cephalexin, and Amoxicillin. It is unsure which antibiotic the participant will receive but a majority of the time it will be one of the above named antibiotic. The choice will be determined by the physician, but will accommodate participants' prior medication history and adverse events.</description>
