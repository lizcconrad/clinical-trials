  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis are often delayed in hospitalized patients, leading
      to worse outcomes. Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis currently relies on microscopy and
      molecular techniques, which have limitations including low sensitivity and high cost.Highly
      sensitive diagnostic technique is needed for more accurate rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis to
      aid earlier initiation of antituberculous therapy. Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
      (MTB) antigens in the bloodstream can potentially allow early diagnosis of tuberculosis. This
      study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a novel assay using nanotechnology to
      detect MTB antigens in patients admitted to hospital with suspected pulmonary and/or
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Blood will be taken from eligible patients, and will be sent to
      the School of Biological and Health Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, for
      detection of 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) and the 6 kDa early secretory antigenic
      target (ESAT-6), two antigens specific for MTB, using the Nanodisk-MS assay. Investigations,
      including microscopy, culture, MTB polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and imaging, will be
      performed for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The diagnostic performance of Nanodisk-mass
      spectrometry (MS) assay will be evaluated.

    <description>Nanodisk-MS assay is a recently reported novel assay for quantitative detection of various MTB antigen peptides, using nanotechnology and mass spectrometry that showed remarkable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing active pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This assay detected MTB-specific antigens, CFP-10 and ESAT-6, in patients' serum samples.</description>
