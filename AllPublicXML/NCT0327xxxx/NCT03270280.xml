  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontitis is an infectious inflammatory disease affecting the periodontal tissue
      (Gingivae, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament and cementum). Chronic Periodontitis is
      considered to be the most prevalent disease after dental caries which is linked to increased
      levels of C- reactive protein, interleukins and matrix metallo-proteinases. Interleukin- 1β
      and Matrix metalloproteinase-8 have been shown to be robust markers of inflammatory cascade
      of chronic periodontitis.Various treatment modalities including scaling and root planing,
      toothpastes and chlorhexidine based mouthwashes have been are known to be associated with
      various side effects like teeth staining, altered taste sensation, mucosal burning. Hence,the
      use of natural medicaments could provide a better alternative because of their fewer side
      effects and cost effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is one of the most common diseases in humans and is responsible for most
      of the tooth loss in adults. World health Organisation report of 2005 described that the
      global problem persisted with the worldwide oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal
      disease, tooth loss, oral mucosal lesions and oro-pharyngeal cancer. According to a local
      study the prevalence of periodontitis is found to be more in males of older age group and
      more in rural areas owing to the lack of awareness of importance of oral hygiene.

      Apart from various conventional treatment option for periodontitis a number of herbal
      medicinal intervention have been used for its treatment. Plant extracts and herbs that have
      been used previously used for periodontal therapy include Salvadora persica, Arnica Montana
      and Hamamelis virginiana which have been shown to exhibit antibacterial activity against
      periodonto-pathic bacteria. Phytomedicines (Medicines derived from herbal plants) like indian
      gum arabic, aloe vera, nim, carvacrol, garlic, wild coffee and propolis resin have been used
      in dentistry as anti-inflammatory, antibiotics, analgesic and hypnotic agents. Propolis
      resin, guava and triphala have been also been used for the treatment of periodontitis
