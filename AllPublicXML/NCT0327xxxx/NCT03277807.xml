      This prospective observational study assesses whether women who regularly exercise during
      pregnancy show reduced low grade Inflammation, compared to women who are not regularly
      exercising. Furthermore, the effects of regular physical activity in pregnancy on fetal and
      neonatal outcomes will be investigated. 3 groups of pregnant women will be formed (group 1:
      regularly physically active women; group 2: physically inactive women and group 3: women with
      a history of preeclampsia or positive history of metabolic conditions increasing the risk of
      hypertensive disorders in pregnancy).

      Pregnancy is a natural state of low grade inflammation in the mother and the feto-placental
      unit. The severity of this inflammation increases with higher pregravid Body Mass Index
      (BMI). This is reflected by an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the maternal
      circulation and in the placenta. It has been proposed that the pro-inflammatory maternal and
      fetal environment plays a role in mediating pregnancy outcomes.

      In non-pregnant individuals regular physical activity is associated with a reduced
      inflammatory state. The overall objective of the study is to investigate the interaction of
      maternal physical activity and pregnancy induced low-grade inflammation in the mother and
      feto-placental unit, and to assess th resulting effects on prenatal and postnatal
      development.

      Specific research objective will be to study effects of maternal physical activity on:

        1. low grade Inflammation in the mother an feto-placental unit;

        2. maternal and fetal lipid profiles, including High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) proteome;

        3. fetal growth and infant body composition;

        4. transcriptomic and epigenetic profile in the placenta;

        5. biomarkers of nutritive status;

        6. psychological assessment: cardiac awareness; assessment of arterial stiffness;
           stress-coping questionaire

        Women with an ongoing healthy pregnancy. 3 groups will be formed: Group1 consists of women
        performing moderate to vigorous physical activity (PA) before and in early pregnancy.
        Group2 consists of women who are not physically active, and Group3 consists of women with a
        risk of hypertensive disorders or metabolic diseases (not diabetes). PA before and in early
        pregnancy will be assessed with a screening questionnaire. Women reporting a minimum of 150
        mins of moderate to vigorous PA per week will be classified as active, women with less PA
        will be classified as inactive. 20 women each group will be recruited not later than 14
        weeks of gestation. Women will be recruited at the outpatient clinic at the Department of
        Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz.
