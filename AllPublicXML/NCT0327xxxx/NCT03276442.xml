  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolism is increasingly recognized as being highly regulated by anticipatory biological
      rhythms (circadian rhythms or &quot;biorhythms&quot;), which are driven by molecular feedback loops,
      and which are approximately 24 hours long (&quot;circa diem&quot;). These circadian rhythms exist both
      centrally, in the brain, but also in the periphery, and are specific to many tissues
      depending on their main biological function or functions. Whereas these circadian rhythms
      have been thoroughly characterized in other organisms, their role in humans remain poorly
      understood, partly because of the difficulty in studying these rhythms in peripheral tissues.
      The investigators therefore aim to characterize these rhythms in primarily skeletal muscle
      and adipose tissue in healthy young volunteers (using the so-called constant routine
      paradigm), and how these rhythms interact with one another at various genetic and molecular
      levels. At the same time, the investigators aim to study how an unhealthy vs. healthy diet
      can alter these circadian rhythms, and how they interact with circadian rhythms in other
      tissue compartments such as those expressed by blood cells.
