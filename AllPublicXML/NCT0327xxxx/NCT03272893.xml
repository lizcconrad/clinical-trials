  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research project is to explore if levels of inflammation predict levels of
      comorbid mood disorders and treatment success in chronic pain patients. More knowledge in
      this respect will advance our understanding of chronic pain and comorbid syndromes, and
      facilitate subgroupings of patients based on the presence and/or level of low-grade
      inflammation. This research is an important step towards finding an explanation to why
      treatment effects following behavioral interventions differ across individuals, and generate
      new hypothesis regarding novel treatment approaches. The specific aims are: 1) to explore if
      baseline levels of inflammatory biomarkers predict the effects of behavioral intervention and
      2) to investigate if baseline levels of inflammatory biomarkers are associated with
      psychological co-morbidity (e.g. depression, anxiety and fatigue) in patients with chronic
      pain.

    <description>The main component in the treatment is exposure to symptoms and feared situations. The iACT program is adapted from the evidence based face-to-face treatment at the Behavioral Medicine unit at Karolinska University Hospital. The iACT program has a different structure but is equal in content to face-to-face treatment, and is to be completed within ten weeks. Participants receive texts, audio files, movies and exercises and have online contact with their psychologist via an internet platform or a smart phone application. The treatment aims to encourage valued behaviors in the presence of inner discomfort.</description>
