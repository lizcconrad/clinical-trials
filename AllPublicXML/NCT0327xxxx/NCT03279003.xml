  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Light-emitting diode (LED) light therapy is increasingly used successfully and without
      adverse effects in diabetic leg ulcer, chronic low back pain, chronic myofacial pain in the
      neck and in several dermatoses such as acne, Psoriasis, alopecia areata and skin
      rejuvenation. A Korean study conducted in 2013 suggested its effectiveness in patients with
      sensitive skin in connection with rosacea, acne, eczema. The objective of the study is to
      perform a study in subjects with a sensitive skin without associated dermatosis.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of light-emitting diode therapy in
      subjects with sensitive skin and to assess pain improvement, evaluation of improvement in
      pruritus and evaluation of treatment tolerance.
