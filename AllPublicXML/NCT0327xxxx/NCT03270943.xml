  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of depression increases markedly over the course of adolescence. Adolescents
      struggling with depression are often set on a maladaptive behavior trajectory which may lead
      to academic challenges, substance abuse, risky sexual behavior, impairment in relationship
      building, and suicidality. The S.M.A.R.T Project (Stress Management and Resilience Training
      for Teens) is designed to learn about mood in teens, and whether emotional well-being can be
      improved with an 8 week class. The study proposes to refine and test the feasibility of a
      mindfulness-based self-compassion training program for adolescents who are experiencing
      subsyndromal depression, comparing it with a &quot;healthy lifestyles&quot; group program as a
      comparison attention-control for the treatment intervention. Secondarily, the study will
      explore the impact of these programs on measures of psychopathology and well-being (i.e.
      depressive symptoms and resilience).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms are common in adolescents, with 20-25% of adolescents experiencing a
      depressive episode before they graduate high school, and implications into adulthood. Since
      depression often first appears in adolescence and unsuccessful treatment of adolescent
      depression increases the risk of chronic or recurrent depression in adulthood, managing
      depression symptoms at this critical stage of development can benefit mental health and
      functioning throughout the lifespan. Preliminary studies have indicated that a mindful
      self-compassion program is a promising intervention to prevent depression and improve
      wellbeing in at-risk teens.

      The S.M.A.R.T Project (Stress Management and Resilience Training for Teens) is designed to
      learn about mood in teens, and whether emotional well-being can be improved with an 8 week
      class. In this study, 80 adolescents ages 14-17 ,with subsyndromal depression, will be
      randomized to either the 8-week mindful self-compassion intervention or the 8-week healthy
      lifestyles control program, followed by 6 monthly continuation sessions. Feasibility of the
      research protocol and of the program elements will be assessed. Focus group feedback will
      also inform program modifications and refinement. Additionally, baseline, mid-intervention,
      and 3- and 6-months post intervention measurements of depression, resilience, and other
      related psychosocial measures will allow preliminary exploration of the impact of each
      program on outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be randomized to one of two groups: a mindful self-compassion program or an active attention control program. Randomization will be stratified by gender. As soon as 20 eligible adolescents qualify for enrollment, they will be allocated to either the MFY or healthy lifestyle groups, using a specially-designed computer program which utilizes a random number generator with a permuted block design to ensure that the number of subjects allocated to the two arms over time are equal and to conceal the allocation. This will continue through 4 cohorts of adolescents (n=80). This study is a planning grant for development of an adequately powered clinical trial. Randomization is designed to assess feasibility of our randomization plan, in addition to general feasibility issues of the delivery of the educational programs.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The nature of the interventions tested in this study does not allow for masking of subjects, instructors, or other personnel involved in program delivery. To preserve unbiased outcome assessments, study personnel involved in clinical assessments or data analysis will be masked with respect to group assignment. To minimize differences in subject expectancy, the programs will be described to participants as two programs, both of which have been previously found to be beneficial to teens.</masking_description>

    <measure>Time (weeks) to incident depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until onset of incident depression, up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) is a measure of the level of depressive symptoms. There is a 13-item youth version (SMFQ-C) and 13-item parent version (SMFQ-P). Items are symptoms of depression experienced over the past 2 weeks. Each item is scored on a 3-point Likert scale as follows: &quot;True&quot; (0), &quot;Sometimes&quot; (1), and &quot;Not True&quot; (2). A score of 8 on the SMFQ-C (child survey) or a combined score of 12 on the SMFQ-C and SMFQ-P (parent survey) constitutes incident depression. Lower scores over time indicate improvement in incident depression.</description>

    <description>The BRS defines resiliency as the ability to &quot;bounce back&quot; and recover from stress; the items reflect a sense of personal agency. Six items are rated on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) giving a possible scoring range from 6-30. Scores are summed and totals divided by the number of questions answered. Higher scores at each time point indicate increasing resilience.</description>
