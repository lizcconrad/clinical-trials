  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study documenting the neurotoxic side effects including tremors in patients
      with a stable graft who are receiving Tacrolimus following kidney transplantation. A
      standardized questionnaire will be used to document these symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressive therapies have burdensome side effects which may lead to sub-therapeutic
      dosing and non-compliance.

      This study provides renal transplant patients the opportunity for an alternative treatment
      using tacrolimus, with possible less Central Nervous Symptom (CNS) side effects. CNS side
      effects are one of the main reasons that patients complain about after having a kidney
      transplant while on tacrolimus (Prograf). The side effects can be debilitating and can affect
      the patient's overall well-being. In severe cases it may lead to non-compliance. The
      advantage of the study of using Envarsus is the ability to avoid these debilitating CNS side
      effects and afford better compliance with the patients taking the medicine.
