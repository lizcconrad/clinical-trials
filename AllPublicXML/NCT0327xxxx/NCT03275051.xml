  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2696277 is a gene therapy drug product consisting of autologous hematopoietic
      stem/progenitor cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ cells genetically modified with a
      lentiviral vector (GLOBE) encoding the human beta globin gene. The TIGET-BTHAL is a phase
      I/II study evaluating safety and efficacy of GSK2696277 in subjects with transfusion
      dependent beta-thalassemia for two years post gene-therapy. Subjects who have undergone gene
      therapy are at risk of delayed adverse events. Thus, this study is designed as a longer term
      safety and efficacy follow-up of TIGET-BTHAL for a further six years (i.e. until eight years
      post-gene therapy) in subjects who previously completed the TIGET-BTHAL study. Approximately
      10 subjects who have received treatment with GSK2696277 in and completed study TIGET-BTHAL
      will be included in this study. The entire post-gene therapy follow-up will be of eight years
      i.e. two years in TIGET-BTHAL plus six years in this study.
