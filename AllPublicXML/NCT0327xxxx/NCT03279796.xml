  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a single-center, randomized, single-blind clinical trial. We plan to include
      100 patients who met exclusion criteria of rotator cuff and lateral epicondylosis (tennis
      elbow) respectively by MRT or ultrasonography. The patients will be randomly divided into two
      groups. Adipose mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue, cultured and
      then transplanted back to the tendon injury site by multiple point injection. 1*10^6 cells as
      an unit. Patients in the experiment group will be injected into an unit of adipose
      mesenchymal stem cells (1*10^6/10kg) while the control group received the same dose compound
      betamethasone injection. Follow up visit for all patients will occur at 1，3，6 and 12 months
      after the first injection. Clinical quantitative assessment will measure by the visual
      analogue scale(VAS). The secondary outcomes are the constant-murley score(CMS) and the rating
      scale of the American shoulder and elbow surgeons(ASES) and the disability of arm shoulder
      and hand(DASH). The objective evaluation methods is that the examination of MRI or ultrasound
      were accomplished before the first injection and at 6 and 12 months afterwards.
