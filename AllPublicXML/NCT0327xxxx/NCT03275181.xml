  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to determine whether androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) decreases
      left ventricular function in prostate cancer patients. If found successful, this may lead to
      improved cardiovascular health via treatment and/or lifestyle interventions in prostate
      cancer populations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate Cancer is the second most common cancer among American men. Approximately 1 in 7 men
      will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. In prostate cancer patients
      alone, hypotestosteronemia, caused by prostate cancer treatment is associated with visceral
      adiposity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, decreased high-density lipoprotein,
      increased low-density lipoprotein, increased triglycerides, loss of muscle mass, erectile
      disfunction, and a loss of microvascular endothelial function. Recently, several
      population-based studies have reported an association between androgen deprivation therapy
      and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, that include myocardial infarction and
      cardiovascular mortality. Given this link and the growing evidence that androgen-deprivation
      therapy adversely affects traditional risk factors, it is essential to better understand the
      role this type of treatment has on cardiac structure and function. As such, the manifestation
      of cardiovascular toxicities with prostate cancer treatment will initially be subclinical
      (left ventricular function changes in asymptomatic individuals) compared to clinical
      (including coronary symptoms or heart failure) and may develop subacutely (during treatment)
      or chronically.
