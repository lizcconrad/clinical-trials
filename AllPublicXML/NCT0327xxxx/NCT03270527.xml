  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Raised blood cholesterol (also referred to as blood LDL-cholesterol) is a major risk factor
      for developing heart disease. Dietary saturated fat is recognised as the main dietary
      component responsible for raising blood LDL-cholesterol, and reducing its intake has been the
      mainstay of dietary guidelines for the prevention of heart disease for over 30 years.
      However, there is very little evidence for a direct link between the intake of saturated fat
      and risk of dying from heart disease. One explanation for this, is that the link between
      saturated fat intake and heart disease is not a direct one, but relies heavily on the ability
      of saturated fat to raise blood LDL-cholesterol levels. This LDL cholesterol-raising effect
      of saturated fat is complex, and highly variable between individuals because of differences
      in the metabolism of dietary fat and cholesterol between people. The main aim of this study
      is to measure the amount of variation in blood LDL-cholesterol in 150 healthy volunteers (75
      at the University of Surrey and 75 at the University of Reading) in response to lowering the
      amount of saturated fat in the diet to the level recommended by the government for the
      prevention of heart disease. This collaborative project between the Universities of Reading,
      Surrey and Imperial ('RISSCI-1 Blood Cholesterol Response Study') will permit identification
      of two subgroups of men who show either a high or low LDL-cholesterol response to a reduction
      in dietary saturated intake. These participants (n=36) will be provided with an opportunity
      to participate in a similar follow-up study ('RISSCI-2') that will also take place at the
      University of Surrey and Reading. In this follow-up study, the participants will be asked to
      repeat a similar study protocol as for RISSCI-1, but undergo more detailed measurements to
      determine how saturated fat is metabolised in the body.

    <textblock>
      The LDL cholesterol-raising effect of saturated fat is complex, and highly variable between
      individuals because of differences in the metabolism of dietary fat and cholesterol between
      people. While these differences in metabolism make it difficult to study how dietary
      saturated fat influences LDL-cholesterol in large numbers of people, they can be measured in
      the laboratory and used as biological markers to distinguish between people who respond well
      from those who will respond less well to moderate-fat diets which are lower in saturated fat.

      The main aim of this study is to measure the amount of variation in blood LDL-cholesterol in
      150 healthy volunteers (75 at the University of Surrey and 75 at the University of Reading)
      in response to lowering the amount of saturated fat in their diet to the level recommended by
      the United Kingdom government for the prevention of coronary heart disease.

      The specific objectives of the study are as follows:

        1. Undertake a dietary intervention study to examine the effects of two, 4 week diets that
           differ in their composition of fatty acids. The first diet ('Diet 1') will contain ~18%
           of its total energy as saturated fatty acids (SFA), while the second diet ('Diet 2')
           will contain ~10% of its total energy as SFA. Blood, urine and stool samples taken at
           the beginning (week 0) and end of Diet 1 (week 4), and end of Diet 2 (week 8), will be
           analysed to measure blood LDL-cholesterol and other relevant blood, urine and faecal
           metabolites. The white blood cell buffy coat will also be isolated from the blood
           samples collected at the baseline visit to enable genotyping of relevant genes involved
           in the absorption and metabolism of dietary fat.

        2. To examine the data for evidence of associations between the changes in blood LDL-
           cholesterol, and the physical and biochemical characteristics of the participants as
           possible determinants of the variation in serum cholesterol response across the whole
           cohort (n=150). This will include measurement of a common genetic polymorphism in
           APOLIPOPROTEIN E, as an established determinant of variation in blood cholesterol in
           response to dietary SFA.

        3. To identify two subgroups of individuals whose blood LDL-cholesterol either responds
           ('Responders') or show little or no response ('Non-responders') on changing from Diet 1
           to Diet 2, for participation in the follow-up study (RISSCI-2), which will be conducted
           at the Universities of Surrey (n=18), Reading (n=18) and Imperial College London. In
           this follow-up study, the participants will be asked to repeat a similar study protocol
           as for RISSCI-1, and undergo more detailed measurements to determine how saturated fat
           is metabolised in the body.

      Hypothesis:

      In accordance with the variation in blood LDL-cholesterol response, that many studies have
      reported previously following substitution of dietary saturated with unsaturated fats, the
      investigators hypothesise that consuming Diet 1 (a high saturated fat diet) for 4 weeks
      followed by diet 2 (a low saturated fat/high unsaturated fat diet) for a further 4 weeks,
      will: 1) produce a variable distribution of responses in LDL-cholesterol that will enable the
      study of associations between the participants' baseline characteristics as possible
      determinants of the observed variation in blood LDL-cholesterol response, and 2) identify two
      distinct subgroups of individuals who either respond or show little or no response in their
      blood LDL- cholesterol. These distinct groups will be defined by the top and bottom 10% of
      change in the concentration of blood LDL-cholesterol in the cohort of 150.

    <description>Participants will undergo, sequentially, a high SFA diet (Diet 1) followed by a low SFA diet (Diet 2) for 4 weeks each. Study visits will occur before and after each dietary intervention period. To comply with current UK dietary recommendations, Diets 1 and 2 will both contain ~35% energy from total fat. These diets will be consumed within the homes of free-living participants, by the substitution of ~40g of habitual fat, with either SFA-rich or mono/poly-unsaturated fatty acid-rich (MUFA/PUFA) cooking oils, spreads and snack foods, while maintaining their habitual diet (consistent intake of protein and carbohydrates, including dietary fibre). This will be achieved using a dietary exchange model developed for the 'DIVAS' study (Vafeiadou K et al (2015) Am J Clin Nut 102, 40-8).</description>
