  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a preliminary study whose objectives are to define the clinical use cases and the
      constraints of the implementation of a multi-sensor image-sound system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      300 000 newborns per year are hospitalized in European neonatal units in the post-natal
      period. This is a critical period for neurobehavioral development and the establishment of an
      optimal model of sleep-wake cycle is fundamental for brain development.

      The objective of the research is to develop new tools for computer-aided clinical and
      predictive diagnosis and real-time monitoring in neonatology.

      The development of non-invasive sensors based on video and sound images aims to improve the
      short- and medium-term prognosis in perinatal patients.

      To that aim, multi-modal composite indices integrating the image (which is used only to
      generate a quantification of the movement) and the sound to the bioelectric signals already
      available (electrocardiogram, oxymetry, temperature) will be developed to provide diagnostic
      and prognostic information.

    <description>After parental information and collection of their non-opposition, the data of the daily cardio-respiratory recordings of the newborns hospitalized in the units of Neonatology are collected and analyzed.
At the same time, a video recording is set up. This video recording does not modify the care provided for the child, the organization of the day with nursing and parental care.</description>
