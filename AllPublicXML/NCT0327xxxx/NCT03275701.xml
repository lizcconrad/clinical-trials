      Phase IV, Single-Arm, Open-Label Study Evaluating Bone Mineral Density in HIV-1-Infected
      Adults ≥50 Years Old Switching from EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (Genvoya) or EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF (Stribild)
      to ABC/DTG/3TC (Triumeq)

      To evaluate the impact on BMD, as measured by DEXA over 48 weeks, of switching from an
      INSTI-based regimen with either TDF or TAF to a regimen of ABC/DTG/3TC (administered as
      commercial Triumeq) in chronic HIV-infected patients over the age of 50

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Documented HIV-1 infection;

          2. At least 50 years of age;

          3. Currently on a stable antiretroviral regimen (for ≥3 months preceding Screening) of
             either EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (Genvoya) or EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF (Stribild);

          4. HIV is currently suppressed, defined as:

               1. Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL for ≥3 months preceding Screening; AND

               2. Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies/mL at the Screening assessment; INCL 5. Documentation
                  that the participant is negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*5701
                  allele.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study period;

          2. Bilateral hip replacement;

          3. Exceeds weight limit for DEXA equipment (i.e., weighs &gt;350 lbs or &gt;159 kg);

          4. History or presence of allergy to the study treatment (Triumeq) or any of its
             components (to ABC, DTG, or 3TC);

          5. Active Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category C HIV-1 disease (see
             Section 17.1 for definition), with the exception of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma, not
             requiring systemic therapy and historic CD4+ cell counts of &lt;200 cells/mm3;

          6. Positive for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) at Screening;

          7. Ongoing malignancies (other than localized malignancies, such as cutaneous Kaposi's
             sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia);

          8. Significant suicidal risk in the investigator's opinion;

          9. Metabolic disease;

         10. Treatment with HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine within 90 days of Screening;

             responses) within 28 days of Screening;

         12. Exposure to any experimental drug or vaccine within 28 days or 5 half-lives of the
             test agent, or twice the duration of the biological effect of the test agent,
             whichever is longer, prior to first dose of study treatment on Day 1;

         13. History of use of only mono or dual NRTI therapy prior to starting combination ART for
             the treatment of HIV infection (except that prior NRTI use for the purpose of
             pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] or postexposure prophylaxis [PEP] is not excluded);

         14. Became HIV-positive (i.e., had a detectable plasma HIV-1 viral load) while taking PrEP
             or PEP;

         15. Documented resistance to any component of the study treatment (ABC, DTG, or 3TC) as
             indicated by either:

               1. Historical genotype in the participant's medical record; OR

               2. Genotype obtained by GenoSure Archive evaluation at Screening;

         16. Any verified screening Grade 4 laboratory abnormality that in the investigator's
             opinion is clinically significant;

         17. Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Class B or greater) as determined by Child-Pugh
             classification;

         18. Either of the following liver chemistry elevations:

               1. Alanine amintotransferase (ALT) ≥5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN); OR

               2. ALT ≥3 x ULN and bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN (with &gt;35% direct bilirubin);

         19. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &lt;50 mL/min (calculated by CockroftGault equation)

         20. QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB) ≥450 msec or
             QTcB ≥480 msec for participants with bundle branch block;

         21. Any other condition or substance use that in the opinion of the investigator places
             the participants at undue risk from participation in the study or that may negatively
