  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled trial compared integrated water jet channel
      colonoscopy with traditional accessory channel colonoscopy in cecal insertion time among
      patients undergoing WE method colonoscopy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When the WE method colonoscopy were done with the accessory channel for both infusing and
      suctioning of water. The water had to be suctioned or infused alternatively and increaed the
      insertion time.

      With the new designed endoscopy that integrated a separate water jet channel for infusing
      water, infusing and suctioning of water can be done at the same time. Besides, water jet
      pumping system could provide a powerful jet to help us open the collapse lumen and keep an
      appropriate distance between the mucosa and the lens, thus preventing loss of visualization.
      It will help the colonoscopist to find the way during insertion.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 120 patients were allocated into one of two groups by computerized randomization. In group A (Two-channel group), clear water was infused through the water jet channel and dirty water was sucked form the accessy channel. In group B (One-channel group), water exchange was done by using the accessory channel for both infusing and suctioning of water.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Cecal insertion time was defined as the time from insertion into the rectum to the time when the colonoscope tip passed to a point proximal to the ileocecal valve so that the base of cecum was visible.</description>
