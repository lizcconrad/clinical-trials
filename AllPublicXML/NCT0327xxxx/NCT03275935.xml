      This study analyzes the prevalence of patients using inhalation devices via incorrect
      technique and access the adherence of patients to correct inhalation technique when taught
      along with their subjective improvement of symptoms.

      This is a one group pretest- posttest design conducted in all patients presenting in Chest
      clinic of Dhulikhel Hospital-Kathmandu University Hospital, Nepal from March 2017 to May
      2017. Patients diagnosed of having COPD, Asthma or Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) and
      were under inhalation bronchodilators in the form of Dry Powder Device via Rotahaler were
      included. Enrolled patients are assessed for inhalation technique compliance at their routine
      medical (pre-training) visits by physician. The use of inhaler device is evaluated in a
      practical manner by asking the patients to demonstrate their inhalation technique. After the
      assessment, instructions and training are given until they can use the device correctly. One
      month later (post-training), all patients are re-evaluated in regards to inhalation technique
      and subjective improvement of symptoms.

    <description>An observation checklist measuring essential steps required for adequate drug delivery for Rotahaler was developed. The number of required steps are seven and the correctness of the seven-step inhalation technique was measured by giving a score 0 for incorrect action and 1 for correct action. Each of the seven steps were scored 1 or 0, giving a total score of 0-7. After assessment, instructions were given with demonstrations regarding the correct use of Rotahaler. One month later (post-training visit), all patients were re-evaluated</description>
