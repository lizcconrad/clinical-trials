      Introduction: new methods of evaluation of respiratory function, such as electrical impedance
      tomography (EIT) and optoelectronic plethysmography (OEP), have been used to measure regional
      pulmonary ventilation and the variation of tricompartmental volumes of the thoracic cavity,
      respectively. Analysis of these instruments during maximal respiratory maneuvers with
      monitoring of esophageal pressure may probably provide additional information on the
      physiological behavior of the cardiorespiratory system during EIT and OEP maneuvers.
      Objectives: To describe the physiological behavior of maximal respiratory maneuvers through
      the electrical impedance tomography and optoelectronic plethysmography in healthy men.

      METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 10 healthy male volunteers. The
      development of the method will take place in 3 stages. The first step corresponds to the
      characterization of the inspiratory and expiratory curves in the respiratory cycle generated
      by the impedance variation (ΔZ), the mobility of the chest wall and the pulmonary volume
      curve during maximal respiratory maneuvers. 2nd stage: verification of the correlation
      between the variables Step 3: Estimate the dislocated blood volume of the lung through
      previous analyzes.

      The physiological repercussions resulting from the maximal respiratory maneuvers together
      with the synchronized analysis of the chest cavity mobility, pulmonary volume , pulmonary
      impedance and measurement of Oesophageal pressure is not known. Therefore, this study aims to
      describe the physiological behavior of maximal respiratory maneuvers through the
      synchronization between electrical impedance tomography and optoelectronic plethysmography in
      healthy men.
