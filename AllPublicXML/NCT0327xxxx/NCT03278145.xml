  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute leukaemias (AL) are the first cause of cancer in children, with a majority of B acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Some of the processes causing leukemogenesis are already
      identified and well characterized in some AL subtypes such as translocation t (12; 21) of
      good prognosis in ALL. However, translocations are not sufficient to explain all the
      different processes of leukemogenesis, and other processes such as genetic / epigenetic
      mutations leading to oncogene activation / inhibition of tumor suppressor genes are the
      object research. Among the latter, mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as DCC (Deleted
      in Colorectal Cancer) have recently been identified in solid cancers, such as in hemopathies.
      This gene was subsequently characterized as encoding a &quot;dependence receptor&quot; specifically
      binding to its Netrin-1 ligand.

      Dependence receptors (RDs) are transmembrane receptors that cause cell death in the absence
      of their ligand. RD decreases tumor progression and overexpression of their ligands is
      observed in many cancers, such as B lymphomatous hemopathies in adults. Inhibition of the
      RD-ligand interaction constitutes a new and original therapeutic target in oncology.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether RDs, in particular DCC, are expressed in
      acute leukemia cells at the time of diagnosis or relapse in patients aged 1 to 18 years, and
      then in these patients at the time of the remission balance. This research will be both
      qualitative and quantitative.

    <description>Primary endpoint: presence of specific labeling of the DCC-dependent receptor on the surface of leukemic cells that will be detectable in flow cytometry.
This marking will be both qualitative (positive signal = presence of the receptor, absence of signal = absence of the receptor), and quantitative (percentage of expression of the receptor on the surface of the cells).</description>

The same patients will benefit from a new sample at the time of their remission balance. Analyses for this research will be made from bone marrow aspiration samples performed for diagnosis and treatment of these patients. The medical team will investigate whether RDs, in particular DCC, are expressed in acute leukemia cells at the time of diagnosis or relapse and then in these patients at the time of the remission balance. This research will be both qualitative and quantitative. Next, investigators will characterize the existence and then the level of expression of the ligand specific for DCC, Netrin-1, in these same leukemic cells, at the time of diagnosis / relapse and remission.</description>
