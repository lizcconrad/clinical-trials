  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Main proposed benefit of sleeve gastrectomy is loss of ghrelin secreting tissue. Some studies
      express that ghrelin augment pancreatic regeneration. Therefore we hypothesized that with
      sleeve gastrectomy it may result with pancreatic insufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanism of weight loss differs in bariatric surgery according to type of surgery.

      With sleeve gastrectomy which has restrictive mechanism, ghrelin excretion decreases, and
      this condition is attributed as an additional mechanism in weight loss.

      Ghrelin effects pancreatic regeneration, and loss of ghrelin may result with pancreatic
      insufficiency. Therefore we aimed to deteremine this association.
