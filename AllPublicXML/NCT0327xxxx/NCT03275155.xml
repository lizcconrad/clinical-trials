      This prospective non-interventional cohort study investigates the pathophysiology of Atrial
      Fibrillation Detected After Stroke or transient ischemic attack (AFDAS) by comparing the
      autonomic function and inflammation between patients with AFDAS, patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF) diagnosed before the ischemic event or known AF (KAF), and patients with
      normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after 14 day of cardiac monitoring following the event onset.

      This study enrolls patients with acute ischemic stroke at the London Health Sciences Center
      in London, Ontario, Canada. The heart rhythm of the patients is monitored with a CardioSTAT®
      Holter device (Icentia) for 14 days after the ischemic event onset. Based on this cardiac
      monitoring and previous medical history, patients are stratified into three groups: (a)
      atrial fibrillation detected after stroke or transient ischemic attack (AFDAS), (b) atrial
      fibrillation diagnosed before the ischemic event or known AF (KAF), and (c) normal sinus
      rhythm (NSR).

      Autonomic function is assessed by the levels of plasma catecholamines, a battery of validated
      autonomic tests [autonomic reflex screening (ARS)], heart rate variability (HRV) through data
      obtained by Holter monitoring by standard quantitative analysis methods according to the
      guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and
      Electrophysiology and by the analysis of diurnal variation of heart rate. Blood samples are
      collected for the analysis of inflammatory markers (e.g. CRP, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and
      potential AFDAS predictors such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP- AFDAS biomarker),
      endothelin-1 (endothelial dysfunction marker), Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and
      thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) plasma levels, TAFI activity, TAFI single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), apo(a) isoform size and plasma catecholamines levels.
      Furthermore, specific neuroimaging findings (e.g., specific regions of the insula or its
      connections) and clinical features (e.g., impaired interoceptive processing, cognitive
      impairment, etc) are also analyzed. Interoception is assessed using a heartbeat detection
      task without feedback condition and gait, balance, frailty, and cognitive status in patients
      are evaluated by the administration of a battery of tests. Stroke recurrence will be assessed
      by a structured phone interview at 6 and 12 months after the initial stroke.
