  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a chronic acquired cutaneous disease of pigmentation that affects patients'
      quality of life across all degrees of involvement and severity. Phototherapy, such as Narrow
      band UVB (NB-UVB), is a clinically indicated treatment for skin lesions. NB-UVB treatment has
      been shown to promote repigmentation and normalize cellular behaviors. The investigators
      would like to analyze the change in protein expression and histological change in skin from
      NB-UVB treatment in participants with Vitiligo.

      The investigators are recruiting participants with Vitiligo on the body, arms, and/or legs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dermatology study of the effects of short-term NB-UVB treatment, standard
      phototherapy for Vitiligo patients. In the study, demographics information, three ascending
      dose of phototherapy, and small skin biopsies will be required of the participants.

      For all enrolled participants, the starting dose of NB-UVB administered will be 250 mJ/cm2,
      which is the standard of care for patients with Vitiligo. The dose will be increased by 10%
      with each treatment, as long as there are no side effects with treatment such as burning or
      redness/ erythema. Small skin biopsies will be collected from normal skin and from affected
      skin from vitiligo participants at the baseline visit and 3 days after the conclusion of
      treatment; up to a total of 6 biopsies will be collected from each patient. Participants will
      be compensated for time and effort.

    <description>This is an investigator-initiated, single-blinded, ascending dose study of NB-UVB treatment for Vitiligo in adults of 3 treatments for one week. It is designed to measure the molecular changes and re-pigmentation in affected and normal skin of participants with Vitiligo and normal skin in healthy participants.</description>
