    <textblock>
      Primary end point of the study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental
      evaluations tolerance and efficacy of a bio-revitalizing product containing hyaluronic acid
      with high (H-HA) and low (L-HA) molecular weight; the micro-injection of the study product
      was performed by a specialized dermatologist, bilaterally on the face (zygomatic
      protuberance, nostril's angle, inferior margin of tragus, lip marionette lines, mandibular
      angle) of healthy female volunteers aged 30-60 years.

      It was also aim of this study to evaluate efficacy by the volunteers and tolerance both by
      investigator and volunteers.

    <time_frame>Basal visit (T0), Week 4 (T4W) , Week 8 (T8W), Week 12 (T12W), Week 16 (T16W).</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction of wrinkles severity corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) clinical score where:
Grade 1 (absent): no visible nasolabial fold; continuous skin line. Grade 2 (mild): shallow but visible nasolabial fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature.
Grade 3 (moderate): moderately deep nasolabial folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched.
Grade 4 (severe): very long and deep nasolabial folds; prominent facial feature; &lt;2mm visible fold when stretched.
Grade 5 (very severe): extremely deep and long nasolabial fold, detrimental to facial appearance; 2-4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched.</description>

    <measure>Facial Volume Loss Scale (FVLS) improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction of face volume loss corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Facial Volume Loss Scale (FVLS) where Grade 1 Mild flattening or shadowing of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas). No prominent bony landmarks. No visibility of underlying musculature.
Grade 2 An intermediate point between grade 1 and grade 3. Grade 3 Moderate concavity of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas. Prominence of bony landmarks. May have visibility of underlying musculature.
Grade 4 An intermediate point between grade 3 and grade 5. Grade 5 Severe indentation of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas). Severe prominence of bony landmarks. Clear visibility of underlying musculature.</description>

    <measure>Determination of profilometric parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Basal visit (T0), Week 4 (T4W) , Week 8 (T8W), Week 12 (T12W), Week 16 (T16W).</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction of the nasolabial fold and marionette lines profilometric parameters versus baseline where Ra is average roughness of the analysed profile, Rt is wrinkles total high, Rv is wrinkles maximum depth.
Replicas of nasolabial fold and marionette lines are obtained using silicone rubber. A picture of the skin replicas is taken thanks to Primos compact portable device (GFMesstechnik); Primos software is able to elaborate 3D representations of skin wrinkles as well as to measure skin principal profilometric parameters.</description>
