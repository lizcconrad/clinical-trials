  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine implant design and determine if method of fixation
      cemented versus cementless results in different bone loss patterns. The investigators also
      want to determine if clinical outcomes correlate with bone density changes.

      Patients who present to the clinical practices of Dr. Ryan Nunley and Dr. Robert Barrack and
      are suitable candidates for primary total knee arthroplasty(TKA) type assigned either
      cemented or cementless and Triathlon knee or Depuy by surgeon will be screened for
      eligibility and invited to participate. Data collected for the study will include standard of
      care clinical and radiographic evaluations collected during office visits and surgery, Dual
      Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry(DEXA) Bone density monitoring, as well as study-specific patient
      questionnaires. Clinical, radiographic and questionnaire data will be collected
      pre-operatively, at the time of surgery, and at 6 weeks, 1 year and beyond, and 2 years and
      beyond post-operatively. Patients will complete the following outcomes questionnaires
      preoperatively: New Knee Society Score, Oxford Knee Score, UCLA Activity Score, SF-12, and
      EQ-5D. The following questionnaires will be collected at four to six weeks, six months, one
      year and beyond, and two years and beyond postoperatively: New Knee Society Score, Forgotten
      Joint Score, Washington University Knee Satisfaction and Function Questionnaire, Oxford Knee
      Score, UCLA Activity Score, SF-12, and EQ-5D, and a Pain Drawing.
