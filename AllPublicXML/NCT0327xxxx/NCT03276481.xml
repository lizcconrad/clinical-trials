    <measure>Feasibility of comprehensive chemical gustometry in participants with multiple myeloma undergoing autologous HCT</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline assessment up to 180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this protocol is to evaluate the feasibility of comprehensive chemical gustometry in participants with MM undergoing autologous HCT. Chemical gustometry will be evaluated at baseline and on days -1, 7, 14, 30 and 180.</description>

    <intervention_name>Oral microbiota assessment</intervention_name>
    <description>Whole mouth microbiota will be assessed by having participants swish in their mouth 10 ml of sterile water for 30 sec and then expectorate in a sterile container. Specimens will be immediately placed on wet ice and transferred to the laboratory for processing or for storage at -80Â° C until they are ready to be prepared for sequencing.</description>

    <intervention_name>Comprehensive chemical gustometry</intervention_name>
    <description>Chemical gustometry assessments will be performed by a trained clinician on the study team, including a Registered Dietitian, Physician's Assistant, or Research Nurse. The test solutions and gradients will be formulated in house using sterile water and the following constituents: Sweet taste; 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 g/ml sucrose, sour taste; 0.05, 0.09, and 0.165 g/ml citric acid, salty taste; 0.016, 0.04, and 0.1 g/ml NaCl and bitter taste; 0.0004, 0.0009, and 0.0024g/ml quinine-HCl. Umami will be tested with MSG at 25, 50, and 75 mM.</description>

    <intervention_name>Measurement of salivary flow</intervention_name>
    <description>Both stimulated and un-stimulated salivation will be assessed by saliva collection in pre-weighed plastic containers. Participants will be seated with their back at a 90 degree angle and asked to swallow everything in their mouth. They will then be asked not to swallow and spit the accumulated saliva in the plastic container every 30 seconds for two minutes (unstimulated flow). For measurement of stimulated saliva, we will follow the same procedure except that after the initial swallow, participants will have their tongue swabbed twice with a cotton swab dipped in ascorbic acid solution or lemon juice.</description>

        Study subjects will be identified by the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant team. They are
        usually identified in clinic when a treatment plan that includes conditioning chemotherapy
        has been scheduled.
