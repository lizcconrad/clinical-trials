  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AL-335, odalasvir (ODV)
      and its metabolites ALS-022399 and ALS-022227, after a single oral dose of ODV and AL-335
      respectively, in participants with moderately impaired hepatic function compared to
      participants with normal hepatic function. Also to evaluate the steady-state PK of AL-335 and
      its metabolites ALS-022399 and ALS-022227, ODV and simeprevir (SMV) after multiple oral doses
      of the combination of AL-335+ODV+SMV, in participants with moderately impaired hepatic
      function compared to participants with normal hepatic function.
