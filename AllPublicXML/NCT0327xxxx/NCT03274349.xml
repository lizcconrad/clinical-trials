  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective or the trial is to study the influence of a combined therapy involving
      protein-rich individualized nutritional therapy and highly effective muscle training via
      personalized whole-body electromyostimulation exercise on muscle mass, muscle functionality,
      physical capability, fatigue and quality of life in patients with esophageal and bronchial
      carcinoma in advanced or metastatic stage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumor specific and inflammation promoting mediators lead to a loss of appetite, to systemic
      inflammation processes and to metabolic and hormonal changes including anabolic resistance.
      Consequences hereof are a decreased food uptake, a deteriorated nutrient utilization and a
      loss of muscles and/or fat leading to cancer cachexia. In addition, an accelerated muscle
      wasting can be a side effect of the oncologic therapy promoting cancer cachexia even further.
      The advancing muscle loss induces diminishing physical capability, a decreased tolerance of
      oncological therapy, functional losses even reaching loss of independence and a worsened
      prognosis.

      The purpose of this study is to establish an innovative combined therapy involving
      protein-rich nutritional therapy and highly effective muscle training by personalized
      whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) exercise to improve muscle mass, functionality and
      strength of esophageal and bronchial carcinoma patients in advanced stage. An increase in
      muscle mass and strength leads to an increase in physical activity, physical capability as
      well as tolerance to and applicability of tumor therapy. In the course of a 3-months
      intervention study the efficacy of a combined protein-rich nutritional therapy with an
      innovative exercise therapy will be documented for patients with esophageal and bronchial
      carcinoma in advanced or metastatic stage. An effective stopping of the progress of muscle
      wasting or even increase of muscle mass, strength and function in the patients of the trial
      would benefit each patient and his family individually, since it could mean a considerable
      improvement in his quality of life and tolerability of oncological treatment.
