      This study is aiming to evaluate the efficacy of denosumab among adult patients suffering
      from Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority and diversity of clinical manifestations in LCH are attributed to immunological
      dysfunction resulting from langerhans cell (LC) derived cytokine secretion both at the
      lesional and systemic level. In a recent study, Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor Kappa-B
      Ligand (RANKL) was found to be abundantly expressed in cells within diverse LCH lesions from
      adult patients, especially in inflammatory infiltrates, a finding in line with a previously
      reported high osteoprotegerin (OPG) and low RANKL levels in the serum of patients with or
      without bone involvement. RANKL expression was associated with concomitant p65 Nuclear Factor
      Kappa-B (NFκB) nuclear staining, the main downstream effector of RANKL signaling, suggesting
      that lesional cell activation may be triggered locally by RANKL. Combining the serum and the
      lesional results, it can be inferred that there is an ongoing process of countervailing OPG
      production against lesional RANKL, which could be one of the self defense mechanisms among
      LCH patients. Therefore, the use of denosumab seems a rational treatment option in LCH in
      order to support and enhance the defensive OPG action and hopefully control or even interrupt
      the lesional immunological process.

      The primary study objective is to assess the therapeutic efficacy of denosumab 120 mg every 8
      weeks (Q8W) sc in adult LCH patients.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To define an uniform treatment approach for LCH patients with mild symptoms and low risk
           disease.

        2. To explore the efficacy of denosumab 120 mg Q8W sc in reducing disease reactivations
           after treatment completion.

        3. To illustrate the safety profile of denosumab in LCH patients. The primary efficacy
           endpoint is defined as the percentage of patients with progression of disease at Month
           8.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be measured through the incidence of patients with active disease at Month 8. Given that all patients have active disease at baseline the incidence of patients with active disease at Month 8 will provide the efficacy of denosumab in controlling the disease within this time frame.</description>
