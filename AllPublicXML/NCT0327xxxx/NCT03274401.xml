  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism and high thromboembolic risk will be
      randomized to screening for atrial fibrillation or standard of care using intermittent ECG
      registration for at least two weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients included in the study might be referred for an ultrasound of deep vein thrombosis
      unless this has already been performed. Blood will be drawn in a subset of patients to assess
      cardiac biomarkers, and stored in a biobank for further analysis of thrombotic biomarkers. If
      a computed tomography (CT) angiogram was used as diagnostic method for pulmonary embolism a
      radiologic review will be performed to assess presence of right atrium thrombus, with the
      reviewer will be blinded to the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, an
      echocardiogram of the heart will be performed.

      Many patients with pulmonary embolism have prolonged symptoms of dyspnoea, and palpitations.
      These symptoms are also described in patients with atrial fibrillation. All participants will
      be asked to fill out a standardized quality of life (RAND-36)-, and a symptoms questionnaire
      (modified European Heart Rhythm association symptom scale). Upon inclusion all patients will
      be reviewed for factors predisposing to PE such as recent surgery, or illness requiring
      immobilisation within the past three months prior to index event.

      After inclusion patients will be randomised to screening for atrial fibrillation or standard
      of care. Participants who get randomised into the screening arm will be screened for AF using
      a validated, handheld ECG device at least twice daily for two weeks. Participants who get AF
      diagnosed during the study will be referred for appropriate cardiology follow-up and the
      anticoagulant therapy will be changed from a fixed time to continued (subject to yearly
      reviews). Patients will then be followed for five years using the Swedish death registry, and
      the Swedish national patient registry, in combination with the national prescription registry
      for the outcomes.

    <description>Comparison of clinical characteristics (diagnosis of prior hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, vascular disease, heart failure, stroke/TIA) to identify risk factors for detection of AF in patients with PE, and use to build a risk score for AF detection. Patients in the intervention arm who had atrial fibrillation discovered after screening with intermittent ECG will be compared to participants in the intervention arm where atrial fibrillation was not discovered. Multivariable logistic regression will be used to determine which risk factors are most important in order to detect previously undetected AF in patients with pulmonary embolism.</description>
