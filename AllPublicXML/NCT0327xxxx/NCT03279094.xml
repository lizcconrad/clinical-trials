  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of a treatment regimen consisting of 2
      cycles of pre-transplant immunosuppressive therapy followed by myeloablative preparative
      regimen and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a haploidentical donor in
      patients with sickle cell disease.

      The overall goal of this study is to expand the donor pool for hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation in sickle cell disease using haploidentical donors, and to develop a
      non-toxic, myeloablative regimen, with the goal of achieving a consistent donor chimerism
      utilizing pre-transplant immunosuppressive therapy.

      All patients will receive an haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant with the
      following conditioning and GvHD prevention:

      2 cycles of Fludarabine and Dexamethasone x 5 days each cycle

      Conditioning regimen:

      rATG daily x 3 days, Fludarabine daily x 6 days and Busulfan daily x 4 days

      GVHD prophylaxis:

          -  Recurrent priapism requiring medical therapy.

          -  Osteonecrosis of two or more joints despite the institution of supportive care
             measures.

          -  Prior treatment with regular RBC transfusion therapy, defined as receiving 8 or more
             transfusions per year for &gt; 1 year to prevent vaso-occlusive clinical complications
             (i.e. pain, stroke, and acute chest syndrome)

          -  Echocardiograph finding of tricuspid valve regurgitation jet (TRJ) velocity ≥ 2.5
             m/sec.

          -  Ages 1 to 30.

          -  Child Bearing Potential- Transplantation could be teratogenic and/or lethal to the
             developing fetus. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for six months following duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while
             participating on the trial, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Informed Consent/Assent: All subjects must have the ability to understand and the
             willingness to sign a written informed consent.

          -  The recipient must have a related donor who is genotypically haploidentical on HLA-A,
             B, C and DRB1 loci.

          -  No HLA matched sibling or 10/10 matched unrelated donor is available.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any uncontrolled illness including ongoing or active bacterial, viral or fungal
             infection.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study.

          -  Patients with any active malignancy are ineligible for this study, other than
             non-melanoma skin cancers.

          -  Medical problem or neurologic/psychiatric dysfunction which would impair patient
             ability to be compliant with the medical regimen and to tolerate transplantation or
             would prolong hematologic recovery which in the opinion of the principal investigator
             would place the recipient at unacceptable risk.

          -  Prior autologous or allogeneic transplant.

          -  Fully HLA-matched related or unrelated donor is available to donate.

          -  Non-Compliance: Subjects, who in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to
