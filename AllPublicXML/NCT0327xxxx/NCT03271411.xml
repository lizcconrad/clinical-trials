  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an extension of a randomized clinical trial comparing eye movement desensitization
      and reprocessing (EMDR) to progressive counting (PC) for volunteers from the community who
      are distressed by the memory of a motor vehicle accident. The purpose of this extension is to
      add Phil Manfield's recently developed Flash technique as a precursor to both EMDR and PC, to
      see a) if that has any impact on participant retention, treatment effectiveness, or treatment
      efficiency; and b) if such impact is equivalent with EMDR and PC.
