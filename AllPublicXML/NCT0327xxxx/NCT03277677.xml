  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high chloride content of 0.9%sodium chloride (0.9%NaCl) leads to adverse
      pathophysiological effects in both animals and healthy human volunteers. Small randomized
      trials confirm that the hyperchloremic acidosis induced by 0.9%NaCl also occurs in patients.
      A strong signal is emerging from recent large propensity-matched and cohort studies for the
      adverse effects that 0.9% NaCl has on the clinical outcome in surgical and critically ill
      patients when compared with balanced crystalloids. Major complications are the increased
      incidences of acute kidney injury and the need for renal replacement therapy, and that
      pathological hyperchloremia may increase postoperative mortality.

      Fluid resuscitation with 0.9% NaCl in animals with sepsis resulted in hyperchloremic
      metabolic acidosis, worsened AKI, and increased mortality when compared with resuscitation
      with a balanced crystalloid solution.

      Furthermore, hyperchloremic acidosis also resulted in increased concentrations of circulating
      inflammatory mediators in an experimental model of severe sepsis in rats, with a
      dose-dependent increase in circulating interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, and
      interleukin-10 concentrations with increasing acidosis.

      Thus, in this study, investigators compared the effects of a balanced crystalloid solution
      with 0.9% NaCl on the renal function in severe sepsis/septic shock patients. Investigators
      hypothesized that balanced crystalloid solution resuscitation would decrease AKI incidence
      and severity and would improve immunomodulatory effect when compared with 0.9% NaCl
      resuscitation.
