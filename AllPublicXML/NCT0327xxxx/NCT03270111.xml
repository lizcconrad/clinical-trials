    <textblock>
      The purpose of this second pilot study is to extend the feasibility demonstrated in
      NCT02963740 that the intervention achieves high levels of moderate to vigorous physical
      activity (MVI PA) and modulates risk biomarkers for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease
      in older, obese sedentary breast cancer survivors who are undergoing moderate calorie
      restriction.

      All subjects participate in same intervention. Intervention consists of a 6-month structured
      weight loss program utilizing portion controlled meals and a prescribed level of graduated
      physical activity with an eventual goal of 200 minutes or more per week. The program will
      include twice weekly sessions with a trainer at a local YMCA, and weekly phone group sessions
      the first 3 months with transition to unsupervised exercise and less frequent group phone
      sessions the second 3 months.
