      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the additional value of EEG-fMRI method in the
      presurgical evaluation of focal intractable epilepsy.

      To consider a patient for surgery, the main difficulty is to define accurately the
      epileptogenic zone. This definition is complex and is often supported by several types of
      exploration (MRI, FDG PET, neuropsychological testing, video-EEG...). In this study we will
      evaluate the adding value of the simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI in the epileptogenic
      zone definition.
