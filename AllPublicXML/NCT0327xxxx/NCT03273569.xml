      The aim of this study is to evaluate a novel protocol to conserve the uterus during Cesarean
      delivery indicated for placenta accreta.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Placenta accreta is a morbid obstetric condition that describes variable non-physiologic
      invasion of the placenta into the the uterine wall. The incidence of placenta accreta, as a
      serious cause of postpartum hemorrhage, has substantially increased secondary to increase the
      rate of Cesarean delivery. Placenta accreta is primarily managed by peripartum hysterectomy
      prior to delivery of the placenta to avoid uncontrolled bleeding. However, in addition to the
      surgical risks, hysterectomy is psychologically morbid to many women particularly younger
      women and women with low parity. Therefore, several conservative options were studied to
      provide an alternative for hysterectomy in these women. Our study is designated to evaluate a
      proposed protocol of multi-step interventions to reduce the anticipated amount of bleeding
      prior to delivery of the placenta.
