  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persists worldwide as an immense health burden among
      vulnerable populations. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has offered the promise of
      limiting the global burden of HIV. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a
      pharmacokinetic (PK) study in transgender women to describe the pharmacokinetics of tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) as PrEP within this population.

      PrEP is a critical component of comprehensive transgender medical care. The proposed
      open-label, intensive PK study will inform the pharmacologic impact of combining PrEP and
      concurrent feminizing hormone regimens. The investigators hypothesize transgender women will
      achieve similar PrEP concentrations compared to the historical controls, and that hormone
      concentrations (estrogen and testosterone) will not be affected. The aims of this study are
      to (1) to determine if concurrent use of TDF/FTC as PrEP in combination with feminizing
      hormones alters the PK of tenofovir (TFV) and FTC and (2) to determine if concurrent use of
      PrEP with feminizing hormones alters serum estradiol and testosterone concentrations. To
      achieve these aims, this study will enroll transgender women who are receiving either
      oral/sublingual or transdermal estradiol with spironolactone. Using intensive PK sampling,
      plasma and intracellular TDF/FTC concentrations will be measured after 14 days of oral
      TDF/FTC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document indicating that
             the participant has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the study.

          -  Participants who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          -  Self identify as a transgender woman.

          -  Receiving estradiol (oral/sublingual tablets or transdermal patches) with oral
             spironolactone for at least 3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Serum estradiol level &gt;100 pg/mL.

          -  Non-reactive 4th or 5th generation screening test for HIV.
