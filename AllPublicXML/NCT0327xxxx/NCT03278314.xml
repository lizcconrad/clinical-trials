        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females, 12 years of age and older with confirmed diagnosis of CF.

               1. - completed Vertex clinical studies NCT02565914 or NCT03150719, or

               2. - are homozygous for F508del and have (1) discontinued Orkambi within 12 weeks
                  from start of treatment because of the onset of respiratory AEs considered to be
                  treatment related or (2) cannot initiate Orkambi because of chronic treatment
                  with an essential sensitive CYP3A substrate or a CYP3A substrate with a narrow
                  therapeutic index AND who meet at least 1 of the following criteria:

                    -  the highest percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1)
                       is &lt;40 in the 6 months before the date of completion of the request form, or

                    -  documentation of being active on a lung transplant waiting list or
                       documentation of being evaluated for lung transplantation, but deemed
                       unsuitable because of contraindications, or

                    -  rapid and persistent loss of lung function, defined as at least a 20%
                       relative decrease in ppFEV1 in the last 6 months and sustained for at least
                       1 month despite appropriate treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any comorbidity that, in the opinion of the treating physician, might pose
             undue risk in administering TEZ/IVA combination therapy to the patient (e.g., history
             of advanced liver disease).

          -  Ongoing or prior participation in an investigational drug study (with the exception of
             Vertex clinical studies evaluating TEZ/IVA) within 5 terminal half-lives of the
             previous investigational study drug or 30 days, whichever is longer, of first
             administration of TEZ/IVA.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant.

          -  Patients eligible for participation in ongoing clinical studies evaluating TEZ/IVA or
             other CFTR modulator therapies.

        Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
