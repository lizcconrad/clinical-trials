    <textblock>
      Astragalus membranaceus (AM, Huang-Chi) is a Chinese herb used extensively in China as a
      traditional treatment to treat stroke for a long time, and a number of studies have shown
      that AM can reduce cerebral infarction area and has anti-oxidation activity. Our previous
      studies have demonstrated enhanced recovery of neurologic function in patients with acute
      hemorrhagic stroke who received AM. It is hypothesized that AM either reduces inflammatory
      response or reduces perihematomal edema.

      Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to rupture of a cerebral aneurysm is a medical condition
      associated with a high morbidity and mortality; approximately 10-15% of patients die before
      reaching medical care, and overall mortality is approximately 45%. Of those that survive, 30%
      suffer permanent disability graded as moderate to severe, and two-thirds of survivors never
      return to the same quality of life as they had prior to their hemorrhage. A large number of
      patients (30-70%) who are able to make it to the hospital and have successful treatment of
      their aneurysm will develop delayed cerebral vasospasm that is related to the blood clot from
      their initial aneurysm rupture. Of patients that survive their initial aneurysm rupture,
      vasospasm results in an additional 7% mortality and another 7% of severe disabilities
      secondary to ischemic strokes from severe spasm of cerebral arteries.

      This research is trying to see if AM can enhance the clinical prognosis for spontaneous
      aneurysm ruptured subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. All procedures done as a part of this
      study are standard hospital care procedures done to treat aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
      according to the AHA/ASA guideline.
