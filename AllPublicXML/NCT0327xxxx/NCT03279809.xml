  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether administration of aspirin can help maintain the
      patency of metallic stents for distal malignant common bile duct obstruction. Metal stents
      are mainly used for malignant biliary obstruction if the surgical treatment is not considered
      and its maintenance period has been reported to be about 8 months. We prospectively conducted
      randomized controlled study with aspirin treated patients who received metal stents in
      patients over 20 years who were confirmed malignant distal biliary obstruction. The primary
      endpoint is the incidence of stent dysfunction in both groups for 6 months after the
      procedure. The secondary endpoints included duration of metalic stent patency, incidence of
      further procedures, and adverse events related with aspirin.

    <textblock>
      Endoscopic drainage is the first choice for bile drainage in patients with malignant distal
      biliary obstruction. Metal stents are mainly used for malignant biliary obstruction if the
      surgical treatment is not considered. Metal stents have proven superior in many clinical
      aspects over plastic stents. Nonetheless, the maintenance period of the metallic stent
      patency has been reported to be around 8 months, and it is often necessary to undergo further
      procedure due to dysfunction of stents. Recently, it has been reported that the duration of
      the metallic stent patency in patients with aspirin is prolonged. Since the previous study
      was a retrospective study, we prospectively conducted randomized controlled study with
      aspirin treated patients who received metal stents in patients over 20 years who were
      confirmed malignant distal biliary obstruction. We compared the incidence of stent
      dysfunction in both groups for 6 months after the procedure. Stent dysfunction is defined as
      any case which further procedure is required due to jaundice or cholangitis after stent
      insertion.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether administration of aspirin can help maintain the
      patency of metallic stents for distal malignant common bile duct obstruction.
