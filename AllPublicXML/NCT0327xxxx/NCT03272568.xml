    <textblock>
      The purpose of this feasibility study is to find out if two clotting factor products,
      Eloctate [hemophilia A] and Alprolix [hemophilia B], can reduce the amount of menstrual
      bleeding in female hemophilia A and B carriers (14 years of age or older) who have severe or
      heavy bleeding. These products are FDA-approved for use in males with hemophilia A and B to
      prevent and treat bleeding. They are not approved specifically to reduce menstrual bleeding,
      but may be useful for this purpose. Both products have an &quot;extended half life&quot; which means
      they circulate in the body longer than other FVIII or FIX products. The study team will
      gather additional information about the safety of these drugs and how well they work. The
      results of this feasibility study will provide information for an upcoming larger study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A or B is caused by defects in the factor VIII or IX gene, respectively, of which
      is located on the X chromosome. This disorder exhibits X-linked inheritance, in which
      primarily males, with a single X chromosome, are affected and females, with two X
      chromosomes, are heterozygotes, or carriers. Hemophilia carriers show a wide distribution of
      factor VIII or IX levels with a mean of 50%, which overlaps the distribution of non-carrier
      women.

      Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as menstrual bleeding that lasts more than 7 days or more
      specifically as the loss of more than 80cc of blood per cycle. Management is critical as it
      can lead to iron deficiency anemia, lead to school absence and affects the general quality of
      life. There are multiple options to control or reduce menstrual bleeding in hemophilia A and
      B carriers, they include but not limited to the following options: Antifibrinolytics
      (Aminocaproic acid, Tranexamic acid), Synthetic desmopressin (DDAVP, SQ or IN) or hormonal
      therapies (Combined oral contraceptives, Progestin only options, IUD, etc).

      The use of recombinant factor replacement has been poorly studied and limited by a relatively
      short half-life in relation to the typical length of a menstrual period. The purpose of this
      feasibility study is to find out if two clotting factor products, Eloctate [hemophilia A] and
      Alprolix [hemophilia B], can reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding in female hemophilia A
      and B carriers (14 years of age or older) who have severe or heavy bleeding. These products
      are FDA-approved for use in males with hemophilia A and B to prevent and treat bleeding. They
      are not approved specifically to reduce menstrual bleeding, but may be useful for this
      purpose. Both products have an &quot;extended half life&quot; which means they circulate in the body
      longer than other FVIII or FIX products. The study team will gather additional information
      about the safety of these drugs and how well they work. Five out of the 16 anticipated
      enrolled patients will be approach to request participation in the exploratory aim in which
      the subject is taught to perform a hemoglobin check (CBC) every other day using a novel point
      of care device (Anemocheck) during 2 consecutive menstrual cycles. In addition, they will
      have CBCs drawn within 4-6 hours for comparison and correlation. The study team will also
      correlate symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding with a 2grams drop in the hemoglobin. All the
      results of this study will provide information for an upcoming larger study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in menstrual bleeding measured by the Pictorial Bleeding Assessment Chart (PBAC).</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly throughout study duration for 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Menstrual loss is tracked via paper and electronic PBAC, calculated via visual interpretation centrally and correlated to the ability of a participant to correctly assign pad or tampon saturation. The PBAC will be estimated (mean) over the three-month intervention period to assess if 30% reduction in menstrual bleeding was achieved. PBAC is a semi-quantitative, self-administered pictorial tool. The total score is calculated by adding up the sum of all scores for the tampons or pads used, with a score greater than 150 having an 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity for heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). Possible range is dependent on quantitative and qualitative amount of bleeding during menstruation:
For tampons: 0.5-1 for lightly stained, 1-4 for moderately soiled and 4-12 for completely saturated tampons.
For pads: 1 for lightly stained, 2-6 for moderately soiled and 4-15 for completely saturated pads.
Clots were given a score of 1 for small and 5 for large clots.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems (PROMIS-43) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly, prior to the beginning of each menstrual cycle either by phone or in person for the study duration of 7 months.</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the use of the study drugs leads to a significant improvement in Quality of Life (QOL) the study establishes a baseline QOL and measures change monthly and 6-month change. The PROMIS 43 profile is a QOL assessment tool of 43 questions from 9 health domains and 10 questions focused on sexual health. The PROMIS assesses patient reported outcomes in three major categories: physical health, mental health, and social health. Each item has five response options except for the Pain Intensity item which has eleven options.A raw score is created from each short form. To find the total raw score the values of the response to each question are summed up within each domain. The applicable score conversion table translates the total raw score into standardized T-score that is reported as the final score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Short Form 36 (SF-36) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly, prior to the beginning of each menstrual cycle either by phone or in person for the study duration of 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether the study treatment leads to a clinically significant improvement in Quality of Life (QOL) the study team establishes a baseline quality of life and measures change monthly as well as 6-month change in SF-36. SF-36 is a a 36-item patient reported survey of health consisting of 8 scaled scores with a lower score indicating disability in the one of the 8 sections or domains.The scoring system for the SF-36 is relatively complex and generates subscale scores for physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role-limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Two summary scores can also be derived from the SF-36: the physical component summary and the mental component summary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Monthly, prior to the beginning of each menstrual cycle either by phone or in person for the study duration of 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MIQ consists of six individual measures or items. The first 4 items are evaluated by using 4-point (item 1) or 5-point (items 2-4) response scales. No summative scale is derived for item 5 as it serves as a descriptive tool to characterize limitations of specific activities and is viewed as supporting information for items 2-4. Item 6 represents a global assessment (impact, degree, and meaningfulness) of the change in menstrual bleeding lost (MBL) when compared to the previous period. Impact response options included a 0 ('almost the same'), 1 ('better'), or 2 ('worse'). If a change is reported, then a 7-point rating scale is used to specify the degree of improvement (item 6a) or worsening (item 6b). Finally, item 6c (meaningfulness of change in MBL) provides an overall assessment of the subjective perception of the change in MBL and may be considered an important component of the MIQ.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of hypersensitivity reactions.</measure>
    <time_frame>Througout the interventional phase of the study (visit 4-7 of the study or months 4-7)</time_frame>
    <description>Since Eloctate and Alprolix are biological products, hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic reactions, may occur. Nurses and patients will be trained to recognize the signs and symptoms associated with potential hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, and anaphylactoid reactions, and instructed to provide/seek immediate care. Patients/caregivers will receive two alert cards with this information and instructions. For patients with a previous history of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction, the site will call the patient 24 hours after each dose to assess the status of the patient. Additional precautions following each of these doses may also be considered including having an extended observation period or IV access prior to dosing.</description>

    <measure>Accuracy of hemoglobin levels detection by Anemocheck.</measure>
    <time_frame>Every other day during 2 consecutive menstrual cycles during non-interventional study phase (up to Day 60 of the study).</time_frame>
    <description>Exploratory arm participants will self-perform hemoglobin check using Anemocheck every other day during 2 consecutive menstrual cycles. To determine the feasibility and utility of Anemocheck in the monitoring of hemoglobin during a menstruation, the study team will assess correlation of symptoms of heavy menstrual bleeding with a 2g drop in the hemoglobin detected by Anemocheck, and correlation of hemoglobin level obtained by local Lab (within 4-6 hours).</description>

    <description>Each AnemoCheck test kit enables patients to check hemoglobin levels by pricking their finger to draw 5 μL of blood into a capillary tube, inserting that tube into a larger tube with a pre-filled chemical solution, mixing, waiting one minute, and assessing the color change of the solution using a reference color scale card included with the kit. The test is able to subjectively differentiate low, medium and high levels of hemoglobin to diagnose anemia at home. Study participants are taught to perform a hemoglobin check every other day using Anemocheck during 2 consecutive menstrual cycles. In addition they will have hemoglobin level obtained locally (LabCorp) drawn within 4-6 hours for comparison and correlation.</description>
