  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Basketball has gained worldwide popularity and fascinated players and spectators with its
      dynamic characteristics as a team sport. This kind of sport is multifaceted that requires
      well-developed physical ﬁtness to be played successfully. Many authors have suggested that
      strength, power, agility, and speed are important performance related physical components for
      elite basketball players. The physical components require that fitness and conditioning
      attributes of basketball players are well developed to negate the limiting aspect of sport
      performance. Moreover, functional training is becoming increasingly popular within the
      fitness industry and has been considered to be a better alternative than traditional training
      methods for improving various measures of performance. The purpose of this study was to
      determine whether functional training has effects on performance and related various physical
      components of basketball players.

    <description>Functional training has been defined as emphasizing multiple muscle and joint activities, combining upper and lower body movements, and utilizing more of the body in each movement. The primary goal of functional training is to transfer improvement achieve in one movement to enhancing the performance of another movement by affecting the entire neuromuscular system.</description>
