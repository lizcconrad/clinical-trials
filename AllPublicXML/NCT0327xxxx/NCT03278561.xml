    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study in asthma patients to determine if a late age of onset asthma (start
      symptoms &gt;18 years old), is associated with more persistent airway/systemic inflammation,
      worse asthma control, more co-morbidity, a different microbiome and poorer quality of life
      despite the use of optimized asthma therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For ages, asthma has been considered a disease for children and young adults. However,
      nowadays 30% of all asthma patients is over 50 years old. Asthma in the elderly is generally
      more severe and approximately 50% of all deaths drom asthma occur in this age group. With
      rapid aging of the global population, the burden of asthma in the elderly will further
      increase.

      Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and the question is whether asthma in the elderly can be
      considered the same disease as asthma in children and young adults. The pathophysiology and
      risk factors of asthma in the elderly are still not completely understood. Good
      characterization of asthma in the elderly requires clinical phenotyping as well as a thorough
      analysis of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. It is hypothesized that in
      older asthma patients, a late age of onset (start asthma symptoms &gt;18 years) is associated
      with more persistent airway/systemic inflammation, worse asthma control, more co-morbidity
      and poorer quality of life despite the use of optimized asthma therapy.

        The aim is to enrol 30 patients with early onset asthma (age of onset &lt; 18 years) and 30
        patients with late onset asthma (age of onset &gt; 18 years); all with a smoking history of &lt;
        10 PY. Both groups consist of 15 older asthma patients (&gt; 50 years) and 15 younger asthma
        patients (&lt; 50 years); per age group 15 healthy controls serve as comparison (no asthma).
        Asthma diagnosis is based on presence of typical clinical symptoms, reversible airway
        obstruction (+12% improvement in FEV1 after bronchodilator) or bronchial hyperreactivity
        (PC20 &lt; 8 mg/ml) or a FeNO &gt; 50 ppb. All asthma patients have GINA step 4-5 medication
        (high dose ICS/LABA) and are not adequately controlled (ACQ &gt; 0,75)
