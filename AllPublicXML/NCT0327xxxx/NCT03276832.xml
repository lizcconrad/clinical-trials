  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies the side effects and how well imiquimod and pembrolizumab work in
      treating patients with stage IIIB-IV melanoma. Imiquimod may stimulate the immune system.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Giving imiquimod and pembrolizumab may work better at treating melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gain preliminary data of the anti-tumor activity and safety profile of the combination
      of imiquimod and pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable cutaneous melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare and contrast (in a hypothesis generating manner) the biomarker profiles of
      patients who have a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria with patients who do not.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and apply imiquimod cutaneously on
      days 1-5 (Monday - Friday). Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 2 years (approximately 35
      courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.
