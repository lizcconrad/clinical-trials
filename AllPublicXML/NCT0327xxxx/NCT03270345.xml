  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to provide an up-to-date, global picture of the extent and
      patterns of pressure injuries in ICUs. Point prevalence studies are only of value when
      performed on a vast scale. To sample a representative cohort, it is the intention to recruit
      about 1200 ICUs with all continents covered and as many countries as possible within each
      continent.

      The objective is to provide an up-to-date, international &quot;global&quot; picture of the extent and
      patterns of pressure injuries in ICUs. Thereto , the plan is to perform a 1-day, prospective,
      multicenter point-prevalence study. The large scale of the project should allow thorough
      epidemiological analyses. More precisely the study will enable to identify:

        -  major risk factors for pressure ulcer development;

        -  preventive measures used in distinct ICU populations and countries;

        -  shortages in the availability of evidence-based measures to prevent pressure sores;

        -  malpractice pressure sore prevention in particular regions or countries;

        -  occurrence rates of pressure ulcers with/without accurate adjustment for risk profile
           and preventive measures taken;

        -  benchmarking between regions/countries; clinical outcomes associated with pressure
           ulcers (major organ derangements and mortality);

        -  economic outcomes associated with pressure ulcers (length of ICU stay) and linking these
           outcomes with local practice regarding prevention measures applied/available.

        -  country and regional differences in prevalence of pressure ulcers and outcome.

      Pressures ulcer stages will be graded following the classification system jointly developed
      by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel.

      Data to be recorded include patient demographics, data on severity of underlying disease and
      acute illness, organ failure, pressure ulcers, major risk factors for pressure ulcers, and
      measures taken to prevent pressure ulcers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All adult patients (&gt;18 years of age) present on the date of data collection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There are no exclusion criteria. All patients should be included. Patients with severe
             clinical conditions not allowing safe pressure ulcer identification should not be
             evaluated for the respective risk zones. If it is known that the patient has a
             pressure ulcer at the body sites that cannot be safely evaluated, the stage of the
             pressure ulcer should be recorded as previously known. If it is unknown whether the
             patient has a pressure ulcer at these body sites, this should be indicated with a '?'
             in the Case Report Form
