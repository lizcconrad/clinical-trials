    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the difference between the optic nerve sheath
      diameter measured during total intravenous anesthesia and the optic nerve sheath diameter
      measured during inhalation anesthesia in patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic
      prostatectomy.
