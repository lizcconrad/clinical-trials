    <textblock>
      IGF-I is a mitogenic and antiapoptotic. paracrine growth factor expressed in all fetal organ.
      and is essential in fetal and neonatal growth, differentiation and development Several lines
      of evidence suggest that IGF-I levels are associated with birth weight -furthermore higher
      IGF-I levels are associated with higher BW, but not with lower birth weight]. In adulthood,
      elevated concentrations of IGF-I are associated with an increased risk of obesity and many
      cancers, including breast, lung, head and neck, colorectal, pancreas, synovial sarcoma, and
      prostate canc. Although concentrations of circulating IGF-I levels vary considerably by
      race/ethnicity and maternal pre-pregnancy obesity, few studies included African American
      women an ethnic group that has an almost 9% higher BMI than European-American women

      For healthy mother ,breastfeeding represent the gold standard for infant health, and infant
      formula development aims at mimicking the physiological response to human milk intake. while
      protein content is essential to promote growth and brain development, protein intakes in late
      infancy have been found to be quite high and to exceed required intakes by large margins
      )Ohlund and ,Hernell , 2010)

      More over ,high protein intake was associated with increased weight gain and higher adiposity
      in infancy and child hood )Singhal and kennedy , 2010 ) further more, protein intake of
      breast-fed infant is generally lowerand may relate to lower risk of obesity later in
      life)Harder and Betgmann , 2005 )

      one potential mechanism involves an enhanced stimulation of the secretion of Insulin growth
      factor(IGF-1)strophic hormone involved in longitudinal growth as well as muscle and fat mass
      development (Rolland et el,1995 )

      • General research statement and Justification of the research

      A-Maternal BMI and IGF-1 level in infants There's a positive association among term infant
      with elevated IGF-1 level and increased risk with higher birthweight. This positive
      association most apparent in infant born to obese women PubMed).

      Maternal obesity is rising with subsequent increase risk of childhood obesity offspring of
      overweight and obese women (whit Take ,2004 )

      Obese women have difficulties in initiating and maintaining breastfeeding because of defects
      in their hormonal response to suckling. (Rasmussen and kjolhede , 2004 )

      B-Type of Feeding And IGF-1 level in infant Breastfed infant tend to be smaller and have
      lower endogenous production of IGF-1 than formula fed infant this attributed to their higher
      protein content of formula(SOCHA ET Al2011) how ever this relation reverse as childhood
      progress at age 17 young adult hood who has breastfed had higher IGF-1) than the formula fed
      (LANKAERET Al 2009) Large Danish birth cohort reported that IGF-1 concentration at age 3month
      were higher in formula feeding infants than in breastfeeding infants (CHellakooty et al.,
      2006 ).

      Nutritional view on breast feeding Posted on July 14, 2013 by Thomas Sherman

      C-Relationship between IGF-1 and Childhood obesity and adulthood obesity. Rapid growth in
      infancy is associated with later over weight and obesity Faster weight gain during infancy is
      associated with increased risk of subsequent obesity and related metabolic traits
