        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (males or females), aged 18 years or older with pathologically confirmed,
             advanced (unresectable or metastatic) neuroendocrine tumour from a
             gastroenteropancreatic or lung source. Both participants with functional NETs and
             those with nonfunctional NETs shall be eligible for this study.

          -  Histologically confirmed, WHO Grade 3, poorly-differentiated NEC.

          -  Has received 0,1 or 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (chemotherapy, PRRT, targeted
             therapies such as everolimus or sunitinib). Somatostatin analogues are not considered
             a line of therapy for the purposes of this criterion.

          -  Radiological documentation of disease progression within 24 weeks of study enrolment.
             Disease progression must be demonstrated on two scans less than one year apart.

               -  Participants previously treated with any systemic therapies are eligible to
                  enroll if disease progression is documented during or after their last treatment.

          -  Measurable disease as assessed by CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which is
             suitable for accurate repeated measurements (according to RECIST v1.1).

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function (ANC &gt; 1.5 x 109/L; Platelets &gt;100 x109/L; haemoglobin &gt;

          -  Adequate liver function defined by a total bilirubin level ≤1.5xULN and AST and ALT
             levels ≤2.5xULN for participants (or AST and ALT levels ≤ 5xULN for participants with
             documented metastatic disease to the liver).

          -  Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min
             according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).

          -  Willing and able to comply with all study requirements, including timing and/or nature
             of treatment and required assessments.

          -  Signed, written informed consent.

             without an alternative medical explanation.

          -  Highly effective contraception for both male and female participants if the risk of
             conception exists (note: The effects of the IP on the developing human fetus are
             unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men able to father a child must
             agree to use 2 highly effective contraceptions, defined as methods with a failure rate
             of less than 1% per year. Highly effective contraception is required at least 28 days

             medication.

          -  Major surgery in the 2 weeks prior to randomization. Surgery with intent to debulk
             metastatic disease is allowed, as long as there is sufficient residual disease for

             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             treatment administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results
             and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for
             entry into this study.

          -  Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of
             informed consent

             testing. A core biopsy, endoscopic biopsy or surgical resection specimen shall be

             insufficient tissue.

          -  Prior treatment for study indication with:

               -  Peptide Receptor Radiouclide Therapy (PRRT) administered within 3 months of
