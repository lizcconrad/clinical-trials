    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well gadolinium and ferumoxytol magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) works in diagnosing patients with abnormalities in the central nervous system.
      Diagnostic procedures, such as gadolinium and ferumoxytol MRI, may help find and diagnose
      abnormalities in the central nervous system.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test if prior gadolinium administration affects vascular imaging using ferumoxytol.

      II. To test signal changes of T2*w multi-echo fast field echo (mFFE) scans before and after
      contrast agent injection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test if ferumoxytol affects gadolinium enhanced MRI. II. To test if steady state
      cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps are different at various magnetic field strengths.

      III. To explore late ferumoxytol enhancement (optional MRI) hours to days after ferumoxytol
      administration in various pathologies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive gadolinium intravenously (IV) and then ferumoxytol IV and undergo
      MRI over 60 minutes on day 1.

      GROUP II: Patients receive ferumoxytol IV and then gadolinium IV and undergo MRI over 60
      minutes on day 1.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 2 and 6 weeks.

    <description>Will assess the confidence in identifying the lesion corresponding areas on CBV maps as well as signal change (deltaR2*) and relative cerebral blood volume. Primary analysis will use the average score of the two readers. The mean difference and the associated 95% CI between the two groups will be estimated using a linear regression model. Equivalence will be claimed if the 95% CI does not include 0.4 on either side (equivalence margin is 0.4).</description>

    <description>The mean difference and the associated 95% CI before versus after ferumoxytol in the three visualization variables will be estimated using a paired t-test based on the average score of the two readers.

To compare the two magnetic field strengths, will also use a linear regression model to analyze contrast to noise ratios, Image homogeneity and susceptibility artifacts (the latter two based on average score of the two readers).</description>
