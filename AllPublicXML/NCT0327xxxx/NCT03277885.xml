  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, the Direction of Research, Studies, Evaluation and Statistics, in their 2015
      report on &quot;Chronic pain: the state of health of the population in France - Indicators
      associated with the Public health &quot;, shows that 34.6% of the working population declare
      themselves to be facing psycho-social risks, including chronic pain disorders.

      The main survey conducted in France on chronic pain showed that 32% of French people
      expressed daily pain for more than 3 months, with 20% reporting chronic pain of moderate or
      severe intensity. According to a report by the HAS in 2009, about 30% of patients consulting
      for pain in pain center (CETD) are working and 20% are on sick leave or work-related
      accidents.

      Chronic pain would also be responsible in France for the limitation of professional
      activities in 6% of 25-64 year olds, 15% job losses, 12% changes in work responsibilities,
      12% changes in employment and 18 % of associated depressions. In addition, 40% of chronic
      pain patients experienced a direct impact at work: loss, change in responsibilities and
      activity.

      Combined with the difficulty of understanding and thus treating chronic pain, these data
      demonstrate the challenge faced by occupational health services in their preventive, curative
      and palliative approach to chronic pathologies. Innovation for any new prevention and therapy
      for chronic pain then becomes necessary.

      The main objective of this first study will be the evaluation of the prevalence of pain
      disorders among the employees of French furniture shop. .

      In order to have the earliest possible representativeness of French furniture shop, a
      &quot;virtual&quot; store will be created from 400 volunteer employees from 14 French furniture shop.
      Each job will be represented and the number of employees per job will respect the average
      proportion observed in the French furniture shop.

      Following the on-site presentation of the details of the survey, by a doctor from
      Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, volunteers will be informed within their company of the
      start of the survey. Each volunteer employee will have access to the information document
      (paper format) explaining in detail the purpose, content and conduct of the survey. If the
      voluntary collaborator agrees to participate, he / she will be asked to respond to the survey
      via the computer platform of the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital.

      Before completing the questionnaires, the employee will be asked to participate in the
      survey, via a YES / NO choice on the computer platform, which will serve as proof of
      non-opposition. The employee will be free to reverse his initial decision at any time by
      informing the coordinating center.

      Volunteers who have agreed to participate in the study will be asked to respond to the survey
      questionnaires during each survey. Volunteers will have no obligation to participate in all
      investigations.

      The data manager of the coordinating center will build a specific and secure platform via the
      REDCap website (http://project-redcap.org/). Volunteer collaborators will be provided with
      the web link to respond to the survey directly on the REDCap platform at their workplace or
      at home.

      The deployment of the survey to employees will be carried out over a period of 1 month.

      This survey will take place in 4 separate campaigns with a 4-month interval: October /
      February / June / October (to give an overview of the season effect on the data, as well as a
      longitudinal aspect). During each campaign, employees will be notified and can participate in
      the survey. Each employee may participate in one or more investigations.
