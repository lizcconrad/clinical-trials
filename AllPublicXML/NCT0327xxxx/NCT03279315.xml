  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 4-week study was conducted in 25 Chinese euthyroid women. Unified diets with different
      iodine contents (cooked with non-iodized salt or iodized salt) were provided in two different
      periods. The total iodine intake from diet, water and air as well as the total iodine
      excretion by urine, faces and respiration were monitored and determined, and a total of 300
      samples were collected. The sweat iodine loss was also considered. Moreover, the regression
      curve model between the 24-h iodine intake and 24-h iodine excretion was also established.

    <textblock>
      The experiment was conducted between November and December with a total duration of 1 month.
      Referring to the experience from Harrison and Dworkin, however, considering the negative
      iodine balance reported, during the first 3 weeks, the diet was provided with non-iodized
      salt, while the diet with iodized salt was only offered in the last week. The total daily
      iodine intake consisted of dietary iodine intake, water iodine intake and iodine from
      breathing, while iodine could be excreted out of human body by urine, faces, sweat and
      breathing. The 24-h iodine intake and 24-h iodine excretion were determined in each
      individual participant, and the iodine balance was calculated accordingly.
