    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent
      TAS-102 (TAS-102) works in treating participants with biliary tract cancers that have spread
      to other places in the body. Drugs used in the chemotherapy, such as trifluridine/tipiracil
      hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102
      (FTD/TPI [TAS-102]) in patients with refractory cholangiocarcinoma using progression-free
      survival at 16 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of FTD/TPI (TAS-102) in patients with refractory
      cholangiocarcinoma through adverse event monitoring.

      II. Further explore the efficacy of FTD/TPI (TAS-102) in patients with refractory
      cholangiocarcinoma by overall response rates, progression-free survival, and overall
      survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if circulating tumor cells (CTCs) or cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
      (cfDNA) at baseline correlates with prognosis or response to therapy.

      II. Determine if change in CTCs or cfDNA correlates with efficacy endpoints. III. Determine
      if different mutational status of the tumor will affect efficacy endpoints.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and 8-12. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 2 years.
