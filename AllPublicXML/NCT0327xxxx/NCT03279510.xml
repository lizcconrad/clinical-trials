  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing aids are used to improve audibility for patients with hearing loss and improve speech
      perception. In addition to these immediate benefits, amplification has the potential to have
      long-term effects on higher level auditory processing abilities, such as cognition or other
      abilities required for complex listening tasks. These long-term acclimatization effects are
      not well understood and merit further behavioral and physiological examination. Hearing aids
      will be fit on inexperienced hearing aid users and outcome measures will be used to determine
      immediate and long-term effects of hearing aids. This research may provide a more detailed
      view of individual differences that contribute to receiving benefit from a hearing aid and
      may lead to more individualized treatment of hearing loss.
