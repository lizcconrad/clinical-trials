    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to evaluate the re-volumizing performance and the duration effect of the
      product Aliaxin (new trademark) in women aged 40-65 years with midface volume defects due to
      aging mechanism.

    <description>Reduction of wrinkles severity corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) clinical score where:
Grade 1 (absent): no visible nasolabial fold; continuous skin line.
Grade 2 (mild): shallow but visible nasolabial fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature.
Grade 3 (moderate): moderately deep nasolabial folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched.
Grade 4 (severe): very long and deep nasolabial folds; prominent facial feature; &lt;2mm visible fold when stretched.
Grade 5 (very severe): extremely deep and long nasolabial fold, detrimental to facial appearance; 2-4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched.</description>

    <description>Reduction of face volume loss corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Facial Volume Loss Scale (FVLS) where:

Grade 4: An intermediate point between grade 3 and grade 5.
Grade 5: Severe indentation of one or more facial regions (including the cheek, temple, preauricolar and periorbital areas). Severe prominence of bony landmarks. Clear visibility of underlying musculature.</description>

    <description>First treatment was performed during baseline visit, after the basal evaluations planned by the study procedure.
0.5-1.1 ml of Aliaxin (new trademark) for emi-face was injected by needle (25-27 G) and/or cannula (25 G, 40 mm).
A touch-up treatment (0.5-1.1 ml of Aliaxin new trademark for subject) was performed after 3-4 weeks (T1) in order to treat possible asymmetry.</description>
