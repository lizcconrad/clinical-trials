  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of 60 cases. All the cases of pregnant women are 4 months to 8 months of
      pregnancy. The cases divided into 30 pregnant women's were given iron supplementation without
      health education and another 30 were given iron supplementation and health education for
      comparison between them. Comparative between hemoglobin levels before and after medication.
      Treatment of iron deficiency anemia with iron supplementation received for one month.

      The investigator will divide the participants into two groups e.g. group (A) and group (B)
      according to Hemoglobin level and receiving of oral supplementation for IDA accompanied with
      health education in case of group (A) and without health education in case of group (B). Then
      the investigator asked patient to sign the document of her investigations result to receive
      iron supplementation.

        -  After that, the investigator observes hemoglobin's Level, when it less than &gt;11g/dl, the
           patient will be the group (A) who will receive oral iron supplementation and health
           education.

        -  Group (B) who will receive Total Dose Infusion (TDI) without health education.
