  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase IIa, open-label, repeat-dose trial to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety
      and tolerability of single and multiple twice daily doses of inhaled Aclidinium
      Bromide/Formoterol Fumarate 400/12 μg in 20 Chinese male and female patients with stable
      moderate to severe COPD.

    <textblock>
      Screening will be performed within 21 days of dosing on Day 1 at visit 2. Eligible
      participants will be admitted to the trial center the day preceding the first dosing (day
      -1).

      Participants will receive Aclidinium Bromide/Formoterol Fumarate 400/12 μg twice-daily
      (morning and evening) on Days 1 to 4. On Day 5 patients will receive the morning dose only.
      PK and safety assessments will be conducted at specific timepoints on Day 1 to Day 7.

      Participants will be discharged 48 h after the last administration of investigational product
      and completion of the 48-h PK sample collection and safety assessments on Day 7.

      A follow-up visit will be performed within 5 days of the last PK sample collection on Day 7.
