  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to: (a) evaluate if a desk-based elliptical device can help
      employees to increase their daily physical activity without compromising work productivity;
      and (b) evaluate the effects of different types of incentives for pedaling the desk-based
      elliptical device on employees' pedaling quantity over a one-month intervention period. The
      study will involve placing a compact elliptical device (provided at no cost by the research
      team) under employees' desk at Penn State Hershey Medical Center/College of Medicine. Data
      evaluating the effects of the elliptical device on work productivity will be obtained from
      both employees and the employees' supervisors.
