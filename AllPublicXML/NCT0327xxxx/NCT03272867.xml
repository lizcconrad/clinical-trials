  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study serves to investigate whether ProManna intake leads to any changes in
      baseline levels for oxidative stress markers. In addition, biomarker responses following
      oxidative stress challenge tests will be assessed in subjects taking ProManna versus placebo
      supplements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is characterized by a progressive decline in the efficiency of physiological function
      and by the increased susceptibility to disease and death. Most ageing-associated diseases
      develop silently for many years before symptoms appear, leading to irreversible pathological
      conditions. Examples of these diseases are Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, osteoporosis, diabetes,
      cardiovascular disease and also cancer. Typically, patients are treated when most of the
      damage has already occurred, and existing drugs can rarely cure these diseases, but merely
      slow down further progression of the disease. Therefore, preventive measures that may delay
      the onset of these diseases can hold the best promise for healthy ageing. of the most
      plausible and acceptable explanations for the mechanistic basis of aging is the &quot;free radical
      theory of aging&quot;. This theory postulates that aging and its related diseases are the
      consequence of free radical-induced damage to cellular macromolecules and the inability to
      counterbalance these changes by endogenous anti-oxidant defences. ProManna is a novel and
      safe food supplement that aims to decrease free radical-induced damage, thereby contributing
      to healthy ageing.

             investigator's opinion could affect study results, or which could be affected by the
             study product (i.e. absorption of oral medication will be influenced by D-Mannitol).
             Exception for sporadic use of paracetamol and/or treating an AE.

          5. Able and motivated to comply with protocol requirements like for instance take the
             investigational product the way it is prescribed and to do the tests.
