    <textblock>
      (From NIH reporter) Each year &gt;16 million older Americans undergo anesthesia and surgery, and
      up to 40% of these patients develop postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a syndrome of
      postoperative thinking and memory deficits. Although distinct from delirium, POCD (like
      delirium) is associated with decreased quality of life, long term cognitive decline, early
      retirement, increased mortality, and a possible increased risk for developing dementia such
      as Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the etiology of POCD will likely help promote
      strategies to treat and/or prevent it. A dominant theory holds that brain inflammation causes
      POCD, but little work has directly tested this theory in humans. The preliminary data of this
      team strongly suggest that there is significant postoperative neuro-inflammation in older
      adults who develop POCD. In this K76 award, the investigators will prospectively obtain pre-
      and post-operative cognitive testing, fMRI imaging and CSF samples in 200 surgical patients
      over age 65. This will allow the investigators to evaluate the role of specific
      neuro-inflammatory processes in POCD and its underlying brain connectivity changes.
