  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that the Icare tonometer does not alter Keratometry readings, topography, or
      corneal staining. This would therefore allow intraocular pressure (IOP) testing to be done at
      any time during an exam, without affecting other testing. This may improve office-flow and
      spare patients from returning for another exam for additional testing.

      Four sites will enroll fifteen subjects each. Individual sites will identify their patients
      using numbers 1-15. The link to their identity will be stored in their records but will not
      be forwarded to other investigators. Only the originating site will have the identity log
      linking the participants to the study records. All patients over age 18 in the patient clinic
      are eligible for inclusion. Staff members and employees may also participate. Following
      informed consent, each patient will undergo visual acuity testing, keratometry readings by
      IOL Master, topography testing by Pentacam, and corneal staining evaluation with fluorescein
      using the Oxford scoring scale on both eyes. Once all three tests are completed, the Icare
      tonometer will be used to check the intraocular pressure (IOP) on one eye only. The
      investigator will be masked as to which eye will undergo applanation. Immediately following
      the IOP check, corneal staining, topography and keratometry readings will be repeated. The
      unchecked eye will serve as a control as there may be mild variations in topography or IOL
      Master even without applanation. Following the repeated testing, the control eye will also
      undergo applanation to document IOP.

    <description>Icare tonometry effects of keratometry readings, topography, and corneal staining to demonstrate that the Icare tonometer does not alter subsequent evaluation or testing. This would allow IOP testing to be performed by technical staff at any time during the examination process without affecting subsequent tests. A total of fifteen patients at each of four sites will be evaluated using Icare tonometers provided by Icare USA. The investigator will be masked as to which eye will undergo Icare tonometry. Both the study eye and the control eye will undergo pre-tonometry and post-tonometry testing; Keratometry readings, IOL master, Topography via Pentacam, and corneal staining with fluorescein using the Oxford scoring scale.</description>
