      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of two behavioral interventions at
      recalibrating physician heuristics.

    <textblock>
      Treatment at trauma centers improves outcomes for patients with moderate-to-severe injuries.
      Accordingly, professional organizations, state authorities, and the federal government have
      endorsed the systematic triage and transfer of these patients to trauma centers either
      directly from the field or after evaluation at a non-trauma center. Nonetheless, between 30
      to 40% of patients with moderate-to-severe injuries still only receive treatment at
      non-trauma centers, so-called under-triage. Most of this under-triage occurs because of
      physician decisions (rather than first-responder decisions). Existing efforts to change
      physician decision making focus primarily on knowledge of clinical practice guidelines and
      attitudes towards the guidelines. These strategies ignores the growing consensus that
      decision making reflects both knowledge as well as intuitive judgments (heuristics).
      Heuristics, mental short cuts based on pattern recognition, drive the majority of decision
      making. The investigators have developed two separate behavioral interventions to recalibrate
      physician heuristics in trauma triage, and will compare the effect of these interventions, an
      educational program, and no intervention on physician performance on a virtual simulation.

    <description>Physicians in all arms of the study will be asked to complete a virtual simulation, upon completion of the intervention, ideally within one month of enrollment.
The virtual simulation replicates the environment of the ED. Physicians have to manage 10 patients that appear concurrently, while also responding to a series of audio-visual distractors. Specifically, they must provide information on whether they will admit, transfer, or discharge the patients home. The investigators will categorize severely injured patients as successfully transferred (transferred to a trauma center or died in the ED) or not (admitted). We will use a Poisson regression to estimate the association between successful transfer and exposure to the different interventions (Night Shift v. Graveyard Shift v. educational program v. control).</description>

    <description>Night Shift is an adventure video game with the transformational goal of teaching physicians key characteristics of patients with non-representative severe injuries - injuries classified by the American College of Surgeons as life-threatening or critical but that do not fit the archetype of injuries typically requiring treatment at a trauma center. Players take on the persona of Andy Jordan, a young emergency physician who moves home after the disappearance of his estranged grandfather (Robert Jordan) and takes up a job in the local Emergency Department (ED). In the preamble, players learn they have two explicit objectives. First, they must diagnose and treat patients who present to their ED. Second they must solve the mystery of Robert's disappearance: was he murdered or has he simply chosen to disappear?</description>

    <description>Graveyard Shift is a puzzle video game with the transformational goal of helping physicians derive key triage decision principles for themselves. They complete a three-step game loop to obtain case information, compare cases to determine similarities and differences between cases, and then explicitly state the decision principle that should drive decision making.</description>
