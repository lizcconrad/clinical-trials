  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, phase I, open label study of the MVA viral vector (produced in the
      novel immortalised duck retinal cell line AGE1.CR.pIX) expressing the influenza antigens NP
      and M1 as a fusion protein, in healthy adult volunteers. MVA-NP+M1 will be given alone
      intramuscularly as a single dose.

      There will be 1 study group and a total of 6 volunteers will be enrolled. Staggered
      enrollment will apply for the first three volunteers within the group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adults aged 18-50

          2. Able and willing (in the Investigator's opinion) to comply with all study requirements

          3. Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with
             their General Practitioner

          4. For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception (see
             below) during the study and a negative pregnancy test on the day(s) of screening and
             vaccination (for women of child bearing potential only)

          5. Agreement to refrain from blood donation during the course of the study

          6. Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
             product in the 30 days preceding enrolment, or planned use during the study period

          2. Prior receipt of an investigational vaccine likely to impact on interpretation of the
             trial data.

          3. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate

          4. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state, including HIV
             infection; asplenia; recurrent, severe infections and chronic (more than 14 days)
             immunosuppressant medication within the past 6 months (inhaled and topical steroids
             are allowed)

          5. History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine

          6. Any history of anaphylaxis in relation to vaccination

          7. Pregnancy, lactation or willingness/intention to become pregnant during the study (for
             women of child bearing potential only)

          8. History of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cervical carcinoma in
             situ)

          9. History of serious psychiatric condition likely to affect participation in the study

         10. Bleeding disorder (eg. Factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet disorder), or prior
             history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or venepuncture

         11. Any other serious chronic illness requiring hospital specialist supervision

         12. Suspected or known current alcohol abuse as defined by an alcohol intake of greater
             than 42 units every week

         13. Suspected or known injecting drug abuse in the 5 years preceding enrolment

         14. Seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)

         15. Seropositive for hepatitis C virus (antibodies to HCV)

         16. Any clinically significant abnormal finding on screening biochemistry and haematology
             blood tests or urinalysis

         17. Any other significant disease, disorder or finding which may significantly increase
             the risk to the volunteer because of participation in the study, affect the ability of
             the volunteer to participate in the study or impair interpretation of the study data

         18. Inability of the study team to contact the volunteer's GP to confirm medical history
             and safety to participate
