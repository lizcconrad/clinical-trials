  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that a plasma protein named osteopontin (OPN) could serve as a biological
      predictive marker of acute AVF dysfunction. In several scientific studies, plasma OPN was
      correlated with coronary stent restenosis, and with cardiovascular outcome in patients with
      diabetes and renal insufficiency. This protein is secreted by several cellular types, like
      distal tubule epithelial cells, macrophages, but also fibroblasts and cardiac and vascular
      endothelial cells, in response to several specific stimuli. It acts like a cytokine, inducing
      immunological mechanisms as well as tissue remodeling.

      The main objective of this study is to show that the amount of plasma OPN is higher in
      patients presenting with an AVF stenosis, compared with patients with a functioning AVF.

      OSMOSIS is a monocentric pilot study that will include patients into two groups during 12
      months (no specific follow-up). The control group will include patients that have been
      dialyzed on an AVF, in the dialysis center of Nice University Hospital, for at least 3 months
      without any incident. The experimental group will include hemodialysis patients hospitalized
      in the department of vascular surgery for acute AVF dysfunction, needing endovascular or open
      surgical revision for venous stenosis.

      Blood will be withdrawn right before dialysis or surgical procedure. Plasma OPN will me
      measured by ELISA. Their clinical data would be collected from medical file at the same time.
      After the procedure, patients will be followed-up according to usual protocols.

      To show a significant difference of 100ng/mL plasma OPN between the two groups, with a power
      of 90% and alpha risk of 0.05, we plan to include 76 patients
