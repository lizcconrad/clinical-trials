  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated whether electrical stimulation (ES) prior to a hand function training
      session for a total of eight weeks can better improve neuromuscular control and hand function
      in subacute stroke individuals and change electroencephalography-electromyography (EEG-EMG)
      coherence, as compared to the control (sham ES).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomly assigned into ES and control groups. Both groups received 20-minute
      hand function training twice a week, and the ES group received 40-minute ES on the median
      nerve of the affected side before each training session. The control group received sham ES -
      electrodes were placed on the same location but no electric current was applied. EEG, EMG and
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) were collected before, at the 4th week, at the end of 8th week,
      and 4 weeks after the end of intervention.
