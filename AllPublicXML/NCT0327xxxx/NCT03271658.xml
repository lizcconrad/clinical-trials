  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients and families want to be involved in healthcare decisions [1]. When the
      decision-making process does not engage older patients and their families, the care provided
      does not match patient preferences or meet their needs [2]. Healthcare teams can collaborate
      to support patients and families facing difficult healthcare decisions, such as decisions
      about the use of technology used to keep a person alive when they are critically ill. Tools
      called patient decision aids are used in many health care settings to help patients and
      families understand their options and figure out the benefits and harms of a treatment to
      decide what is right for them [3,4]. The healthcare team can make sure that they understand
      the information provided, give them opportunities to ask questions, and help them talk more
      about the decision with others. This research study is trialing an internet based patient
      decision aid class of intervention. It is anticipated that 120 hospitalized, seriously ill,
      older adult patients/ families and their healthcare professionals will be recruited. The
      study will determine if the intervention can improve dialogue about whether life sustaining
      technology for seriously ill older patients. The findings will contribute to what is already
      known about overcoming challenges to involving patients and families with a goal of keeping
      patients and families at the center of decisions about their health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A concurrent mixed method study of a life support decision aid (eLSDA) intends to prepare
      hospitalized, seriously ill older adult patients and their families to participate in shared
      decision-making. The study includes 1) randomized controlled trial and 2) a qualitative
      (naturalistic observation) study. The experimental study will compare a convenience cohort of
      participants who receive usual care (n=60 patients or patient/surrogate pairs) to a cohort of
      participants who receive the intervention (n=60 patients or patient/surrogate pairs). We
      intend to measure a) knowledge of life-sustaining technologies, b) clarity of values, c)
      congruence between documented physician's orders and patient choice, d) decisional conflict,
      and e) quality of communication. For the intervention group only, we will measure
      comprehensibility and acceptability of the eLSDA. The observational qualitative study derived
      from naturalistic observation will involve participant observation to examine dialogue about
      life support between hospitalized, seriously ill older adult patients, families and their
      healthcare professionals. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected to better
      understand the comprehensibility, acceptability, usability, feasibility and impact of the
      eLSDA used in routine clinical practice.

      Questionnaires, patient/family/physician discussions and web based tool viewing will be
      completed in a hospital setting. The research assistant will administer pre-intervention
      questionnaires to the participants, which will take approximately 15 minutes. They will then
      be randomized to groups, and be invited to use the web based eLSDA or usual care materials on
      a laptop computer or tablet (30 minutes). This will be followed by post-intervention
      questionnaires in a second interview (15 minutes). Physicians and nurses/social workers will
      be asked to complete a survey to examine the barriers to discussions about goals of care (15
      minutes). Research Assistants will also fill out the chart abstraction tool after the
      patient/family give consent.

    <masking_description>The doctor will not be told which intervention was used with the patient.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability &amp; Usability of the eLSDA</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The acceptability and usability is assessed by conducting an Acceptability Survey which asks participants 8 validated questions about the use, amount of information, length, clarity, balance in presentation, willingness to recommend to others and overall suitability for decision making. The intervention will be considered acceptable if score of the acceptability survey exceeds 80%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge about life-sustaining technologies</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This knowledge of life-sustaining technologies will be measured after using the eLSDA using the self-report questionnaire. The knowledge questionnaire was developed for this study based on the eLSDA to test users' knowledge of life-sustaining technologies.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Congruence between documented physician orders and patient choice when participants use the eLSDA and/or based on patient communication during the discussion with their physician will be reported as simple agreement: (Yes/No)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Evaluation Process</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The measures of feasibility are established by the rate of completion of the eLSDA, debriefing and study procedures. The study will be considered feasible if 60% of those approached agreed to participate in the study; &gt;75% of participants discuss the decision about life support during the encounter, &lt;5% of the participants are distressed by the eLSDA, and 80% of participants complete data collection.</description>

    <description>The web-based life support decision aid (eLSDA) was adapted from a print-based decision aid. The eLSDA includes information on the pros and cons of both life support and comfort care. The eLSDA lays out the decision about life support for an individual patient/family in a logical stepwise fashion to permit discussion, ask questions, and permit reflection on each step. At the end of the eLSDA, unmet decision-making needs are identified to seek support from the healthcare team.</description>
