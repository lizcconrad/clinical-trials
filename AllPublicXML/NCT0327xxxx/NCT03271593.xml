  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The impact of rotavirus vaccination on the burden of disease has been well documented.
      However, the anticipated reduction in hospital pressures has yet to be described. This study
      will provide quantitative measures of hospital pressure prior to and post vaccine
      introduction, provide a template for future hospital pressures studies related to vaccine
      introduction and provide measures which could be used in an economic evaluation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in bed day occupancy (BDO) rates</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>BDO rate is measured as the number of bed days occupied divided by the total number of bed days available in a ward during a fixed time period. BDO rate will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in turnover (TO) rates</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>TO rate is the change in average hospital duration measured as average number of days stay per admission. TO rate will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in early unplanned readmission (UR) rates</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>UR rate (within 7 days after discharge) is measured as the number of readmissions ≤7 days after discharge (x100) divided by the total number of discharges. UR rate will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rate of nosocomial infections (NOSO)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>NOSO rate is measured as positive test from a test taken &gt;2 days after admission. NOSO rate will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVAG) tests taken</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>RVAG rate will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in number of positive test results</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>Number of positive RVAG test results will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in rate of hospitalization in children less that 5 years old</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in rate of hospitalization (in children less that 5 years old) will be measured in overall admissions, admissions for infectious disease only, admissions for gastro-enteritis only, admissions for rotavirus induced gastro-enteritis only</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of a Quality of Care (QoC) score</measure>
    <time_frame>During the study observation period of 15 years (1st July 2000 - 30th June 2015)</time_frame>
    <description>To develop the QoC score, a baseline rate/score for each outcome measure out-of-season (June-December) will be developed pre-vaccine introduction (vaccine introduction: 30th July 2013). Each outcome measure in the pre-vaccine period and post-vaccine period in-peak-season (January to May) will be scaled against that score. An overall QoC-Score pre- and post-vaccine in peak season will be calculated by summing scores for each outcome measure</description>
