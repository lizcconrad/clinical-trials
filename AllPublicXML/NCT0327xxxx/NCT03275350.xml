  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Primary Objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of HIV clinic-based
      extended-release Naltrexone (XR-NTX) in decreasing substance use and increasing HIV viral
      suppression in HIV-infected participants with opioid use disorder to Treatment as Usual in
      this population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CTN-0055 CHOICES pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of extended-release naltrexone
      (XR-NTX) for treatment of opioid use disorder in HIV primary care. The CTN-0067 CHOICES
      scale-up study builds on lessons learned from the pilot and uses the Consolidated Framework
      for Implementation Research to advance understanding of XR-NTX adoption in HIV primary care
      clinics. The study is an open-label, randomized, comparative effectiveness trial of
      office-based XR-NTX for 24 weeks (6 monthly injections) versus treatment as usual (TAU) in
      HIV-infected participants with untreated opioid use disorder. Each participant will be
      engaged in the overall study for 25 to 28 weeks, depending on the speed of screening and
      enrollment procedures.

    <time_frame>Between baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Number of days of opioid use between baseline and 24 weeks, measured by the Timeline Follow-Back (count; self-report), will be used to compare opioid use by treatment group. Confirmatory analysis will assess opioid use by the number of days of opioid use in the last 30 days of the study (by Addiction Severity Index-lite; count; self-report) and the number of monthly urine drug screen (UDS) negative for opioids between baseline and 24 weeks (count; laboratory data). Analyzed using rank-based methods such as Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.</description>
