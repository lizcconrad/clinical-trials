  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barrett's oesophagus is a transformation of the esophageal mucous membrane there intestinal
      metaplasia under the effect of gastro- esophageal reflux disease (GERD).

      This metaplasia can evolve in low grade dysplasia LGD) , high grade dysplasia (HGD) then
      invasive adenocarcinoma.

      The treatment of the HGD of the Barrett is the endoscopic treatment. It is about a
      superficial treatment of tumor without ganglionar invasion by definition.

      The endoscopic treatment of the Barrett began in the 2000s, and showed its long-term
      efficiency.

      The studied factors of recurrences are the length of the Barrett, the influence of the
      eradication completes of the Barrett besides the eradication of the dysplasia, as well as the
      duration of spacing of the procedures. An anatomical zone is particularly delicate to treat.
      It is about the anatomical junction between the oesophagus and the stomach appointed junction
      oeso-gastric or cardia or line Z.

      This almost virtual zone is the site of most of the recurrence. The first cause of the
      oesophagus of Barrett and of its transformation in HGD is the reflux.

      This reflux can be handled by medicinal action inhibitor of the pump with proton (PPI) or by
      surgery (hemi-fundo plicator). This reflux is probably the cause of the long-term recurrence
      found in the literature.

      The surgery is a good treatment of the reflux with however unsatisfactory long-term results.
      On the other hand, the surgery is little used after endoscopic treatment of a HGD not to
      compromise the surveillance and the detection of a second offense potentially masked in the
      surgical fundo-plicator. The endoscopic treatment of the expensive ebb because of the based
      necessary material too on a fundo-plicator is complicated with use in reason also of his
      cost.

      The medical treatment by PPI for life, besides his duration and thus the potential hardness
      for the patient, presents long-term complications recently described.

      Effects on the appearance of gastric precancerous lesion is not certain, but this association
      with an osteoporosis is more proved true.

      The PPI could also be a etiologic factor of chronic renal insufficiency and insanity.

      An endoscopic treatment describes by Inoue &quot; Anti-Reflux Mucosectomy &quot; ( ARMS) allows to
      decrease the gastro- esophageal reflux disease.

      This treatment is an equivalent of on treatment of the line Z which would at the same time
      allow to make sure of the decrease of recurrence on the line Z by complete treatment of this
      one and to handle the reflux of these patients.

      In this experimental series, 10 patients having made this endoscopic treatment were able to
      stop their treatment by PPI.

      The purpose of this study will be to make sure of the efficiency of the endoscopic treatment
      of the reflux by it on treatment of this line Z while decreasing the frequent recurrences on
      this line Z.
