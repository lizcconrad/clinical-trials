  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with stroke show abnormal movement pattern of upper limb. The movement pattern
      needs to be corrected. There are several methods to train normal movement. Exercise with
      technology is an active movement and affects sensory and cognitive systems. It may benefit to
      individuals with stroke in training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with stroke sign informed consent. They are trained with virtual reality game
      with and without feedback from a researcher. Age-matched healthy play the same game as
      individuals with stroke do. Both individuals with stroke and healthy are measured upper limb
      movement pattern.
