          -  requires a TKA revision defined as one of the following:

               1. a one-stage aseptic revision procedure

               2. a one-stage septic exchange procedure (requiring removal of all hardware) for
                  acute postoperative infection

               3. removal of cement spacer and re-implantation procedure

          -  if female, has a negative urine or serum pregnancy test at screening and day of
             revision surgery. Women who have had surgical sterilization by a medically accepted
             method such as tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or oophorectomy or are post-menopausal,

        The subject:

          -  continues to meet all pre-operative inclusion criteria

          -  has undergone a TKA revision resulting in a closed surgical incision

        Pre-operative Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject:

          -  is pregnant or lactating

          -  will undergo a bilateral TKA

          -  was previously randomized in this protocol

          -  has a systemic infection at the time of revision

          -  has a remote-site skin infection at the time of revision

          -  has tattoos in the area of the incision

          -  has known sensitivity to the study product components (drape and/or dressing materials
             in direct contact with the closed incision or skin)

          -  has known sensitivity to silver

        Intra-operative Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject:

          -  is found to meet any of the pre-operative exclusion criteria

          -  has a surgical incision that precludes placement of dressing

          -  has a TKA revision resulting in a muscle flap

          -  has a TKA revision resulting in the placement of a spacer

          -  has an incision drainage and debridement procedure only

          -  has a surgical incision closed with skin glue
