      This analysis describes the distribution of TBI and the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID)
      and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) among toddlers, non-pregnant women, and pregnant women.

      Background: Total body iron stores (TBI), which are calculated from serum ferritin (SF) and
      soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) concentrations, can be used to assess the iron status of
      populations in the United States.

      Objective: This analysis describes the distribution of TBI and the prevalence of iron
      deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) among toddlers, non-pregnant women, and
      pregnant women.

      Design: Investigators analyzed data from NHANES; toddlers aged 12-23 mo (NHANES 2003-2010),
      non-pregnant women aged 15-49 y (NHANES 2007-2010), and pregnant women aged 12-49 y (NHANES
      1999-2010). Investigators used SAS survey procedures to plot distributions of TBI and produce
      prevalence estimates of ID and IDA for each target population. All analyses were weighted to
      account for the complex survey design
