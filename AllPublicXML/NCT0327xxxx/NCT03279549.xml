  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burns are common injuries in the daily life and wars. With the development of medical
      techniques, the mortality has been significantly reduced. However, the deformity and
      disability caused by hypertrophic scar have not been improved effectively since the wound
      repair technology is limited and controversial, especially on the early treatment of deep
      second degree burns. The prognosis of burns is of great difference. In recent years, the
      promotion of wound repairing technologies provides a new opportunity for improving the
      quality of wound healing and solving the problem of scar formation. Although some new methods
      and techniques have shown significant efficacy in clinic, clinical researches with large
      samples conducted in multiple centers are still deficient, impeding the evaluation of their
      superiority. Therefore, the current protocol focuses on the repair of deep second degree
      burns based on previous researches. There are four types of treatment protocols for wounds.
      Patients were divided into four groups randomly, including regular dressing change group,
      controlled debridement + biological dressing covering group (xenogeneic acellular dermal
      matrix), controlled debridement + epidermal cell cultivation group, controlled debridement +
      bFGF treatment group. The wound healing rate, healing time and scar formation were observed.
      The availability and security were evaluated. Further more, treatment guidelines and expert
      consensuses on deep second degree burn wounds were concluded. Above studies are important to
      promote the treatment of deep second degree burns to be scientific, standardized and
      professional in China.

    <description>Through regular dressing changes to clean the wound, reduce bacterial growth in the wound and protect the wound. In recent years, nano-silver ion gel and dressings are widely used in burns, which effectively reduced the risk of wound infection and beneficial for wound healing. This technique is widely used in clinic.</description>

    <description>In the removal of necrotic dermis in the &quot;rather not deep&quot; principle, as far as possible not damage the normal dermal tissue and skin accessories. This could improve circulation of wounds and improve wound healing. The xenogeneic acellular dermal matrix dressing has a better protective effect on burn wound after debridement. After covering, the wound will remain alive for about two weeks, providing a good microenvironment for wound repair.</description>

This could improve circulation of wounds and improve wound healing. Epidermal cell spraying technology is a brand new method to rapidly collect epidermal cells from patients themselves and then used on their wounds. The recipient site is 40-80 times than the donor site.</description>

    <description>In the removal of necrotic dermis in the &quot;rather not deep&quot; principle, as far as possible not damage the normal dermal tissue and skin accessories. This could improve circulation of wounds and improve wound healing. BFGF is a kind of polypeptide capable of promoting the growth of fibroblasts, and it also promotes the proliferation, differentiation and migration of epidermal cells. Studies have shown that bFGF could significantly improve the healing of burn wounds.</description>
