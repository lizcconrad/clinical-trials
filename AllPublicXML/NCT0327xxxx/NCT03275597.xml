  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study to evaluate safety and tolerability of dual checkpoint inhibition
      (DCI) of durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) and tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) with SBRT in the treatment of
      oligometastatic NSCLC. This study will examine the sequential delivery of SBRT to all disease
      sites followed by combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab for patients for whom the goal
      is ablating all known sites of disease. We anticipate that for many patients this will be the
      first line-therapy. Patients who have received prior-platinum-based chemotherapy and/or any
      line of prior chemotherapy are eligible. Prior immunotherapy treatment is not allowed.
