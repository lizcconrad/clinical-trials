      The primary objective of this study is to experimentally test the momentary and more distal
      psychological effects of daily self weighing as compared to an active control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two significant public health problems, obesity and eating disorders, are prevalent during
      emerging adulthood, a unique stage of life between ages 18 and 25. Over half of emerging
      adults experience weight gain and/or disordered eating (e.g. overly restrictive dieting,
      binge eating); both of which contribute to obesity. Because many emerging adults attend
      college, the college community represents a viable population for implementing interventions
      to prevent weight gain, while not triggering disordered eating.

      A promising strategy for preventing weight gain during college is daily self-weighing, an
      example of behavioral self-monitoring, an evidence-based strategy for weight control.
      Self-monitoring is fundamental to behavior change: feedback allows the user to evaluate
      progress in relation to a goal and modify behavior. Despite self-monitoring being
      recommended, some evidence suggests that self-monitoring strategies, self-weighing in
      particular, may have unintended psychological consequences; the concern being that negative
      mood states could precipitate disordered eating. Alternatively, other evidence suggests
      positive psychological outcomes related to daily self-weighing in young adults.

      Technological advances have allowed for users to track personal health information in real
      time. Given that 60% of U.S. adults track weight, diet, or exercise, and 92% of adults aged
      18-34 own a smartphone, electronic self-monitoring is feasible in this population. What is
      less known is individuals' psychological and behavioral response to self-monitoring. This
      original, important study will contribute to the fields of obesity and eating disorders and
      experimentally test the psychological effects of this daily weight-control intervention.

    <description>Daily self-weighing will result in significantly greater reactivity than daily-temperature-taking
There will be no significance in mood ratings between daily self-weighing and daily temperature-taking groups for EMA recordings later in the day.
The daily self-weighing group will report significantly more weight control behaviors at the end of the day as compared to the daily temperature-taking group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identify moderators of response to daily self-weighing in a college-aged female population</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with lower baseline dietary restraint scores will experience significantly greater success in preventing weight gain over 3 months in response to daily self-weighing as compared to daily temperature-taking, in comparison to those with higher baseline dietary restraint scores
Participants with higher baseline body satisfaction, lower body consciousness, and higher-self esteem will have significantly more favorable reactions to daily self-weighing, both in terms of momentary mood and prevention of weight gain over 3 months
Baseline weight status will moderate the effectiveness of daily self-weighing as a weight gain prevention tool, such that it will work significantly better for overweight patients.</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided with a scale and instructions necessary to engage in daily self-weighing, first thing in the morning for the next three months.
Height and weight will be measured using standard procedures
Questionnaires will be administered at baseline and EOT: Sociodemographic questions (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, self-weighing frequency, weight goals will be collected at baseline. To assess factors that may modify reaction to intervention condition,a questionnaire will assess participant's eating attitudes, behaviors, and perception of their body.
Questionnaires (baseline, end of Week 1, 2, 3, 4 and EOT): In order to compare results with published studies assessing constructs over varying time frames, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression will be measured at baseline, weekly for the first month, and again at EOT.</description>
