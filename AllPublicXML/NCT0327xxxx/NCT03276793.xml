      This study will include 60 subjects with medication-refractory depression undergoing
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
      In order to obtain good quality data and account for attrition, 80 subjects will be
      recruited. Subjects will be recruited from the Clinical Program of FDA approved TMS at the
      Berenson-Allen Center and the Butler TMS Clinic (40 per site). Subjects will undergo an
      hour-long MRI scanning session, an optional DNA-sample collection, up to three 20 minute
      neuronavigation sessions for marking the site of TMS stimulation, questionnaires, and a
      behavioral testing battery before and after their TMS treatment course. The task battery will
      last 45-60 minutes and consist of the Emotion Conflict Resolution (ECR) task, Multi-Source
      Interference Task (MSIT), War Game (Gambling) task, and Associative Learning with Reversal
      task. Subjects' scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI) will also be assessed before and after the TMS course. MRI data will be
      utilized to identify brain regions whose connectivity to the stimulation site co-varies with
      the aforementioned objective measures of symptom improvement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female

          2. Aged 18-70.

          3. Have previously received or will receive TMS to the left dorsal-lateral prefrontal
             cortex as part of the clinical treatment program at the Berenson-Allen Center for
             Non-invasive Brain Stimulation or the Psychiatric Neurotherapeutics program at McLean
             Hospital for treatment of medication resistant depression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any current or past history of a major psychiatric illness other than depression (e.g.
             bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder,
             post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder)

          2. Any significant current neurological illness (e.g. a history of seizures or
             unexplained loss of consciousness, a family history of epilepsy, signs of increased
             intracranial pressure, previously abnormal MRI scans, parkinsonism or dementia). Of
             note, most of these are also contraindications to receiving TMS and these patients
             would not be enrolled in the clinical treatment program.

          3. Patients who are pregnant or lactating (by menstrual history)

          4. Current abuse of an illicit substance (e.g. marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens,
             psychostimulants)

          5. Positive MRI screen that would preclude the subject from undergoing magnetic resonance
             imaging. These include, but are not limited to any of the following:

               1. Known metal in the head (such as a surgical aneurysm clip), or a history of prior
                  neurosurgical procedures

               2. Ferromagnetic bioimplants activated by any electronic, mechanical or magnetic
                  means such as: cochlear implants, pacemakers, medication pumps, vagal
                  stimulators, deep brain stimulators, neurostimulators, biostimulators, or
                  ventriculo-peritoneal shunts

               3. Subjects who have or might have bullet fragments or other metal fragments
                  (veterans or workers exposed to metal in their work environment)

               4. Subjects with metallic paint (e.g. color contact lenses, tattoos, metallic
                  eyeliner)

               5. Subjects expressing significant anxiety or claustrophobia about being in the
                  magnet.

          6. Subjects that cannot adhere to the experimental protocol for any reason.
