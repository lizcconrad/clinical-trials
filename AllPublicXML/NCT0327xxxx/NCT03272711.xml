      The purpose of this research study is to examine the potential benefits of vortioxetine in
      combination with at-home computerized cognitive training program to improve cognition, such
      as memory, attention, and concentration. This study will compare the effectiveness of
      vortioxetine plus cognitive training versus placebo plus cognitive training.

      The purpose of this research study is to examine the potential benefits of vortioxetine in
      combination with at-home computerized cognitive training program to improve cognition, such
      as memory, attention, and concentration. This study will compare the effectiveness of
      vortioxetine plus cognitive training versus placebo plus cognitive training.

      Vortioxetine is considered investigational when used as a treatment for age-related cognitive
      decline, which means that it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      for this purpose. Vortioxetine is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a
      treatment for depression, and also goes by the name Trintellix (formerly known as
      Brintellix). That means that, while the drug itself is approved by the FDA, it is not
      approved for the reasons the investigators are using it in this study.

      Participation in this study entails an estimated 6 study visits over the course of
      approximately six months. Participants will complete various assessments at our lab at the
      Washington University School of Medicine along with check-in visits in-person or over the
      phone. Additionally, they will participate in at home computerized cognitive training for
      approximately six months, supplemented with either vortioxetine or placebo.

      The investigators will assess memory and problem-solving abilities using paper and pencil,
      computerized measures, and self-assessments of how participants feel. These tests could
      include numbers, letters, symbols, words, or sentences. These tests will be repeated
      throughout the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Community-living men and women age 65 and older

          -  Age-related cognitive decline as defined by (a) self-reported cognitive dysfunction
             that is attributed to the aging process (in response to screening questions to the
             participant); (b) ability to complete cognitive battery, but still scoring less than 1
             standard deviation above age-matched norms at both baseline and after the two-week
             cognitive training lead-in.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known dementia or other clinical neurodegenerative illness (e.g., Parkinson's disease,
             cerebrovascular disease) per self-report, informant report, medical records, or
             neuropsychological testing

          -  Any current psychiatric disorder

          -  Medical conditions that suggest shortened lifespan, such as metastatic cancer; or
             would prohibit safe participation in the interventions, including cardiovascular
             disease or musculoskeletal conditions; or with the assessments.

          -  Sensory impairment that would prevent participation

          -  IQ &lt; 70 as estimated by the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading

          -  Alcohol or substance abuse within 6 months

          -  Concurrent cognitive training, such as brain-training software, or other interventions
             expected to affect neuroplasticity

          -  Psychotropic medications or those with likely CNS effects (none within 4 weeks prior
             to study entry)
