    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial. The
             subject may also provide consent/assent for Future Biomedical Research. However, the
             subject may participate in the main trial without participating in Future Biomedical
             Research

          2. Be &gt;18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          3. Have a histologically or cytologically-documented, advanced (metastatic and/or
             unresectable) endometrial carcinoma that is incurable and for which prior
             platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line treatment has failed. All epithelial
             endometrial histologies are eligible including: endometrioid, serous, clear-cell
             carcinoma, squamous or carcinosarcoma. Sarcomas and mesenchymal tumors are excluded.

          4. Eligible subjects must have had only 1 prior line of systemic platinum-based
             chemotherapy for advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer. Patients who
             have had 2 or more prior chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced, recurrent, or
             metastatic endometrial cancer are not allowed.

             Note: Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy included in initial treatment may not
             be considered first- or later-line treatment unless such treatments were completed
             less than 6 months prior to the current tumor recurrence. Prior treatment may include
             chemotherapy, chemotherapy/radiation therapy, and/or consolidation/maintenance
             therapy.

             Prior hormonal treatment is not considered a line of therapy in any setting. Prior
             targeted therapy no directed against PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 pathway or any other
             immunemodulating mAb (including ipilimumab and any other antibody or drug specifically
             targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways) are allowed.

          5. Have measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each
             lesion must be ≥ 10 mm in long axis when measured by CT, MRI, or caliper measurement
             by clinical exam. Lymph nodes must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when measured by CT or
             MRI. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable
             if progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria has been demonstrated in such lesions.
             Patients must have radiographic evidence of disease progression following the most
             recent line of treatment. Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable
             disease unless there is evidence of progression post radiation according to RECIST 1.1
             criteria. Patients with only one area of measureable disease that consent to have it
             biopsied are still eligible.

          6. Availability of fresh or archival FFPE tumor specimens for analysis for biomarker
             analysis from a tumor lesion not previously irradiated (exceptions may be considered
             after Sponsor consultation). (See Procedure Manual for detailed instructions). Be
             willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a tumor
             lesion if archival specimen is not available. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen
             obtained up to 4 weeks (28 days) prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1.

          7. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          8. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 2, all screening labs should
             be performed within 7 days of treatment initiation.

          9. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required. Female subjects of childbearing potential (Section 5.7.3) must be
             willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 5.7.2 -
             Contraception, for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of
             study medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Receipt of 2 or more prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced, recurrent, or
             metastatic endometrial cancer

          3. History of myocardial infarction, acute inflammatory heart disease, unstable angina,
             or uncontrolled arrhythmia within the past 6 months.

             concomitant use of potentially cardiotoxic medication.

          5. Previous anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

          6. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          7. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          8. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab, doxorubicin or any of its excipients.

          9. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study

             within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects
             with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the
             study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately
             from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
             therapy. Note: Palliative radiotherapy within 2 weeks prior to study is allowed
             provided that the site being treated is not subsequently used as a target lesions as
             per RECIST v.1.1 for the purpose of assessing tumor response on trial.

         11. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the

             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

         14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

         15. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         16. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         18. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive within the projected duration
             of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days
             after the last dose of trial treatment.

         19. Has previously participated in any other pembrolizumab (MK-3475) trial, or received
             prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or any other immunemodulating
             mAb (including ipilimumab and any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell
             co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)

         20. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. No HIV testing is
             required unless mandated by local health authority. Has a known history of or is
             positive for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] Note: Without known
             history, testing needs to be performed to determine eligibility. Hepatitis C antibody
             (Ab) testing is allowed for screening purposes in countries where HCV RNA is not part
             of standard of care.

         21. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

         22. Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, social/ psychological
             issues.
