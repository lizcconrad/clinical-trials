      Psychiatric comorbidities in patient with Painful Peripheral neuropathy
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain has been redefined by the International Association for the Study of Pain,
      as'' pain caused by a lesion or disease of somatosensory system''.Diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy is the result of nerve damage in the toes, feet, and hands . Approximately 50% of
      those diabetic peripheral neuropathy have neuropathic pain .

      Patients with persistent neuropathic pain experience work disability and activity limitation,
      with a substantial impact on their social functioning. As any chronic pain state comorbid
      depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance are common occurring in up to one half of those
      with painful neuropathy.

      The relationship between chronic pain and cognitive function has not been adequately studied
      and little is known about cognitive functioning in neuropathic conditions. This may be
      because the clinicians pay more attention to psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression
      and anxiety.Although chronic pain associated with cognitive deficits may impact on everyday
      behaviour and interfere with emotional decision-making tasks.

      In a cross-sectional survey at the Mayo clinic, the prevalence of clinician-diagnosed
      symptomatic or painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 13-15% out of 78% of those with any
      type of diabetic peripheral neuropathy . Many patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy
      experience neuropathic pain, typically characterized as burning, electric, sharp and shooting
      which initially starts in both feet and may progress to involve calves, fingers, and hands
      (stocking and glove pattern) .

      Recently it has been demonstrated an association between diabetes , diabetes complication and
      impairment of mental health and particular emphasis has been placed on the association
      between painful diabetic sensory neuropathy with depression .
