  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a public health problem, the main causes of ROP are
      prematurity, use of oxygen, malnutrition and oxidative stress. Vitamin E was used beforehand
      however its use was stopped because of its association with sepsis and enterocolitis caused
      by the excipient of vitamin E. The purpose of this study is to use vitamin E to prevent ROP,
      without the previously used excipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antioxidant defence mechanisms include cellular and extracellular enzymes. Vitamin E is the
      main fat-soluble vitamin responsible for the protection of cell membranes against
      peroxidation, thus, it protects polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation which is a step
      in the pathogenesis of ROP.

      Previous research on the roles of vitamin E, in the prevention of BPD and ROP was halted
      because of complications involving sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis. These complications
      were caused by the compositions of vitamin E oral presentations, which contain polyethylene
      glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol and, polysorbate 80. These substances, which are used as
      excipients, may generate adverse effects in premature newborns. These preparations were not
      used in this project to avoid the development of necrotising enterocolitis, and because these
      formulations are not commercially available in Mexico.

      The infants were randomly assigned to one of two groups using a computerized random number
      generator sequence; this process was handled by the hospital pharmacy staff. The treated
      group, received vitamin E 12.5 IU orally every 12 hours, from 72 h after birth until 28 days
      of age, the first blood sample collected from the newborns before the intervention was
      considered the baseline, and subsequent samples were obtained at 15 and 28 days of age.

      Control group: received orally sterile water (placebo)

    <intervention_model_description>participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatmenst (A and B) using a computarized random number generator sequence; this process was handled by the hospital pharmacy staff. Group A: received vitamin E 12.5 IU orally every 12 hours, from 72 h after birth until 28 days of age, Group B: received orally sterile water (placebo) orally every 12 hours, from 72 h after birth until 28 days of age,</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The placebo was made by a pharmacologist and was the only person who knows the treatment of A and B. The placebo was administered by nursing staff and had the same appearance and amount as vitamin E. Neither the parents of the participants nor the researchers involved in the care or analysis of the data knew the content of the treatment and B until the end of the study.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of retinopathy of prematurity</measure>
    <time_frame>For the first retinopathy diagnosis, ophthalmological evaluation was performed at 28 days of birth.</time_frame>
    <description>Retinopathy of prematurity was classified according to the International Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity revisited 2005.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Incidence of BPD was measured in each participant at 28 days old.</time_frame>
    <description>BPD diagnosis was established according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Workshop summary.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Severity of BPD was measured at corrected 36 weeks' gestational age.</time_frame>
    <description>Severity was classified into one of three stages: mild, when the patient did not required oxygen; moderate, when the patient required 30% oxygen; and severe when the patient required &gt;30% oxygen, had nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or mechanical ventilation.</description>
