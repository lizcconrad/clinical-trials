      The clinical trial studies how well 11C-glutamine and 18F-FSPG positron emission tomography
      (PET) imaging works in detecting tumors in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      compared to standard imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed
      tomography (CT) scanning.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish and validate a 11C-glutamine (11C-Gln) and fluorine F 18 L-glutamate
      derivative BAY94-9392 (18F-FSPG) PET image guided gene signature to predict response to
      EGFR-targeted therapy in patients with advanced wild-type RAS colorectal cancer (CRC).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive 11C-glutamine intravenously (IV) and undergo PET imaging over 120 minutes.
      Beginning 2 hours to 7 days after 11C-glutamine PET, patients receive fluorine F 18
      L-glutamate derivative BAY94-9392 IV and also undergo PET imaging over 120 minutes.
