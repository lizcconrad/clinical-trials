  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lipedema is a disorder characterized by massive, bilateral accumulation of fat below the
      waist and in the legs. Enlargement of the lower extremities is often accompanied by leg pain
      and accumulation of fluid. Little is known about the functional changes that lead to fat
      accumulation and pain in women with lipedema. The goals of this project is to conduct a
      comprehensive characterization of abdominal and femoral fat tissues from women with lipedema
      and to evaluate the potential effect of a diet-induced weight loss as a therapy.

      Once enrolled in the study, the following tests will be conducted on lipedema subjects: 1)
      characterization of body composition (fat tissue distribution), insulin sensitivity (response
      to insulin), adipose tissue biology, and vascular function (how arteries dilate/contract) and
      immune system function/inflammation. As control, we will have two control populations:
      BMI-matched women that are metabolically normal obese (MNO) and Metabolically Abnormal Obese
      (MAO) already analyzed in different studies at Washington University (IRB# 201512086 and
      201610005). The MAO and MNO subjects underwent the same testing described above for the
      lipedema. Therefore, we will use the data generated from IRB# 201512086 and 201610005 as
      comparison groups in the statistical analysis to understand differences and similarities
      between lipedema and obesity.

      A second aim of the study is to determine the effect of diet-induced weight loss on body
      composition, insulin sensitivity, adipose tissue biology, and vascular function in the women
      with lipedema and compare these results with data obtained from BMI-matched women with MAO
      participating in another study at Washington University (IRB# 201512086). The MAO population
      will be used as control populations and data generated from the IRB# 201512086 will be used
      as comparison group for statistical analysis. The results from this second aim of the study
      will hopefully provide important insights on the efficacy of diet therapy in managing
      lipedema.ed

      Once informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete 1 screening visit.

      Screen Visit includes a medical history, physical examination, pregnancy test (for women of
      childbearing potential), blood tests, urine drug test, an oral glucose tolerance test,
      resting electrocardiogram (ECG), questionnaires.

      Baseline testing will be performed in 7 weekly visits requiring 1 inpatient overnight stay
      and will require ~30h to complete testing. Testing will include imaging scans to determine
      leg muscle mass, abdominal (belly) fat mass and liver fat content; DXA scan, blood samples,
      skin temperature monitoring, hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure, immune system
      function/inflammation, adipose tissue and muscle biopsies, adipose tissue oxygenation
      assessment, vascular compliance testing (arterial stiffness and endothelial function).

      Once Baseline Testing is completed, participants will start 8-10% dietitian guided
      weight-loss for about 4 months with all meals provided.

      Participant will have weekly visits with a study dietitian.

      After weight loss, the testing completed during baseline will be repeated during Visit 25.

      Study procedures:

        1. Medical History &amp; Physical Exam

        2. Urine Drug/Pregnancy Test

        3. Blood pressure, pulse, height, weight, shoulder and waist circumference measurements

        4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)

        5. Blood tests for routine lab analyses

        6. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)

        7. Screening Questionnaires

        8. Food Diary

        9. Deuterated water consumption

       10. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)

       11. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) for Body
           Composition to determine 1)the amount of fat in the liver, abdomen (belly), and lower
           leg; 2)the amount of oxygen in the abdominal fat store; and 3)how much muscle mass is in
           the thigh

       12. Metabolism study (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp procedure)

       13. Resting Energy Expenditure (REE)

       14. Abdominal and Thigh Fat biopsies

       15. Muscle biopsies

       16. Skin temperature monitoring

       17. Cardiovascular testing: Carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT); Pulse wave
           velocity (SphygmoCor); Endothelial function (Endopat)
