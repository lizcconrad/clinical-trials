  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FLIP topography has been FDA cleared to evaluate a variety of esophageal conditions, but has
      never been evaluated in patients with scleroderma. The investigators hope to evaluate this
      technology in patients who have scleroderma and various esophageal symptoms, and compare to
      non-scleroderma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with treatment refractory reflux disease, dysphagia (trouble swallowing) or other
      symptoms possibly attributed to the esophagus, the standard protocol is generally to first do
      an upper endoscopy to evaluate for abnormalities. If this is normal the next step is often to
      do esophageal manometry to measure esophageal muscle contractions, along with a Ph/impedance
      study in certain clinical situations. If these are normal, then the the disorder is thought
      to be functional (no clear biological pathology). However, it is believed that FLIP
      (Functional Luminal Imaging Probe) technology may pick up additional disorders of the
      esophagus missed by standard esophageal manometry, leading to different treatments in certain
      cases. Additionally, FLIP technology offers a different approach to classifying motility
      disorders of the esophagus.

      FLIP is a technology that measures distensibility and diameter of the esophagus during
      endoscopy by inflating a balloon in the esophagus. It has previously been used to aid in the
      diagnosis and provide more information regarding gastroesophageal reflux disease, achalasia,
      and eosinophilic esophagitis. It has also been used pre and post fundoplication and myotomy
      to assess adequacy of these procedure.

      More recently a group at northwestern has developed a modification of this procedure called
      FLIP topography. The basic principles are the same, but this technique measures the reaction
      of the esophagus to distension, providing additional information.

      A recent study of FLIP topography looked at 145 patients referred for dysphagia (trouble
      swallowing). All patients had both standard manometry and FLIP topography. 25% of patients in
      the study had a normal manometry, offering no measurable explanation of their symptoms. Of
      these patients, half had an abnormal FLIP topography, and additional treatments were offered
      in certain situations.

      FLIP topography has also been evaluated in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, though
      numbers are small.

      Currently, the FLIP topography device has been FDA cleared for esophageal distensibility
      testing. It has never been evaluated specifically in patients with scleroderma.

    <description>This is the readout or topographic map that is generated from the FLIP topography diagnostic procedure. We will look to see if we can make additional diagnoses not made by other clinical testing, to see if the diagnoses made by FLIP topography match with other diagnostic testing, and identify new FLIP topography patterns in patients with scleroderma not seen before.</description>

    <description>During upper endoscopy, the FLIP topography balloon will be advanced into the esophagus and inflated, providing additional information about the distensibility of the esophagus. This generally takes about 5 extra minutes and no complications have been reported. Theoretical complications include bleeding, infection, risk with extra anesthesia time, and putting a hole in the esophagus.</description>

    <description>A standard upper endoscopy will also be done in all patients. A small scope will be passed via the mouth to examine the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. The risks of this procedure include the risks associated with anesthesia, a small risk of bleeding, infection, and a very small risk of putting a hole in the gastrointestinal tract.</description>
