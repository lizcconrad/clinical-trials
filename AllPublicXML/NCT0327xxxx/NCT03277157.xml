  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of daily consumption of Bifidobacterium
      animalis ssp lactis B94 (B. lactis B94) on stool frequency, gastrointestinal (GI) transit
      time, and gastrointestinal symptoms in adults with Prader-Willi syndrome. Participants (18-75
      years old, n=36) will be recruited and enrolled in a 20-week randomized, placebo-controlled,
      crossover study. Study participants will be randomized to B. lactis B94 or placebo each for a
      4-week period, preceded by a 4-week baseline and followed by 4-week washouts. Participants
      will complete daily questionnaires about stool frequency and stool form (transit). Dietary
      intake will also be assessed. A total of 5 stools (one in each period) will be collected for
      exploratory microbiota analysis. It is hypothesized that the B. lactis B94 will increase
      stool frequency, decrease the percentage of slow transit stools, and improve GI symptoms

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics have been shown to improve symptoms of constipation by decreasing gastrointestinal
      transit time, increasing stool frequency, and normalizing stool form. A 20-week randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover study will be carried out. Participants will
      complete a 4-week baseline period during which stool frequency, stool consistency (transit
      time), and gastrointestinal symptoms will be collected by paper questionnaire, and
      participants will collect a single stool. Dietary intake data (3-day) will be obtained during
      the baseline period. Participants will be randomized on or about day 29 and will consume
      Bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis B94 (B. lactis B94) or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by a
      4-week washout, 4 weeks on the alternative, and second 4-week washout. Participants will be
      randomized by sealed envelope method, prepared by a UF faculty member not affiliated with the
      study.

      During the intervention and washout periods, participants will complete daily questionnaires
      to assess stool frequency and form (Bristol Stool Form Scale). Furthermore, they will
      complete Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) at weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20(± 3 days).
      During these same weeks (± 3 days) dietary intake data (3-day record) and stools will be
      collected (1 per period). Participants' height and weight will be taken at baseline, and
      weight during weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.
