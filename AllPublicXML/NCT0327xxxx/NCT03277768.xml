  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research evaluates tissue oxygenation (StO2) as measured by resonance raman
      spectroscopy (RRS) in premature infants with and without patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This
      is a prospective observational study of infants born at &lt; 30 weeks of gestation. The primary
      aim of this study is to determine if the difference in pre- and post-ductal StO2 as detected
      by RRS is more significant in premature infants with PDA in comparison to infants without
      PDA. The secondary aim of this study is to determine if the difference in pre- and
      post-ductal StO2 as detected by RRS is more significant in infant who develop serious adverse
      events.
