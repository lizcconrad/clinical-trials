  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, randomized clinical trial of women with refractory accidental
      bowel leakage (ABL) symptoms who have failed to achieve satisfactory symptom control from 2
      first-line treatments for ABL: supervised pelvic muscle training (PMT) and constipating
      medication. The purpose of this study is to compare percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation
      (PTNS) to a validated sham to determine if PTNS is effective for the treatment of fecal
      incontinence (FI) in women.

      The investigators will test the null hypothesis that change from baseline in St. Mark's
      (Vaizey) score after 12 weeks of stimulation is not significantly different in women with
      symptomatic ABL receiving PTNS treatments compared to women receiving sham PTNS treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this randomized clinical trial is to determine if PTNS is more
      effective than sham PTNS for the treatment of FI in women after 12 weeks of treatment and 1
      year after initiating treatment. This is a two-part trial with a Run-In Phase prior to
      randomization. The trial has the following primary aim:

      To determine whether the change from baseline in St. Mark's (Vaizey) score in women with
      symptomatic ABL undergoing PTNS differs from sham after 12 weeks of stimulation.

      Additional secondary aims include:

        1. To compare changes from baseline in self-reported functional outcomes after 12 weekly
           stimulation sessions in both PTNS and sham groups in Part 1.

        2. To determine whether symptom relief amongst study &quot;responders&quot; can be sustained for one
           year with maintenance treatments in Part II.

        3. To determine the impact of completing a bowel diary and receiving education on FI on
           symptom severity.

        4. To determine the ability of the PFDN ABL phone app bowel diary to detect changes from
           baseline in fecal incontinence episodes recorded to after 12 weeks of stimulation
           sessions.

    <masking_description>Participants will remain masked to subject treatment assignment throughout the trial. To maintain masking of participants, the duration of treatment sessions for both the PTNS and sham groups will be 30 minutes and will be conducted with subjects in a supine position with the knees comfortably abducted and flexed. The leg and foot involved in treatment will be obscured from the subject's view with a portable anesthesia drape frame to which an exam sheet will be secured.</masking_description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>PTNS treatment entails insertion of a 34 gauge needle electrode at a 60 degree angle 3-4 cm deep towards the tibial nerve, approximately 5 cm or 3 finger breadths cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia. The PTNS grounding electrode, placed near the calcaneus and the needle electrode will be connected to the ES-130 device pulse generator.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sham treatment will use the Streitberger acupuncture placebo needle in the same location as the needle electrode for PTNS. The sham uses an active gel surface electrode pad placed on the bottom of the foot just below the fifth (smallest) toe. This location is not part of the acupuncture nerve pathway connected to the bladder, pelvis or any major organs. Electrical current is delivered to this pad via a TENS unit resulting in sensory stimulation using the ES-130 device pulse generator.</description>

    <description>The ES-130 device will be used for the indication of &quot;Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation for the treatment of fecal incontinence&quot; using the FDA-approved protocol for treatment of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in the PFDN NOTABLe study. There is no PTNS device cleared by the FDA for the indication of FI treatment; therefore, this is considered an investigational device.</description>
