    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to serve as a correlative study for patients enrolled on the
      RadCOMP trial (NCT02603341), a randomized phase III study of stage II and III breast cancer
      patients treated with either conventional photon radiation or proton beam radiation

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the change in GLS between conventional radiation and proton beam radiation groups. Participants who decrease their GLS by at least 2% 6-8 months following radiation therapy will be considered to demonstrate a significant decrement in GLS.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) Using Echocardiography</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (approximately 10 weeks), then 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the change in LVEF between conventional radiation and proton beam radiation groups. Reduced cardiac function is defined as an ejection fraction &lt;50%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiation-induced Lung Parenchymal Changes Using CT Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3,6,12, months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Radiation-induced lung parenchymal changes will be assess with non-contrast enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scans and incidence will be estimated in each radiation group by the cumulative incidence function and compared using Gray's test. Among patients who do not have any changes detected, death and disease progression will be considered as competing risks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Thyroid Dysfunction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (approximately 10 weeks), then 12, 24, 36, and 60 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of thyroid insufficiency will be estimated in each radiation group by the cumulative incidence function and compared using Gray's test. In the absence of thyroid dysfunction, death and disease progression will be considered as competing risks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Ipsilateral Arm Lymphedema</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (approximately 10 weeks), then 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of ipsilateral arm lymphedema will be estimated in each radiation group by the cumulative incidence function and compared using Gray's test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Severity of Ipsilateral Arm Lymphedema</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (approximately 10 weeks), then 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Serial arm measurements may be analyzed using mixed effects model to compare the severity of ipsilateral arm lymphedema over time between the radiation groups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ipsilateral Breast/Chest Wall Cosmesis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, end of treatment (approximately 10 weeks), then 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Breast cosmesis will be assessed with characteristics graded on a four-point scale. Assessments will be performed by a trained nurse/nurse practitioner using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Cosmetic Rating System for Breast Cancer. Incidence of adverse cosmesis (2=fair or 3=poor score) will be estimated in each radiation group by the cumulative incidence function and compared using Gray's test. Among patients without adverse breast cosmesis, death and disease progression will be considered as competing risks.</description>
