  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study intends to establish proof of concept for a fractional dose schedule under
      conditions of natural exposure in children 5-17 months old at first vaccination. The study
      also aims to establish the role of third dose spacing in a fractional dose schedule, describe
      the effect of an earlier full fourth dose at Month 14 and describe the effect of multiple
      fractional or full yearly doses.

      The current study intends to establish proof of concept (POC) for a fractional dose schedule
      under conditions of natural exposure. The study will be conducted in children 5-17 months old
      at first vaccination living in areas of mid to high malaria transmission, in line with the
      age group recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the implementation of the
      RTS,S/AS01E vaccine. Results from this study will be critical in informing future
      possibilities for the development of vaccine-based strategies which, in combination with
      other interventions, may contribute to the malaria elimination agenda.

          -  Signed or thumb-printed and witnessed informed consent obtained from the
             parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject prior to performance of any study specific procedure.

             independent witness.

          -  A male or female between, and including, five and 17 months of age at the time of the

             Union member state or WHO [with respect to prequalification]) other than the study
             vaccines during the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccines
             (Day -29 to Day 0), or planned use during the study period.

          -  Any medical condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make
             intramuscular injection unsafe.

             or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting six months prior to the

             pediatric subjects) or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol

          -  History of any, or documented, serious adverse reaction to rabies vaccination.

          -  Contraindication to rabies vaccination (Rabipur is contraindicated in subjects with an
             history of a severe hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Note

          -  Major congenital defects.

          -  Serious chronic illness.

          -  Children with a past history of a neurological disorder or atypical febrile seizure (a
             febrile seizure is atypical if it meets one of the following criteria: not associated
             with fever; lasts &gt; 5 minutes; focal (not generalized); followed by transient or
             persistent neurological abnormality; occurs in a child &lt; 6 months of age).

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment. Fever is defined as temperature ≥
             37.5°C/99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic route, or ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F for rectal
             route.

        Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection)
        without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting
             three months before the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during

          -  Moderate or severe malnutrition at screening defined as weight for age or weight for
             height Z-score &lt; -2.

          -  Hemoglobin concentration &lt; 8 g/dl at screening.
