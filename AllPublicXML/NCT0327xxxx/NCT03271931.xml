  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) events are the leading cause of mortality in the United States. Statins
      have been demonstrated to be an effective tool for reducing CV events and mortality, but
      statins are often either not prescribed or under-prescribed for patients that meet
      evidence-based guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate a health system initiative using
      active choice prompts in the electronic health record to prompt cardiologists to prescribe
      evidence-based statin therapy. In partnership with the health system, this will be conducted
      as a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate its effect.

      This study will use a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate a health system initiative.
      Cardiologists randomly assigned to the control arm will receive no interventions. For
      cardiologists randomly assigned to the active choice intervention, the electronic health
      record will be used to prompt cardiologists to initiate or change statin therapy for patients
      not on evidenced-based guidelines based on the 2013 American College of Cardiology / American
      Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the National Lipid Association (NLA) through a &quot;best practice
      alert&quot; in EPIC. The intervention period will be 6 months in duration.

    <description>Cardiologists in this arm will be exposed to a passive choice alert within the EHR, using the same evidence-based guidelines as in the active choice arm. The passive alert will not block clinician workflow and instead will be available in the background for the cardiologist to open and then use to make a prescribing decision.</description>
