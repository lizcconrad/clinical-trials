  <brief_summary>

      Overall aim of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of two different surgical
      methods to treat Late In-the-bag intraocular lens dislocation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cataract is a condition of unclear lens that cause poor vision. The only treatment is surgery
      where the blurred biological lens is replaced with an artificial clear lens (IOL). Most
      people who operate achieve full vision. Nevertheless, serious complications may occasionally
      occur, and one of these is dislocation of the entire complex with IOL and lens capsule. This
      requires surgical treatment.

      In this study the investigators want to compare two different surgical methods used in late
      dislocation of IOL inside the capsule after cataract surgery. Patients will be randomly
      affiliated to either the suturing of existing IOL / capsule complex, or lens exchange to an
      IOL fixed to the iris.

      The focus of the trial will be especially on complications and other eye changes in the early
      stages of surgery. Today, little data is available on these topics, and the investigators
      believe that new knowledge can bring us closer to a response to preferred operating
      techniques and an optimal drug drop regime for the patient group.

          -  Late dislocation (more than 6 months after cataract surgery)

          -  IOL visible in the pupillary area in the supine position and hence possible to perform

          -  Willing to participate in the study, e.g. willingness to participate at all control
             visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IOL designs that cannot be repositioned with a suture loop, such as plate-haptic IOLs
             without holes in the peripheral part

          -  Eyes with especially thin sclera

          -  Active uveitis or pronounced iris pathology

             (DSAEK)

          -  Totally dislocated IOL into the posterior segment of the eye requiring pars plana
             vitrectomy

          -  Eyes that prior to cataract extraction had a subluxated lens in need of surgery with a
             Cionni capsular tension ring (e.g. patients with Marfan syndrome and ectopia lentis)

          -  Cases requiring a change in refraction. Risk of severe anisometropia

          -  Patients unable to lie in supine position for surgery in local anesthesia, e.g. severe
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and severe heart failure

          -  Patients using anticoagulants that cannot be discontinued

        For patients with dislocated IOLs in both eyes during the study period, only the first
        operated eye will be included. Patients without prospects of improvement in vision will be
        excluded.
