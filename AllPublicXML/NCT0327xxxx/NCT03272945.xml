  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Linked color imaging (LCI) was recently developed and uses a laser endoscopic system
      (Fujifilm Co, Tokyo, Japan) that acquires images by simultaneously using narrow-band
      short-wavelength light and white-light (WL) in an appropriate balance. LCI is a new
      image-enhancing technology that is intended to enhance slight color differences in the red
      region of the mucosa. The acquired color information is reallocated to differentiate colors
      that are similar to the mucosal color, resulting in improved performance in depicting blood
      vessels, and additional image processing that enhances color separation for red color permits
      clear visualization of red blood vessels and white pits. This modality may increase the
      detection rate of colorectal polyps by enhancing the visibility of colonic mucosal vessels.
      In addition, it has been reported that LCI increases the visibility of colorectal flat
      lesions and contributes to improvement of the detection rate for these lesions. The primary
      aim of the current study was to compare the detection rate of colorectal flat lesions of LCI
      cap-assisted colonoscopy with WL cap-assisted colonoscopy in prospective randomized trial. In
      addition, we prospectively compared LCI and WL with regard to the visibility of colorectal
      flat lesions found in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We enrolled consecutive patients who were referred for colonoscopy to our hospital for
             diagnostic work up of colonic symptoms, surveillance of colorectal polyps, and
             colorectal cancer screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  familial colorectal cancer syndrome including familial adenomatous polyposis and
             hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, personal history of colorectal
             cancer or inflammatory bowel disease and those who had previous colonic resection.

        Patients who were considered to be unsafe for polypectomy, including patients with bleeding
        tendency and those with severe comorbid illnesses, were excluded. Those in whom &lt;90% of
        mucosa was seen due to mixture of semisolid and solid colonic contents were also excluded
        because of poor bowel preparation.
