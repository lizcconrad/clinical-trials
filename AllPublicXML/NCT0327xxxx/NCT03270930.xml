      Introduction Operative duration is an important but under-studied predictor of mortality in
      emergency laparotomies.

      Aims &amp; Objectives The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of duration of
      emergency laparotomy in children on mortality and to identify a rough cut-off duration of
      laparotomy to serve as a guide to plan the laparotomy to optimize pediatric surgical patient
      outcome.

    <textblock>
      Operative duration has been found to affect post-operative mortality rates. Operative
      duration has been studied in various studies as a risk factor for predicting morbidity and
      several other post-operative complications like pneumonia. However, the direct effect of
      operative duration on mortality has been studied sparingly and that too mainly in elective
      setting and other authors. Thus, operative duration is an under-studied risk factor in
      predicting mortality in emergency laparotomies. No study was found during literature review
      which predicted mortality as a function of operative duration in emergency laparotomies. Most
      studies focused on pre-operative factors and post-operative management for predicting
      laparotomy outcomes like the use of POSSUM (Physiological and Operative Severity Score for
      the enumeration of Mortality and morbidity) score. Thus, no clear-cut recommendation exists
      regarding the optimal time duration for an emergency laparotomy in pediatric population
      beyond which a laparotomy must not proceed as it would significantly increase the mortality
      rate.

      The primary objectives of the study were to quantify the effect of duration of emergency
      laparotomy in children on mortality and to identify a rough cut-off duration of laparotomy to
      serve as a guide so that such a laparotomy can be planned to optimize pediatric surgical
      patient out come in terms of decreased mortality. The secondary objectives included
      identifying factors that increase the time of emergency laparotomy and identifying measures
      that could be applied to reduce the time of laparotomy significantly and improve outcome.

        All pediatric patients presenting to our emergency department in the age group of 5 to 10
        years presenting with acute abdomen diagnosed clinically and radiologically to be having a
        diagnosis of secondary peritonitis and obstruction.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All pediatric patients in the age group of 5 to 10 years presenting with acute abdomen
             diagnosed clinically and radiologically to be having a diagnosis of secondary
             peritonitis and obstruction; who were adequately resuscitated (with a minimum
             resuscitation period of at least 1 hour) pre-operatively and underwent definitive
             surgery by a single surgeon (pediatric surgery senior resident) in the emergency were
             included in the study. Also, only those patients who had a PRISM-III (Pediatric Risk
             of Mortality III) score (Figure 1) of â‰¤ 8 at presentation were included to avoid the
             confounding effect of pre-operative variables that might affect mortality. All
             patients were adequately resuscitated in terms of temperature, central nervous system
             (Glasgow Coma Scale, pupillary reflexes), cardiovascular system (systolic blood
             pressure, heart rate) and respiratory system (oxygen saturation &gt; 95%, pCO2 , pH,
             PaO2) parameters so that the patients were brought within 0 score range of PRISM-III
             score at the end of resuscitation and before shifting to the operation theatre.
             Furthermore for inclusion only those pediatric patients were considered who presented
             within 72 hours of initial onset of symptoms, operated within 24 hours of initial
             presentation and who died in index hospital admission within 30 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who underwent damage control surgery, whose PRISM - III score was &gt;9 at any
             point of time before undergoing laparotomy or inability to achieve adequate
             resuscitation (PRISM-III score &gt;0 before shifting to operation theatre) and/or
             requirement of resuscitation beyond 4 hours of presentation were excluded from the
             study.
