  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medasense's Pain Monitoring Device (PMD) is a novel non-invasive, bedside stand alone,
      continuous monitor that is designed to provide real-time information about changes in the
      nociception level of patients under general anesthesia during surgical procedures.

      The PMD-200 System is based on real-time data acquisition and processing of physiological
      signals. The system displays the NOL index (a single numerical index) which is computed from
      recorded physiological parameters based on a proprietary algorithm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to evaluate the pattern of the NOL index during
      surgery in the anesthetized patient and during the post-operative period in the awake
      patient.

      Up to 100 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general, regional and local
      anesthesia and sedation, who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, will
      be enrolled after signing informed consent.
