  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a physical exercise program on the
      functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis hospitalized at the
      Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre (HCPA) through a six-minute walk test using the distance
      traveled In six minutes.

      In the first 48 hours of hospital stay, the following evaluations will be performed:
      Six-minute walk test, physical and health fitness test, spirometry and data collection.
      Patients will be randomized to either control group or intervention group. The control group
      will receive the conventional treatment offered by hospital care, the intervention group will
      receive this same treatment plus an exercise protocol. After 14 days they will be reevaluated
      with the same tests applied at the beginning of hospitalization.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of a protocol of physical exercises on
      the functional capacity of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, hospitalized, in
      the stage of exacerbation of the disease.

      In the first 48 hours of hospitalization patients and their caregivers will be invited to
      participate in the study. We will start with the following evaluations: Six-minute walk test,
      spirometry, physical fitness and health test (includes: walking, abdominal, flexibility and
      abdominal circumference), clinical score of shwachman kulczycki and Collected data from
      medical records.

      After the initial evaluation the patient will be randomized to control group or intervention
      group. The control group will receive the conventional physiotherapy by the assistance team
      and the recreation service by the physical education. The intervention group will receive the
      same assistance plus the intervention with the exercise protocol five times a week supervised
      by a health professional. The exercise protocol includes: Punching, climbing and descending
      steps, sit and stand, push-ups on the wall, stationary gait, abdominal, physiotherapy bridge,
      jumping on the floor ladder, cycling on the cycle ergometer and stretching.

      At hospital discharge both groups will repeat the initial tests. The hypothesis is that the
      intervention group showed an improvement in functional capacity compared to the control
      group.

    <description>Patients randomized to the control group will receive routine physiotherapeutic follow-up, performed by the physiotherapist of the hospital during the hospitalization period. Supervision includes inhalation therapy and respiratory physiotherapy. Respiratory exercises and thoracic maneuvers for bronchial hygiene will be performed, according to what the patient is accustomed to perform. Other techniques besides these can be added at the discretion of the physiotherapist according to the needs of the patient. In pediatric hospitalization patients also receive care from physical educators who associate recreational and recreational activities with the treatment.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention group, in addition to routine physical therapy follow-up, will receive a program of physical exercises, illustrated in the form of a booklet and guided by a health professional. The patient is instructed to perform physical exercises five times a week until a hospital discharge. The participant will receive with a booklet a diary to write down the days in which to carry out the proposed exercises, in case of fault he will write down the reason for not performing. The exercise protocol includes: Punching, climbing and descending steps, sit and stand, push-ups on the wall, stationary gait, abdominal, physiotherapy bridge, jumping on the floor ladder, cycling on the cycle ergometer and stretching.</description>
