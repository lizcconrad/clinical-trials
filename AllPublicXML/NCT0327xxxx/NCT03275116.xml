             hypoxemia.

          7. Known respiratory disorders other than COPD which may impact the efficacy of the study
             drug according the investigator's judgment. This can include but is not limited to
             alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, active tuberculosis, a history of asthma, lung cancer,

             arrhythmias diagnosed in the last 6 months (sustained means lasting more than 30
             seconds and or ending only with external action, and or leads to hemodynamic collapse;
             non-sustained means &gt; 3 beats &lt; 30 seconds, and or ending spontaneously, and or

             investigator's judgement.

         14. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities indicating a significant or unstable
