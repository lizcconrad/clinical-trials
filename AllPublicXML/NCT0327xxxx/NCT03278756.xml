  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of an internet-delivered cognitive control training as
      a preventive intervention for remitted depressed patients. Half of the participants will
      receive a cognitive control training, while the other half will receive a low cognitive load
      training that acts as an active control condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective studies have linked impaired cognitive control to increased cognitive
      vulnerability for future depression. Importantly, experimental studies indicate that
      cognitive control training can be used to reduce rumination and depressive symptomatology in
      MDD (major depressive disorder) and RMD (remitted depressed) samples. Provided that remitted
      depressed patients form a high-risk group for developing future depressive episodes, the
      current study will explore whether an internet-delivered cognitive control training can be
      used to reduce vulnerability for future depression in remitted depressed patients.

      A computer training, consisting of 10 sessions of 15 minutes each, will be administered to
      participants, which are remitted depressed patients. This training can either be a cognitive
      control training, using an adaptive paced auditory serial addition task, or an active control
      training, with a low cognitive load task.

      Dependent variables will be assessed pre- and post-training, as well as 3 and 6 months after
      the training, and consist of depressive symptomatology, related variables and cognitive
      control measures.
