    <textblock>
      Objectives: The acute care of pelvic fractures has improved recently however there are no
      formal guidelines for rehabilitation of these types of fractures. Patients have long periods
      of non-weight bearing causing muscle wastage. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has
      proven to minimise muscle loss. However, this has not previously been investigated within
      this patient population.

      Design: Double blind, randomised, feasibility study.

      Setting: NHS trust hospital setting.

      Participants: Nine patients with surgically fixed pelvic fractures were randomly allocated at
      six weeks post fracture.

      Interventions: The intervention group completed six weeks of NMES. The placebo group used
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

      Main outcome measures: Peak torque (Nm) was calculated in the operated limb at 12 weeks using
      the non-operated limb as a baseline. Compliance and intensity levels were recorded.
      Feasibility of NMES was evaluated using a feasibility questionnaire. Pain was measured at six
      and 12 weeks using a visual analogue scale (VAS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria were any patient with a pelvic fracture that was surgically fixed
             with no associated injuries and able to give written informed consent.

          -  Pelvic fractures including acetabular and pelvic ring fracture that were fixed using
             open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) were considered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were patients who could not comply with the NMES or who had
             previous mental health diagnosis.

          -  Patients who may be pregnant, have severe kidney injury or have a pacemaker were
             excluded.
