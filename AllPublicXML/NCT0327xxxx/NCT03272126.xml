  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a hormone with effects not only on the skeleton, but on most tissues in the
      body. Lack of vitamin D is associated with cardio-vascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes,
      cancer, infectious and immunological diseases, as well as risk factors for these diseases.
      However, intervention studies with vitamin D have been inconclusive regarding diseases and
      risk factors. This could be due to inclusion of subjects already vitamin D sufficient, and
      short and underpowered studies. In addition, there are indications that the dosing regimens
      may be important, so that daily doses with vitamin D are more efficient than intermittent
      doses, which so far have been generally used. This could be related to the concentration of
      circulating and thereby intracellular vitamin D concentrations, which probably is dependent
      on daily vitamin D doses. This will be tested in the present study where 60 subjects will be
      randomized to vitamin D 160 000 once, vitamin D 4000 IU/day, or placebo for four weeks. The
      primary endpoints will be effects on serum hepcidin and plasma cathelicidin after 4 weeks,
      with effects on serum PTH, RNA expression and microRNA in peripheral blood, telomerase
      activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the ration between serum 1,25(OH)2D and
      24,25(OH)2D as secondary endpoints.

             detect than if the included subjects were vitamin D sufficient.

          -  Hgb, SR, CRP, creatinine &lt; 130 umol/L in males, &lt; 120 umol/L in females, calcium, FT4

             study (as judged by one of the study doctors)

          -  subjects using vitamin D supplements exceeding 800 IU per day or active vitamin D
             drugs (Rocaltrol or Etalpha)
