  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with locally advanced gastric caner undergo the
      enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs or the standard cares (SC) programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before, most trials about the ERAS for radical gastrectomy demonstrated ERAS programs
      accelerate the postoperative rehabilitation of gastric cancer patients without increasing
      postoperative complications. However, in most trials, patients who received neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy were excluded. The investigators designed this trial for patients received
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this trial, patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      locally advanced gastric caner undergo the ERAS programs or the SC programs. Finally, the
      investigators evaluated whether patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be enrolled
      into the ERAS programs for locally advanced gastric cancer.
