  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Units (ICU) are stressful places where life-and-death medical decisions are
      made and patients and patients' caregivers are exposed to potentially traumatic experiences.
      As the number of life-prolonging procedures administered to the patient rises, the patient's
      quality of life falls. Thus, interventions to improve the quality of life and care of ICU
      cancer patients are needed.

      EMPOWER is a cognitive-behavioral, acceptance-based intervention to reduce experiential
      avoidance of unpleasant thoughts and feelings related to thinking about patient death. By
      reducing caregivers' experiential avoidance, EMPOWER removes a barrier to advance care
      planning (ACP), including the completion of advance directives, such as Do Not Resuscitate
      (DNR) orders. EMPOWER should improve EoL care that enhances patient quality of life while
      also empowering caregivers to cope with a loved one's impending death and adjust following
      the patient's ICU death or discharge. Specifically, investigators aim to:

        -  1: Determine feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, and preliminary effects of
           EMPOWER on caregiver mental health.

        -  2: Estimate the effects of EMPOWER on patient outcomes in the month following the ICU
           admission.

      Hypothesis 1: caregivers who receive EMPOWER will have significantly lower PTSD symptom
      levels when compared to usual care condition.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients whose caregivers receive EMPOWER will have a higher rate of advance
      care planning, a lower rate of intensive care and a better quality of life/ death.

      Investigators will randomize 60 caregivers of terminally, critically ill and uncommunicative
      cancer patients to EMPOWER or usual care. Assessments will occur pre-intervention,
      immediately post-intervention, and then 1 month and 3 months from baseline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This EMPOWER pilot study is designed to obtain information on its feasibility, tolerability,
      acceptability, and preliminary effect size estimates to inform the planning of the larger,
      efficacy randomized controlled trial (RCT). Our pilot will be a parallel-arm RCT comparing
      EMPOWER to usual care.

      Aggressive care in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has been shown to impair the quality of life
      of patients with advanced cancer and to increase the risk of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD) among the family and friends who serve as informal caregivers. Although ICU stays are
      established indicators of low quality end-of-life (EoL) cancer care, a large, growing number
      of cancer patients - over 1 in 4 -- are being admitted to the ICU in the last month of life.
      Even within the ICU, investigators find that as the number of life-prolonging procedures
      administered to the patient rises, the patient's quality of life falls. Thus, interventions
      to reduce the suffering and to improve the quality of life and care of ICU cancer patients
      are needed.

      As described above, suffering is not confined to the patient. Informal caregivers of cancer
      patients in the ICU also suffer. In our &quot;Severity of Suffering&quot; (SoS) study, which examined
      dying cancer patients' quality of life in the ICU, nurses indicated that 53% of the patients'
      caregivers were acutely distressed. The nurses also reported that 43% of the patient's
      caregivers had unrealistic expectations for the patient's recovery and that 41% insisted that
      the patient receive futile, burdensome care (e.g., resuscitation). Over 85% of these patients
      were unable to communicate, which resulted in the need for grieving, potentially traumatized
      caregivers to serve as the patient's surrogate and make life-and-death decisions for a
      critically ill, uncommunicative patient. Yet advance care planning (ACP) for patients demands
      caregivers be relatively emotionally &quot;present&quot; and thinking clearly. Our conceptual models
      posit that peri-traumatic stress (e.g., feeling in shock) and anticipatory grief (e.g.,
      separation distress evoked by the patient's impending death) will result in experiential
      avoidance (i.e., avoidance of unpleasant feelings and consideration of negative outcomes),
      which is itself a barrier to ACP. Investigators have shown that ACP predicts higher quality,
      less aggressive, and more value-consistent EoL care, as well as better patient quality of
      life, both of which predict better bereavement adjustment of the caregiver. Investigators
      have also shown that caregivers of cancer patients who die in the ICU are at elevated risk of
      PTSD in the months that follow the potentially traumatic ICU &quot;exposures&quot;. These findings
      indicate a compelling need to address the peritraumatic stress and anticipatory grief of
      cancer patient caregivers in the ICU.

      The EMPOWER study is an interventional clinical trial that will enroll 60 surrogate
      caregivers of 60 current patients from New York Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH) medical ICU
      (MICU) who are comatose or sedated on a ventilator or otherwise cannot communicate or decide
      on the treatment planning. Research staff will contact ICU physicians and/or fellows in
      person or by email regularly to identify eligible candidates based on the inclusion criteria.

      Caregivers will be consented and screened. Those who have at least &quot;4&quot; on 1-10 scale of
      psychological distress assessing symptoms of anxiety and stress, or who score at least 8 on 2
      Partner Dependency Scale (PDS) 15 items will be randomized to receive EMPOWER or usual care.
      Caregivers will be assessed pre-intervention/baseline (Time point 1, T1), post-intervention
      (within a week of the caregiver's completion of the baseline assessment) (Time point 2, T2),
      1-month post-baseline (Time point 3, T3), and 3-months post-baseline (Time point 4, T4).
      Caregivers will be assigned to either control (usual care) or intervention group using
      sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) method.

      EMPOWER is based on well-established cognitive-behavioral techniques that aim to promote the
      expression and understanding of a person's emotional reactions. The EMPOWER interventionist
      will be compassionate and attempt to teach subjects tools for remaining present-focused,
      validate participants' experience, explore participants' loved ones' and participants' own
      wishes, values and decision challenges, increase subjects acceptance and sense of permission
      to experience challenging emotions, and prepare participants for future distressing
      situations.

      The usual care condition is is intended to serve as a control condition which is regular ICU
      care.

      The primary outcome will be PTSD symptom severity. Investigators hypothesize that caregivers
      who receive EMPOWER will have significantly lower PTSD symptom levels when compared to ICU
      usual care. Secondary caregiver outcomes will include caregiver Prolonged Grief Disorder
      (PGD) symptom severity (either pre-loss/anticipatory or post-loss/bereavement grief) and
      experiential avoidance. Patient outcomes will include Advance care planning (ACP), intensity
      of care, and quality of life/death.

    <description>Enhancing and Mobilizing the Potential for Wellness and Resilience (EMPOWER) is a cognitive-behavioral, acceptance-based intervention designed to reduce experiential avoidance in caregivers of ICU patients. Specifically, it was created to assist informal caregivers of patients who are incommunicable and who become surrogate decision-makers on the patient's behalf. The goal is to reduce experiential avoidance of negative thoughts and distressing feelings in the short- and longer-term.
The total amount of time EMPOWER intervention is about 90 minutes, about 15 minutes each session. It will take place in the family room outside of MICU. Booster sessions will be decided by therapists and it will be performed by phone.</description>
