  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe? and 2) Is treatment effective in improving cardiac function and clinical outcomes?

      This will be an open-label, non-randomized multi-center study of ASC implantation using a
      catheter delivery system. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue.
      Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen for subsequent
      processing to isolate the stem cells. The injection catheter will be used for delivery of the
      ASCs therapy.

      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected mainly from the patient's abdomen using a
      liposuction cannula. The adipose tissue may be collected from other areas if necessary The
      adipose tissue is transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue-derived
      stem cells, which are then transferred to an injection/infusion catheter for delivery into
      the akinetic myocardial scar in the region of a previous infarct

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and Females between Age 18 and 80 years.

          -  Defined subacute myocardial infarction between 9-90 days from screening

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction at screening of ≤ 50%, with 2 or more contiguous
             areas of severe wall motion abnormality on resting echocardiography.

          -  Patients must have a minimum myocardial wall thickness of 5mm

          -  Need or feasibility for re-vascularization has been ruled out by coronary angiogram or
             noninvasive stress testing.

          -  Stable for at least 14 days on optimal medical management including:

          -  Plavix/asprin therapy, anticoagulation therapy, cholesterol lowering agent, beta
             blocker, ACE inhibitor or ARB blocker Up to date on all age and gender appropriate
             cancer screening per American Cancer Society (Refer to section 9.3 for more details).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or nursing or females of childbearing potential who are
             unwilling to maintain contraceptive therapy for the duration of the study

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 6 months due to concomitant illnesses.

          -  NYHA CHF Class 4

          -  Severe valvular or other non-ischemic myocardial disease.

          -  Mechanical complications of the index acute myocardial infarction including but not
             limited to rupture of the mitral valve with resultant development of mitral
             regurgitation, rupture of the left ventricular free wall and rupture of the
             interventricular septum.

          -  Previous severe reaction to radiocontrast agents

          -  Exposure to any investigational drug or procedure within 1 month prior to study entry
             or enrolled in a concurrent study that may confound results of this study.

             and HBV-sAg, then an expert will be consulted as to patient eligibility based on the
             patient's infectious status

             investigator are not suitable to participate.
