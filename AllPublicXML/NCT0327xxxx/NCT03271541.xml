    <textblock>
      This proof-of-mechanism study is being performed to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple oral doses of bitopertin in
      adults with NTD beta-thalassemia.

      This study consists of two parts:

      Part 1 - The main study - 16 weeks in total: Participants will undergo a 6-week
      dose-escalation period followed by 10 weeks of treatment at the attained target dose.

      Part 2 - Open Label Extension (OLE) - up to an additional 12 months. Participants will be
      given the option to enroll into the OLE once the 16-week treatment of Part 1 has been
      completed. Participants who decide not to enroll in the OLE, at the end of Part 1 will enter
      a 6-week follow-up period.
