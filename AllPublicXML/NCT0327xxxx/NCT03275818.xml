  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A two-cohort, fase II, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter clinical trial. 14 sites in
      Spain.

      Cohort 1: Subjects with desmoid tumor (DT) Cohort 2: Subjects with desmoplastic small round
      cell tumor or Ewing sarcoma (DSRCT and ES)

      Nab-paclitaxel (ABRAXANE) will be administered as follows:

      Age ≥ 21 and ≤ 80 years: 125 mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15 in cycles of 28 days Age ≥ 6 months and ≤
      20 years: 240 mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15 in cycles of 28 days

      Subjects in the DT cohort will receive a maximum of three cycles. Subjects in the DSRCT and
      ES cohort will receive unlimited cycles until disease progression, the subject begins a new
      anticancer treatment, withdrawal of parent/guardian/subject consent/assent,
      parent/guardian/subject refusal, physician decision, toxicity that cannot be managed by dose
      delay or dose reduction alone or the study ends for any reason.

      The main goal is to determine the objective response rate (ORR), using RECIST 1.1 criteria
      and to determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as CR+PR+SD for 3 months with
      improvement of pain with at least minimally important difference (MID) of 2 in subjects with
      desmoid tumors (DT cohort) and to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in subjects
      with desmoplastic small round cell tumor and Ewing sarcoma, using RECIST 1.1 criteria (DSRCT
      and ES cohort)

        TD Cohort

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must voluntarily sign the informed consent form before any study test is
             conducted that is not part of routine subject care.

          2. Subjects with pathologic diagnosis of deep desmoid tumor of extremities, trunk wall or
             head and neck region.

          3. Subjects must be symptomatic due to tumor desmoid mass.

          4. Age: 18-80 years (both ages included).

          5. Subjects could have received 1 previous chemotherapy line if the scheme was
             methotrexate and vinca alkaloids. Importantly, if this is the case, it must be
             documented that symptoms have gotten worse or symptoms are stable in the context of
             disease progression (RECIST 1.1).

          6. Availability of archive tumor block.

          7. Measurable disease, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          8. Performance status ≤1 (ECOG).

         10. Normal ECG values.

         11. Adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL, leukocytes ≥ 3.000/mm3,
             neutrophils ≥ 1.500/mm3, platelets ≥ 100.000/mm3). Subjects with plasma creatinine ≤
             1.6 mg/dl, transaminases ≤ 10 times the ULN, total bilirubin ≤ 1.25 times the ULN are
             acceptable.

         12. Men or women of childbearing potential must use an effective method of contraception
             before entry into the study and throughout the same and for 6 months after ending the
             study treatment. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test before study entry.

         13. HBV and HCV serologies must be performed prior to inclusion. If HbsAg is positive it
             is recommended to reject the existence of replicative phase (HbaAg+, DNA VHB+)
             remaining at investigators' discretion the preventive treatment with lamivudine. If a
             potential subject is positive for anti-HCV antibodies, presence of the virus should be
             ruled out with a qualitative PCR, or the subject should NOT be included in the study
             (if a qualitative PCR cannot be performed then subject will not be able to enter the
             study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Less than 4 weeks elapsed since prior exposure to chemotherapy.

          7. Other active invasive malignancy requiring ongoing therapy or expected to require
             systemic therapy within two years. However, localized squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or other
             malignancies requiring only locally ablative therapy, will not result in exclusion.

          8. Concomitant anticancer therapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy within prior 4
             weeks.

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection requiring IV antibiotic, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, psychiatric illness or social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

         10. Hb &lt; 9 g/dL.

         11. Pregnant women are excluded due to the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects of nab paclitaxel because there is a potential risk for adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with these agents, breastfeeding

             investigational product.

        DSRCT and ES Cohort

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects (parent or tutor if subject under 18 years) must voluntarily sign the

             ULN, alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 times the ULN are acceptable. If alkaline phosphatase
             is &gt; 2.5 times the ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase liver fraction and/or 5'
             nucleotidase and/or GGT must be ≤ ULN.
