  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the impact of a skills training program in stimulus control of
      meals and snacks on zBMI. Participants will be randomized to a standard family-based obesity
      treatment intervention with education on child health or a standard family-based obesity
      treatment intervention with experiential learning about meal stimulus control strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family-based obesity treatment interventions can successfully reduce weight in children, but
      are often limited in the practice of skills being taught during treatment sessions.

      Skills training focused on a particular behavioral strategy can provide parents with an
      experiential component of learning where the information learned as part of a family-based
      obesity treatment intervention is also practiced. Health education simply provides knowledge
      to a family about a topic.
