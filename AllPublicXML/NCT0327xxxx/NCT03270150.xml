      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of the BTL-799 device for the
      disruption of adipocyte cells of abdomen. The study is a prospective open-label single-arm
      study. The subjects will be enrolled and assigned into a single study group. Subjects will be
      required to complete four (4) treatment visits and follow-up visits 1, 6 and 12 weeks after
      the final treatment.

      At the baseline visit photographs of the abdomen will be taken. In addition, subject's weight
      will be recorded.

      The treatment administration phase will consist of four (4) treatments. The treatment area is
      abdominal fat.

      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE).

      Post-procedure evaluation (follow-up visit) will be conducted 1, 6 and 12 weeks after the
      final treatment. A photography and weight measure will be conducted at the final follow-up
      visit. In addition, subject's satisfaction will be noted at the last follow-up visit.
