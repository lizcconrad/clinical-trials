  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In collaboration with the First Pavlov State Medical University in St. Petersburg, Russia, we
      are proposing a pilot, open label, non-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety,
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of treatment for alcohol and opioid use
      disorders combining Nalmefene and recovery coaching (educational and behaviorally oriented
      drug counseling). The proposed pilot study will also be used to further develop and refine
      the recovery coaching/counseling intervention and to train additional cadre of clinicians and
      researchers in St. Petersburg, Russia.
