  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation surgery, which consists of intracerebral implantation of electrodes,
      is considered one of the most effective techniques for controlling the motor fluctuations of
      Parkinson's disease. The particularity of this surgery is the necessity of the awakening of
      the patient for the correct positioning of the electrodes, it is therefore a difficult test
      for the patient.

      Medical sophrology is an ideal strategy to optimize the comfort of the patient during the
      operation thanks to its anxiolytic and analgesic virtues while guaranteeing the maintenance
      of a good patient vigilance favoring the cooperation with the operating room team. Indeed,
      sophrology is a body-mediated set of techniques, at the crossroads between hypnosis and yoga,
      which makes it possible to find a balance between emotions, thoughts and behaviors. It has
      already been applied in other fields such as oncology, pain management, preparation for
      childbirth, and for 5 years at the CHU of Rennes for preparation for the intervention of deep
      brain stimulation.
