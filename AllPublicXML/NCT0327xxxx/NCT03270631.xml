  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects are recruited from the attendees of the multidisciplinary low back pain
      rehabilitation group before it takes place in University Hospital of Oulu at Physical and
      Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) unit. Subjects were invited to participate by letter 2 weeks
      before the beginning of the rehabilitation. Subjects to rehabilitation are picked by doctor
      at PRM unit. The volunteered subjects are invited to the briefing of the study and those who
      are willing to participate, they filled in several questionnaires about pain, participation,
      disability and mood. After that the subjects are measured at baseline measurement. Subjects
      are randomized into the five groups. After the 3 months treatment and training the follow-up
      measurements are performed. Same questionnaires are filled in at that point as well. At 6 and
      12 months the follow-up questionnaires (same as before) are sent to subjects.

      are willing to participate, they filled in several questionnaires about pain, participation,
      disability and mood. After that the subjects are measured at baseline measurement. Subjects
      are randomized into the five groups: 1) control group, 2) fascial manipulation (FM) and
      movement control exercises (MCE), 3) sham-FM and MCE, 4) FM and sham-MCE and 5) sham-FM and
      sham-MCE. Physical therapists who perform treatments (FM), prescribing MCE and performing the
      measurements are blinded to each other. Physical therapist who is performing measurements is
      also blinded for the baseline measurements. There and 4 treatments of sham-FM, 4-5 treatments
      of FM, 4 treatments of sham-MCE and 4-6 treatments of MCE. Control group will receive only
      university hospital rehabilitation and will participate into the baseline and follow-up
      measurements. After the 3 months treatment and training the follow-up measurements are
      performed. Same questionnaires are filled in as at baseline. At 6 and 12 months the follow-up
      questionnaires (same as before) are sent to subjects.
