    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinometric (psychometric) properties of the
      SCALE and FMA-LE assessments in adults after stroke. A second purpose is to determine how
      well each measure predicts walking speed using the 10 meter walk test.

      Selective voluntary motor control may be important in prognosticating future function in
      adults post stroke. It is therefore important to measure selective voluntary motor control
      using assessments that are valid, reliable and easy to perform and interpret. Current
      assessments are time consuming and complicated. Clinicians who work with patients post stroke
      will benefit from this research because they will have evidence supporting appropriate
      measurement of selective voluntary motor control. This evidence may inform their clinical
      decision making when working with patients. Patients who have survived a stroke will benefit
      because their therapists will be able to better measure their selective voluntary motor
      control which may one day lead to better prediction of functional outcomes and the selection
      of appropriate interventions.

      The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) is the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; for the assessment of individuals with
      brain injury, most commonly those surviving cerebrovascular accident (stroke). The full
      assessment is complicated and can take more than an hour to complete. Clinicians have limited
      time to perform a full evaluation of their patients, the FMA is just one part of this
      evaluation. The lower extremity selective voluntary motor control component of the FMA
      (FMA-LE) is difficult for clinicians who are not experts to perform and interpret. For these
      reasons, few practicing clinicians use the FMA. However, measuring selective voluntary motor
      control may be important for prognosticating patients' future functional level and their need
      for continued therapeutic interventions. The Selective Control Assessment of Lower Extremity
      (SCALE) was developed for use with children who have cerebral palsy (CP), a condition that in
      some ways presents similar to stroke. The SCALE has been validated and deemed reliable in the
      pediatric population with CP. This study aims to determine inter-rater and intra-rater
      reliability for the FMA-LE and the SCALE. In addition, scores on the SCALE will be compared
      to scores on the FMA-LE to determine concurrent validity. Finally the scores on the SCALE and
      FMA-LE will be compared to the time it takes for stroke survivors to walk 10-meters (10-meter
      walk test) to determine how well each measure predicts functional status (predictive
      validity).

    <description>The complete Fugl-Meyer contains 155 items and each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale, 2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being partially completed, and 0 points for the detail not being performed. The maximum score for the motor performance is divided into 66 points for the upper extremity and 34 for the lower extremity. Only the lower extremity motor assessment component of the Fugl-Meyer will be used for this study, which consists of 17 items.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Performance measure used to assess walking speed in meters per second over a short distance. It can be employed to determine functional mobility, gait, and vestibular function. Scoring is done by completing three trials and calculating the average of the three trials to obtain the velocity. The test may be completed at the subject's self-selected velocity and/or at the subject's fast velocity.</description>
