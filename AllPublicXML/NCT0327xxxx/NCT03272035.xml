    <textblock>
      Very few studies are dealing with the way general practitioners feel the death of their
      patients. Main studies about that subject are qualitative. It needs quantitative studies to
      analyse how is felt general practitioners' patients' death. This is an epidemiologic
      quantitative cross-sectional study. The Studied population is the whole of the general
      practitioners of the region Nouvelle-Aquitaine. The primary endpoint is the percentage of the
      general practitioners which have hard time living with their patients' death. The secondary
      endpoints are to evaluate the general practitioners' help needing after their patients'
      death, to evaluate the personal and professional impact of the patient's death, the
      percentage of general practitioners using chemical aid after their patients' death and to
      determinate the existence of support facilities to help general practitioners to stand
      patients' death. The results of that study could help general practitioners to improve their
      medical practice in the patient's death situation.
