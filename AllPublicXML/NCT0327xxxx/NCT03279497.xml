  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effectiveness of the game-intervention in promotion of physical
      activity self-efficacy and physical activity behavior among early adolescents (10-13 year
      olds). Half of the study participants will receive the game-intervention and half of the
      study participants will receive a commercially available sport and fitness application for
      running, cycling and every-day training.

      The study evaluates the effectiveness of the game-intervention in promotion of physical
      activity self-efficacy and physical activity behavior among early 10 to 13 years old
      adolescents. Participants allocated to the Health game intervention group will use a game
      called Movenator, during a four week intervention and participants allocated to the Sport and
      fitness-intervention group will use a commercially available Sport and fitness application
      for running, cycling and every-day training, during a four week intervention period.

    <description>Health game intervention consists of 20 minutes guided training session with the mobile health game at school and 4 weeks free usage of the game via own smart phone during free time. Smart phones are tracking the actual physical activity (steps) of the participants via activity sensors and the tracked steps work as In-App Currency enabling the participants to play the game and proceed in it.</description>
