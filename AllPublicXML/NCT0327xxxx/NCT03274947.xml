  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to explore the effectiveness of non-invasive cerebellar stimulation to
      enhance motor plasticity in the cortex after stroke. The investigators have shown that the
      human cerebellum is strongly activated during the act of swallowing and when stimulated with
      single TMS pulses can strongly facilitate the corticobulbar projection to the pharynx in
      humans. More recently the investigators have identified the most relevant frequency of
      stimulation of the cerebellum that can produce longer term excitation in the human swallowing
      motor system. The investigators therefore believe that the potential for cerebellar
      stimulation in improving swallowing is much greater than other methods for two reasons.
      Firstly, previous work has shown that unlike successful recovery of hand/arm function which
      relies on restoring activity in the stroke hemisphere, recovery of swallowing function relies
      on increased excitability in intact projections from the non-stroke hemisphere. The
      investigators believe that methods that can enhance these undamaged pathways have a greater
      chance of inducing recovery in the human swallowing system in unilateral stroke. Additionally
      cerebellar stimulation produces very high levels of corticobulbar excitation it may also have
      the advantage of improving dysphagia in posterior fossa strokes. Second, the human cerebellum
      is relatively easy to target and stimulate and has reduced risk of inducing unwanted effects
      (such as seizures) which as a consequence makes cerebellar stimulation a more pragmatic
      method for delivering therapeutic neurorehabilitation to dysphagic stroke patients compared
      to other more complex/riskier methods.

      A final factor is that the investigators have developed a &quot;virtual lesion&quot; model of
      swallowing dysfunction in healthy volunteers which can be reversed quite successfully with
      other neuro-stimulation protocols. The investigators can therefore use this model to test the
      effectiveness of cerebellar stimulation protocols (ipsilateral and contralateral cerebellar
      sites) before choosing the most effective side to apply stimulation in a proof of principle
      trial/study in a small group of sub-acute dysphagic patients.

      The hypotheses are that cerebellar TMS will:

      i. Reverse the brain inhibition and behavioural dysfunction following a virtual lesion model
      of disrupted swallowing in healthy brain (phase 1); ii. Reduce the degree of aspiration in
      acute dysphagia after a stroke (phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Protocols:

      Hypothesis 1:

      Cortical excitability (in both dominant and non-dominant swallowing cortex) to TMS and
      swallowing behaviour assessed with a swallowing reaction time task will be measured at
      baseline. Thereafter, the virtual lesion paradigm will be applied to the dominant swallowing
      projection followed by the cerebellar intervention (10Hz, 250 pulses). Cerebellar stimulation
      will be applied (in a randomised fashion) on separate occasions to both the contralateral and
      ipsilateral cerebellar hemispheres, immediately after the virtual lesion. The investigators
      have found that placement using known reference landmarks are equivalent to using
      neuronavigation, so the latter will not be employed. Repeat measurements of cortical
      excitability and swallowing behaviour will then be performed and analysed against baseline
      data and a sham cerebellar paradigm. Differences in cortical excitability and swallowing
      responses will thus be an indication of which cerebellar region (contralesional/ipsilesional)
      can influence excitability and reverse any behavioural changes most effectively.

      Hypothesis 2:

      I. Dysphagic stroke patients (n=24) recruited over a 9 month period within 14 days of stroke
      ictus will have their swallowing assessed by videofluoroscopy before and after receiving
      either the real or sham cerebellar stimulation (10Hz, 250 pulses) as determined from phase 1.
      As before, placement of the coil for cerebellar stimulation will be performed using landmarks
      already established and validated in the work from question 1. Patients will be intubated
      with the pharyngeal EMG catheter for pre and post recordings of pharyngeal motor evoked
      potentials (MEPs) to cortical TMS. Power calculations, based on a similar study of pharyngeal
      stimulation indicated that the investigators would need 12 patients per group to achieve a
      statistical power of 80% at a 5% significance level to detect changes in the primary outcome
      measure of aspiration. In this study, the investigators will examine if the chosen site of
      cerebellar stimulation from phase 1 can induce short-term changes in brain function
      (pharyngeal MEPs) and swallowing function (videofluoroscopy) compared to sham interventions
      and baseline measurement, up to 1 hour after the intervention.

      II. Following stage I, once it is established that cerebellar stimulation can alter brain and
      swallowing functions in stroke in the short-term, it will need to be appraised for clinical
      feasibility, dose response, and longer term efficacy. Dysphagic stroke patients (n=48, 16
      patients per group) admitted to the stroke unit and identified by videofluoroscopy will be
      recruited over the next 21 months. Since it is not known how the cerebellar stimulation
      method should be delivered to patients, a dose ranging treatment trial will be utilised,
      randomising patients to one of three groups (A-C), low level stimulation, high level
      stimulation and sham stimulation. From our previous work with pharyngeal stimulation, the
      investigators propose that group A will receive stimulation once per day for 3 days. Group B
      will receive stimulation twice per day for 5 days. Group C will receive sham stimulation
      (delivered as in protocol I) twice a day for 5 days. Groups A and B will receive stimulation
      at the optimal site (10Hz, 250 pulses) found in question 1, but all groups will also receive
      standard speech and language therapy.

      Assessments:

      Swallowing before and after stimulation will be evaluated using videofluoroscopy, at 1 hour
      for protocol I. For protocol II the investigators propose both videofluoroscopy and
      functional scores (Functional oral ingestion scale (FOIS), the dysphagia severity rating
      scale (DSRS) including feeding status and modified rankin scale (mRS)) at baseline and at 2
      weeks.
