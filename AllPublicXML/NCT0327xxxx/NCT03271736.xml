  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Parkinson's disease have internal rhythm dysfunction, which may affect the
      rhythmic movements such as walking. Poor regularity of the rhythmic movement may lead to
      freezing of gait. This study will apply rhythmic auditory cues on the stepping-in-place
      training and the investigators will examine if the behavior and neuroelectrophysiology would
      change after auditory cueing training. The investigators hypothesize the variation of
      rhythmic movements such as walking and stepping-in-place will be reduced, and the cortical
      excitability would be modulated after training.

    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease and movement disorder. Due to the
      degeneration of basal ganglia, patients with Parkinson's disease also demonstrate internal
      rhythm dysfunction, thus will lead to difficulty in rhythmic movements such as ambulation.
      For improving the rhythmic movement problem, auditory cues are often used in clinical setting
      and shows benefits in ambulation and freezing problems. Previous studies often use finger
      tapping test and ambulation to assess the rhythmic movement problem. No study uses stepping
      in place movements as a test to examine rhythmic problem. Little study investigates the
      effects of auditory cues on brain cortical excitability. In this cross-over study,
      participants will receive 2 times of training include stepping-in-place exercise with and
      without auditory cues in random orders. Auditory cues are given via the metronome. There is
      one-week wash-out period between two trainings. Movement tests such as walking and
      stepping-in-place and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are carried out before and
      after each training.

      The investigators hypothesize the variation of rhythmic movements such as walking and
      stepping-in-place will be reduced more, and the cortical excitability would be modulated
      after the training with auditory cues, comparing with the other training without auditory
      cues.

    <description>Single-pulse and paired-pulse TMS are used to measure the cortical excitability of the motor cortex and the integrity of the intracortical inhibitory/facilitatory circuits. The TMS parameters include motor threshold (MT), motor evoke potential, silent period, short intracortical inhibition and facilitation. In single-pulse condition, the stimulation intensity is set at 130% of the MT. While in the paired-pulse condition, the first conditioning stimulus is set at 80% of MT, the second test stimulus is set at 130% of MT.</description>

    <description>All the subjects received 2 experiments. 2 experiments contain 20 mins stepping-in-place exercise and pre-/post assessments. The difference between 2 experiments is the application of auditory cues. One of the 2 experiment includes stepping-in-place exercise with auditory cues from the metronome (Stepping-in-place exercise with external auditory cues), in the other experiment we ask the subjects to follow their internal rhythm without external auditory cues (Stepping-in-place exercise without external auditory cues). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied before and after the stepping-in-place exercise.</description>
