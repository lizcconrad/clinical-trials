  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to measure the whole-body distribution and radiation
      dosimetry of [18F]JNJ-64511070 in healthy male participants by positron emission tomography
      (PET) (Part A); and to measure the uptake, binding, distribution, and washout of
      [18F]JNJ-64511070 in the brain of healthy male participants by PET and to model tissue
      specific kinetics of [18F]JNJ-64511070 with the appropriate arterial input function (IF)
      (Part B).

    <measure>Part A: Effective Radiation Dose Following Injection of [18F]JNJ-64511070</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 hours on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The tissue radioactivity will be measured per organ for up to 5 hours after injection of up to 185 megaBecquerel (MBq) of [18F]JNJ-64511070 and corrected for attenuation by computed tomography (CT) transmission scans using positron emission tomography (PET) /CT. These measurements will be used to estimate effective radiation dose per organ and total body.</description>

    <measure>Part B: Total and Regional Brain Compartmental Kinetics for Volume of Distribution of [18F]JNJ-64511070 in Brain</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Distribution of [18F]JNJ-64511070 in brain will be measured by PET/CT scans obtained from the time of injection for up to 120 minutes along with measurement of the tracer input function with arterial samples for intact tracer and metabolites to establish the total and regional compartmental kinetics and volume of distribution (V[t]) of [18F]JNJ-64511070.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately Up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) inclusive

          -  Nonsmoker (not smoked for 3 months prior to screening)

          -  Is willing to allow the investigators to place an arterial catheter in the radial
             artery and is assessed via physical examination (Allen test) to be a good candidate
             for arterial catheter placement (Part B only)

          -  During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as
             approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug, a man: a) who is
             sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and has not had vasectomy must
             agree to use a condom and their female partner should also use a highly effective
             method of birth control for at least the same duration; b) who is sexually active with
             a woman who is pregnant must use a condom; c) must agree not to donate sperm

          -  Participants must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they
             understand the purpose of, and procedures required for,the study and are willing to
             participate in the study and comply with the study procedures and restrictions

          -  Exposed to greater than (&gt;) 1 milliSievert (mSv) of ionizing radiation participating
             as a participant in research studies in the 12 months before the start of enrolment in
             this study

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or
             urinalysis at screening or admission. It is expected that laboratory values will
             generally be within the normal range for the laboratory, though minor deviations,
             which are not considered to be of clinical significance to both the investigator are
             acceptable

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical and neurological examination, vital signs or
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or admission

          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, coagulation abnormalities, or other
             conditions that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant and preclude
             their ability to participate in study procedures. Participants with a history
             significant liver or renal disease, or difficulty in urination, which could affect the
             metabolism and elimination of the radiotracer or radiometabolites should be excluded.
             Participants with a history of epilepsy or fits or unexplained black-outs or loss of
             consciousness should also be excluded

          -  Serology positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C (HCV)
             antibodies or human immunodeficiency (HIV) antibodies unless the participant has been
             successfully treated for HCV or HIV. In such cases, the response should be confirmed
             with RNA testing for the relevant pathogen
