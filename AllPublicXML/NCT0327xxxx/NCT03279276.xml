  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been no previously published clinical randomized studies comparing Primoris®,
      short stem, hip prosthesis with standard uncemented hip arthroplasty in relation to bone
      density and function development. This is the subject for this study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to show whether the Primoris® hip prosthesis results in
      a smaller loss of bone density than standard hip prosthesis, which in the longer term may
      result in an improved survival of prosthesis No. 2 after revision / replacement of a
      Primoris® hip prosthesis.

      The primary outcome is periprosthetic bone quality in Primoris® hip prosthesis compared to
      standard hip prosthesis measured by DXA scanning.

      The secondary outcomes are to assess:

        1. The hip function measured by gait analysis.

        2. Hip strength at pressure gauge.

        3. Prosthetic migration / migration measured by radio-stereometric analysis (RSA).

        4. Patient satisfaction measured by PROMs.

    <description>The usual procedures of the department: Moore incision and insertion of uncemented joints (exceed with vitamin E enriched polyethylene liner and 32 or 36 mm head). Cyclokaprone is administered peroperatively (bleeding-reducing), antibiotics and thrombosis prophylaxis. Follow the usual rehabilitation regimes, fast track, incl. Use of crutches and must support within the pain limit, possibly with crutches the first 4 weeks after surgery, then full load.
By default, postoperative X-ray and RSA recordings will be performed on the 1st or 2nd postoperative day. The surgery will be performed by specialist physicians in orthopedic surgery associated with the hip arthroplasty sector.</description>
