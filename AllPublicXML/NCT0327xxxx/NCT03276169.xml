    <textblock>
      A total of 105 patients with persistent atrial fibrillation(AF), that lasting longer than one
      year and planned to undergo surgical treatment, will be allocated into three groups. These
      patients will receive left atrial appendage closure(LAAC), radiofrequency ablation under the
      guidance of 3D mapping and LAAC combined with radiofrequency ablation, respectively
      (allocation ratio, 1:1:1). Real-time 3D ultrasound and 2D ultrasound examinations and
      measurement of left ventricle(LV) and left atrial(LA) function are carried out for all
      patients before the operation, and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks and 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after
      the operation. All ultrasound data will be stored and a professional director from the
      ultrasound room will be invited for quantitative analysis. Indicators for ultrasonography
      include: LV ejection fraction(LVEF), LV end-diastolic volume, Stroke volume, left atrial
      anterior and posterior diameter, left atrial volume, left atrial volume index, mitral e &quot;, E
      peak, A peak, velocity time integral (VTI), left atrial ejection fraction, left atrial
      strain, and strain rate. Blood samples are extracted in all patients to detect type B
      natriuretic peptide before the operation and at 1, 2, 3 days and 1,3,6,12 months after the
      operation. Blood samples are extracted in all patients to detect routine blood, coagulation,
      D-D dimmer,Inflammatory markers (hsCRP） and other biochemical parameters before the operation
      and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks and 1, 2, 3,6and 12 months after the operation. At the same time
      in operation LA pressure in all patients will be measured preoperatively and postoperatively.
      This study will clarify the short-term and long-term changes of LA pressure and function of
      patients with persistent AF after LAAC, and whether changes in left atrial pressure and
      function are related to inflammation indicators. This study will also to observe whether the
      coagulation indexes changed after LAAC that can be used to know whether the LAAC activates
      the coagulation system. In addition, this study to investigate the effects of radiofrequency
      ablation combined with LAAC on left atrial pressure and function, changes of blood
      coagulation and inflammatory markers, and to analyze the above findings. At an average
      follow-up of one year, changes in left atrial function, inflammation, coagulation, and
      embolic events were analyzed early (3 months after surgery) and late (1 years after surgery).

Other researchers including follow-up personnel and the ultrasonic data analyst are uninformed about the random situation of the patients (patient information is recorded according to the random number. Random numbers corresponding to the random allocation list are stored in the research center.
