      The aims of the research are:

        -  To predict factors affecting hand dysfunction in patient with rheumatoid arthritis

        -  To study the effect of hand dysfunction on quality of life in patient with rheumatoid
           arthritis

      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic autoimmune systemic inflammatory
      arthritis, associated with considerable impairments of Quality of life .

      Hand is the principle means by which an individual interacts with people and objects in the
      external environment .Many factors affect hand function in addition to arthritis ,. Many RA
      patients suffer from an increased loss of muscle mass with a significant impact on these
      patients' quality of life , and also Distal sensory, mixed sensorimotor, mononeuritis
      multiplex and entrapment neuropathy are the most commonly reported types of neuropathy in RA
      .So assessment of factors causing hand dysfunction can provide us a quick and early insight
      on the debilitating effects of RA on functioning and disability.Thus Early intervention can
      then be initiated which will help limit joint damage and thereby improve functional outcomes.
