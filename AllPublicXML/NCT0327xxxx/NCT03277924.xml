    <textblock>
      Phase I-II, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label, multicenter, international clinical
      trial, with two cohorts (Soft Tissue Sarcoma and Bone Sarcoma). Seven sites in Spain and 3
      sites in Italy.

      Patients will receive sunitinib 37.5 mg/day (or recommended dose defined in phase I) orally
      continuously + nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenous every 2 weeks infused over 1 hour. Treatment
      will continue until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity,
      non-compliance, withdrawal of consent by the patient or investigator decision.

      The main goal is to evaluate the efficacy of the sunitinib plus nivolumab combination as
      measured by the progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months in patients with advanced
      soft tissue and bone sarcomas.

      One arm survival design based on Lawless (Lawless, Statistical Models and Methods for
      Lifetime Data, John Wiley and Sons, 2003). Formulas are based on the assumptions of uniform
      accrual over time, no loss to follow-up, exponentially distributed death times.

      For STS 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained for the primary endpoint
      progression-free survival rate (PFSR) at 6 months. Estimated accrual time: 24 months. A PFSR
      of 5% will be considered not promising, whereas a response rate of 15% will be considered
      promising in this population. With a type I error α of 0.05 and a power of 0.90, 43 patients
      are needed in this cohort.

      For bone sarcoma 2nd line cohort sample size has been obtained under the same assumptions
      than above, but with a type I error α of 0.10, therefore 32 patients are needed in this
      cohort.
