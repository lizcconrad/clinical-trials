  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
      (EMDR) to progressive counting (PC) for volunteers from the community who are distressed by
      the memory of a motor vehicle accident. Participants will be assigned to the geographically
      nearest therapist, and then randomized to treatment condition.
