    <textblock>
      Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of the traditional Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)-Life
      style Intervention (LI) and the Pacific DPP-LI among Marshallese living in Arkansas using a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 378 overweight or obese, pre-diabetic participants
      where the unit of randomization is at the individual level. The primary outcome measure is
      percent weight loss relative to pre-intervention baseline weight. As selected by
      stakeholders, HbA1c, blood pressure, physical activity, and dietary intake will be evaluated
      as secondary outcome measures. Self-efficacy and social/family support will be examined as
      mediating variables. Data collection will take place at baseline (pre-intervention), six
      months (post-intervention), and 12-months (six months after the post-intervention to assess
      maintenance).

      Aim 2: To continue engaging Marshallese stakeholders in all aspects of research.

      Aim 3: To collaboratively and creatively disseminate results to a broad group of
      stakeholders, locally and nationally.
