  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, adults and children who undergo elective surgery remain fasting in the
      preoperative period, for the purposes of avoiding bronchial aspiration of the gastric
      contents during general anesthesia. The determination of preoperative fasting has taken on
      importance only in 1946, when Mendelson established a relationship between pulmonary
      aspiration during labor and general anesthesia. Stemming from other studies, such concept has
      been expanded to elective surgery and 25 ml were set as the maximum threshold of the gastric
      content to thus reduce the hazards of aspiration pneumonia.

      The fasting time prescribed is still the subject of several investigations. For decades it
      has been established that patients should not feed on solids or ingest liquids over a period
      of 8 to 12 hours prior to surgery.

      The guidelines are well set in connection with the rules of fasting, with aims at making the
      instructions constant throughout different services worldwide. In 2011, the American and the
      European guidelines became more permissive and determined as safe the 2 hours for liquids
      devoid of residue, 4 hours for breast milk, 6 hours for infant formula and non-human milk, 6
      hours for light meals, and 8 hours for full meals. In accordance with the American guideline,
      liquids devoid of residue are: water, fruit juice with no pulp, carbohydrate-based beverages,
      tea with no residue, and black coffee, but those examples are not extensive. Gelatin is solid
      prior to intake, but it is found in a liquid state inside the stomach and, therefore, it is
      regarded as a liquid devoid of residue. Yet, in spite of the non-human milk's being a liquid
      material, it features a gastric emptying time which is similar to that of the non-fat solids.
      A light meal is characterized by toast and liquids devoid of residue, whilst a full meal
      includes food that is fried or which contains a high level of fat.

      Currently, many directives (American Society of Anaesthesiologists - ASA; Norwegian National
      Consensus Guideline - NNCG; Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland -
      AAGBI) recommend liquids devoid of residue until two hours prior to the anesthetic induction
      for elective surgery in healthy children. The particular benefit of the oral intake of fluids
      includes a lower incidence of deleterious effects, such as thirst, irritation, crying,
      hypoglycemia, and dehydration. The preservation of the intravascular volume improves the
      hemodynamic conditions during the induction of inhalation anesthesia and facilitates the
      vascular access.

      Even though the old instruction of &quot;nothing by mouth after midnight&quot; is in a process of being
      replaced by shorter periods of fasting, both surgeons and anesthesiologists still deem the
      traditional fast indispensable and have trouble with implementing the new norms, either by
      uncertainty before the possibility of the catastrophic consequences of pulmonary aspiration,
      or by lack of update on the subject. That matter generates mistakes in the rendering of
      information by the health professionals. Combined with the unawareness of the guardians in
      respect of the risk of bronchial aspiration and the anxiety in relation to the fasting, there
      is a result of difficulty in abidance by the proper preoperative fasting.

      The minority of the guardians understands the real importance of the preoperative fasting
      and, many times, food regarded as &quot;harmless&quot; is offered during the period of fasting.
      Likewise, the guardians provide improper information in order to maintain the surgical
      procedure, with no regard for the correct observance of the fasting. That way, countless
      pediatric elective surgeries are canceled, deriving in psychological, social, and economic
      implications. The correction of these flaws will allow for the anesthetic procedure to take
      place in a more secure manner, with the proper observance of the fasting period and with the
      least possible trauma to the child.

      Cross-sectional, observational study in which questionnaires will be applied to the guardians
      during the immediate post-surgical period in the anesthetic recovery room by residents of the
      third year of anesthesiology.

      Moreover, the knowledge of the physicians of the surgical specialties of the aforementioned
      institution pursuant to preoperative fasting is to be assessed, whilst a questionnaire will
      be applied after the meetings of the respective departments.

      After explication of the study, the Informed Consent Form will be handed in the
      pre-anesthetic consultation, and the questionnaires will be applied in the post-anesthetic
      recovery room to the guardians of the children who have undergone imaging examination and
      elective surgery. After the anesthetic induction, the patients will be subject to the
      measurement of blood glucose by Dextro. The resident doctors will be evaluated by means of
      another questionnaire, which is to be applied after the weekly clinical meeting of each
      specialty.
