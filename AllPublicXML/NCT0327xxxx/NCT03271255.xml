  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab, as an antibody of vascular endothelial generated factor (VEGF), combined with
      the fluorouracil-based chemotherapy regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer, has become the
      classical first-line treatment. However, vast majority of patients eventually will suffer
      progression disease. The second-line treatment includes replacing chemotherapy regimens
      whistle continuing bevacizumab or other anti-VEGF antibodies, such as Aflibercept and
      Ramucirumab. Apatinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which can highly
      selectively bind to and strongly block VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR - 2), also potently suppress
      the activities of Ret, c-kit and c-src, resulting in reduced cell migration, proliferation,
      and tumor microvascular density mediated by VEGF .There are already robust data showing that
      antibodies aimed at blocking VEGF signaling pathways combined with chemotherapy to treat
      advanced colorectal cancer is superior as compared to chemotherapy alone. Thus, we
      hypothesize that the effect of using the second-line chemotherapy regimens combined with
      apatinib may be superior to those combined with bevacizumab. In this study,the patients who
      have progressed following or on first-line oxaliplatin and 5-FU combined with bevacizumab are
      randomised into two arms. Patients in the experimental arm receive second-line FOLFIRI
      combined with apatinib and those in the control arm receive second-line FOLFIRI combined with
      bevacizumab. To compare the efficacy and safety of the two arms, progression-free
      survival(PFS) is the primary end point.If apatinib is superior to bevacizumab in the
      second-line setting,it is one possible option of anti-angiogenic therapy in combination with
      second-line FOLFIRI for treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.

      Firstly, screen eligible mCRC patients for enrolment. Our CRC clinical nurse specialists will
      document medical history of patients including diagnoses, first-line chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6
      or CAPOX),bevacizumab dosage,toxicities,PFS on previous therapy.In the
      meantime,chest-abdonimal-pelvic CT and blood tests are to be examined to assess base-line
      measurable lesions and guarantee adequate organ function prior to enrolment.If all the values
      meet the criteria for enrolment, consent will be signed.

      Secondly, randomise patients into two arms: Arm A-apatinib plus FOLFIRI regimen and arm
      B-bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI regimen.A software which is alike the procedure of coin flipping
      is used to randomise eligible patients.According to the selected regimen in specific
      arm,patients will be given full-dose drugs or reduced dose drugs if serious toxicities (
      CTCAE v4.0 criteria grade 3/4) are complained since previous cycle of treatment.Symptoms and
      blood test results (including CEA and CA199) before each cycle will be recorded and the
      consultant oncologist, who is responsible for individual participants, will decide whether to
      continue next cycle chemotherapy with apatinib or bevacizumab based on the assigned
      arm.Radiological assessment consisting of chest-abdonimal-pelvic CT will be performed every 2
      months.Notably,the monitor will check with physicians and nurse specialists for the accuracy
      and completeness of all data.

      Thirdly, follow up participants and analyse primary end point (PFS) and secondary end points
      (OS,ORR and DCR).The causes of confirmed missing data in the trial should be recorded in
      detail to determine the mechanism of missing data and choose the suitable missing data
      handling methods.

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 6 months after admission, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) [according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v). 1.1] or death due to any cause, whichever was first. PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). Participants who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who did not progress or were lost to follow-up were censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 6 months after admission,up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the cut-off date, OS was censored at the last known date alive.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Objective Response (Objective Response Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 3 months after admission.</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate is equal to the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR). Response was defined using RECIST, v. 1.1 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Stable Disease (SD) or a confirmed CR or PR (Disease Control Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>The follow-up period ranges from the first patient recruited to the last patient within 3 months after admission.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants achieved disease control if they had a best overall response of CR, PR or SD. According to RECIST v1.1, CR was the disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions, with the short axes of any target lymph node reduced to &lt;10 mm, the disappearance of all non-target lesions, and the normalization of tumor marker levels (if tumor markers were initially above the ULN); PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions (including the short axes of any target lymph node), taking as reference the baseline sum diameter. SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>
