  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded cluster-randomized study to evaluate the feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness of HIV self-testing strategies compared to standard of care in outpatient
      departments (OPD) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics. The first aim of the
      study will be conducted in Malawi at 15 clusters among 15,000 individuals (15 years or older)
      to test the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of group HIV self-testing for patients in OPD
      and STI clinic waiting areas. The second aim of the study will be conducted in Malawi at 15
      clusters among 7,500 individuals (15 years or older) to test the feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness of HIV self-testing for partners of newly identified HIV-positive clients.

      This is an unblinded cluster randomized study to evaluate the feasibility and
      cost-effectiveness of HIV self-testing strategies compared to standard of care in outpatient
      departments (OPD) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics. The study will be
      conducted in Malawi at 15 clusters among 15,000 individuals (15 years or older) for Aim 1 and
      7,500 individuals (15 years or older) for Aim 2. Clusters will be randomized to one of three
      study arms: (1) standard of care for provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) for
      HIV; (2) optimized standard of care for PITC for HIV; and (3) group self-testing for HIV for
      Aim 1 and partner self-testing for HIV for Aim 2.

      In Aim 1, the standard of care arm will receive no intervention for PITC, and the optimized
      standard of care arm will receive training and support for implementing the Malawi guidelines
      for PITC. The group self-testing arm will receive an intervention in which eligible patients
      at OPD and STI clinics will be given HIV self-test kits to use in the waiting area.
      Participants will present their self-test results to their provider, who will confirm their
      HIV diagnosis. On the same day, participants will complete a brief survey upon exiting the
      clinic. Survey and medical record data from the group self-testing arm will be compared to
      clinic registers from the standard of care and optimized standard of care arms to determine
      whether group self-testing is superior in regard to number of individuals tested for HIV,
      cost-effectiveness, number of HIV-positive individuals identified, and linkage rates for
      those who identify as HIV-positive.

      In Aim 2, the standard of care arm will receive no intervention for partner notification and
      referral, and the optimized standard of care arm will receive training and support for
      implementing the Malawi guidelines for partner notification and referral. The partner
      self-testing arm will receive an intervention in which eligible patients at ART clinics will
      be referred to study staff to learn about partner notification and self-testing. Participants
      in the self-testing arm will be given one self-test kit for each of their sexual partners who
      have an unknown HIV status or who tested HIV-negative more than six months prior.
      Participants (index clients) will be given instructions on how their partner can complete the
      self-test and how to refer their partner(s) to care if they receive a positive result from
      the self-test. Partners will be instructed to complete the self-tests and return the used
      tests to a lockbox in their community or to a provider at the study site. Participants will
      complete a brief survey at the beginning of the intervention and another survey at their
      follow-up ART visit. Participants in the standard of care and optimized standard of care arms
      will complete a survey upon entry to the study for self-report data on partner notification
      and testing. Survey and medical record data from the partner self-testing arm will be
      compared to standard of care and optimized standard of care arms to determine whether partner
      self-testing is superior in regard to number of individuals tested for HIV,
      cost-effectiveness, number of HIV-positive individuals identified, and linkage rates for
      those who identify as HIV-positive.

    <description>Facilities assigned to the standard of care arm will not receive an intervention and will continue with Ministry of Health National HIV Guidelines for provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) for Aim 1 and partner referral mechanisms for Aim 2. PITC guidelines recommend OPD and STI providers to inform their patients about HIV testing and refer them to HIV testing services at the facility. Partner referral mechanism recommendations advise providers to offer partner referral slips to newly identified HIV-positive clients to monitor the number of partners presenting to the facility for HIV testing.</description>

Eligible clients will receive education about HIV testing and a demonstration of how to use and interpret results of a self-test kit will occur in the group setting, and participants will be allowed to view their results in the group setting or in a private setting. Participants will disclose their results to their provider if they choose. In Aim 2, HIV self-test kits will be provided to newly identified HIV-positive clients to distribute to their partners. Eligible clients will be counseled on the importance of HIV testing and will receive instruction and a demonstration on how to use the self-test kit.</description>
