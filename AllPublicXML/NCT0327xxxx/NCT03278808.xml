  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase 2 study with controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Twenty
      three subjects will be enrolled into 2 groups (15 subjects in the Chloroquine-Azithromycin
      [CQ/AZ] Intervention Group, and 8 subjects in the Chloroquine [CQ] Group). The CQ/AZ Group
      will receive experimental intervention of 300 mg of CQ and 2 g of azithromycin (AZ). The CQ
      Group will receive 300 mg of CQ only. All subjects will participate in the CHMI and will be
      required to stay at a hotel for evaluation for a maximum of 14 nights starting 7 days after
      the challenge. A standard dose of atovaquone-proguanil (Malarone®) will be administered to
      all symptomatic parasitemic subjects under directly observed treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2, open-label study of the combination of a single dose-level of AZ
      (Zithromax) plus CQ given weekly as a prophylaxis against CQ-resistant P falciparum in
      healthy adults. After signing informed consent, subjects will undergo screening procedures
      between Day -77 to Day -18. If enrolled, subjects who are still eligible at Study Day -18
      will be randomized to either the CQ/AZ group (Group 1 of 15 subjects: 2 g AZ (Zithromax) plus
      300 mg CQ base weekly for 6 weeks), or the CQ control group (Group 2 of 8 subjects: 300 mg
      chloroquine base weekly for 6 weeks) and start intervention on Study Day -17. The rationale
      for the CQ control group to receive CQ is to show that the strain utilized (7G8) is indeed
      chloroquine resistant in humans: we expect all of the subjects in the CQ control group to
      become symptomatically parasitemic. If 3 or more subjects in the CQ control group do not
      become symptomatic with malaria, the CHMI will be considered uncontrolled either due to 7G8
      not being CQ-resistant, or the parasite not being infective.

    <masking_description>Because placebo for both products is difficult to obtain and because the primary endpoint of symptomatic parasitemia is an objective measure, treatment will be open-label. Microscopists reading the smears will be blinded to the group, but will be aware of whether or not a particular sample is from a symptomatic subject.
Although symptoms are a subjective measure and part of the primary endpoint of symptomatic parasitemia, subjects will not be told if they are parasitemic prior to treatment initiation thus making symptomatic complaints and this endpoint more reliable.</masking_description>
