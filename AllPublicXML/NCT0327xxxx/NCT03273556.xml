      Evaluation of the filler performance on the nasolabial folds of Aliaxin® EV with and without
      lidocaine 0.3%: comparison within subjects (half face method)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparative, randomized, mono-centre spontaneous trial, under dermatological control, that
      foresaw the comparison within subjects of the investigational product versus investigational
      product with Lidocaine 0.3% (half face method); assignation of right or left face side to the
      two injective treatments was choose by the Investigator according to a previously defined
      randomisation list.

      Primary end point of the study was to evaluate the filling and bio-revitalizing activity on
      nasolabial folds of the product Aliaxin® EV Essential Volume, in women aged 40-65 years.

      It was also aim of this study to show if the addition of Lidocaine 0.3% to the
      investigational product (extemporaneous mixture) could have reduced the discomfort/pain
      sensation perceived by the subject during the injection procedure, without altering the
      aesthetic performance.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) grade variation from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit (T0), Week 4 (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction of wrinkles severity corresponding to a decrease from the baseline of the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) clinical score where:
Grade 1 (absent): no visible nasolabial fold; continuous skin line. Grade 2 (mild): shallow but visible nasolabial fold with a slight indentation; minor facial feature.
Grade 3 (moderate): moderately deep nasolabial folds; clear facial feature visible at normal appearance but not when stretched.
Grade 4 (severe): very long and deep nasolabial folds; prominent facial feature; &lt;2mm visible fold when stretched.
Grade 5 (very severe): extremely deep and long nasolabial fold, detrimental to facial appearance; 2-4 mm visible V-shaped fold when stretched.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) grade variation from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit (T0), Week 4 (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>Aesthetic improvement in the subjects' midface from their pretreatment state according to a five point scale:
Very much improved: Optimal cosmetic result for the implant in this patient.
Much improved: Marked improvement in appearance from initial condition, but not completely optimal for this patient. A touch up will slightly improve the result.
Improved: Obvious improvement in appearance from the initial condition, but a touch-up or re-treatment is indicated.
No change: The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.
Worse:The appearance in worst than the original condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self grading</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the injection procedure (T0A), 2 hours after the injection procedure (T2h)</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately and 2 hours after the aesthetic procedure, each volunteers scored its own sensations thanks to a visual analogic scale (VAS 10 units length) as follow:
Stinging (0= no stinging to 10= strong stinging)
Itching (0= no itching to 10= strong itching)
Tightening (0= no tightening to 10= strong tightening)
Burning (0= no burning to 10= strong burning)
Pain (0= no pain to 10= strong pain)
Discomfort (0= no discomfort to 10= strong discomfort) In order to highlight any differences between the side treated with the investigational product and the one treated with the study product + lidocaine 0.3%, the VAS score will be expressed separately for each of the two treated sides.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of profilometric parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline visit (T0), Week 4 (T4)</time_frame>
    <description>Variation from baseline of the nasolabial fold profilometric parameters versus baseline. Profilometric parameters are expressed in in micron.
A picture of nasolabial fold area is taken thanks to Primos compact portable device (GFMesstechnik); Primos software is able to measure skin principal profilometric parameters:Ra (average roughness) Rt (wrinkles total high), Rv (wrinkles maximum depth)</description>
