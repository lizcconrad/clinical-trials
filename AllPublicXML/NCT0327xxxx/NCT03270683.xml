      Objective: To assess neurologic prognostication by early Transcranial Doppler Sonography
      (TCD) in comatose survivors after cardiac arrest.

      Design: Prospective study between May 2016 and November 2017 in a medical intensive care unit
      and cardiac intensive care unit in a university hospital.

      Patients: all comatose patients older than 18 years successfully resuscitated from an
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Patients for whom OHCA is associated with traumatic
      brain injury, no window for TCD measurements, or dead before neurological prognostication are
      excluded.

      The investigators measure the pulsatility index (PI) and diastolic flow velocity (DFV) of the
      right and left middle cerebral artery during the first 12 h after return of spontaneous
      circulation (ROSC). The highest value of DFV and the lowest of PI will use for the
      statistical analysis. Cerebral Performance Category evaluate neurologic outcome at hospital
      discharge.

      Data provided by early TCD after ROSC are associated with neurological outcome. The use of
      these data could lead to the development of therapeutics improving cerebral perfusion in
      patient resuscitated from an OHCA.
