  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare disease, which means that any single PCD center
      has experience with a limited number of patients. PCD Registry is the collection of data
      about PCD from many centers and countries who treat children with PCD. Collecting data about
      PCD increase the knowledge on PCD, better describe the course of the disease, and help to
      better understand the progression of the disease and be used to develop new treatments.

      In the PCD registry of Alberta, important information about PCD such as time of diagnosis,
      symptoms, and tests which led to the diagnosis, state of health at diagnosis, the progression
      of lung function, the occurrence of severe infections, tests and treatments data will be
      collected from the patients' medical records.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to better characterize the clinical course, and improve the diagnosis and treatment
      of PCD, the investigators propose to establish a provincial PCD registry in Alberta. This
      registry will be securely linked to the currently existing International Registry for PCD and
      will allow more researchers to use the information to do research on PCD.

      The investigators will collect demographic data: current age, sex, age, diagnostic findings
      and symptoms at diagnosis; in addition, clinical data about PCD which are recorded during the
      past and future clinical visits and encounters (e.g. lung function, weight, height,
      infections, treatments, and complications) will also be collected.
