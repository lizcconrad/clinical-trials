  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we assessed the therapeutic effects and safety of left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC) high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on negative
      symptoms of schizophrenia. We evaluated the efficacy of rTMS on cognition in patients with
      chronic schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial. 47 patients diagnosed with
      schizophrenia on stable antipsychotic treatment were randomly assigned to active rTMS
      treatment group (n=25) or a sham rTMS treatment group (n=22). 25 patients in the active rTMS
      group received 10 Hz 110% rTMS, while 22 patients were subjected to sham rTMS, both being
      given 4-week treatment (5 days per week). Efficacy of negative symptom was assessed with the
      Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative symptom scale
      (PANSS) at baseline, the end of 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The cognitive function was assessed with
      CANTAB at baseline, the end of 4 weeks and 8 weeks .The side effects were assessed with
      Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale at baseline and the end of 4 weeks.

    <masking_description>This was a single-institution, randomized controlled, double blinded trial. Participants were randomized to receive, over 4 weeks, 20 sessions of either active or sham rTMS. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks by 2 psychiatrists blinded to the treatment assigned. Inter-rater reliability was satisfactory (κa=0.86).</masking_description>

    <description>Prior to each TMS administration, motor threshold was determined by stimulating the left motor strip with the lowest possible energy to produce, within 10 stimuli, at least 5 evoked potentials Z0.05 . In active rTMS, 10 Hz stimulations over left DLPFC occurred at a power of 110% of MT for 5-s intervals with 30-s intertrain interval. 30 trains were administered each day (MondayFriday) for 4 consecutive weeks (total stimuli=30,000).</description>
