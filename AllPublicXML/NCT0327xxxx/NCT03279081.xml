      The purpose of this phase III, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled,
      international, multicentre study to assess efficacy and safety of Cx601, adult allogeneic
      expanded adipose-derived stem cells (eASC), for the treatment of complex perianal fistula(s)
      in patients with Crohn's disease over a period of 24 weeks and a follow-up period up to 52
      weeks. ADMIRE-CD II study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current multicentre phase III study is proposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Cx601 compared to placebo for the treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in patients with
      Crohn's disease at Week 24 with a follow-up period up to 52 weeks.

      The primary efficacy analysis, will be conducted at Week 24 timepoint. The double blind
      design will be maintained up to Week 52 (both patient and investigator) by a specific
      blinding for study treatment administration and for evaluating its efficacy .

      The study will follow an add-on design, patients receiving any ongoing concomitant medical
      treatment, at stable doses at the time of screening, for the Crohn's disease (CD) will be
      allowed to continue it throughout the study.

      Study treatments will be allocated, on a 1:1 ratio, by central randomization through
      interactive web response system (IWRS).
