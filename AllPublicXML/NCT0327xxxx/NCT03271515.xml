      This study aims to evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of anti-CD19
      anti-CD20 Bispecific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) redirected autologous T-cells in
      patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ and CD20+ haematological malignancies.

      This is a multi-centre, non-randomised, open label Phase I clinical trial of an Advanced
      Therapy Investigational Medicinal Product named CD19 CD20 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)
      T-cells (CD19 CAR T-cells) in patients with high risk, relapsed CD19+ and CD20+haematological
      malignancies (Leukemia and lymphoma). Following informed consent and registration to the
      trial, patients will undergo an unstimulated leukapheresis for the generation of the CD19
      CD20 CAR T-cells. Patients will receive the CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells following lymphodepleting
      chemotherapy. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy and duration of response of the
      CD19 CD20 CAR T-cells in patients with high risk relapsed CD19+ malignancies.
