      This study seeks to enroll patients receiving a Survivorship Care Plan following curative
      therapy for cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or to be
      followed by a Patient Navigator as part of their Survivorship Care Plan.

      This study seeks to enroll patients receiving a Survivorship Care Plan following curative
      therapy for cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive usual care or to be
      followed by a Patient Navigator as part of their Survivorship Care Plan.

      Study participation for all participants will be for up to 9 months, with study visits
      approximately every 3 months, based on standard clinical follow-up. All participants will be
      administered quality of life surveys by a Clinical Research Associate at study entry,
      mid-study (approximately 3-6 months) and at study completion.

      The following factors will be compared between arms:

        -  Missed/kept appointments

        -  Use of urgent/emergent care

        -  Quality of Life in relation to survivorship care

        -  Participants lost to care

    <measure>Cancer Needs Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their feelings about 39 specific cancer needs on a 5 point scale from &quot;Not a Problem&quot; to &quot;Very Severe Problem&quot; using the Cancer Needs Distress Inventory (CaNDI) tool. Total scores can range from 39 to 195. Lower scores are associated with less cancer related distress.</description>

    <measure>New Survivor Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their understanding about 16 specific aspects of survivorship care on a 4 point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; using the Preparing for Life as a New Survivor (PLANS) Scale. Total scores can range from 16 to 48. Lower scores are associated with less understanding of the survivorship care process.</description>
