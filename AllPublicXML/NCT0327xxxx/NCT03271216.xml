  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if surveillance monitoring of general ward patients can reduce
      cardio-pulmonary arrest while maintaining an acceptable false alarms rate for nursing
      workload.

      The investigators placed a wired monitoring system (pulse oximetry, heart rate and
      respiratory rate) on every patient who arrived on a subject general post surgical ward who
      assented to wear the system. this was the Masimo PSNET system using the Radical 87 monitor
      and an acoustic respiratory sensor along with a Masimo pulse oximetry probe. Patients were
      monitored for a minimum of 48 hrs. Heart Rate (HR) parameters were set between 45-130,
      Respiratory rate was set between 6-20 and pulse oximetrry was 85-100%. Nurses documented in
      the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) any alarms they responded to as to whether they were
      false (vital sign not out of range when rechecked) or true and what the response was.
      Responses ranged from nurse managed to notification of primary service to Rapid Response
      Activation to Code team activation as well as transfer to a higher level of care (operating
      room or Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/IMC. Patient and Nursing satisfaction surveys were
      collected.
