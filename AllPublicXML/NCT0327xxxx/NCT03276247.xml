  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analyzed iron status, HFE mutations and ethnicity for women in five primary care centers in
      the United States and Canada using de-identified data from the HEIRS study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HEIRS included a cross-sectional screening study of 101,168 patients, 25 years of age or
      older, in the primary care setting. Participants were recruited from four centers in the U.S
      .and one in Canada from February 2001 to February 2003. We will evaluate results for women
      aged 25-44 years of age who are self-reported as Asian, Black, Hispanic or White. The lower
      detection limit for the serum ferritin (SF) assay in the HEIRS study was 15 μg/L and
      therefore the definition of iron deficiency will be SF concentration ≤ 15 μg/L. Elevated SF
      concentrations, possibly indicative of elevated iron stores, will be classified by two
      definitions: 1) SF concentration &gt; 300 μg/L and 2) SF &gt;200 μg/L in combination with TSAT
      &gt;45%. Proportions will be compared by Pearson's chi-square. Logistic regression models will
      be used to identify independent associations with measures of iron deficiency and elevated
      iron stores.
