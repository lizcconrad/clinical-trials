  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, Single time point, discovery study intending to identify biomarkers
      that can differentiate endometriosis from other underlying reasons for pelvic pain. Patients
      undergoing laparoscopy for evaluation of chronic pelvic pain or elective tubal ligation will
      be enrolled for collection of tissue samples at the time of laparoscopy.

  <detailed_description>

      This study will be a prospective collection of blood, urine, and endometrial tissue from
      women with chronic pelvic pain symptoms, with or without infertility, who require evaluation
      by laparoscopy. Women undergoing laparoscopy for elective tubal ligation will also be
      investigated similarly and serve as the negative control. Subjects will be queried regarding
      sociodemographic characteristics, medical and reproductive history, pain and lifestyle as
      well as assessment for differential diagnoses such as interstitial cystitis and idiopathic
      bowel syndrome. Endometriosis severity will be captured by rASRM staging during laparoscopy.

    <description>The primary variables will be the DiscoveryMAP analytes identified in blood and/or urine and the mRNA transcriptome in endometrial tissue. DiscoveryMAP is a comprehensive, quantitative platform of immunoassays evaluating multiple analytes in various body system categories: cytokines, chemokines, metabolic markers, hormones, growth factors, tissue remodeling proteins, angiogenesis markers, acute phase reactants, and cancer markers</description>
