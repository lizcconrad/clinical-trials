  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study, to assess if thermal imaging and/or near infrared imaging will
      be useful in identifying changes in the peripheral circulation in patients with different
      stages of liver disease.

      The aim of this study is to use new and advanced thermal imaging techniques to identify
      changes in the peripheral circulation and hand temperature in patients with liver disease.
      These changes could be used as a non-invasive marker of the severity and progression of liver
      disease. Thermal imaging will also be used to assess the changes in the peripheral
      vasculature with the use of terlipressin, a drug used as treatment for specific complications
      of liver disease.

      Patients with acute or chronic liver disease from any aetiology will be recruited, along with
      patients without liver disease as healthy controls. Patients with disease or on drugs known
      to affect the peripheral vasculature will be excluded.

      All studies will be performed in a ward setting in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The
      subjects will be required for up to three sessions, each lasting 30 minutes. The session will
      involve static thermal images being taken, and video images of the hands warming up after
      being cooled for 30 seconds in water at a temperature of 7 degrees Celsius. If the patient is
      receiving terlipressin therapy, static images will be taken before, during and after
      terlipressin therapy.
