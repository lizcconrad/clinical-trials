  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this exploratory clinical trial in patients with high-grade a primary brain
      tumor who receive chemoradiation is that the PET imaging agents [18F]Fluciclovine and/or
      [18F]FLT will be a better predictor of tumor response than standard MRI based brain tumor
      response criteria. When used in conjunction, the two PET agents may be better able to predict
      tumor aggressiveness and thus overall survival than the use of individual-tracer PET
      biomarkers. This may eventually lead to improved assessment of response (including time to
      progression and overall survival) and differentiation of tumor recurrence/progression from
      treatment effect (pseudoprogression).

    <textblock>
      The standard treatment approach for patients with high-grade primary brain tumors includes
      maximum feasible surgical resection, followed by 6 weeks of concurrent cranial irradiation,
      and daily low-dose temozolomide chemotherapy; followed by 12 cycles of high-dose temozolomide
      administered for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks (Stupp et al., 2005). Contrast-enhanced MRI
      is the current standard for evaluating the success of therapy and monitoring for tumor
      recurrence. MRI is typically obtained prior to initial surgery, within 24 hours after
      surgery, at the conclusions of cranial irradiation, and then every 8 weeks during
      temozolomide chemotherapy until evidence of recurrence. Despite this careful clinical and
      radiographic surveillance, and despite decades of research into the histologic and molecular
      classification of primary brain tumors, our ability to predict tumor behavior remains very
      limited. Some gliomas will result in overall survival times of only months, whereas other
      histologically-identical gliomas may yield survivals of years to decades (Curran et al.,
      1993, Carson et al., 2007). Current assessment of tumor response to therapy is also poor.
      Patients with complete radiographic response after cranial irradiation often progress rapidly
      post-irradiation. In contrast, some patients with enhancing masses at the end of
      chemoradiotherapy may respond dramatically to further chemotherapy alone; or the masses may
      even disappear in the absence of further therapy, so called &quot;tumor pseudoprogression&quot;
      (Chamberlain et al., 2007). This confounding situation demonstrates a need for better
      assessment of tumor response.

      Improvements in the ability to predict tumor behavior prior to the start of therapy would
      allow more efficient and effective tumor surveillance; better prognostication; and more
      appropriate assignment of patients to conventional, aggressive, or investigational therapies
      early in their clinical courses. This would provide huge economic and social benefits, and
      could afford decisive insights into brain tumor physiology and biology.

      Similarly, the ability to identify, earlier and more accurately, whether individual patients
      were responding to therapy would allow prompt discontinuation of ineffectual treatments and
      institution of potentially more effective therapies.

      Previous efforts using imaging for such tasks have generally been limited to a single
      modality (e.g. MRI) and/or single-tracer (e.g. FDG-PET). However, there is a significant and
      growing body of evidence that complementary imaging of multiple aspects of tumor physiology
      (i.e. using multiple PET tracers) can provide greatly enhanced information over imaging with
      a single modality or tracer alone. In solid tumors, complex interactions exist between blood
      flow, metabolic activity, and oxygen status which affect metastatic and proliferative
      activity. Heterogeneous tumors may contain both slow-growing and fast-growing regions that
      present different profiles of proliferation rates and amino acid uptake.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Two adult patient groups will be eligible for inclusion in this study:

        Group A: Patients where there is compelling evidence, based on the MRI and/or CT imaging,
        that a high-grade primary brain tumor is present. Pathologic confirmation will occur with
        biopsy or surgery.

        Patients whose tumor is felt to be inoperable and a biopsy is performed but no surgery.

        Patients with a newly diagnosed primary malignant brain tumor (WHO Grade III or IV) who
        will be receiving chemoradiation and who either did not undergo surgical resection or
        underwent incomplete resection with residual tumor &gt; 1.0 cm in greatest diameter by
        contrast MRI postoperatively.

        Group B: Patients with pathologically proven malignant brain tumor (WHO Grade III or IV
        glial-based tumors) who have undergone chemoradiation and have MRI-documented possible
        recurrence/progression versus treatment effect (pseudoprogression) within 6 months from the
        time of completion of chemoradiation.

          -  Patients must be 18 years or older for inclusion in this study. There is little
             experience with the safety of [18F]FLT or [18F]Fluciclovine in children, and the risks
             associated with radiation exposure may be increased for children under 18 years old as
             well.

          -  Patients must document their willingness to be followed for at least 24 months after
             recruitment by signing informed consent documenting their agreement to have clinical
             endpoints and the results of histopathologic tissue analysis (when tissue becomes
             available from routine care) entered into a research database.

          -  All patients, or their legal guardians, must sign a written informed consent and HIPAA
             authorization in accordance with institutional guidelines.

          -  Determination of pregnancy status: Female patients who are not postmenopausal or
             surgically sterile will undergo a serum pregnancy test prior to each set of [18F]FLT
             and [18F]Fluciclovine PET scans. A negative test will be necessary for such patients
             to undergo research PET imaging.

          -  Pre-imaging laboratory tests must be performed within 28 days prior to the [18F]FLT
             imaging procedure. These must be less than 4.0 times below or above the upper or lower
             limit range for the respective laboratory test for entry into the study (unless
             clinically not relevant). In those instances where a laboratory value is outside of
             this range, then such a patient will be ineligible for enrollment. For follow-up
             scanning sessions after therapy has been instituted, laboratory testing will also be
             required due to the use of [18F]FLT. The patients have brain tumors and will have
             received chemoradiation; therefore, many routine laboratory tests may not be within
             the typical normal range. As such, a factor of 4.0 times above or below the upper or
             lower value for the normal range for any laboratory test will also be used to
             determine the acceptable range for the 2nd and possibly 3rd imaging time points
             (unless clinically not relevant). The baseline laboratory testing will include liver
             enzymes (ALT, AST), bilirubin (total), serum electrolytes, CBC with platelets,
             prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, BUN, and creatinine. For those patients
             receiving coumadin or another anticoagulant the upper limit for prothrombin time or
             partial thromboplastin time must not exceed 6 times the upper limit of the normal
             range. (Appendix E, Laboratory Study Results).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically significant signs of uncal herniation, such as acute
             pupillary enlargement, rapidly developing motor changes (over hours), or rapidly
             decreasing level of consciousness, are not eligible.

          -  Patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to previously administered
             radiopharmaceuticals. Patients with significant drug or other allergies or autoimmune
             diseases may be enrolled at the Investigator's discretion.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating or who suspect they might be pregnant. Serum
             pregnancy tests will be obtained prior to each set of multi-tracer PET scans in female
             patients that are not postmenopausal or surgically sterile.

          -  Adult patients who require monitored anesthesia for PET scanning.

          -  Patients who are too claustrophobic to undergo PET scanning.

          -  Known HIV positive patients due to the previous toxicity noted with [18F]FLT in this
             patient group.
