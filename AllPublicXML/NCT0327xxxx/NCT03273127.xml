      A Phase 1 study to assess pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of abediterol 5 μg dry powder
      inhaler (DPI) given once daily (QD) for 9 days, compared to placebo, in patients with asthma
      on inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess PK and safety of
      abediterol 5 μg DPI given QD for 9 days, compared to placebo, in patients with asthma on
      ICSs. It is planned that 12 patients with asthma will be randomized into the study, of which
      9 will receive abediterol 5 μg and 3 will receive placebo. The entire study period is
      scheduled to take a maximum of 41 days (follow-up included) for each individual patient.
      During the screening period, all patients will take their own baseline inhaled
      corticosteroids. Patients on long-acting β2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroids will be switched
      over to the respective inhaled corticosteroid mono-component at Visit 1. Patients will be
      provided salbutamol as rescue medication for use throughout the study. Each patient will
      receive a single inhaled dose of abediterol or placebo in the morning of Days 1 to 9 (Visits
      3 to 8) under supervision of the Investigator or designee.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

          -  Male and non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients aged 18 - 55 years with asthma

             multiplying this figure by the number of years a person has been smoking. For example,
             a person who smokes 40 cigarettes a day and has been smoking for 10 years would have a
             20 pack-year smoking history (40 cigarettes per day ÷ 20 cigarettes per pack = 2; 2 ×
             10 years of smoking = 20 pack-year history).

          -  Patient with documented clinical diagnosis of asthma for ≥ 6 months before Visit 1

             test at Visit 2.

          -  Patient with pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Visit 2

             minutes apart).

          -  Patient who demonstrates the ability to use the study inhalation device properly.

        Patient able to perform acceptable pulmonary function testing for FEV1 according to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has known or suspected hypersensitivity to the IMP or excipients, including
             lactose (Note: lactose intolerance is not an exclusion criterion).

          -  Patient who has used systemic steroid in the 6 weeks before Visit 1.

          -  Patient with a history of hospitalization due to asthma in the 6 months prior to Visit
             1 or a history of intubation because of asthma at any time in their lifetime.
