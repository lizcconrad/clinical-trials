  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-based case management programs and home hospitalization services following the risk
      stratification model of Kaiser Permanente and Kings Fund select an estimated 5% of older
      individuals living in the community who are at high risk of hospitalization and adverse
      outcomes. The objective of these services is to avoid deterioration and hospital admissions
      or visits to the emergency services by regular follow-up, proactive home visits and support
      of self-care . The prevalence of malnutrition in patients selected using this model of care
      is unknown.

      The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of malnutrition, using the MNA, in this
      high-risk community living population, and to explore risk factors that could identify
      subgroups of individuals at higher risk.

      This study was performed in individuals included in a Case Management (CM) Program lead by
      the Telemedicine Unit of a tertiary university hospital in Valencia. Patients admitted to the
      hospital with two or more hospital admissions for medical reasons in the previous year are
      detected by a computerized system and included in the program, an integrated care
      intervention developed for patients with complex multimorbidity using patient-centred
      education activities and integrated care interventions, with the support of a Hospital at
      Home Unit (HHU). Telephone follow-ups by case manager nurses are focused on identifying
      problems and detecting disease exacerbations. The main aim of this program is to avoid
      hospital admissions and reduce the number of visits to emergency services
