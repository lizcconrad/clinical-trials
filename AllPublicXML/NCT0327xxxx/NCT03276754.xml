      Prospective multicenter observational study, to evaluate the impact of routine clinical
      practice vaccination with PCV13 on the reduction of the risk of moderate/severe COPD
      exacerbations
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been demonstrated to have an
      increased risk of pneumococcal disease. Pneumonia is frequent among patients hospitalized for
      COPD exacerbations and is associated with increased health care utilization and higher
      mortality. Up to 50%-70% of exacerbations can be attributed to respiratory infections by
      viruses or bacteria, even more in the most severe patients. They are often associated with
      the colonization of airways by multiple bacteria or viruses of low virulence that in normal
      conditions are parts of the normal flora of the upper airway. Current recommendations for
      immunization of patients with COPD include vaccination against influenza and Streptococcus
      pneumoniae. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits of immunization of
      COPD patients with PCV13 and/or against influenza in terms of clinical benefits and quality
      of life.

    <description>The SGRQ is a specific questionnaire developed to measure health status (quality of life) in patients with chronic airflow limitation.
Scores are calculated for three domains: Symptoms, Activity and Impacts (Psycho-social) as well as a total score. The scores range from 0 (minimum, best possible health status) to 100 (maximum, worst possible health status).</description>
