  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that the presence of (subclinical) gut inflammation at
      baseline in patients with early active axial spondyloarthritis predisposes to a more severe
      disease defined as more need to use anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy and a shorter time
      to relapse after stopping anti-tumor necrosis factor α therapy after obtaining sustained
      clinical remission. Overall, the investigators hypothesize that subclinical gut inflammation
      is an important predictor in therapy response and outcome. These data could provide better
      insights into the complex interactions between gut and joint inflammation and guide the
      physicians in the therapeutic approach.

    <description>Axial spondyloarthritis patients who don't have a good treatment response on 2 NSAIDs, will be treated with golimumab. After remission, the therapy will be stopped.
All patients will undergo a ileocoloscopy at baseline and, if positive, at time of remission.</description>

          -  Subject has at least 3 months and maximum 1 year (almost) daily chronic back pain.

          -  Subject has an active disease defined as a positive MRI (according to ASAS definition)
             or elevated CRP (in patients who are HLA-B27+) and an ASDAS score &gt; 2.1 (at least high
             disease activity).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Full anti-inflammatory dose of NSAIDs for more than 4 weeks for the duration of the
             axSpA symptoms.

          -  Prior exposure to any biologic therapy with a potential therapeutic impact on SpA,
             including anti-TNF therapy.

          -  Exposure to disease-modifying drugs (DMARDSs; i.e. methotrexate and sulfasalazine) in
             the last 3 months before the ileocolonoscopy.

          -  Exposure to systemic corticosteroid treatment in the last 14 days before the
             ileocolonoscopy.

          -  Infection(s) requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics/antivirals/antifungals
             within 30 days prior to the baseline visit or oral antibiotics/antivirals/antifungals
             within 14 days prior to the baseline visit.

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to human immunoglobulin proteins or other components of
             golimumab.

          -  History of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease or neurologic symptoms
             suggestive of CNS demyelinating disease.

          -  History of listeriosis, histoplasmosis, chronic of active hepatitis B infection,
             hepatitis C infection, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, immunodeficiency
             syndrome, chronic recurring infections or active tuberculosis.

             than a successfully treated non-metastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell
             carcinoma or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Have received, or are expected to receive, any live virus or bacterial vaccination
             within 3 months prior to the first administration of study agent, during the trial, or
             within 6 months after the last administration of study agent.

          -  Positive pregnancy test at screening or baseline.

          -  Female subjects who are breast-feeding or considering becoming pregnant during the

          -  Subject with diagnosis and current symptoms of fibromyalgia.

          -  Any medical or psychological condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, could
