  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTENSITY-LOW study aims to answer if there are any limits to LDL reduction in relation
      to benefitting vascular health from a mechanistic viewpoint, and therefore potentially
      limitations to primary prevention in healthy volunteers by lowering LDL cholesterol using
      PCSK9 therapies. This research is being carried out because it is unclear what the lowest
      threshold of LDL cholesterol should be to attain significant reductions in CV risk in healthy
      individuals. It is also unknown whether there is a true limit of LDL cholesterol below which
      there is no further improvement in endothelial function in healthy people, and, whether this
      is associated with a reduction in markers of both systemic and vascular inflammation. This
      study will hope to provide evidence that the so-called pleiotropic effects of statins are
      actually mediated by a mechanism of LDL-cholesterol lowering per se and not necessarily a
      special therapeutic effect of statins.

      Defining this may help identify individuals from the general population who may benefit from
      more aggressive lipid-lowering treatment than standard statin treatment in terms of CV
      morbidity and mortality.

      This study will be conducted in healthy volunteers only, where participants will be
      randomized to either the Alirocumab arm (which is a therapy designed to lower cholesterol) or
      comparator arm. Both Alirocumab and comparator arms will be combined with Atorvastatin
      (another therapy designed to lower cholesterol) at the second dosing visit.

      In total, thirty healthy individuals will be recruited to this single centre, randomized,
      single blind, parallel group, mechanistic physiological study which will be conducted at
      Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust/University of Cambridge. This study will
      be open to recruitment for one year and the total study duration for each participant will be
      approximately 10 weeks. There will be 4 study visits in total with a telephone follow up at
      the end of the study. Of these visits, two will be dosing visits and the total duration of
      treatment is approx. 4 weeks.

      A series of non-invasive haemodynamic assessments and minimally invasive procedures including
      blood tests and forearm blood flow measurements will be conducted prior, during and post
      dosing to determine if there is an improvement of endothelia vascular function (as measured
      by nitric oxide bioavailability) and reduced systemic inflammation. This study is funded by
      JP Moulton Charitable Foundation.

    <masking_description>Independent CRF research nurse to perform the drug administration. CRF nurse will be unblinded whilst the rest of the study team (including the CI/PI) are blinded. This will involve the ACRC nurse bringing the injection in a sealed box to the room, preparing a shield (so the volunteer is blinded), administering the injection (via alirocumab pen or placebo - saline in insulin syringe) and then putting the syringe back in the sealed box and removing the screen. They have to ensure none of the study team are aware of the Rx as well as the patient.
CRF nurses will also have to collect and store medication in their building. Statin can be stored in a locked cupboard (open label).</masking_description>
