  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the efficacy, safety and clinical benefit (how well the drugs
      works), of the pharmaceutical compositions in Nasal Spray NST-4G for the treatment of brain
      tumors( Recurrent Glioblastoma, Gliosarcoma,Anaplastic Gliomas, Previously Treated).

      All drugs target the inhibition of the growth factors and neo-angiogenesis as one the main
      reasons for the growth of the tumor.

      The purpose of the Nasal Spray NST-4G study is to determine the safety and tolerability in
      order to establish the best dose level to be used in future studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study, Phase 1 study evaluating the preliminary safety, efficacy,
      tolerability and clinical benefit of Nasal Spray NST-4G in patients with Recurrent
      Glioblastoma, Gliosarcoma,Anaplastic Gliomas.

      Acceptable subjects included in the study will receive Nasal Spray NST-4G, administered twice
      daily for 7 weeks intranasally.

      Every 8th day, a blood function (hematopoiesis) is examined . Patients may continue to
      receive subsequent nasal spray cycles if the subject is not intolerant of the test product,
      does not withdraw consent or the individual no longer receives clinical benefit (the factors
      taken for consideration will be the progression of the disease, expressed in increasing
      neuropathy, hemiparesis, pain intensification ,DLT events, Clinical signs of deteriorating
      quality of life (QOL).

      The evaluation of the tumor size will be repeated using the MRI method with a contrast agent
      after each 7-week nasal spray cycle.

      The use of nasal spray is a non-invasive method of treatment that does not require
      specialized conditions for therapy

    <description>To determine late toxicity for the maximum tolerated dose is estimated a function of hematopoiesis of patients by blood sampling every 8th day The MTD is based upon dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) experienced during Cycle 1 of treatment. The MTD is the dose level at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT with at least two patients experiencing DLT at the next higher dose level. Using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0, DLTs are defined as: Grade 4 neutropenia lasting greater than 5 days; Grade 3 thrombocytopenia; the occurrence of non-hematologic Grade 3 or greater drug-related adverse events excluding Grade ≥ 3 elevation in alkaline phosphatase, Grade ≥ 3 nausea or vomiting unless occurring despite the use of standard anti-emetics or Grade 3 diarrhea unless occurring despite standard anti-diarrheal therapy; &gt; 14 day delay to re-treat due to failure to resolve drug-related toxicity to re-treatment criteria or pre-treatment baseline.</description>

          1. Has been treated previously with bevacizumab and (or) temozolomide.

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          3. Be &gt;/= 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          4. Have histologically confirmed World Health Organization Grade IV malignant glioma
             (glioblastoma or gliosarcoma). Participants will be eligible if the original histology
             was low-grade glioma and a subsequent histological diagnosis of glioblastoma or
             variants is made.

          5. Patients must be at first or second relapse and clinically require reoperation for
             tumor progression within 4 to 6 weeks. Note: Relapse is defined as progression
             following initial therapy (i.e., radiation, chemotherapy, or radiation+ chemotherapy).
             If the participant had a surgical resection for relapsed disease and no antitumor
             therapy instituted for up to 12 weeks, this is considered one relapse. For
             participants who had prior therapy for a low grade glioma, the surgical diagnosis of a
             high grade glioma will be considered first relapse.

          6. Have measurable disease consisting of a minimal volume of 1 cm3.

          7. Have provided tissue from an archival tissue sample of a tumor lesion.

          8. Have a performance status of &gt;/= 60 on the KPS.

             with total bilirubin levels &gt; 1.5 ULN; AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;/= 2.5 X ULN,
             Coagulation: International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) &lt;/= 1.5 X

         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 90 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         14. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with

             recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          6. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
