      The primary objective is to contrast the degree to which increased consumption of dietary
      fiber vs. probiotics can increase microbiota diversity and can impact microbiota production
      of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), potential normalizers of metabolic and immune dysfunction,
      in obese and non-obese adults.

      The centrality of the gut microbiota to human health has emerged in just the last decade,
      with the last three years implicating our modern, deteriorated gut microbiota in numerous
      chronic diseases. It is likely dietary changes in the last half-century consistent with
      adoption of the Western diet have had an adverse impact on the gut microbiota. A critically
      important next step in this field of research is to identify how different probiotic
      supplements can potentially restore the microbiota in alignment with the optimization of
      human health, particularly in regards to the reversal or prevention of chronic diseases
      including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease. This study is designed
      to elicit and contrast the amount of increase in microbiota diversity and related metabolic
      output achievable by several distinctly different dietary approaches commonly available to
      the general population. The results could contribute to dietary recommendations for reversing
      the chronic disease epidemics of westernization.

             greater than 160/100, oral temperature greater than 100 degrees F, pulse greater than
             100.

          -  Use of any of the following drugs within the last 6 months:

               1. systemic antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals or antiparasitics (intravenous,
