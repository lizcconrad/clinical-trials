  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The severity of minimal dialysis disequilibrium syndrome (DDS) is currently detected and
      graded clinically using clinical criteria. Bispectral Index (BIS), an electroencephalographic
      (EEG) derived parameter is widely used in anesthesia and Critical Care setting to detect
      effects of anesthetic/hypnotic drugs. The aim of our study was to assess the discriminative
      power of BIS monitoring to accurately detect DDS.

      Design: A consecutive, clinical, validation study. Setting: Medical University of Graz (Graz,
      Austria). Patients: Twenty consecutive patients undergoing first hemodialysis are enrolled at
      Medical University of Graz, Haemodialysis Unit. Agitated patients or patients who fell asleep
      during the recording are excluded from the final analysis.

      During the first dialysis session of approximately 3 h, patients were observed for signs of
      disequilibrium; headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, if they become obtunded, have visual
      impairments or cramps. Accordingly patients were divided into 2 groups; the &quot;DDS group&quot; of
      patients who experienced one of the DDS symptoms of headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting,
      become obtunded, have visual impairments or cramps and patients who do not experience any of
      the DDS symptoms in the &quot;non-DDS group&quot; An assigned nephrologist will assess the physical and
      mental status of the patients.
