    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the side effects and efficacy of using Laser
      Interstitial Thermotherapy (LITT) combined with Pembrolizumab. LITT is a minimally invasive
      surgical technique that uses a laser to heat brain tumors.

      Pembrolizumab is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by helping participants'
      immune system work correctly to detect and fight cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is experimental
      because it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for this use, though it
      is approved to treat other cancers.

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Phase I: To determine the optimal timing for combining LITT and pembrolizumab in
           patients with rGBM:

           • To determine the feasibility, safety, tolerability and side effect profiles for
           combining LITT and pembrolizumab at various time points pre-LITT vs. post-LITT (Phase
           I).

        2. Phase II: To estimate the response to pembrolizumab combined with LITT in patients with
           rGBM;

           • To estimate the response rate after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in
           patients with rGBM (Phase II).

        3. To collect and record the side effect profiles for combining LITT and pembrolizumab
           (Phase I and Phase II).

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on systemic immune microenvironment in patients
           with rGBM.

        2. To determine the effect of pembrolizumab on the intra-tumoral immunosuppressive
           microenvironment within rGBM.

        3. Secondary for Phase II, to estimate progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival
           (OS) after treatment with LITT combined with pembrolizumab in patients with rGBM (Phase
           II).

        4. Measure radiological response using both conventional RANO criterion, a modified RANO
           (RANOi) designed specifically for immunotherapy response assessment, as well as MRI
           fingerprinting (MRF), recently demonstrated by the PI and collaborators to accurately
           and precisely distinguish recurrent GBM from radiation injury.

        5. Correlate clinical and radiological response to known biomarkers of GBM such as
           Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1) mutations, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 2 (IDH-2)
           mutations, Methyl-Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) promoter methylation, Phosphatase
           and tensin homologue (PTEN) loss and KI-67.

      Study Design:

      The Phase I component will involve up to two of a possible 3 cohorts of 3-4 patients each for
      a total of 6-8 evaluable patients. Each patient will undergo a stereotactic biopsy. If GBM or
      Gliosarcoma is confirmed by frozen section, patients will undergo LITT then treatment with
      200 mg pembrolizumab IV. Cohort I will receive pembrolizumab on post operative day 14 and
      every 3 weeks thereafter. In the event that one patient suffers non-hematologic toxicity of
      grade 3 or more, or if hematologic toxicity is grade 4 or higher, the investigators will
      delay the 2nd dose of pembrolizumab by 3 weeks and a 4th patient will be accrued. If there
      are two patients in the initial cohort with non-hematologic toxicities grade 3, or if
      hematological toxicity in two patients is grade 4 or higher, the second cohort will delay
      initiation of pembrolizumab until post operative day 35 after LITT. Conversely, if there are
      no non-hematologic adverse events (AEs) of grade 3 or higher, the investigators will proceed
      to cohort IB using the same dose of pembrolizumab given 7 days prior to surgery, then every 3
      weeks. Similarly, feasibility and safety will be addressed as above in deciding whether or
      not to proceed to the next cohort.

      The Phase II component of the study will consist of additional patients receiving
      pembrolizumab at the earliest tolerated time post LITT:

        -  14 days post-op

        -  -7 days pre-op;

        -  35 days post-opto achieve a total of 23 evaluable patients at the earliest tolerated
           dose.

                  Control and Prevention (CDC) definition; note, however, that HIV testing is not
                  required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with AIDS
                  from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol
                  may be significantly immunosuppressive and worsen the patient's HIV symptoms.

               -  Active connective tissue disorders, such as lupus or scleroderma, which in the
                  opinion of the treating physician may put the patient at high risk for
                  immunologic toxicity.

               -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of

                  might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive
                  treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include
                  but are not limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic
                  disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy,
                  Guillain-Barre syndrome or Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy,
                  myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as Systemic Lupus
                  Erythematosus, connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel
                  disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a
                  history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or
                  phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or
                  exacerbation of disease.

               -  Of note, patients with vitiligo, endocrine deficiencies including thyroiditis
                  managed with replacement hormones including physiologic corticosteroids are
                  eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjögren's
                  syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication and patients with
                  positive serology, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies
                  should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential
                  need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible.

               -  Any other major medical illnesses or psychiatric impairments that in the
                  investigator's opinion will prevent administration or completion of protocol
                  therapy.

               -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active
                  treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell
                  carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ
                  cervical cancer.

               -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
                  meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate
                  provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least
                  four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms
                  have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain
                  metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial
                  treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is
                  excluded regardless of clinical stability.

               -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
                  years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.
