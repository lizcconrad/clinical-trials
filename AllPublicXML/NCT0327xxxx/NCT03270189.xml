  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical dystonia occurring only during the writing task is a rare form for which there is no
      established treatment. Many authors agree that alteration of sensory integration is
      associated with dystonia. Similar disturbances in the integration of oculomotor information
      could have a role in cervical dystonia forms involving visuo-cervico-manual coordination such
      as handwriting. We hypothesize that orthoptic treatment by wearing prisms when writing (i)
      will reduce the abnormal posture of the head occurring whilst writing and remove the
      associated nuchal pain; (ii) the correction after a period of systematic wearing of the
      prisms during handwriting tasks will have a sustainable effect allowing to keep a normal head
      position after the suppression of the prisms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Case

          -  Presenting a cervical dystonia that occurs only during handwriting tasks, diagnosed by
             a neurologist specialised in movement disorders

          -  Being treated or not by injection of Botulinum Neurotoxin (but last injection &gt; 3
             months before the initial assessment)

        Control

          -  No cervical dystonia

          -  Same sex, age (Â± 5 years), socio-professional level and hand laterality as the cases

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Case

          -  Cervical dystonia occuring in other circumstances than handwriting

          -  Neurological disease other than cervical dystonia (e.g. Parkinson's syndrome)

          -  Pain, trauma or pathology of the cervical spine of another cause than cervical
             dystonia and which have required medical or surgical treatment in the last 6 months
             preceding the initial assessment

        Control

          -  Cervical disorders requiring medical or surgical treatment in the last 6 months prior
             to the tests
