  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of S 95005 in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are refractory or intolerant to standard chemotherapies in terms
      of Progression-Free Survival rate at 2 months in the Russian population.

The treatment is given until unacceptable toxicity according to the investigator, disease progression or patient withdrawal. If a patient discontinues study treatment for reasons other than radiologic disease progression (e.g., intolerable side effects), patients will be followed for tumour response until radiologic disease progression or initiation of new anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first).</description>
