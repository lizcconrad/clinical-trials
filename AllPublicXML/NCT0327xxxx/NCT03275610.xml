  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to uncover potential genetic determinants of pulmonary embolism (PE). Our
      translational goal is to ultimately identify certain genetic markers that will allow us to
      stratify patients in terms of their PE risk post total knee or total hip arthroplasty. The
      clinical implications for this study would allow for better patient care by lowering the risk
      of post-operative bleeding while still preventing symptomatic PEs and deep vein thromboses
      (DVTs). We look to sample patients who have a history of PE after undergoing total knee or
      total hip arthroplasty. We will sample these patients' blood DNA for a set of DNA genetic
      markers. To do so, we will utilize the Taqman assay, which is a PCR-based 5'-nuclease allelic
      discrimination assay to determine single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes at specified
      loci. The region flanking the SNP is amplified using two allele-specific fluorescent probes,
      allowing for the detection of each allele in a single tube. Using this assay, there is no
      post-PCR processing because the probes are included in the PCR reaction (Hui). Using this
      approach, we will measure the frequency of genetic mutations in patients who have developed a
      PE after a total joint arthroplasty. This data would then be used to perform a prospective
      study to determine a subset of genetic markers that can definitively be used to risk stratify
      patients.
