  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase I, single centre, randomised, open-label, 2-period ascending dose incomplete block,
      cross-over study to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and tolerability of single
      and multiple twice daily doses of inhaled Aclidinium Bromide in healthy Chinese male and
      female subjects.

      Screening will be performed within 21 days of dosing on Day 1. Eligible participants will be
      admitted to the trial center on Day -1.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three possible treatment sequences,
      according to a randomisation schedule in a (1:1:1) ratio (6 in each sequence). Subjects will
      receive 2 of the 3 treatments to be tested (twice-daily Aclidinium Bromide 200 μg, Aclidinium
      Bromide 400 μg or Aclidinium Bromide 800 μg) in an ascending dose manner, each within a
      separate treatment period. The treatment in each period will consist of a single dose of
      Aclidinium Bromide followed by a 72 hour wash out period and then the same treatment will be
      administered for five consecutive days (on the last day, only the morning dose will be
      administered). There will be a 7-day wash out period between both treatment periods.

      From Day 1 through Day 10 at Visit 2, and from Day 15 to Day 24 at Visit 3 safety
      measurements (blood pressure, 12-lead ECG; and AE monitoring) and blood samples for PK
      assessments will be collected at predetermined time points. Clinical laboratory tests
      (haematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis) will be performed under fasting conditions
      at Day -1 at Visit 2, Day 14 at Visit 3 and 48 hours after last IP administration in each
      period.

      A follow-up visit will be performed within 5 days of the final PK sample collection on Day
      24.
