  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot disease is a global health problem. Diabetes affects over 450million people
      worldwide, expected to rise to 1 in 10 people by 2040. 60-70% will lose sensation in their
      feet and up to 25% will develop a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU - a wound on the foot). More than
      half of DFUs become infected requiring hospitalisation and 20% of infections result in
      amputations contributing to 80% of non-traumatic amputations performed in the developed
      world. DFUs cost the NHS £1billion in financial year 2014-15.

      A diabetic foot ulcer is a form of chronic wound. Chronic wounds are wounds that fail to
      progress through the normal phases of wound healing in an orderly and timely manner and
      become hard to heal. Almost all chronic wounds are known to have bacteria within and this is
      termed colonisation. Wounds can progress from being colonised to becoming infected. The
      concentration of bacteria can predict delayed healing or infection.

      This study aims to use a novel hand held device, Moleculight i:X™, in a pilot study to
      investigate the clinical effectiveness and decision making associated with its use in the
      assessment of DFUs. Moleculight i:X™ is a hand held device that emits violet blue light. By
      controlling distance from the wound and ambient light, Moleculight i:X™ identifies bacteria
      above a pre-determined concentration by identifying natural fluorescence in the bacteria cell
      wall.

      Patients attending a specialist DFU clinic will be screened and if eligible and consenting
      will be recruited. Patients will be randomised into two groups; those who receive treatments
      as usual (TAU) alone (in line with NICE guidelines) and those that receive TAU plus
      Moleculight i:X™ imaging. The main objective is to describe the proportion per group with
      healed DFUs at 12week follow up in these two comparable groups of 30 patients each.
