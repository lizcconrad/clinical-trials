  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of 12-week yoga training on blood
      pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, and total peripheral
      resistance during rest and psychological stress in patients with hypertension. All eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to either yoga (n=40) or usual care control (n=40)
      group. During the 1st lab visit, the experimenter will explain the purpose and procedures of
      the study. If the participants understand and agree to participate in this study, they will
      be asked to sign the informed consent. Next, participants will fill out questionnaires,
      including demographic information, Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, perceived
      stress scale, anxiety inventory, exercise behavior questionnaire, and quality of life scale.
      Participant's resting blood pressure will be measured. Participants will then be instructed
      to relax in a supine position for 15 minutes while ECG is recording. Next, participants will
      perform 5 minutes of stroop task and 5 minutes of mental arithmetic task (mental stressors).
      ECG and cardiac output will be monitored throughout the whole session. After the stress
      period, participants will be asked to relax until heart rate becomes stable and return to
      baseline. The participants will perform the sit-and-reach test. After completing all the
      baseline testing, the yoga group will begin the training program which is 60 minutes per
      session, 2 times per week for 12 weeks. The control group will be asked not to participate in
      any exercise program during the course of the study. Participants will be filling out the
      same questionnaires and receive measures of blood pressure, ECG, and cardiac output at week 6
      and week 12. Additionally, participants will perform the stress tasks and the sit-and-reach
      test again at week 12.

    <description>The hatha yoga program will be led by an experienced yoga instructor. Each 60 minutes session will consist of 10 minutes of breathing exercises (pranayama), 40 minutes of yoga pose practice (asana), and 10 minutes of supine meditation/relaxation (savasana). Yoga props, such as blocks and belts, will be used in accordance to each participant's particular body type and needs to help he/she achieve precise yoga postures safely and comfortably. The yoga poses are chosen for providing a restorative session and based on their purported relationship to restorative effects. Participants will be instructed to maintain their concentration and breath control at all times during the yoga session.</description>
