      This study focused on evaluating the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet
      during pregnancy and offspring longitudinal body mass index trajectories and cardiometabolic
      risk in early-childhood. This study is part of a secondary data analysis of the INMA
      (INfancia y Medio Ambiente—(Environment and Childhood)) Project.

        The study included pregnant women recruited between 2003 and 2008 in the four Spanish
        regions of Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell and Valencia as part of the population-based INMA
        (&quot;INfancia y Medio Ambiente&quot;) birth cohort study. The pregnant women were recruited during
        prenatal visits in the 1st trimester of pregnancy at public health care centers or
        hospitals. Mothers were afterwards followed at 3rd trimester, and their children later, and
        at ages 6 months, 1 and 4 years.
