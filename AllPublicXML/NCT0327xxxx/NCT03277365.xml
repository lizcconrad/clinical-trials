  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many conditions affecting health are caused by a combination of environment, behaviors, and
      genes. While individuals can alter some factors in their lives to reduce the chances of
      developing different diseases (e.g., not smoking cigarettes), the contribution from genetic
      risk encoded by DNA remains with people throughout their lives. Scientists are still trying
      to determine the entirety of genetic factors that influence disease, but for some conditions
      it has been shown that the factors identified thus far can begin to identify people at high
      to low genetic risk. Looking across the genome, scientists can calculate a cumulative genetic
      risk score - which can be used to rank genetic risk compared to other worldwide populations.

      The goal of this study is to determine how genetic risk influences health decisions and other
      things that can be controlled in life. The first genetic risk score is calculated for
      coronary heart disease (CAD). CAD ultimately leads to heart attacks, heart failure and
      sometimes sudden cardiac death and is the main reason heart disease remains as the number one
      cause of death worldwide. Other researchers have shown that this genetic risk score can be
      used to identify people with low, intermediate, and high risk for coronary heart disease. It
      has also been shown that the use of statins (cholesterol lowering drugs) provides greater
      benefit and protection against heart attack for people with high genetic risk for coronary
      artery disease.

      Leveraging the Apple ResearchKit and the ResearchKit linked 23andMe API, customers of 23andMe
      are able to provide researchers access to their genomic data. Participants will use the
      ResearchKit app to provide consent, view study information, answer surveys, and contact the
      study team.

      Participants will be asked to complete 3 surveys. One before viewing genetic risk scores, one
      immediately after viewing scores, and one 6 months after viewing scores.
