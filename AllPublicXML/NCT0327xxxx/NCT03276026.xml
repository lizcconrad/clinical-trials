  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will track bariatric patients who received sugammadex versus neostigmine in
      the post anesthesia care unit until discharge and assess their length of stay and possible
      nausea / vomiting / hypoxia episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During their preadmission testing, patients planning to undergo sleeve gastrectomy bariatric
      surgeries will be consented (by having them sign consent forms) and recruited for the study.
      A trained individual will track these patients after the surgery in the post anesthesia care
      unit until discharge and assess their length of stay and possible nausea / vomiting. The
      exact time the investigators are looking to assess is patient arrival to the post anesthesia
      care unit until patient ready for discharge when the anesthesiologist writes the anesthesia
      evaluation. The time the reversal agent is administered during the start of skin closure
      until patient medically ready to leave the post anesthesia care unit will also be taken into
      account. Blinded to the treatment group, the trained individual will ask each patient every
      15 minutes after arrival to the post anesthesia care unit if they are experiencing nausea or
      vomiting. As an exploratory measure, the trained individual will assess the patient at these
      same times (every 15 minutes) and determine their oxygen saturation. The investigators will
      take all the data from the observations and use statistical means to measure what is
      significant. A discussion and conclusion will follow. Finally, the principal investigator
      will submit the study outcomes to an anesthesia journal.
