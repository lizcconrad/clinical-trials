  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many post-operative complications arise from patients who breathe inadequately. Inadequate
      respiration, whether the result of surgery or the anesthesia, causes a decrease in blood
      oxygen saturation and an increase in carbon dioxide partial pressure. Both of these surrogate
      measurements of respiration may pose a challenge to measure. Some administer exogenous oxygen
      to all patients as they leave the operating room in order to maintain the blood oxygen
      saturation. This renders the oximeter a less sensitive metric of depressed respiration. In
      the face of decreased respiration, the carbon dioxide levels continue to increase slowly and
      often go undetected unless blood gases are measured. Indeed carbon dioxide blood levels are
      the only metric to detect inadequate ventilation using this surrogate index.

      Monitoring ventilation is a serious challenge outside of critical care settings. In fact,
      there are no monitors available that can measure tidal volume or relative tidal volume
      outside of these settings.

      Linshom is a novel instrument that tracks relative respiration by measuring the excursions of
      the temperature swings between inspiration and expiration and normalizing them to the
      patient's breathing. This monitor may be the first non-invasive monitor to measure relative
      tidal volume in non-critical care settings.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a non-invasive, temperature-based
      respiratory instrument can track tidal volume (Vt) in patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that the Linshom device can accurately and consistently track
      tidal volume as measured by closed loop mechanical ventilator.

      Forty volunteers will be enrolled in this open label, prospective study to determine the
      correlation between the tidal volumes measured with the Linshom detector and those measured
      with the mechanical ventilator. after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and written
      informed consent from the volunteers.

      The Linshom detector, which is comprised of two rapid responding medical-grade thermistors in
      close proximity to the mouth/nose (sensor) and a thermistor remote to the airway, will be
      mounted in the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) face mask to measure the
      temperature during breathing. The CPAP will be connected to a Servo-I ventilator (Maquet)
      with a circuit and disposable filter. The volunteers will be instructed to breathe normal
      through the CPAP mask on room air. The excursions of the thermistor tracings (from valley to
      peak) will be recorded by the Linshom device and displayed continuously on a laptop monitor
      in a waveform. The tidal volume will also be measured by the ventilator and the data
      downloaded in a Compact Flash card. The temperature profiles from the sensors and the
      relative tidal volume will be correlated with the tidal volumes measured by the ventilator.
