  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research is to evaluate an intervention focused on increasing latrine
      use in rural Odisha India. The present study builds off of previous research, which resulted
      in the design of an intervention to increase latrine use. This research evaluates the
      intervention designed to determine if significant increases in latrine use are observed among
      those who received the intervention compared to those that did not. Qualitative research will
      supplement trial data collection to help explain findings and understand perceptions of the
      intervention.

      The objective of this research is to evaluate an intervention focused on increasing latrine
      use in rural Odisha India. The present study builds off of previous research, which resulted
      in the design of an intervention to increase latrine use. This research evaluates the
      intervention designed to determine if significant increases in latrine use are observed among
      those who received the intervention compared to those that did not. Qualitative research will
      supplement trial data collection to help explain findings and understand perceptions of the
      intervention.

      For trial data collection, household members will be engaged in a survey that asks questions
      about the household, the latrine use practices of their family members, and may include
      additional questions about social norms attitudes, and other factors influencing latrine use.

      Investigators will carry out two discrete qualitative research activities both digitally
      recorded: in depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs). Topics to be covered
      during the qualitative research include: perceptions of the intervention, reasons for
      using/not using latrines, motivations for sanitation behaviors.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate a multi-level, theoretically informed
      intervention designed to increase latrine use for defecation among all members of households
      that currently own a latrine.

Transect Walk: village walk to identify and mark feces in community;
Community meetings: sex-segregated meetings with village members to decide on an action plan to increase community cleanliness/reduce open defecation;
Wall painting: village map noting households that use latrines always.
Sub-Community level:
Mothers meeting: For caregivers with children under age 5, to provide knowledge of and hardware for safe child feces disposal.
Household Level:
Household visits: to those with latrines to motivate use;
Latrine repairs: for households with non-functional latrines to make functional.</description>

    <description>For villages receiving the intervention package, investigators will engage community members through qualitative interviews to gain their perception of the intervention, what they thought of the intervention activities, what information they recall, what aspects they enjoyed or disliked, if they had barriers to attendance or participation.
For the three villages not receiving the intervention, investigators will conduct qualitative interviews to determine additional barriers and determinants of latrine use to identify other potential intervention strategies.</description>
