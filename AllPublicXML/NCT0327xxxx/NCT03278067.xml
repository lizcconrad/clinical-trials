  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study, to be conducted in the 2017/2018 influenza season, is a safety surveillance
      study using passive surveillance enhanced with a reporting card system to report adverse
      events of interest (AEIs) after Flu vaccination.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the third pilot study following, EPI-FLU-045 VS UK [NCT02567721] and EPI-FLU-046 VS
      UK [NCT02893878] studies, carried out in the 2 previous influenza seasons (2015/2016 and
      2016/2017). This study will collect data about vaccination status and adverse events
      following influenza immunisation (AEFI) on a weekly basis, from 01 September 2017 onwards,
      using a customized Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Cards and data from Electronic Health Records
      system for a period of approximately 13 weeks.
