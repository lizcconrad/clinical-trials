      This study is an open-label, single-center, randomized, comparative phase IV clinical trial.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant
      administration of EV71 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac (Beijing) Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd.
      with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine/Group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine. 780
      healthy infants of 6 months old as participants are randomly assigned into three experimental
      groups in the ratio 1:1:1. The group I receive EV71 Vaccine (first dose)&amp; recombinant
      hepatitis B vaccine on day 0 and EV71 vaccine (second dose)&amp; Group A meningococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine on day 30. The group II receive recombinant hepatitis B vaccine on day
      0 and Group A meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine on day 30. The group III receive the first
      and second dose of EV71 Vaccine on day 0 and day 30 respectively.
