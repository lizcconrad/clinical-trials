    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study &quot;Usability and Ergonomic Evaluation of Self-Positioning System for
      Retinal Imaging&quot; is to enable self-operation of a monitoring device in home-simulated
      environment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the main challenges in developing a retinal imager is to design it to be self-operated
      by elderly patients in their home setting The study's objective is to explore ergonomic
      solutions that will allow the user to perform imaging on their own. The study will be done in
      a home-simulated environment using a dedicated ergonomic system (termed &quot;PAF&quot; - Positioning
      And Fixation system) that stimulates the retinal imager and enables to record the tested
      subject using standard cameras. The prototype doesn't include the retinal imager and does not
      include any imaging capabilities aside from standard means of photography Subjects will be
      evaluating for positioning accuracy and comfort by comparing different methods. Pupil
      position will be recorded using commercial off the shelf cameras when the subject is
      performing simple ergonomic tasks while looking at a screen presenting images.

    <description>Up to 60 Subjects will be evaluating for positioning accuracy and comfort by comparing different methods utilizing the PAF device. Some methods of positioning will be applied and compare for each usability factor X, Y, Z location, and fixation.
The patient will be evaluated before pupil dilation. VA and ophthalmic diagnoses will be recorded.
Pupil position will be recorded using 3 commercial off the shelf cameras when the subject is performing simple ergonomic tasks while looking at a screen presenting images. Each testing session will be limited 20 min long. Subjects will be able to rest within the testing session if required. Total session time per patient will not exceed 30 minutes.</description>
