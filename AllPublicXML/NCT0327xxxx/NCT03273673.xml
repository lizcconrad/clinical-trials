  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACL injuries are common among athletes and due to residual muscle weakness, limited knee
      motion and asymmetrical movement patterns after surgery many of these athletes will sustain
      secondary ACL injuries following return to sports. This project seeks to determine if a novel
      biofeedback-based rehabilitation approach can decrease a known risk factor for secondary
      injuries to the ACL. The project specifically focuses on correcting asymmetric movement
      patterns, a known risk factor for secondary injury that is not directly addressed by existing
      interventions through a 6 week therapy based biofeedback intervention.

    <description>The 6-week biofeedback training program is focused on altering loading and movement asymmetry during biweekly sessions on non-consecutive days (12 sessions). The biofeedback training program will provide sensory (visual and tactile) feedback to the subject to heighten awareness of asymmetrical movement strategies (e.g. load shift, movement asymmetry) during a squat. The two exercises that will be completed during the biofeedback training program will be a visual feedback squat and a resisted squat (tactile feedback). Each of these tasks will be completed 30 (3 sets of 10 repetitions) times per session. We will provide a 20 second rest between trials, and a 10 minute break between the visual and tactile feedback exercises to decrease the effect of fatigue.</description>

    <description>The 6-week attention control group program will focus on providing educational information to the participants related to the clinical and sports expectations as they are released to return to sport. These participants will be asked to meet 6 times during the 6-week intervention time period. Three of these visits will be completed in person and three will be completed using an online educational module (6 sessions). The online sessions will be completed in week 1, week 3, and week 5 while the in person sessions will be completed during week 2, week 4, and week 6.</description>
