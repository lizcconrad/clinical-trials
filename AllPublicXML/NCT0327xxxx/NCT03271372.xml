  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well avelumab works in treating patients with
      Merkel cell cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes and have undergone surgery with or
      without radiation therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may stimulate the immune
      system and interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the clinical activity of adjuvant avelumab to that of placebo, as determined by
      relapse-free survival in subjects with clinically detected nodal metastases from Merkel cell
      carcinoma (MCC) after definitive therapy (surgery with/without adjuvant radiation therapy
      [RT]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine whether post-operative adjuvant therapy with avelumab improves overall survival
      (OS) as compared to placebo.

      II. To examine whether post-operative adjuvant therapy with avelumab improves distant
      metastases-free survival (DMFS) as compared to placebo.

      III. To assess whether post-operative adjuvant therapy with avelumab improves
      disease-specific survival (DSS) as compared to placebo.

      IV. To assess the safety and tolerability of avelumab in the adjuvant setting.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore predictive biomarkers in tissue and peripheral blood for immunogenicity of
      avelumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive avelumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once every 15 days for the
      first 120 days (Induction Phase 1), once every 30 days for the next 120 days (Induction Phase
      2), and then once every 120 days (Maintenance Phase) for a maximum of 720 days (approximately
      24 months or 2 years total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IV over 1 hour once every 15 days for the first 120 days
      (Induction Phase 1), once every 30 days for the next 120 days (Induction Phase 2), and then
      once every 120 days (Maintenance Phase) for a maximum of 720 days (approximately 24 months or
      2 years total) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years for
      a minimum of 5 years from study treatment initiation.

             laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make
             the patient inappropriate for entry into this study

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
