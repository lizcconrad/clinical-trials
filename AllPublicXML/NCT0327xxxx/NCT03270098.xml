      People with schizophrenia display a broad range of cognitive impairments that have been
      identified as major determinants of poor functioning and disability. The goal of the proposed
      study is to examine the impact of exercise training on cognition, daily functioning, and
      biomarkers of cognitive change in people with schizophrenia.

      The goal of the proposed study is to examine the impact of exercise training on cognitive
      functioning in people with schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia display a broad range of
      cognitive impairments that have been identified as major determinants of poor functional
      outcome and disability, thus representing an important public health concern and a target for
      interventions. At present, available treatments offer only minimal to limited benefits to
      ameliorate these deficits. Extensive animal and human research literatures converge in
      supporting the positive influence of aerobic exercise training on cognitive functioning.
      Preliminary data indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective in improving cognitive
      functioning in people with schizophrenia. However, previous studies employed small samples,
      focused on a single or limited range of cognitive domains, and/or collected insufficient
      information on daily functioning or putative biomarkers underlying cognitive change.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The UPSA is performance-based measure of real-world daily functioning abilities. Participants receive scores for multiple domains, which are summed to create a summary score ranging from 0 to 100 with higher score indicating better overall functioning.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SCoRS is a 20-item clinician-administered interview assessing cognition-related daily functioning. Each item rated on a 4-point scale ranging from &quot;no impairment&quot; to &quot;severe impairment&quot;. Total scores range from 20-80, with higher score indicating poorer functioning.
