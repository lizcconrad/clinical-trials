  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and prevalent joint disorder with great impact on quality of
      life and high economic burden. Although a number of conservative therapies have proven to be
      effective for the management of hand OA, only modest treatment effects were reported for most
      individual interventions. The aim of the proposed study is to assess the effect of laser
      therapy on pain, function and force in patients with carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC OA).

      A randomized, controlled, single-center, double-blind, clinical trial, with 1:1 allocation
      ratio, were carried out involving patients diagnosis of CMC joint OA grade 1-2 (aged 18 years
      and above). Both assessor and statistician remained blinded. The research diagnostic criteria
      for carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis was used to assess all individuals who agree to
      participate. All participants were submitted to a clinical examination and X-ray assessment
      of thumb base to determine carpometacarpal osteoarthritis grade. Based on the clinical and
      radiological findings, the participants were classified by a rheumatology. Those with CMC OA
      grade 2-3 were included in the study. The experimental group received laser therapy and
      control group received a placebo treatment.

      The primary outcome measures was pain scores during daily living activities (DLA)- at the
      base of the thumb measured with VAS (Unidimensional measure of pain: 0-10 (0, no pain and 10,
      worst pain), and changes in hand function measured using the Quick-Dash questionnaire.
      Secondary outcome measures included changes in pinch strength. All outcome measures were
      collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks
      following the end of the intervention.

    <description>VAS has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument for pain assessment which is used frequently for clinical and research purposes. It consists of a 10-cm line anchored at each end. The left-hand anchor reads 'no pain' and the right-hand anchor reads 'worst possible pain'; the patients marked a line to represent their pain level.
