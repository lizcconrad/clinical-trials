  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Right ventricular dysfunction is the worst mortality predictor in pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH). Recent study has described that approximately 25% of PAH patients will
      developed into right ventricular failure despite therapeutic reduction of pulmonary vascular
      resistance. Subsequently, several studies have shown that fatty acid accumulation in right
      ventricle was inversely correlated with right ventricular function in PAH patients. Several
      PAH animal studies have revealed that metabolic glucose oxidation impairment through
      increased aerobic glycolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lipotoxicity play significant
      role in right ventricular failure. Moreover, several pulmonary hypertension animal studies
      have demonstrated the benefit of partial fatty acid inhibitor such as trimetazidine on right
      ventricle function. It was hypothesize that trimetazidine improved right ventricular function
      through indirect effect of increased glucose oxidation by blocking the Randle cycle.
      Therefore, we hypothesize that trimetazidine can improve right ventricular function in
      pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.
