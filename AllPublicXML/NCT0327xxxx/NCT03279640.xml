  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) or transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) has been used for the modulation of stroke patients' motor function by
      altering the cortical excitability. Recently, more challenging approaches, such as
      stimulation of two or more sites or use of dual modality have been studied in stroke
      patients. In this study, simultaneous stimulation using both rTMS and tDCS (dual-mode
      stimulation) over bilateral primary motor cortices (M1s) was investigated to compare its
      modulatory effects with single rTMS stimulation in subacute stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators assessed each patient's motor function using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)
      score and acquired their resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data at two times: prior to stimulation
      and 2 months after stimulation. Changes in rs-fMRI network measures were investigated between
      groups.

10 Hz of rTMS was applied over the ipsilesional M1 for 20 minutes with simultaneous application of cathodal tDCS on the contralesional M1.
Each participant's total FMA score is assessed and their resting-state fMRI data at two times: prior to stimulation (pre-stimulation) and 2 months after stimulation (post-stimulation) are acquired.</description>
