  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and cause significant
      distress and decreased quality of life. A high rate of non-declaration of NMS by patients
      means that many NMS remain unrecognized and untreated, even in specialist clinical services.
      In phase one of this research qualitative interviews (phase 1) were guided by the Theoretical
      Domains Framework and used to identify the barriers for help-seeking. A quantitative
      questionnaire survey (phase 2) examined the significance of these barriers to help seeking.
      The present study aims to develop (phase 3) and test the feasibility (phase 4) of a targeted
      behavioural intervention of barriers which were identified in phases 1 and 2 which prevent
      help-seeking for NMS in patients with PD. As with phases 1 and 2, the feasibility trial will
      include people with unreported burdensome NMS, who have not reported them to their PD
      consultant or nurse. The intervention has been co-designed by people affected by Parkinson's
      and targets the barriers identified in the previous phases of the research. In phase three of
      the research, 'think-aloud' interviews will be used to further develop the intervention so
      that it is acceptable and easy to use. In the final phase, a feasibility trial will be
      conducted to examine efficacy of the intervention for increasing help-seeking for undeclared
      NMS. The study has implications for using a theoretically driven behavioural intervention to
      promote help-seeking for NMS and ultimately increase receipt of clinical care for NMS among
      patients with PD.

        -Participants diagnosed with idiopathic PD will be recruited through outpatient neurology
        clinics and via the Parkinson's UK research network. Participants experiencing burdensome
        undisclosed non-motor symptoms will be recruited into the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's

          -  Access to a computer and internet connection

          -  Experiencing at least one unreported non-motor symptom

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of sensory loss or communication difficulty (including inadequate command of
             English) sufficient to interfere with the assessments.

          -  Severe cognitive impairment that would make participation in the intervention
             problematic or distressing. This will be assessed using the Telephone Interview for
             Cognitive Status-Modified (TICS-M, Brandt et al., 1993). People with a score of less
             than 20 will be excluded.
