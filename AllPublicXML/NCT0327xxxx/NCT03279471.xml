  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40%-80% of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms. These symptoms are associated with increased social
      deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children
      and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby
      missing opportunities to learn important new skills. However, there is a lack of clarity
      about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. There is also little known about how
      anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). The goal of this study
      is to investigate these issues in order to make interventions more precise, more
      personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes

      While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do
      about this problem is less clear. Multiple small trials have provided promising evidence that
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might
      reduce anxiety in those with ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. In this study we
      will conduct a study in children with ASD and clinically significant anxiety ages 8-12 to
      compare efficacy of these different treatment types.

      Approximately 40%-80% of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit
      clinically significant anxiety symptoms. These symptoms are associated with increased social
      deficits, depression, irritability, and stereotyped and self-injurious behaviors. Children
      and adolescents with anxiety also frequently avoid potentially stressful situations, thereby
      missing opportunities to learn important new skills. Despite the significant consequences of
      anxiety symptoms, several critical treatment-relevant issues remain unresolved. First, there
      is a lack of clarity about how to differentiate ASD and anxiety symptoms. Second, little is
      known about how anxiety manifests in those with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). Third,
      the neural substrates of anxiety in ASD are poorly understood. The overarching goal of this
      project is to investigate these open issues in order to make interventions more precise, more
      personalized, and more likely to promote positive outcomes -- an objective consistent with
      the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Roadmap, Precision Medicine, and Research Domain
      Criteria Project (RDoC) Initiatives and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC)
      Strategic Plan, Chapter 4.

      While there is no doubt that anxiety is a very serious issue for those with ASD, what to do
      about this problem is less clear. The search for empirically-validated treatments has begun
      with multiple small trials providing promising evidence that selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) might reduce anxiety in those with
      ASD. However, this work is in its early stages. There is a great need for large, rigorously
      designed trials that validate the effectiveness of both medication and CBT, as well as
      functional neuroimaging studies that identify neural predictors of treatment efficacy and
      markers of therapy-induced change. Such work holds the potential to help answer the questions
      posed above and to assist the field in developing more personalized treatments. In Project 1
      of the Center for the Development of Phenotype-Based Treatments of Autism Spectrum Disorder,
      we leverage the large, well-characterized UC Davis MIND Institute Autism Phenome Project
      (APP) cohort to conduct a comparative efficacy trial in N=132 participants (ages 8-12 years)
      with ASD and clinically significant anxiety.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Outpatient boys and girls with ASD between ages 8-12 years at consent.

          2. Meets criteria for a diagnosis of ASD.

          3. Meets criteria for clinically significant anxiety symptoms as defined by a minimum
             score of 14 on the PARS Severity Scale.

          4. The child has a Full Scale and Verbal Comprehension IQ greater than 50 as assessed on
             the Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence.

          5. Subjects with co-morbid depression, tic disorder or disruptive behavior disorders will
             be acceptable as long as the anxiety symptoms are considered the primary mental health
             problem (i.e., most impairing/distressing). (a) Eligibility will be guided by the
             following principle: For subjects presenting with comorbid symptomology, the co-morbid
             conditions cannot be sufficiently severe to: 1) warrant immediate treatment or require
             a change in an otherwise stable psychosocial treatment regimen for that disorder, or
             2) potentially interfere with the child's ability to comply with the study assessment
             and treatment batteries. (b) Preliminary determination of acceptable eligibility will
             be made by the PI with consultation with clinical co-Investigators on the project. (c)
             Finally, each potential subject will be presented and discussed at weekly team
             meetings.

          6. The use of stable stimulant or alpha-agonist medications will be allowed if the dose
             has been consistent for 8 weeks and the family and treating psychiatrist affirm there
             is no plan to alter the dose or change medication in the foreseeable future.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Receiving concurrent psychotherapy, social skills training that include homework, or
             behavioral interventions (e.g., applied behavior analysis). Families will have the
             option of discontinuing such services to enroll in the study. Other non-medication
             interventions will be allowed but we will document type and dose. This includes
             academic tutoring, occupational therapy, speech therapy, school counseling that is no
             more than 60 minutes per week in duration, school aides, and social skills training
             groups that do not include homework and are no more than 60 minutes/week in duration.
             Families of youth with ASD often have a variety of adjunctive services of this nature
             that they do not want to give up, and given the limited documentation of the efficacy
             of such interventions for social and emotional outcomes, it is deemed important to
             permit families to retain them in the service of recruiting a representative sample.
             If a potential participant is receiving non-allowed psychosocial treatments
             (psychotherapy, social skills training with homework, ABA) at the time of the phone
             evaluation and wishes to discontinue these treatments to enter the study, the patient
             will be asked to discuss this option with their clinician to determine whether
             termination would be safe and in the child's best interest. In addition, we will
             obtain the patient's written consent to contact their treating clinician to determine
             the appropriateness of study participation. We will not influence the decision
             patients make with their clinician. If non-allowed psychosocial treatments are
             discontinued, Gate B assessments will not be conducted until 1 month following
             termination.

          2. Child has failed a previous trial of sertraline judged adequate in dose (100mg/daily)
             and duration (at least 6 weeks) or child has a history of intolerance to sertraline.
             Subject has failed two previous SSRI (other than sertraline) trials judged adequate in
             dose (of 30mg/daily citalopram or paroxetine; 20mg/daily of escitalopram; 20mg/daily
             fluoxetine, 100mg/daily of fluvoxamine) and duration (6 weeks).

          3. Biological Treatments: Recent treatment with psychotropic medication within 12 weeks
             of study entry for antidepressants and within 6 weeks for neuroleptics. No new
             alternative medications, nutritionals or therapeutic diets within 6 weeks of study
             enrollment.

          4. Established Treatment changes: Any change in medication dosage (e.g., stimulant, alpha
             agonist) within 8 weeks before study enrollment will result in exclusion from the
             study. Any medications (e.g., stimulant) that the child is on must remain stable
             during treatment. If a potential participant is taking non-allowed psychotropic
             medication (antidepressants, antipsychotics) at the time of the phone evaluation and
             wishes to discontinue this medication to enter the study, the patient will be asked to
             discuss this option with their prescribing physician to determine whether medication
             discontinuation would be safe and in the child's best interest. In addition, we will
             obtain the patient's written consent to contact their treating clinician to determine
             the appropriateness of study participation. We will not influence the decision
             patients make with their prescribing physician. All pharmacotherapy recommendations
             will be made in consultation with the study physician. As described in Exclusion
             criterion 3, a specified waiting period would be required before the Gate B assessment
             should patients choose to discontinue non-allowed medications to enter the study.

          5. Current clinically significant suicidality or (b) individuals who have engaged in
             suicidal behaviors within 6 months will be excluded and referred for appropriate
             clinical intervention.

          6. Child has failed an adequate trial of CBT for anxiety within the previous 2 years (at
             least 10 sessions over a period of less than 1 year conducted by a licensed provider
             of CBT). This will be determined through records review and speaking with the
             clinician if appropriate.

          7. Lifetime DSM-5 bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder as assessed
             by all forms of information (i.e., clinical history, data from the ADIS-IV, etc.).

          8. Child has a major neurological disorder or medical illness that requires a prohibited
             episodic or chronic systemic medication or that would interfere with study
             participation (e.g., frequent hospitalizations, frequent school absences).

          9. Child pregnancy as indicated by history or positive pregnancy test.

         10. Inability to safely swallow study mediation after pill swallowing education.

         11. Contraindications to MRI (i.e. claustrophobia, extreme sensitivity to noise, metal in
             the body).

         12. Excess motion during scanning even after 2-3 training sessions.
