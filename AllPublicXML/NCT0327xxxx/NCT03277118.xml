  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wireless wearable devices (WWD) have been shown to be an effective means to measure patient
      activity and sleep-wake cycles in the ICU. However, no current studies involving WWD have
      demonstrated the ability of these devices to measure adverse outcomes, including delirium in
      critically ill patients. This study is unique because the investigators will implement
      monitoring with the WWD prior to extubation in the ICU to correctly measure first
      mobilization, as well as capture quality of sleep and episodes of delirium for the first five
      postoperative days.

      In this single-center non-randomized prospective cohort study, cardiac surgical patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass will be enrolled consecutively with
      written informed consent from the time this protocol is approved by the IRB until 100
      subjects are enrolled (expected duration of subject enrollment is 12 months). Upon arrival
      into the ICU, cardiac surgery subjects will have a Fitbit Charge 2 device placed on their
      wrist and will wear the device until the fifth post-operative day. This device will
      wirelessly transmit data regarding activity and sleep quality to a smartphone application for
      the duration of wear. No identifiable patient information will be entered into the smartphone
      application or transmitted to any external entity.
