  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient self-matching (as compared with
      treatment as usual by expert matching) improves quality of life, retention, and outcome for
      patients being treated for alcohol problems.

      There are at least two good reasons for offering patients a choice when the goal is a change
      in their behavior. The first is that patients are likely to know what treatment works best
      for them. Secondly, being allowed to choose between options may increase compliance in
      treatment. As a randomized controlled trial, this study will compare the efficacy of patient
      self-matching versus treatment-as-usual expert matching.

      The Self-Match Study is expected to increase knowledge on the importance of involving the
      alcohol dependent patient in choosing what treatment method is best for him/her instead of
      having experts to do that. The investigators expect to discover patient involvement as a way
      to improve compliance in treatment, hence preventing that patients drop out of treatment to
      early. If this hypothesis proves to be right, clinicians will have a viable strategy for
      matching treatment methods to patients, since the strategy does not demand further resources
      in the treatment system.
