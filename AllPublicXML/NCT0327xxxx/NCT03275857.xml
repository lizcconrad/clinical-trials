  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that treatment with cisplatin will reverse emerging refractoriness to
      enzalutimide in patients with CRPC by affecting AR function.

    <measure>Toxicity observed with dosing differences of Cisplatin</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples and physical assessments will be conducted and reviewed to determine toxicity of treatment. Toxicity would be symptoms such as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) peripheral neuropathy or lab findings such as rise in creatinine, electrolyte abnormalities such as low magnesium.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer

          -  Age 18 yrs or older

          -  Able to provide written, informed consent

          -  Subjects who have received docetaxel for metastatic disease are eligible if absolute
             neutrophil count is greater than 100 and platelet count is greater than 100,000 and
             their bone marrow reserve is deemed to be adequate

          -  Subjects with castration resistant prostate cancer, as defined by having testosterone
             level of less than 50 Nano gram/dl, being treated with enzalutamide with a rise in
             PSA, confirmed with a repeat measurement within 1 to four weeks, or asymptomatic
             radiographic progression

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 50 ml/min

          -  Subjects with hearing impairment. The treating physician may decide which subjects
             should not receive cisplatin based on audiometry or based on clinical judgment.

          -  Subjects with grade 2 or greater neuropathy

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the treating physician could not tolerate the standard
             hydration before receiving cisplatin

          -  Chemotherapy na√Øve subjects who in the opinion of the treating physician should
             receive docetaxel instead of enrolling on the trial and receive cisplatin
