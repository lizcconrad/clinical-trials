  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1B/2 study to evaluate the safety and assess the
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of binimetinib administered in combination with nivolumab or
      nivolumab + ipilimumab in adult patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
      with microsatellite stable (MSS) disease and presence of a RAS mutation that have received at
      least one prior line of therapy and no more than 2 prior lines of therapy. The study contains
      a Phase 1b period to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) and schedule of binimetinib followed by a randomized Phase 2 period to assess the
      efficacy of the combinations.

        Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  Measurable, histologically/cytologically confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer
             (mCRC).

             laboratory testing of RAS mutation status and microsatellite stable (MSS).

               -  If a fresh tissue sample is provided, a blood sample is required.

          -  Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) categorized as microsatellite stable (MSS) by
             polymerase chain reaction (PCR) per local assay at any time prior to Screening or by
             the central laboratory.

          -  RAS mutation per local assay at any time prior to Screening or by the central
             laboratory.

          -  Have received at least 1 prior line of therapy and meets at least one of the following
             criteria:

               -  were unable to tolerate the prior first-line regimen

               -  experienced disease progression during or after prior first-line regimen for

                  Generally, treatments that are separated by an event of progression are
                  considered different regimens.

          -  Have received no more than 2 prior lines of therapy (maintenance therapy given in the
             metastatic setting will not be considered a separate regimen). Generally, treatments
             that are separated by an event of progression are considered different regimens.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, cardiac, kidney and liver function

          -  Able to take oral medications

             for at least 6 weeks, or must agree to take appropriate precautions to avoid pregnancy
             from screening through follow-up if of child-bearing potential

             potential must agree to follow instructions for acceptable or highly effective
             method(s) of contraception for the duration of study treatment and for 7 months after

             treatment:

          -  History of thromboembolic or cerebrovascular events ≤ 6 months prior to starting study
             treatment, including transient ischemic attacks, cerebrovascular accidents, deep vein
             thrombosis or pulmonary emboli.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as persistent systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mmHg or
             diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg despite current therapy.

          -  Concurrent neuromuscular disorder that is associated with the potential of elevated
             creatine kinase (CK) (e.g., inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic
             lateral sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy).

          -  History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or current risk factors
             for RVO (e.g., uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension, history of hyperviscosity
             or hypercoagulability syndromes).

          -  Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known
             acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). NOTE: Testing for HIV must be performed at
