  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of the hormones (ie,
      norelgestromin [NGMN] and ethinyl estradiol [EE]) from the transdermal contraceptive patch
      and to evaluate the adhesion of the transdermal contraceptive patch using the newly sourced
      adhesive component, as compared to the currently marketed EVRA patch.
