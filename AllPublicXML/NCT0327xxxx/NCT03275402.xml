  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with a neuroblastoma diagnose and central nervous system (CNS)/leptomeningeal
      metastases will be given up to 2 rounds of intracerebroventricular treatment with a
      radiolabelled monoclonal antibody, 131I-burtomab to evaluate efficacy and safety
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One 131I-burtomab treatment cycle takes 5 weeks and includes a dosimetry dose, a treatment
      dose, an observation period and post-treatment evaluations.

        -  A dosimetry dose (2mCi) of 131I-burtomab is administered during week 1 followed by
           blood/cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples and whole-body scintigraphy at predefined
           intervals during the following 48 hours after treatment.

        -  A therapeutic dose (50mCi) of 131I-burtomab is administered during week 2 followed by a
           3-week observation period that includes a repeated MRI, CSF cytology, and safety
           monitoring.

        -  A second treatment cycle of 131I-burtomab is administered during week 6 if there is no
           objective disease progression week 5 after the first injection, and the participant is
           presenting without unexpected and clinical significant Grade 4 toxicity. For
           participants with ongoing Grade 3 toxicity a second doing cycle will take place
           according to the discretion of the investigator

      Participants can be treated in an outpatient setting or may be admitted as inpatients for
      both the dosimetry and the therapeutic injections.

      Participants completing at least one treatment period will first enter a follow-up period
      through week 26 and thereafter the long-term follow-up where patients will be evaluated for
      up to 3 years post-131I-burtomab treatment where after the trial is ended

      Participants will be monitored for adverse events during and after 131I-burtomab injection
      and will have pre- and post-treatment clinical assessments including neurologic examination,
      hematology and serum chemistry, blood and CSF cultures, endocrinology assessments, CSF
      analysis, and, pre- and post 131I-burtomab performance testing. Performance testing will be
      performed at trial baseline, at week 26 and every 6 months during trial period.

    <description>One treatment cycle of 131I-burtomab consists of 2 doses; 2mCi at week 1 and 50mCi at week 2). First cycle is initiated right after confirmation of eligibility at week 1. At week 6 the participant will be evaluated for safety and if eligible, receive a second cycle of 131I-burtomab.
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at week 26 and primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated at week 156.</description>
