      This is a prospective, phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, open-label study comparing a
      pre-surgical combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with concurrent weekly paclitaxel
      chemotherapy or endocrine therapy given for 12 weeks with a quality of life assessment for 40
      additional weeks in patients with operable HER2+/HR+ breast cancer.

    <measure>Pathological complete response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks after start of therapy treatment</time_frame>
    <description>14 weeks after start of therapy treatment, tumor and lymph node biopsy is performed to reach the primary endpoint of pathological complete response (pCR) which is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ypT0/is ypN0 in the current AJCC staging system). As secondary endpoint, also other response states will be taken into account: no invasive tumor in the complete resected breast specimen irrespective of the lymph node state following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (ypT0/is, any ypN).</description>
