  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric bypass surgery is a highly effective treatment for obesity, but it has negative
      effects on skeletal health, due in part to a dramatic decline in intestinal calcium
      absorption capacity. Animal and human studies suggest that non-digestible fibers termed
      prebiotics, such as soluble corn fiber (SCF), augment calcium absorption in the lower
      intestine as they act as substrates for beneficial gut microbiota. This is a pilot randomized
      controlled trial of the effects of SCF vs. placebo on intestinal calcium absorption, bone
      turnover marker levels, and the gut microbiome in postmenopausal women who have previously
      undergone gastric bypass surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) of the effects of the prebiotic SCF vs.
      placebo in 20 postmenopausal women who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery 2-6 years
      previously and thus have completed the postoperative period of rapid weight loss and
      metabolic and dietary change. A 24 g/day dose of SCF85 (which is approximately 20 g/day
      fiber) will be tested, as that dose was proven effective for calcium absorption/retention in
      healthy postmenopausal women and adolescents. The SCF and the maltodextrin placebo will be
      mixed in water and consumed in divided doses twice daily for 2 months, a duration exceeding
      other SCF trials but remaining feasible for a pilot. The primary outcome will be change in
      intestinal calcium absorption, which is the efficacy outcome about which the study must
      collect preliminary data and from which the investigators must refine power calculations for
      the anticipated future trial. Because the investigators hypothesize that an increase in
      calcium absorption will decrease bone turnover and ultimately increase bone mineral density
      (BMD), the study will measure biochemical markers of bone turnover in this pilot. Secondary
      outcomes will be gastrointestinal tolerability and acceptability. On an exploratory basis,
      the study will determine effects of the prebiotic on the gut microbiome. This pilot will
      yield critical experience about feasibility of recruitment and adherence to the intervention
      and measurements.

    <description>SCF (PromotorTM Soluble Corn Fiber 85, provided by manufacturer Tate &amp; Lyle) will be dispensed to participants as a dry powder in sachets of 12 g SCF85 product (which is approximately 10 g fiber). Participants will mix the powder into 250 mL water and consume two such beverages daily, ≥1 hour apart. (For the first week, all participants will consume one beverage daily, and subsequently increase to one beverage twice daily.) Participants will be asked to substitute these for 500 mL of their usual daily water intake but to make no other dietary changes.</description>

Participants will be requested to substitute these for 500 mL of their usual daily water intake but to make no other dietary changes.</description>
