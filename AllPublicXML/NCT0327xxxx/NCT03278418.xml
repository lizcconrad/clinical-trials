      Patients elected to undergo any type of left-sided valve surgery (either repair or
      replacement) with non severe tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid annular dilation will be
      screened. Consenting patients fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      included in the study and assigned to elective left-sided valve replacement or repair with or
      without concomitant tricuspid valve repair in a 1:1 fashion, using a blocked randomization
      scheme balanced within center.

      The present study is designed as a prospective, multicentre, multinational, randomized, 2-arm
      parallel group trial. Participating centres are selected based on previous experience with
      the surgical technique and standardised echo imaging. Each center is expected to contribute
      70 patients over a 12 months enrolment period.

      Patients elected to undergo any type of left-sided valve surgery (either repair or
      replacement) with non severe tricuspid regurgitation and tricuspid annular dilation will be

      included in the study and assigned to elective left-sided valve replacement or repair with or
      without concomitant tricuspid valve repair in a 1:1 fashion, using a blocked randomization
      scheme balanced within center.

      After discharge patients will be assessed at 1, 12, 24 and 36 months after surgery.
