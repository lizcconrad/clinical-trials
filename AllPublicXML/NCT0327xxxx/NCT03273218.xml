  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness and safety of Tiger (5Fr) vs Judkins (5Fr)
      catheters, in coronariography via the right transradial approach.

      This was a prospective, randomized, study of paralled design. Consecutive patients with acute
      coronary syndrome (ACS), eligible for coronary angiography, was randomized after successuful
      cannulation of right artery and informed consent to either Tiger or Judkins catheters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      analyzed a total of 120 consective diagnostic coronary angioggraphy cases from the right
      radial approach. Of these 60 cases were performed with single catheter (Tiger) and 60 cases
      were performed with conventional catheters (Judkins). The patients of both group were overall
      well balanced for gender, age, risk factors, height, weight and body surface area. Diagnostic
      angiograms were successfully achieved in all cases via the radial approach.
