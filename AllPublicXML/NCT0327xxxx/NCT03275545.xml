    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify the patterns of brain activity in reward circuitry
      that promote symptoms of anorexia nervosa. This project will compare weight-restored
      individuals with anorexia nervosa to a non-eating disorder control group on reward brain
      circuitry patterns in response to typically rewarding cues (i.e., entertaining videos) and
      disorder-specific restrictive eating cues (i.e., low-fat food choice) using fMRI. In
      addition, this study will examine which neurobiological reward responses among
      weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa predict objective restrictive eating
      (measured by laboratory meal intake) and longitudinal risk of relapse one year later.

      Aim 1: To compare patterns of brain activity in reward circuits to typically rewarding cues
      and disorder-specific cues between weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa and
      non-eating disorder controls

      Hypothesis 1a: Activity in reward circuitry will be elevated in response to typically
      rewarding cues in the non-eating disorder control group versus weight-restored anorexia
      nervosa group.

      Hypothesis 1b: Activity in reward circuitry will be elevated in response to disorder-specific
      in the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group versus the non-eating disorder control group.

      Aim 2: To specify the relationship between brain patterns related to reward and restrictive
      eating among weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa

      Hypothesis 2a: Lower reward circuit activity in response to typically rewarding cues will
      predict lower test meal intake for weight-restored anorexia nervosa group versus the
      non-eating disorder control group.

      Hypothesis 2b: Higher reward circuit activity in response to disorder-specific cues will
      predict lower test meal intake for the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group versus the
      non-eating disorder control group.

      Aim 3: To identify the brain patterns in reward circuitry associated with the risk of relapse
      among weight-restored individuals with anorexia nervosa in the year following
      weight-restoration.

      Hypothesis 3a: Lower reward circuit activity in response to typically rewarding cues will
      predict relapse in the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group.

      Hypothesis 3b: Higher reward circuit activity in response to disorder-specific cues will
      predict relapse in the weight-restored anorexia nervosa group.

        Many participants will be community individuals self-referred to participate through a
        flyer or other study advertisement. Individuals who are patients at The Emily Program
        eating disorder treatment facility who are in the process of weight-restoration or who have
        recently been weight-restored from anorexia nervosa may also be presented with a flyer by
        clinical staff at the program through the process outlined above. Participants will also be
        recruited from logs of individuals who had previously participated in studies in our lab
        and stated that they would like to be contacted for future studies and our active
        recruitment log.
