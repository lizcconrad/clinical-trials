  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled case series in patients having a surgery for
      bilateral breast reduction. Objectives of the case series are to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the FBPM10 System when compared with standard of care (massages with vitamin E
      cream) in the treatment of post-surgical wounds.
