  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study CRB-402 is a 2-part, non-randomized, open label, multi-site Phase 1 study of bb21217 in
      adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will be Dose Escalation followed by Part B, an expansion cohort.

      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (bb21217).
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to
      bb21217 infusion. All subjects will then be followed for up to 24 months in Study CRB-402.

      All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after
      receiving bb21217 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria,
      will be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Diagnosis of MM with relapsed or refractory disease and have had at least 3 different
             prior lines of therapy including proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib or
             carfilzomib) and immunomodulatory therapy (IMiD; e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide),
             or have double refractory disease to a proteasome inhibitor and IMiD, defined as
             progression on or within 60 days of treatment with these agents.

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known central nervous system disease

          -  Inadequate hepatic function

          -  Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Investigator
             would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the study; examples include,
             but are not limited to, cirrhotic liver disease, sepsis, recent significant traumatic
             injury, and other conditions

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity

          -  Known hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             positivity with evidence of ongoing infection.

          -  Subjects with a history of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or
             ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control
