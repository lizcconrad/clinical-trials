  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a multi-factorial chronic pain condition characterized by fluctuating
      and heterogeneous symptoms. This leads to both reduced patient function and quality of life
      and consequentially, significant economic burden on the society. Although numerous
      pharmaceutical and multi-treatment approaches exist, there is lack of an integrated
      multidisciplinary model of care for these patients. Such a system is hypothesized to be
      beneficial for the patients and would help them regain function and significantly improve
      their quality of life. The primary aim of this pilot clinical trial is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of an integrated community-based multidisciplinary model of care for FM
      patients in Penticton and surrounding areas. The comprehensive 10 week intervention will
      provide care from a team of health care providers (psychiatrist, physiotherapist, certified
      exercise therapist, dietitian, rheumatologist, and mental health clinician). Patients will
      also attend a peer led pain self-management support group provided by the Arthritis Society.
      The study aims at educating these patients about self-management of their symptoms such as
      chronic pain, weight, sleep and mood disorders. The integration of health care between the
      different providers will be achieved by &quot;huddle&quot; sessions that will be conducted on a monthly
      basis. The evaluation of the study outcomes will be based on the RE-AIM framework. Data will
      be collected through patient questionnaires, healthcare utilization data, and interviews with
      providers. Data analysis will involve thematic analysis of qualitative data and statistical
      methods for quantitative data.

    <description>The 10-week intervention will include twice weekly 1-2 hours sessions with multiple professional team members to undergo education and exercise sessions. The multidisciplinary team will consist of a rheumatologist, rheumatology nurse, dietitian, physiotherapist, a trained exercise therapist, a physiologist who specializes in pain management, a psychiatrist and a mental health clinician. All intervention team members have expertise in working with individuals with chronic pain conditions. General disease information, current best practices and techniques such as self-pain management, pacing, sleep hygiene, approach to a healthy lifestyle and weight loss will be discussed. The total number of hours for the 10 week intervention is 31 hours.</description>

    <description>Usual care involves being referred to the local rheumatologist involved in the study. The rheumatologist and the rheumatology nurse will see the control group patients during a one hour one on one consultation appointment. During that time the patient's history will be taken, physical exam performed and investigations analyzed. If a diagnosis of fibromyalgia is confirmed, the rheumatologist and nurse will counsel the patient and provide resources for self directed management. Unless there is a concern of an alternative diagnosis, follow up will not be arranged.</description>
