  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment
      among elderly populations in developed countries. Majority of AMD patients (80%) suffer from
      the dry or non-exudative form of the disease. Currently there are no approved treatments for
      dry AMD. Clinical development of therapeutic agents for dry AMD is limited by slow
      progressing nature of the disease as well as the lack of sensitive endpoints to assess
      therapeutic efficacy. Visual acuity, the commonly used functional endpoint, remains minimally
      affected during early stages of dry AMD. Thus novel visual function endpoints, that can
      identify functional deficits during early stages of dry AMD prior to development of
      geographic atrophy, are needed. In the current study a battery of visual function tests will
      be evaluated in subjects with different stages of dry AMD and normal controls, to assess
      their sensitivity and feasibility as potential functional endpoints for dry AMD.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Critical flicker fusion</measure>
    <time_frame>At study visit through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Critical flicker fusion will be tested using a computer based test for different stimulus colors, white, red, green and blue. A wide range of luminance and contrast levels will be tested. The subject would be seated in front of the monitor. The non-study eye will be occluded. Subjects would be given adequate practice tests prior to performing the actual test. The stimulus will be presented on the monitor screen and the subject indicates perceiving the stimulus by pressing a test button.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dark adaptation</measure>
    <time_frame>At study visit through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Dark adaptation function will be assessed with dilated pupils using computer based stimuli following photo bleach. Subject will be seated in front of the test monitor with best correction in place for the study eye. The subject will be instructed to keep fixating on a red fixation cross in the center of the monitor and respond to perceiving the stimulus presented by pressing the response trigger button. All stimuli will be presented in random order for all intensities presented. The stimulus intensity is programmed to decrease in intensity with time. The test will be terminated after 20 minutes of recording. Dark adaptation curve will be generated and rod-cone recovery time (in minutes) will be derived from the curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reading Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>At study visit through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Reading tests will be performed using an electronic tablet device. The subject will be seated in a comfortable position with the non-tested eye occluded. The tablet will be set up in a table right in front of the subject at a viewing distance of 40cm. The subject will be given detailed instructions on the test procedures and outcomes. The goal of this test to assess reading speed of the study eye under a variety of conditions such as high contrast-high luminance, low contrast, low luminance, crowded letters, pepper words of different lengths and vanishing optotypes. Each challenge will be tested using a different passage of similar difficulty level. For each passage, reading speed will be estimated as the time taken to accurately read the entire passage and recorded in words per minute (WPM).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Color vision function</measure>
    <time_frame>At study visit through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Color vision function will be assessed to test L, M and S cone functions. During the test, a letter will briefly flash on the screen. The subject then must verbally identify the letter and/or its orientation. The response of the subject is then recorded by the technician. If correct, the next letter is presented at decreased color contrast relative to the background. The test continues in this manner until the subject incorrectly identifies the presented letter. At that point, the stimulus is presented at the next higher contrast level. This continues until the subject correctly identifies the presented letter. The test then terminates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Shape discrimination</measure>
    <time_frame>At study visit through study completion, an average of 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Shape discrimination will be tested by presenting a two-alternative forced choice stimulus to the subject on a computer device (monitor or tablet). The subject will be asked to identify the stimulus which is modulated and which is not. The test shall be performed at full room lighting for photopic sensitivity as well as in reduced lighting (mesopic) conditions. The effect of eccentricity may be tested by presenting successively larger targets with foveal fixation.</description>
