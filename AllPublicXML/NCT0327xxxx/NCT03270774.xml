      Background: Central Venous catheter insertion technique and indwelling time are major risk
      factors for CVC colonisation. Colonisation occurs through microbial migration and biofilm
      formation along the catheter insertion tract. This study set out to determine the prevalence
      and associated factors for central venous catheter colonisation among critically ill patient.
      No data exists in this clinical setting addressing this topic.

      Methods: The study population included 100 participants with central venous catheters in situ
      for at least 24 hours. Catheter tip (distal 5-cm segment) and blood cultures (10mls
      peripheral blood) were obtained at the time of catheter removal.

      Introduction : Central venous catheter (CVC) insertion technique and time spent in situ
      (dwell period) are major risk factors for CVC colonisation among patients admitted to
      intensive care units (ICU) worldwide. Normal skin flora colonizes CVCs early in their dwell
      period (&lt; 7-10 days) causing variable occurrence of infections in all categories of patients.
      Uganda has no data on CVC colonisation and with increasing use there is concern of CVC
      colonisation and its consequences. This study was done to determine the prevalence and
      associated factors of CVC colonization among patients in general ICUs.

      Methodology: This was prospective cohort study. Critically ill patients with CVCs in situ
      from four general ICUs were consecutively enrolled into the study. Data on socio-demographic,
      clinical characteristics (diagnosis, comorbidities) and CVC insertion (site, technique,
      experience) was collected using a standardised questionnaire until a sample size of 100 was
      achieved. At the time of CVC removal, the CVC tip (distal 5cm segment) was aseptically
      obtained and cultured for microorganisms using the semi-quantitative method. A blood culture
      sample (10mls) was also collected from a peripheral site at the same time. Data was double
      entered into EPIDATA version 3.1.5 and exported to STATA version 12.0 for analysis.
