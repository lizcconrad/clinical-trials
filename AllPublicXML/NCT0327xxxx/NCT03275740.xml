             no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed medical history, full
             physical examination, including oral temperature, blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate
             (PR) measurement, 12 lead ECG or clinical laboratory tests

          -  Female subjects of non childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following
             criteria:

               1. Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular menses

                  physiological cause; and have a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level
                  confirming the post menopausal state;

               2. Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy;

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or

             seasonal allergies at the time of dosing).

          -  Subjects with a history of autoimmune disorders (including but not limited to: Crohn's

             disease) and other conditions that compromise or impair the immune system

          -  Subjects with a history of allergic or anaphylactic reaction to any drug including
             immunoglobulin

          -  History of active infections within 28 days prior to the screening visit

          -  Subjects with a history of or current positive results for any of the following
             serological tests: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HepBsAg), Hepatitis B core antibody
             (HepBcAb), Hepatitis C antibody (HCVAb) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Subjects with a history of thromboembolic events or current positive result for
             anti-cardiolipin antibody

          -  History of TB or active, latent or inadequately treated TB infection. All positive TB
             test result(s) are exclusionary

          -  Male subjects with partners currently pregnant; male subjects able to father children
             who are unwilling or unable to use a highly effective method of contraception as
