  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reaching a peripheral venous access or making a blood sample in a scared infant or toddler
      can be challenging even for experienced nurses o pediatricians. Up to 60% of children report
      pain and distress during venipuncture and multiple attempts can result in more difficult
      physical and emotional conditions for subsequent insertions so that the procedure should be
      performed with the less number of punctures as possible. In about one third of children, more
      than one attempt is required to achieve peripheral intravenous cannulation. In the last
      years, specific tools have been developed to enhance the success in venipuncture or
      incannulation. Near-infrared (NIR) technology consists on light-emitting diodes placed
      underneath the hand, that makes vessels visible by projecting the processed image in a green
      light directly on to the puncture site. According to previous studies, NIR had shown a trend
      in reduction of time employed for a blood sample, in children younger of 6 yr.

      The aim of this trial is to investigate if the use of the VeinViewer® in a pediatric blood
      drawing center could decrease time spent to perform the procedure and improve the rate of
      first attempt success.
