    <textblock>
      The Study of Asthma Adherence study was a multicentre, single-blind, parallel group
      randomised controlled trial, with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Outpatient or inpatient with
      doctor-diagnosed asthma aged 6 months-3 years attending Shanghai Children's Medical Center
      and 14 Community hospitals were screened for eligibility. Before randomization, all
      participants had the same chips attached to their regular nebulizers. Caregivers were told
      the devices monitored the date and time of all actuations. All caregivers were asked to fill
      the questionnaire about the patients. After randomisation, all caregivers had their nebulizer
      technique checked by a qualified asthma nurse, and received a brief asthma education session,
      emphasising the importance of taking inhaled steroids regularly.

      Caregivers of the recruited patients in the intervention group were added to a Wechat group.
      All the decive-monitored adherence data from the previous week were downloaded and calculated
      by a qualified asthma nurse. Weekly, according to the adherence rate, the nurse offered the
      feedback to caregivers and reminded them to keep taking inhaled steroids on Wechat. Monthly,
      Caregivers were asked &quot;Have your child inhaled the medicine according to the doctor's
      instructions?&quot; and &quot;How about the frequency&quot; through telephone follow-up. Caregivers of the
      recruited patients in the control group were not added to a Wechat group. All the
      decive-monitored adherence data were also downloaded and calculated weekly. However, the
      investigators did not give feedback to them. Monthly, Caregivers were also asked &quot;Have your
      child inhaled the medicine according to the doctor's instructions?&quot; and &quot;How about the
      frequency&quot; through telephone follow-up.

    <measure>device monitored adherence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome for the study was device monitored adherence rate and it was calculated weekly. The device monitored adherence rate was calculated as number of atomizer run times recorded by the chip/number of run times prescribed√ó100%. The weekly adherence was capped at 100%, to avoid falsely increased values due to re-start. The monthly figure was a mean of each weekly adherence rate.</description>

    <description>The caregiver-reported adherence rate was recorded monthly.
