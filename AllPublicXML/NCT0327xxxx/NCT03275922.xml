    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zolmitriptan nasal spray (ZNS) in the acute treatment
      of migraine headache in subjects ages 6 to 11 years.

      Part 1: Approximately 20 weeks (includes screening and double-blind treatment).

        -  Screening will be performed based on the inclusion exclusion criteria specified in the
           study protocol.

        -  Randomize approximately 288 subjects into the double-blind crossover phase.

      Part 2: Approximately 100 subjects who complete the double-blind crossover phase will enter
      part 2, a 6 month open-label safety extension (OLE).

      Efficacy will be evaluated in the double-blind part of the trial. Safety will be evaluated in
      both the double-blind and the OLE.

    <description>The subject diary captures the headache severity using a 4-point headache pain intensity scale (severe = 3, moderate = 2, mild = 1, or none = 0). Headache response is defined as a reduction in moderate (2) or severe (3) pain to mild (1) or no (0) pain at 24 hour post-dose.</description>

    <measure>Sustained headache response at 24 hours post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained headache response is defined as a reduction in migraine headache pain intensity from severe or moderate to mild or none at 2 hours which is then maintained (without a return to moderate or severe pain) at 24 hours with no use of rescue medication prior to the 24 hour assessment.</description>

          2. Subjects ages 6 to 11 years throughout the double-blind portion of the studyAn
             established diagnosis of migraine

          3. By history, average migraine frequency of ≥ 2 attacks per month lasting on average ≥ 3
             hours per attack

          4. By history, experiences at least 16 headache-free days per month on average

        Exclusion Criteria:

             bowel disease, uncontrolled hypertension, recent (within 24 hours) or use of another
             5HT1 agonist, ergots or ergotamine-containing medications.

          2. Any medical condition, including severe hepatic impairment, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may put the subject at increased risk with exposure to zolmitriptan,
             or may interfere with the safety or efficacy assessments.

          3. Had an unacceptable adverse experience following previous use of any 5HT1B/1D agonist
             drug (in the opinion of the investigator).

          4. Had not experienced satisfactory relief from migraine pain during prior treatment with
             2 or more adequate courses of triptans.

          5. Prior use of any nasal spray (triptan or dihydroergotamine [DHE]) for the acute
             treatment of migraine

          6. Disease or anatomic abnormalities of the nasal cavity precluding or complicating the
             use of ZNS.
