  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present pilot study is to test the hypothesis that in patients with group
      1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) who are on regular oral pulmonary vasodilator
      therapy, inhaled albuterol causes transient pulmonary vasodilation. If the results support
      this premise, they could serve as the basis for a phase 2 trial investigating the potential
      for using inhaled long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists as add-on therapy in group 1 PAH.
      Echocardiography will be performed before and after administration of inhaled albuterol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators will use echocardiography to assess the acute pulmonary hemodynamic effect
      of albuterol in 6 patients with group 1 PAH documented by right heart catheterization (mean
      pulmonary arterial pressure &gt;25mmHg, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) &gt; 3 wood/u and
      pulmonary wedge pressure &lt;15). The patients will be on regular oral pulmonary vasodilator
      therapy. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) and cardiac output will be measured before
      and serially for 2 hours after the administration of either 270μg albuterol or placebo by
      inhalation using a spacer. PVR will be calculated by using an estimate of left atrial
      pressure.
