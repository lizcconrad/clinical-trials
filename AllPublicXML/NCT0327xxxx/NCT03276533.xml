      Objective: The present study was to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine alone, lidocaine
      alone and their combined infusion on postoperative inflammation cytokines after Laparoscopic
      hysterectomy.

      Methods: Investigators enrolled 160 women with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
      physical status I and II, aged 40-65 years, and scheduled for elective laparoscopic
      hysterectomy with general anesthesia from October 2017 to August 2018. The participants were
      randomly assigned into four groups(n=40 each group): group CON received normal saline
      infusion, group LIDO received lidocaine infusion (1.5 mg/kg loading, 1.5 mg/kg/h infusion),
      group DEX received dexmedetomidine infusion (0.5 µg/kg loading, 0.4 µg/kg/h infusion) and
      group LIDO+DEX received lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg loading, 1.5 mg/kg/h infusion) and
      dexmedetomidine infusions (0.5 µg/kg loading, 0.4 µg/kg/h infusion). The four groups received
      an IV bolus infusion of normal saline, lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and lidocaine combined with
      dexmedetomidine respectively, over 10 minutes before induction of anesthesia, followed by a
      continuous IV infusion of normal saline, lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and lidocaine combined
      with dexmedetomidine until abdominal wound closure, respectively. Interleukin-6 and tumor
      necrosis factor-α levels in serum were measured at different time points: before
      administration of drugs (T1), the end of surgery (T2), postoperative 2 hour (T3) and
      postoperative 24 hour (T4).
