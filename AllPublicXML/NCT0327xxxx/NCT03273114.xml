  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence, of a single randomized controlled trial, that CFT is better than combined
      manual therapy and motor control exercise for chronic low back pain. However, this study had
      significant methodological shortcomings regarding the failure to carry out the intention to
      treat analysis and a considerable loss of follow-up of patients. As it is, it is important to
      carry out more studies involving CFT compared to other interventions already used in clinical
      practice and to correct these methodological shortcomings. Therefore, the aim of the study is
      to assess the efficacy of Cognitive Functional Therapy in patients with chronic non specific
      low back pain.

      Randomized controlled trial with concealed allocation, blinded assessor, blinded participants
      and intention to treat analysis. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 and 12
      months after randomization, to assess the maintenance of any effect of treatment. The
      patients in the CFT group will be treated by a physical therapists that attended twice the
      CFT workshops with two of the tutors of the method. She completed 106 hours of training
      including workshops, patient examinations and a pilot study with the supervision of a
      physical therapist with more than three years of clinical experience in CFT. Patients in
      CORE-MT group will be treated by a physical therapist with clinical experience in manual
      therapy and core training exercises.

    <description>Cognitive Functional Therapy (CFT) is a behavioral intervention that addresses multiple aspects of low back pain. This approach focuses on changing the patient's beliefs, confronting their fears, educating them about pain mechanisms, increasing mental strength, and control of their body. This is done with functional tasks performed by individuals training them to reduce excessive muscle activity in the trunk and generate behavioral changes related to pain, from postures and provocative movements.</description>

    <description>There will be four main components in the intervention, following the protocol used by O'Keefe et al. (2015):
The cognitive component will focus on on the multidimensional nature of persistent pain about individual beliefs, and how emotions and behaviors (movement and lifestyle) can reinforce a vicious cycle of pain and disability.
Specific Functional training is designed to normalize maladaptive or provocative movement and posture.
Functional integration directed to activities of daily life that are avoided by the patient (rolling in bed, sitting, sitting to standing, walking, bending and lifting)
Patients will be advised to gradually increase physical activity based on their preference, also focusing on sleep hygiene, stress, and management strategies</description>

    <description>According to the pragmatic clinical decision of the physiotherapist responsible for this intervention arm, participants allocated to the comparison group will be treated with active exercises will involve contractions of abdominal and back muscles in different functional positions, as well as joint mobilization or manipulation techniques applied to the lower back or pélvis, when necessary. Most patients in this group will receive exercises to perform at home, but not related to CFT.</description>
