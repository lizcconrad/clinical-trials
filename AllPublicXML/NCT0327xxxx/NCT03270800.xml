  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 1, multi-center, randomised, double-blind and adjuvant-controlled study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IMX101 in H. pylori-negative and H. pylori-infected
      healthy volunteers.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase A: Study design contains 6 cohorts, each
      containing 8 subjects. Three cohorts (24 subjects) will be H. pylori-negative and 3 cohorts
      will be H. pylori-infected. Subjects fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be assigned to
      one of 3 sequential dose cohorts with a 3:1 randomisation to IMX101 or to CTA within each
      cohort.

      Phase B: Two cohorts with H. pylori-infected subjects can be expanded up to 20 subjects in
      each cohort. The decision whether to expand the cohorts will be taken by the Sponsor and the
      DSMB, as soon as the results of the safety and efficacy analyses are available.

      Up to 72 subjects collectively in Phases A &amp; B will be recruited. depending on immunogenicity
      status.

    <description>All subjects who received at least one dose of the IMP will be included in the safety analysis by following parameters:
-Adverse events: AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Separate analyses will be conducted using severity, seriousness, and relationship to the IMP. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarised and tabulated according to the primary system organ class and preferred term.
Clinical laboratory and other safety measures Haematology and clinical chemistry will be summarised with descriptive statistics for absolute values und changes from Baseline by visit. Urine dipstick test will be summarised with frequency tables by visit.
Vital signs Vital signs will be summarised with descriptive statistics for absolute values und changes from Baseline by visit.
Local tolerability Injection site assessments will be summarised in frequency tables when the collected data allow for this.</description>
