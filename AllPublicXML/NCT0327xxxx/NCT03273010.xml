  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The palatal donor site of autogenous free gingival grafts significantly influences the
      patient's morbidity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyanoacrylate
      on palatal wound healing and postoperative complaints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 35 patients were included in the study. In the test group (19 patient),
      cyanoacrylate was placed over the palatal wounds; conversely, the 16 control group patients
      were allowed to heal in a conventional way without cyanoacrylate.

      Primary bleeding time, presence of secondary bleeding, postoperative pain and completion of
      epithelization were assessed following free gingival graft operation. As a result, compared
      to the control group it was determined that the cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive could reduce
      the postoperative morbidity and improve the wound healing.
