  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to give pembrolizumab in
      combination with romidepsin to patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma or cutaneous T-cell
      lymphoma. Researchers also want to learn if the study drug combination can help to control
      the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of certain types of melanoma. Romidepsin is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The
      use of these drugs in combination with each other is investigational.

      The study doctor can explain how pembrolizumab and romidepsin are designed to work.

      Up to 33 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study. Up to 3 groups of up to 6 participants will be
      enrolled in Phase 1 of the study, and up to 21 participants will be enrolled in Phase 2.

      If you are enrolled in Phase 1, the dose of romidepsin you receive will depend on when you
      join this study. The first group of participants will receive the highest dose level of
      romidepsin. A second group will receive a lower dose of romidepsin than the group before it,
      if intolerable side effects are seen. A third group will receive an even lower dose if there
      are still intolerable side effects.

      If you are enrolled in Phase 2, you will receive romidepsin at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Phase 1.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of pembrolizumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive the study drugs in 21-day study cycles. On Day 1 of each cycle, romidepsin
      will be given first, followed by pembrolizumab. Romidepsin will be given by vein over about 4
      hours on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle. You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30
      minutes after romidepsin on Day 1 of each cycle.

      If you are in Phase 2, you will not receive romidepsin on Day 1 of Cycle 1.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 36 cycles, as long as the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease
      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study
      directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      You will have study visits on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1. You will then have study visits on
      Days 1 and 8 of Cycles 2 and 3. After that, you will only have study visits on Day 1 of
      Cycles 4 and beyond. At each of these visits:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1 and within 72 hours before Day 1 of each cycle, if you can become
           pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test. To take part in this study, you must not be pregnant.

        -  At some of these visits, additional tests will be performed:

        -  On Day 1 of every cycle that you receive romidepsin, you will have an EKG within 6 hours
           before you receive romidepsin.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3, Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 2, and Day 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1
           teaspoon) will be drawn for research tests.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles after that, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be
           drawn for thyroid function tests.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles after that, you will have the same imaging scans
           (such as CTs or PET/CTs) you had at screening to check the status of the disease.

      End-of-Dosing Visits:

      When you stop receiving the study drugs, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine
      tests and thyroid function tests. You will have these blood tests again 30 days later.

      Follow-Up:

      Every 12 weeks after the second end-of-dosing visit:

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and thyroid function tests.

        -  You will have the same imaging scans (such as CTs or PET/CTs) you had at screening to
           check the status of the disease.

      You will also be called every 12 weeks to be asked about your health. This call should last
      about 15 minutes.
