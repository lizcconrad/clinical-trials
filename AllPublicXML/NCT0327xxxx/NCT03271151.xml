  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-discharge pain after total knee arthroplasty remains problematic; many patients have
      excessive pain at the 2 week time point (and often thereafter). Reduction in opioid use has
      become a national goal, due to the 'epidemic' in opioid misuse.

    <description>Epidural analgesia after knee arthroplasty is not as prevalent at HSS as formerly, in large part due to the rise of local infiltration analgesia. Studies using epidural analgesia may also lack generalizability given the infrequent use of epidural analgesia at other institutions. For these reasons, we plan to use adductor canal nerve blockade + local infiltration analgesia for management of immediate postoperative pain. Patients will receive spinal anesthesia as the primary anesthetic. It is particularly important to study duloxetine (&quot;Cymbalta&quot;) in the context of local infiltration analgesia, as patients receiving local infiltration analgesia receive increased doses of opioids, compared to patients receiving epidural analgesia.</description>

    <description>Duloxetine (&quot;Cymbalta&quot;) is a serotonin and norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is an effective treatment for painful diabetic neuropathy. It is approved for major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain</description>
