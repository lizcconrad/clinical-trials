  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical trials have demonstrated the human body's own healing and regenerative
      cells can relieve the pain of arthritis. Bone marrow contains stem cells which can change
      into cells of various different tissue types, while platelet rich plasma contains growth
      factors. Both techniques have been shown to relieve pain and with this study the
      Investigators wish to compare the two treatments.

      Participants will be randomized into two groups. Concentrated Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMAC) or
      Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP). BMAC subjects will have bone marrow aspirated from the subjects
      iliac crests and the cellular rich portion will be concentrated and subsequently injected
      into the subjects' symptomatic knee. BMAC patients will also have a venous whole blood drawn
      from the antecubital vein to simulate a PRP procedure. PRP subjects will have the same venous
      blood draw from the antecubital vein with subsequent platelet concentration. The resulting
      PRP will be injected into the symptomatic knee. PRP subjects will also undergo a bone marrow
      aspiration from the iliac crest to simulate the BMAC procedure. Follow-up at 1 week, 6 weeks,
      6 months, and 12 months after injection, with repeat radiographs at 12 months.

          -  Subjects must have previously tried 6 weeks of one of the following conservative
             treatments: Activity modification, weight loss, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory,
             or injection therapy.

          -  Patients must be able to provide written informed consent after the nature of the
             study is fully explained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with abnormal hematology, serum chemistry, or screening laboratory results.

          -  Patients taking anti-inflammatory medications (prescription or over-the-counter),
             including herbal therapies, within 14 days of baseline visit.

          -  Patients taking anti-rheumatic disease medication (including methotrexate or other
             antimetabalites) within the 3 months prior to study entry.

          -  Patients receiving injections to the treated knee within 3 months prior to study
             entry.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or currently breast-feeding.

          -  Patients with systemic, rheumatic, or inflammatory disease of the knee or
             chondrocalcinosis, hemochromatosis, inflammatory arthritis, arthropathy of the knee
             associated with juxta-articular Paget's disease of the femur or tibia, ochronosis,
             hemophilic arthropathy, infectious arthritis, Charcot's knee joint, villonodular
             synovitis, and synovial chondromatosis.

          -  Patients with ongoing known infectious disease.
