  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is examine the eye movements characteristics of patients with VOR gain deficits
      (overt and covert saccades) before and after physical therapy intervention program and
      examine the most effective physical therapy treatment program for patients with
      vestibulopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vestibular system receives and conveys information about head motion in space, and is the
      main human sensory system dedicated to detecting self-motion.The vestibular system plays a
      crucial role in static and dynamic balance control, stabilizing the head and trunk,
      especially on unstable surfaces . In terms of postural control and falls, the literature
      describes a direct association between VOR deficits, gait instability, and falls.The &quot;gain&quot;
      of the VOR is defined as the change in the eye angle divided by the change in the head angle
      during the head turn. Under ideal conditions, the gain of the rotational VOR is 1.0, meaning
      there is a compensatory eye velocity equal to the head velocity and in the opposite
      direction. In case of a positive vHIT, the VOR gain is decreased and refixating saccades are
      observed. The video Head Impulse Test measures eye velocity during head rotation. Instant
      feedback about every single head impulse allows the examiner to apply a set of standardized
      graded impulses. The system is easy to use in a clinical setting, provides an objective
      measure of the VOR, and detects both overt and covert catch-up saccades in patients with
      vestibular loss. Measurements are quick and noninvasive, and the automated analysis software
      provides instant results.

    <description>The Vhit incorporates a new technology that uses a high speed light weight video goggle to measure high velocity and record &quot;catch up&quot; saccades in patients with impaired VOR function. we will examine the changes from baseline in the latency, frequency and duration of the overt and covert saccadic eye movements. In addition, we would like to examine changes over time in the ratio between the head and the eye movement (Gain).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline velocity sway at 3 and 6 months measured by force platform</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 7 days after acute vestibulopathy, after 3 and 6 months after acute vestibulopathy</time_frame>
    <description>The force plate is designed to measure the forces and moments applied to its top surface as a subjects stands, steps, or jumps on it. Force plates are regularly used in research and clinical studies looking at balance, gait, and sports performance (www.amti.biz). Center of pressure (COP) data during the stability tests will be sampled at a frequency of 100 Hz. We will perform the zur balance scale (ZBS) on the plate at each time and evaluate the changes from baseline.</description>
