  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12 month prospective, multicenter, post-marketing, observational study to compare
      the effectiveness of a treat-to-target (T2T) disease management strategy vs. routine care
      (RC) in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with
      subcutaneous abatacept (Orencia - SC). Patients completing the study will be offered to
      participate in a 12-month extension of their follow-up provided that this is in agreement
      with the judgment of the treating physician.

        Adult patients with active RA defined as a CDAI &gt; 10 for whom the treating physician has
        made the decision to initiate treatment with SC abatacept according to the approved
        Canadian product monograph and regional reimbursement criteria will be potentially eligible
        for inclusion in the study. The decision to treat the patient with SC abatacept must have
        been reached prior to and independently of considering the patient for study enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Active moderate to severe RA, defined as CDAI &gt; 10.

          -  The treating physician has made the decision to initiate treatment with SC abatacept
             in accordance with the Canadian product monograph.

          -  Patient has provided a written informed consent and is able to complete the survey
             requirements.

          -  Patient fulfills the reimbursement criteria for treatment with SC abatacept under
             provincial or private health insurance reimbursement coverage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received abatacept (SC or IV) prior to the enrolment visit.

          -  Has failed more than one prior biologic DMARD therapy

          -  Has a history of autoimmune disease or of any joint inflammatory disease other than RA
             with the exception of concomitant secondary Sjogren's syndrome.

          -  Is participating in an ongoing clinical trial and/or has received treatment with an
             investigational agent within 4 weeks before starting treatment with SC abatacept.

          -  Is participating in another industry-sponsored observational study.

          -  Patients participating to non-industry related registries or other data collection
             studies can be included

          -  Presence of any condition that, in the opinion of the treating physician, prohibits
             the patient from participating in the study or obscures the assessment of RA
             treatment.
