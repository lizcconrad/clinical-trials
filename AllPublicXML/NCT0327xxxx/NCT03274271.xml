  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of intervention 'MyPlan 2.0' and
      the efficacy of the different behaviour change techniques that are included. Eight groups
      will be created that will receive a different version of the intervention, varying in three
      behaviour change techniques (action planning, coping planning, self-monitoring).

    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of the self-regulation-based e- and m-health intervention 'MyPlan 2.0' on
      changing physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the adult population will be
      investigated. Furthermore, the role of three different behaviour change techniques (action
      planning, coping planning, self-monitoring) will be examined via a 2x2x2 design, in which 8
      groups are created that all receive a different version of the intervention.
