  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre study of single ascending intravenous doses of MEDI1341 or placebo in
      up to 48 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 80 years.

      The study will include up to 5 planned cohorts; each cohort will comprise 8 subjects. An
      optional sixth cohort of 8 subjects may be studied.

      Each subject will receive a single 60 minute intravenous infusion of MEDI1341 or placebo and
      will undergo scheduled assessments over a period of 13 weeks.

      The main aim of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of
      MEDI1341 in Healthy Volunteers.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single
      ascending intravenous doses of MEDI1341 in male and nonfertile female healthy volunteers,
      aged 18 to 80 years.

      The study will include up to 5 planned cohorts; each cohort will comprise 8 subjects. Within
      each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive MEDI1341 and 2 will be randomized to
      receive placebo. A Safety Review Committee will review data from each cohort before
      progression to the next higher dose cohort occurs. An optional sixth cohort of 8 subjects may
      be studied, based on an interim review of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/
      pharmacodynamic data, with a dose level that may be lower than, the same as, or higher than
      for any preceding cohort.

      On Day 1, each randomized subject will receive a single 60 minute intravenous infusion of
      MEDI1341 or placebo and will undergo scheduled safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and
      immunogenicity assessments. Additional study assessments will occur on Days 2, 4, 8, 15, 22,
      29, 43, 57, and 92.
