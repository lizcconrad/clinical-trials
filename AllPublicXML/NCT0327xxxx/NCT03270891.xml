      This is a 6-month randomized, wait-listed, controlled pilot trial conducted in 6 department
      of family medicine (DFM) clinics at the University of Michigan (UM). Physicians practicing at
      a UM DFM clinical site who are willing to utilize pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results for the
      management of depression and/or anxiety will be enrolled. Patients of these DFM physicians
      who are adults with a new diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and have a current
      prescription for an antidepressant will also be enrolled.

      This is a 6-month randomized, wait-listed, controlled pilot trial conducted in 6 department
      of family medicine (DFM) clinics at the University of Michigan (UM). Physicians practicing at
      a UM DFM clinical site who are willing to utilize pharmacogenomic (PGx) test results for the
      management of depression and/or anxiety will be enrolled. Patients of these DFM physicians
      who are adults with a new diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety and have a current
      prescription for an antidepressant will also be enrolled. Patients will be randomized to
      either an intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group will have PGx
      test results available soon after enrollment while the control patients will have test
      results available 3 months after the first visit. All patients will complete a baseline, 3-,
      and 6-month assessment; control patients will have an additional 9-month assessment. Data to
      be collected include depression symptoms and severity (PHQ-8), anxiety severity and symptoms
      (GAD7), functional health status (SF-12), PGx knowledge, work status changes, demographic
      information, physician and emergency department visits, adverse effects, and medication
      alterations and adherence.
