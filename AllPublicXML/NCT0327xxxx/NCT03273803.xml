  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a proof-of-concept study enrolling subjects with normal and
      pathologic heart sounds. Heart sound was recorded by auscultation on the skin of the chest
      wall using three smartphones: Samsung Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S6, and LG G3 . Recorded heart
      sounds were processed and classified by a diagnostic algorithm using convolutional neural
      networks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart sound recording was done by researchers who were familiar with the use of the app and
      understand the principles of cardiac auscultation.

      Reference heart sounds were recorded using an electronic stethoscope (3M™ Littmann®
      Electronic Stethoscope Model 3200). Study devices included Samsung Galaxy S5 (model SM-G900),
      Galaxy S6 (SM-G920), and LG G3 (LG-F400).
