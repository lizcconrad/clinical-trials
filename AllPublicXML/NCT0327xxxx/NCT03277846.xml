  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether Nexalin Trans-cranial Electrical
      Stimulation (TES) is an effective treatment for depression among patients who are candidates
      for ECT. A secondary aim to assess whether Nexalin can be used as an alternative to ECT.
      Although Nexalin has been approved for use in the US, using Nexalin to treat depression in
      this way is investigational and experimental. If Nexalin is found to be an alternative to
      ECT, it could offer a safer treatment for depression with less side-effects and a lower cost.

      A 2x2 factor Randomized Controlled Trial with block randomization. Inpatient subjects at the
      Carrier Clinic who are referred for ECT will be recruited, typed regarding their acceptance
      of ECT, and randomized to either treatment with TES or to a Sham condition. Treatment
      non-responders in either condition will continue as in patients at the Carrier Clinic until
      they reach acceptable levels of functioning to be discharged
