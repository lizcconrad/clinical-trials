      ICON 9 will assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of maintenance olaparib in
      combination with cediranib compared to maintenance olaparib alone following a response to
      platinum-based chemotherapy in women with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube
      or peritoneal cancer. Prognostic and predictive factors will be studied from tumour and blood
      samples.

  <detailed_description>

      ICON9 is an international multicentre randomised, phase III trial assessing maintenance
      treatment with olaparib and cediranib or olaparib alone in women with relapsed ovarian cancer
      whose disease progressed more than 6 months after first line chemotherapy. Women whose
      disease responds to platinum chemotherapy following 3 to 4 cycles can be registered for
      collection of germline BRCA test results if known, and somatic BRCA testing of archival
      tumour specimens or secondary debulking tissue if required. Patients who have completed
      treatment and whose disease has responded (partial or complete) to a minimum of 4 cycles of
      platinum based chemotherapy will be randomised to maintenance treatment of either olaparib
      and cediranib or olaparib alone.

      The maintenance regimen may be continued beyond radiological progression until trial closure
      if the patient is deemed to still be deriving clinical benefit, but must be discontinued once
      subsequent treatment is instituted.
