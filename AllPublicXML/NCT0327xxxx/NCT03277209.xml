  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A dose escalation trial to assess the safety of plerixafor in patients with advanced
      pancreatic, high grade serous ovarian and colorectal cancer. To identify the proof of
      mechanism, by demonstrating alterations in T-cell tumour distribution, ideally associated
      with loss of tumour cells, measured by immunostaining, and changes in FDG uptake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label, Phase I, dose escalation trial of
      plerixafor in patients with histological documentation of advanced pancreatic, high grade
      serous ovarian or colorectal adenocarcinoma. We will investigate the feasibility of
      administering plerixafor in terms of safety, and will try to identify the proof of mechanism
      in patients. This trial will follow the standard 3+3, Phase I trial design, leading to a
      treatment expansion phase to confirm the RP2D.
