  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No consensus exists about which coronary artery should be firstly catheterized in primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the present study was to compare
      door-to-balloon time (D2B) of ECG guided immediate infarct-related artery (IRA) PCI with
      traditional complete coronary angiography followed by PCI for the treatment of ST segment
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Primary endpoint is door to device (D2D)
      time. Secondary end-points are: puncture to device (P2D) time,first medical contact to device
      (FMC2D) time,incidence of radial artery spasm and occlusion, contrast amount, fluoroscopy
      time, cumulative air kerma(CAK) and dose area product(DAP).
