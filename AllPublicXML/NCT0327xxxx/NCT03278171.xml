    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric pathology noticed in the DSM-5, in
      troubles due to a traumatism or a stress factor and appearing at least 1 month after
      confrontation with trauma. This trouble can become chronic, and be the source of psychiatric
      and somatic comorbidities, which themselves have personal, professional and economic
      consequences at the level of the individual and society.

      Some studies looked at the psychological effects induced by a stay in intensive care unit
      (ICU) since few years. The emergence of PTSD in these patients has been described, with an
      incidence varying from 4% to 60%.

      The literature is contradictory about identified risk factors for PTSD. It's not possible to
      design a screening of these patients actually, only focused on the risk factors. It has been
      shown that the presence of acute stress trouble (presence of symptoms during the first month
      after the traumatism) was a risk factor for PTSD. Early detection of acute stress disorder
      could be a way to screen risk of emergence of a post-intensive care PTSD. Post-intensive care
      consultations have been done at 6 months, but not systematically. Only few symptoms are
      looked for and a sizable part of this population were not being followed probably due to a
      non-diagnosed-PTSD. In case of the emergence of a post-intensive care PTSD, those patients
      will never be diagnosed and treated, favoring all complications linked to this trouble.

      Associated with other factors, IES-R (Impact Event Scale Revisited) at the ICU exit would
      permit an exhaustive screening of patients at risk for PTSD and could permit to propose them
      an adapted care and then limit the emergence of PTSD and its consequences..

      In this study, the investigators will screen acute stress symptoms within 8 days following
      the ICU's exit, using the IES-R, in order to evaluate his ability to predict the emergence of
      a PTSD at three months. IES-R is an auto-questionnaire, easy and fast with good psychometrics
      capacities for PTSD.
