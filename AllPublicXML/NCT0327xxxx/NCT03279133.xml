  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection was reported to range between 10% and up
      to 30% prior to institution of routine HCV screening in recipients of HCT (hematopoietic cell
      transplantation). In an Italian prospective study 6% of HCT candidates were positive for HCV
      RNA. HCV in recipients of HCT carries both short-term and long-term consequences. In the
      short-term those with HCV after hematopoietic cell transplantation have been associated with
      risk for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome especially in patients with some level of hepatic
      dysfunction going in to the transplant. In addition, the type of conditioning chemotherapy
      (e.g., busulfan) and radiation may increase risk for sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. The
      rate of hematopoietic recovery was found to be lower in HCV infected recipients, with delayed
      neutrophil and platelet engraftment.

      In the long-term, HCV may flare up once immunosuppression is being tapered off. The issue of
      reactivation of viral hepatitis (HBV and HCV) after HCT has been well documented. The risk
      for HCV reactivation in allogenic HCT in one study was reported at 100% by 12 months after
      HCT, with risk for death related to HCV of 8%. Also, of concern is rapid progression of liver
      disease in long-term survivors of HCV+ HCT. In such patients, cumulative incidence of
      cirrhosis has been reported in up to 11% and 24% at 15 and 20 years after HCT respectively.

      Hepatitis C infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, due to the
      short-term and long-term complications associated with it. Treatment of hepatitis C virus
      with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents pre-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in
      candidates with hepatitis C may lead to reduction of both short-term and long-term
      complications from it.

      Treatment with DAA's pre-HCT in candidates with hepatitis C would potentially prevent
      complications of hepatitis C infection; prevent reactivation of hepatitis C post-HCT, prevent
      delay in hematopoietic recovery (especially neutrophils and platelet), possibly reduce risk
      for sinsusoidal obstruction syndrome, prevent relapse of malignancy that could be related to
      hepatitis C (non-Hodgkin lymphoma), reduce non-relapse mortality and long-term complications
      (cirrhosis).

      This is an open-label observational/ feasibility study to treat candidates for HCT infected
      with hepatitis C prior to the transplantation to reduce the complications associated with
      hepatitis C in the post-transplant setting.

      The study will be conducted at Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center and City of Hope
      National Medical Center, Duarte, CA.

      There is no data available on the outcomes of treating hepatitis C with DAA's pre-HCT in
      candidates with hepatitis C infection. The ASBMT task force made recommendation to consider
      treating hepatitis C infection pre-HCT based on potential benefits it may be associated with.
      A single case report has documented benefit of treating a donor infected with hepatitis C
      prior to stem cell collection with DAA and ribavirin

      Subject Population will include autologous or allogeneic HCT candidates (for hematologic
      malignancy) who have hepatitis C infection. Subjects will be considered treatment-experienced
      if they have received prior interferon-based therapy. Treatment-experienced patients with
      prior use of DAA(s) are excluded from study participation.

      This study will treat HCV patients prior to HCT, with the goal of reducing early post HCT
      complications in the first 100 days post HCT followed by measuring outcomes at 2 years post
      HCT.

      Subjects will receive LDV 90mg/SOF 400mg FDC for 12 weeks.
