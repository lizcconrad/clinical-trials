    <textblock>
      Phase II trial in which patients with metastatic solid tumors experiencing progression after
      first line standard chemotherapy or for which there is no standard chemotherapy, and for
      which pembrolizumab does not have an FDA or compendia listing approved indication, will
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic or recurrent solid malignancy who have progressed on first line
      standard of care treatment or for which defined standard of care does not exist or is not
      readily available are eligible to participate on this trial. Patients for which pembrolizumab
      has an FDA approved indication and for whom pembrolizumab is covered by their insurance
      should receive standard commercial pembrolizumab and will not be eligible for this trial.

      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the Immune-Related Objective Response Rate
      (IR-ORR) achieved with pembrolizumab in patients with Fanconi Anemia Repair Pathway
      functionally competent and functionally deficient tumors.

      Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all
      procedures/assessments have been completed. Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days
      before or after the scheduled Day 1 of each cycle due to administrative reasons.

      All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis.

      Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks. Target
      infusion timing is 30 minutes.
