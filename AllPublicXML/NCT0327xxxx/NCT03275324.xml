  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Capnostream 20p monitor by Medtronic is FDA-cleared and consists of a monitor which
      measures real-time respiratory status based on respiratory rate, pulse rate, pulse oximetry
      (SpO2) and end tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) with a disposable nasal canula.

      The integrated pulmonary index (IPI) is an algorithm driven parameter derived from
      non-invasive etCO2, respiratory rate, pulse rate and SpO2. Fuzzy logic is used to produce a
      value from 1-10 with 4 and under requiring intervention and 8-10 representing the normal
      range.

      The purpose of this observational study is to determine if the IPI is associated with
      complications in the immediate postoperative period.

      The study will enroll approximately 600 patients at 2 centers. Clinicians will be blinded to
      the IPI therefore this device will not be used to guide care in any way.
