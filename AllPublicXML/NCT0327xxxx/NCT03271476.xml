  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist in an adjustment/adaptation of the &quot;standard EMDR protocol&quot; for cancer
      disease, and most particulary for women who present a breast cancer and during adjuvant
      therapy. It will also test the faisability of the research, with a view to adjust the
      calendar and the ressources to put at disposal for a randomized control trial that follow.
      This study will also allow to test the need and acceptibility of this new psychotherapy for
      the patient, and to identify facilitators and obstacles : participation/rejection ratio,
      inclusion rythm, adhesion of the medical staff about the project
