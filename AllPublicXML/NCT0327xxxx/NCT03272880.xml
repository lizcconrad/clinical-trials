      Objective:

      Primary:

      To assess the feasibility and acceptability of arts-based programming for community-dwelling
      cancer survivors and caregivers. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed based on:

        1. Recruitment

        2. Participation

        3. Retention (drop-outs)

        4. Satisfaction

      Secondary:

      To assess the participants' ability to:

        1. Define goals and strategies using the contents of the program.

        2. Implement the strategies in their daily activities in the short-term.

        3. Continue to use these strategies after the program ends.

      Exploratory:

      To perform exploratory analyses on the impact of arts-based programming on health,
      resilience, and well-being.
