      Aim of the study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental evaluations the
      activity of a &quot;revitalizing&quot; face treatment consisting of a day and a night cream, applied
      for an uninterrupted period of 3 months, by female volunteers, aged 35-60 years, with
      aging/photo aging of moderate grade.
