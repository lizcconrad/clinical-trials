  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. In case of untreatable suffering at the end of life, palliative sedation may be
      chosen to assure comfort by reducing the patient's level of consciousness. An important
      question here is whether such sedated patients are certainly completely free of pain. Because
      these patients cannot communicate anymore, caregivers have to rely on observation to assess
      the patient's comfort. Recently however, more sophisticated techniques from the neurosciences
      (fMRI, EEG) have shown that sometimes consciousness and pain is undetectable with these
      traditional behavioral methods.

      Therefore there is an urgent need for a more reliable way of assessment by combining existing
      observational scales, subjective assessments of caregivers and family and neuroimaging
      techniques.

      Aim. The aim of this study is to better understand how unconscious palliative sedated
      patients experience the last days of their life and to find out if they are really free of
      pain.

      Methods In this study the investigators will observe 40 patients starting with initiation of
      palliative sedation until death.

      Assessment of comfort based on behavioural observations will be related with the results from
      a NeuroSense monitor, an EEG-based brain monitor used for evaluation of the adequacy of
      anesthesia and sedation in the operating room and an ECG-based Analgesia Nociception Index
      (ANI) monitor, which informs about the comfort or discomfort condition of the organism, based
      on the parasympathetic tone (including calculation of ANI). Additionally, the researchers
      will investigate whether changes of these measures can be linked to changes in the patients'
      experience as observed by caregivers and relatives, especially in the last moments of life.
      An innovative and challenging aspect of this study is its qualitative approach, implying all
      the different types of data will be used to link &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;subjective&quot; data to achieve
      a holistic understanding of the study topics.

      The following data will be collected:

        -  assessment of pain/comfort by the patients themselves before loss of consciousness due
           to deep continuous sedation (if possible) by scoring a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

        -  brain function monitoring (NeuroSense monitor)

        -  monitoring of parasympathetic tone (ANI monitor)

        -  assessment by caregivers on 3 VAS scales (different scales or 3 different caregivers?)

        -  relatives' perception of the quality of the dying process on 3 VAS scales (idem)

        -  assessment by 2 trained investigators using observational scales

        -  observation: video and audio registration
