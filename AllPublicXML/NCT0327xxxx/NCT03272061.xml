  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive performance is negatively related to an impaired glucose metabolism, possibly due
      to impairments in brain vascular function. Supported by the statement from the American Heart
      and Stroke Association that physical exercise is one of the most effective strategies to
      protect against cognitive decline, we now hypothesize that exercise-induced changes in
      glucose metabolism cause beneficial effects on brain vascular function thereby improving
      cognitive performance. The primary objective of this intervention study is thus to evaluate
      in sedentary elderly men the effect of a 8-week aerobic-based exercise program on cerebral
      blood flow, as quantified by the non-invasive gold standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      perfusion method Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). Cerebral blood flow is a robust and sensitive
      physiological marker of brain vascular function. Secondary objectives are to examine effects
      on glucose metabolism using the oral glucose tolerance test and cognitive performance as
      assessed with a neurophysiological test battery.
