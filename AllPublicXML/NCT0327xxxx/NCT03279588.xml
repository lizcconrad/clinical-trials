    <textblock>
      Colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition in patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department (ED) with abdominal pain. The diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected
      acute diverticulitis is often made by CT imaging with intravenous contrast, which involves
      radiation exposure, is expensive and has contraindications. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and role of bedside abdominal US for the diagnosis of acute
      diverticulitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition; about 20% of patients with colonic
      diverticulosis experience abdominal symptoms and, eventually, complications such as episodes
      of diverticulitis or bleeding. The distinction between patients with uncomplicated or
      complicated diverticulitis affects the clinical management: medical therapy for the first,
      interventional therapy for the latter. CT imaging with intravenous contrast has become the
      gold standard in the diagnosis and staging of patients with suspected acute diverticulitis
      but, unfortunately, CT involves radiation exposure, is expensive and has contraindications.
      UltraSound (US) is a real-time dynamic examination with wide availability and easy
      accessibility and may be useful in diagnosing and managing critically ill patients who cannot
      be moved to CT. In a recent meta-analysis, US exam performed by Radiologists showed a pooled
      sensitivity of 90% (vs 95% for CT, p = 0.86) and a specificity of 90% (vs 96% for CT, p =
      0.04). US is increasingly used at bedside to rapidly assess patients presenting to the
      Emergency Department. No previous studies have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of
      abdominal US performed by physician at bedside as an extension of physical examination. This
      study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of bedside abdominal US.

    <description>Patients presenting to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain suspected of acute diverticulitis are evaluated with standard care by an Emergency Physician (tutor); at the time the tutor requests an imaging test performed by Radiologist (CT scan or US scan), he notifies another physicians skilled in bedside abdominal US (ultrasonographer), who evaluates the patient and performs the US scan. Ultrasonographer after completation of US and knowing blood samples results fills in a standardized form reporting the diagnostic hypotesis, the need for additional work-up (if deemed necessary), and the disposition of the patient. The standardized form completed by the ultrasonographer will be compared with the actual management of the patient.</description>
