      Primary end point of the study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental
      evaluations tolerance and efficacy of SUNEKOS ® 200 injectable treatment on main sign of face
      skin photoaging; the micro-injections of the study product were performed by a specialized
      dermatologist, bilaterally on the face (zygomatic protuberance, nostril's angle, inferior
      margin of tragus, lip marionette lines, mandibular angle) of female volunteers aged 45-65
      years, with photoaging of mild/moderate grade.
