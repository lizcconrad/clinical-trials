  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic postoperative pain (CPSP) is common symptom in patients after surgery, seriously
      affected the quality of life. Accumulating evidences have demonstrated dexmedetomidine can
      improve chronic pain. However, the prevention of dexmedetomidine on CPSP remain uncertain.

      Chronic postoperative pain (CPSP) is defined as pain persisting at least 3 months after
      surgery. It is most common in patients who undergoing breast or thoracic surgery.
      Dexmedetomidine, a adrenergic Î±2 agonists, can alleviate the postoperative pain 24 h after
      surgery. In our study, patients were randomly assigned to one of the two group to receive
      0.5mg/kg/h infusion dexmedetomidine (Group D, n=57) or normal saline (Group C, n=57). The
      pain scales were evaluated day 1, day 2, day 3, month 3, month 6 after surgery.
