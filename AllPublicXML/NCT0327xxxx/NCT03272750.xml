      Controlled, randomized, double blind study, for the evaluation of tolerance and trichological
      efficacy of a food supplement: Bioscalin® new formulation versus reference formulation
      currently on the market and placebo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to evaluate clinically and by non-invasive instrumental measurements the
      trichological activity of a food supplement taken for 3 months by subjects of both sexes,
      aged between 18-60 years, affected by telogen effluvium, with a percentage of hair in anagen
      phase &lt; 75%.

      In particular the study foresaw the evaluation of the trichological activity of the
      Bioscalin® new formulation with Galeopsis Segetum in comparison to a reference product
      currently on the market and to placebo.

      It was also aim of this study to evaluate treatment tolerance.
