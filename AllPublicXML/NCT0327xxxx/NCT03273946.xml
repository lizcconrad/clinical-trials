  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the prophylactic treatment of asthma, FP inhaled aerosol (Flixotide ®) administered via a
      pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) was approved in China in adults, adolescents older
      than 16 years of age and children aged 4 to 16 years. This post-marketing safety monitoring
      program will evaluate the safety profile of FP 50 micrograms (µg) inhaled via a pediatric
      spacer device with a face mask in Chinese subjects aged 1 to &lt;4 years. The adverse drug
      reactions (ADRs) and predictors of these adverse reactions among subjects will be reported.
      This single arm observational study will include subjects prescribed with FP 50 µg inhaled
      via a pediatric spacer device with a face mask. The maximum duration of the study will be 12
      weeks with 3 visits. Visit 1 (Day 1) will be on-site visit and will also mark the start of
      the observational program. The follow-up visits will be scheduled at Visit 2 (Week 4), and
      Visit 3 (Week 12) conducted on site or by telephone. A total of 150 asthmatic subjects who
      have been prescribed FP 50 µg treatment for appropriate medical use for the first time in
      China will be enrolled in the study. Flixotide is a registered trademark of GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) group of companies.
