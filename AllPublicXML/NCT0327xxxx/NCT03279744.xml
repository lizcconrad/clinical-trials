      A Prospective, Single-Arm, Open-Label, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of
      Photodynamic Therapy Using Radion™-pdt in Patients with Oral Precancerous Lesion (Oral
      Verrucous Hyperplasia or Oral Erythroleukoplakia).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      topical Radion™-pdt for treatment of patients with oral verrucous hyperplasia (OVH) or oral
      erythroleukoplakia (OEL).

      Total duration of the study will be up to 40 weeks (from screening throughout study until
      completion) as follows:

        -  Screening (within 2 weeks before dosing)

        -  Treatment period (up to 14 weeks)

        -  Safety follow-up period (within 2 weeks after final treatment)

        -  Follow-up period (final treatment plus 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 16 weeks and 24 weeks
           respectively) All enrolled patients will receive up to 8 treatments (once every two
           weeks) during a maximum of 14-week study treatment period. The treated lesion will be
           clinically evaluated and documented (clinical photograph) at each treatment visit.

             with histological evidence of oral precancerous lesions. Besides, patients should have
             at least one lesion whose size should not exceed 4 cm in the greatest diameter and the
             distance between two lesions should not less than 1 cm.

          3. Patient who is willing and able to comply with study procedures and sign informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with history of hypersensitivity to any photosensitizer (including
             5-aminolevulinic acid HCl or porphyrins), acute or chronic types of porphyria;

          2. Record of previous unsuccessful treatment with photodynamic therapy;

          3. Patients who have been diagnosed as having oral cancer or carcinoma in situ;

          4. Patients who have a history or evidence of a medical condition that would expose them
             to an undue risk of a significant adverse event during the course of the trial,
             including but not limited to hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine,
             immune, neurological, hematological, gastrointestinal or psychiatric disease as
             determined by the clinical judgment of the investigator;

          5. Patients with impaired hepatic function (defined as AST and/or ALT &gt; 2× the upper
             limit of normal values), and/or impaired renal function (defined as serum creatinine &gt;
             1.5 mg/dL);

          6. Female patient of childbearing potential who:

               -  is lactating; or

               -  has positive urine pregnancy test at visit -1; or

               -  refuses to adopt reliable method of contraception during the study;

          7. Patient has received any other investigational agent within 28 days or 5 half-lives,
