      This trial will examine the contribution of massage therapy and mindfulness to
      tobacco-smoking women in the third trimester of pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Massage therapy may be a viable approach to decrease stress during pregnancy that may in turn
      reduce tobacco consumption. Massage therapy may not be sufficient as a stand-alone approach,
      and may be better suited partnered with a cessation approach that targets another mechanism
      of addiction, craving. Therefore, participants (N=60) will be enrolled in the Craving to
      Quit速 tobacco cessation program, designed by researchers at Yale, which employs a
      mindfulness-based approach to train participants to recognize and bring cravings into their
      conscious awareness. Each mother will be randomly assigned to a bi-weekly massage
      intervention (n=30) or control (n=30) group. Participants in the intervention group will
      receive two prenatal massages a week for a three-week period.

    <description>We will utilize moderate pressure Swedish massage (SM) that utilizes long slow strokes known as effleurage and kneading strokes known as petrissage. A specific routine will be performed on each participant with focus on low back, upper back, shoulders, and neck musculature. Consistent moderate pressure, which is lighter than deep tissue massage but deeper than brush strokes, will be used.</description>
