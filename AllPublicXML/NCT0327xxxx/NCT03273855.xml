    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled prospective trial with sixty
      patients to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on body weight
      in patients with severe obesity. We will also collect data that possibly could give a better
      understanding of mechanisms of this correlation.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a main threat to public health in western countries. This condition increases the
      risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, physical stress disorders,
      dispose for cancer and contributes to increased overall morbidity and mortality. However
      sustained weight loss lead to the reduction of risk factors and improvement of several
      obesity related co-morbidities.

      Currently there are mainly two established treatments for severe obesity: a conservative
      approach through lifestyle intervention and a surgical approach with bariatric surgery. The
      gut microbiota is recognized as an environmental modulator of nutritional uptake and body
      weight. This has led to the hypothesis that the gut microbiota could be a therapeutic target
      fighting obesity. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied for more than 50
      years, and is a established treatment for refractory recurrent infection with Clostridium
      Difficile (CDI). Recent scientific studies have also applied FMT as treatment for other
      diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel disease and even metabolic syndrome
      and the results are promising.

      The investigators are planning a randomized, double-blinded and placebo controlled
      prospective trial with sixty patients to investigate the effect of fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT) on body weight in patients with severe obesity. In the trial there will
      also be collected data that possibly could give a better understanding of mechanisms of this
      correlation; with insulin resistance, blood pressure, inflammation and biochemical parameters
      of hepatic steatosis, hunger related hormons, changes in the patients microbiota and the
      development in quality of life as secondary outcome measures.

    <description>The intervention treatment is fecal microbiota transplantation made of frozen donor feces. The FMT is transferred as rectal enema where we use a rectal probe with a balloon to prevent leakage and keep the solution long enough in the colon. The patient will stay on the bench in different positions for 20 minutes. We will encourage the participant to keep the solution in the colon as long as possible and give them four pills of loperamide before the procedure in order to reduce bowel motility.</description>
