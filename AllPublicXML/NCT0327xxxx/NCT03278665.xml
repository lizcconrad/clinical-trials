  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ib/II open-label, multi-center study with a priming cycle of 4SC-202 to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of combination treatment with 4SC-202 and
      Pembrolizumab. A dose expansion cohort at the Recommended Phase Two Dose (RPTD) will be
      added.

      Adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) cutaneous melanoma primary
      refractory or non-responding to anti-PD-1 therapy as most current systemic anti-cancer
      therapy and for whom no standard therapy is available, will be enrolled. The last
      administration of anti-PD-1 therapy must have been performed within 6 months prior to
      screening.

    <description>Duration of response (DOR) is defined as the time from the first documentation of response to the date of disease progression. Patients who have no documented disease progression at the end of the study or who are lost to follow-up or who receive additional anti-neoplastic therapy after discontinuing 4SC-202 and Pembrolizumab will be censored at the date of their last extent of disease assessment or on the first date of additional therapy, respectively.</description>

             nodal lesions

          -  At least one tumor site (either primary site or metastasis) must be accessible for
             sequential biopsies and patient must consent to the 3 mandatory biopsies.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who achieved, during or after prior anti-PD-1 therapy, a response of complete
             response (CR) or partial response (PR); or stable disease (SD) of a duration of more
             than 6 months (counted from the first dose of prior anti-PD-1 therapy to first date of
             documented progression)

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastases/central nervous system (CNS) involvement

          -  Patients with inadequate organ function

          -  Therapy with agents known to prolong the QT interval and increase the risk for
             Torsades de Pointes
