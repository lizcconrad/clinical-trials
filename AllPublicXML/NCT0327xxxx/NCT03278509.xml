  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long-term beta-blocker therapy has not been investigated in contemporary randomized clinical
      trials in patients with myocardial infarction and normal heart function. The aim of this
      study is to determine whether long-term treatment with oral beta-blockade in patients with
      myocardial infarction and preserved left ventricular systolic ejection fraction reduces the
      composite of death of any cause or new myocardial infarction..

      REDUCE-SWEDEHEART is designed as a registry-based, randomized, parallel, open-label,
      multicenter trial.

      Patients, day 1-7 after myocardial infarction, who have undergone a coronary angiography and
      with preserved left ventricular systolic ejection fraction will be randomized to either oral
      beta-blockade (see &quot;Intervention&quot; for detailed description) at a dose according to the
      treating physician, or no beta-blockade. To allow quick inclusion the randomization module
      will be accessible by a simple web-based log-in procedure. Concomitantly, all baseline data
      about each individual patient will be collected from the SWEDEHEART registry. Patients will
      then be followed regarding all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial
      fibrillation, and patient-related outcome measures (for a subgroup of patients). Patients
      that are eligible but not included in REDUCE-SWEDEHEART will also be followed regarding
      chosen treatment and the primary and secondary endpoints.

      Follow-up will continue until 944 primary endpoints have been observed (endpoint driven). All
      analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat set, defined as all intentionally
      randomized patients, by randomized treatment. The primary endpoint is death or new MI.
      Information about death will be obtained from the Swedish population registry. Information
      regarding new myocardial infarction during hospitalization and readmission because of
      myocardial infarction or other outcome (secondary outcomes, see section below), will be
      obtained from the SWEDEHEART-registry (for myocardial infarction) and the patient registry of
      the National board of health and welfare.

    <description>Patients randomized to beta-blockade will be prescribed oral beta-blocker (metoprolol succinate or bisoprolol) at a dose according to the treating physician. Metoprolol succinate will be strongly recommended as first choice. Bisoprolol will be allowed as an alternative. Atenolol (or any other beta-blocker therapy) will not be allowed. The treating physician will be encouraged to aim for a dose of ≥ 100 mg for metoprolol succinate and ≥ 5 mg for bisoprolol. Prescribed treatment and dosing will be registered. Initiation (whether the prescribed drug is dispensed) and adherence (defined as proportion of prescribed tablets that are dispensed), and persistence (time on treatment) will also be recorded via the Drug prescription registry.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to no beta-blockade will be discouraged to use beta-blockade as long as there is no other indication than strictly secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Patients assigned to no beta-blockade also receive best evidence-based care, without beta-blockers. For blood pressure control, other drugs than beta-blockers will be recommended as first-line treatment. Regarding later use of beta-blockade, follow up is performed in the Drug prescription registry. Patients will be asked to provide future physicians with the written information about the study when beta-blockade treatment is discussed.</description>
