      Objective: To make use of admission Modified Functional Ambulation Category (MFAC) as a
      stratification tool to reveal profiles of functional outcomes of patients with stroke in
      inpatient rehabilitation.

      Design: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of the demographic, functional outcomes
      of patients with stroke in an inpatient rehabilitation centre. A total of 2,722 patients
      completed a stroke rehabilitation program from 2011 to 2015 were recruited.

      Design: This was a retrospective, descriptive study of the demographic, functional outcomes
      of patients with stroke in an inpatient rehabilitation centre. A total of 2,722 patients
      completed a stroke rehabilitation program from 2011 to 2015 were recruited. The patients were
      divided into seven groups according to their admission Modified Functional Ambulation
      Category (MFAC). The between-group difference in length of stay (LOS), functional outcomes at
      admission and discharge including Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (MRMI) and Modified
      Barthel Index (MBI) as well as MRMI gain, MRMI efficiency, MBI gain and MBI efficiency were
      analyzed.

    <measure>Change in Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (MRMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>MRMI was used to assess subjects' mobility in this study. The MRMI is highly reliable between raters (ICC= 0.98) and has high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93) to early stage patients with stroke. The MRMI consists of eight test items, including turning over, changing from lying to sitting, maintaining sitting balance, going from sitting to standing, standing, transferring, walking indoors, and climbing stairs. The score of MRMI range from 0 to 40. One main characteristic of the MRMI is that participants are scored by observation of their performance on the items directly. Change in MRMI i.e. MRMI gain is the difference between pre-discharge MRMI and admission MRMI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Modified Barthel Index (MBI) Gain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>MBI was used to assess subjects' basic activities of daily living (ADL) in this study. MBI measures the subject's performance on ten functional items including self-care, continence, and locomotion. The values assigned to each item are based on the amount of physical assistance required to perform the task and added to give a total score ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = fully dependent, 100 = fully independent) with higher score indicating higher levels of physical function. There are no subtotal score because there are no sub-scales. The internal consistency reliability coefficient for MBI is 0.90. Change in MBI i.e. MBI gain is the difference between pre- discharge MBI and admission MBI.</description>
