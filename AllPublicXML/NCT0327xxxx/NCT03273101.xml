      Background: Manual lifting is a common method to train the sit-to-stand, in which repetition
      is important. Alternate training regimen by mechanical device may be opted to avoid staff
      injury.

      Objective: The purpose of the study is to investigate the repetitive mechanical training to
      improve the independence of standing up.

      Methods: A total of 38 participants were randomised into two groups. Both groups had no
      lesser than 100 repetitions or 10 minutes/day of training sessions. Berg Balance Scale (BBS),
      Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (MRMI), Sit-and-Reach test (SRT), Five-Repetition
      Sit-to-Stand Test (5XSST), Sit-to-Stand Test from the Balance Master® (SST) were assessed in
      baseline, after 5 days and 10 days of training.
