    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) among patients with reduced myocardial function
      remains a surgical challenge despite improvement in surgical technique, myocardial protection
      and postoperative care. Such cases are considered as high risk and associated with a higher
      peri-operative mortality than those with normal left ventricular function (LVF). Patients
      with low EF are at higher risks of sudden death, ventricular arrhythmia, and worsening heart
      failure due to recurrent ischemia. Therefore,early recognition of patients at risk for a
      worse outcome plays a pivotal role in the decision making process, allowing the prompt
      institution of an adequate support.

    <textblock>
      Current treatment options for Chronic Unstable Angina patients with low Ejection Fraction
      include intensive medical therapy, surgical revascularization, ventricular remodeling, and
      heart transplantation. Medical treatment alone is problematic because of limited long-term
      survival. Heart transplantation offers excellent results with a 65.6 % 5-year survival rate;
      however, the scarcity of donor organs, the need for lifelong immunosuppression and the fact
      that heart transplantation has been restricted to those without co-morbid medical conditions
      and relatively restricted to those younger than 65 years of age makes this option impractical
      for a majority of patients. As a result, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is the
      optimal therapeutic approach and remains superior to medical therapy. Numerous controlled
      trials of coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with low left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF), have shown that these are the patients that benefit most from
      revascularization, especially if symptoms of angina or ischemia are present. This benefit is
      not only for symptoms, but also on longevity. It is believed that the most important factor
      for successful surgical recovery may be the viability of revascularized myocardium.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Angiographic indication for revascularization based upon symptoms of angina and/or
             objective evidence of myocardial ischemia.

          2. Preoperative EF ≤ 40 %.

          3. Preoperative myocardial viability (by cardiac MRI).

          4. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply with study
             requirements.

          5. Patient is willing to comply with all follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe congestive heart failure (class III or IV according to NYHA, or pulmonary
             edema, cardiogenic shock) at the time of enrollment.

          2. Prior surgery with the opening of pericardium.

          3. Evidence of non-viable (scarred) myocardium.

          4. Prior stroke (within 6 months)or more than 6 months if there are substantial
             neurological defects.

          5. Acute ST-elevation MI within 72 hours prior to enrollment requiring revascularization.

          6. Planned simultaneous surgical procedure unrelated to coronary revascularization (e.g.
             valve repair/replacement, aneurysmectomy, carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting).

          7. Significant leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, or known bleeding
             diathesis.

          8. Intolerance or contraindication to aspirin or both clopidogrel and ticlopidine.

          9. Extra-cardiac illness that is expected to limit survival to less than 5 years e.g.
             oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, active hepatitis or
             significant hepatic failure, severe renal disease.

         10. EF ≤ 20 %.
