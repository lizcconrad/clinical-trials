    <textblock>
      Current data are showing a potential link between inflammatory biomarkers in chronic
      periodontitis and COPD. However the impact of periodontal treatment on systemic inflammation
      as measured by biomarkers and time to occurrence of acute exacerbations (AECOPD) remains an
      important but unresolved issue. This pilot study will provide information on effects of
      periodontal treatment on systemic inflammation and the course of COPD including acute
      exacerbation.

      40 patients with chronic periodontitis and COPD will be included in this study. First
      baseline information (age, gender, lifestyle, smoking history, medical history, medication,
      frequency of exacerbation, dental treatments) are recorded. Then patient's health status is
      assessed using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and a comprehensive lung function testing
      (bodyplethysmograph) is conducted to assess lung functional severity of COPD. Blood samples
      are taken for analysis of various inflammatory biomarkers and saliva and sputum samples are
      collected for analysis of microbiome.

      Afterwards experienced dentists will conduct oral health examination and record the
      periodontal conditions of every patient. Samples of gingival crevicular fluid for determining
      Matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP8), Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) and Interleukin 6 (IL-69
      levels and for microbiome analysis will be taken. After randomization to one of the two study
      groups (intervention group: periodontal treatment / control group: no periodontal treatment)
      all patients get comprehensive oral hygiene instructions, irrespective of their periodontal
      status . Patients of the control group receive no further planned dental intervention. For
      patients of the experimental group, who need periodontal treatment due to the presence of
      periodontal pocket depth of ≥ 4 mm an appropriate care plan will be determined and supra- and
      subgingival scaling and root planing will be performed.

      During a 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up patient's current health condition will be assessed
      using the CAT. Additionally lung function tests (bodyplethysmograph) will be performed and
      clinical periodontal parameters are re-evaluated. To detect and assess COPD exacerbations in
      this trial, patients will complete a daily diary during the whole follow-up period which will
      be provided to the clinical researcher at each study visit. Furthermore the cough and sputum
      assessment questionnaire (CASA-Q)) will be used at each telephone call and at each visit in
      the pulmonary center. After 6 and 12 months blood, sputum, saliva and gingival crevicular
      fluid will be taken additionally. To understand the microbial ecology mechanisms linking
      periodontitis to COPD combined analysis of oral cavity microbiome (GCF) and lung microbiome
      (sputum) will be conducted. The biomarkers high sensitive C-reactive Protein (hsCRP), MMP8,
      IL-1beta und IL-6 will be determined in blood and in gingival crevicular fluid, respectively.
