    <intervention_name>Endovascular treatment of bifurcation aneurysm with pCONUS2</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients suffering from a bifurcation aneurysm will be treated endovascularly with the pCONUS2 device.
The patients do not face any additional risks by participating in the study as the treatment does not differ from the standard of care in any way.
The patients will only be enrolled in the study if they give their written consent.
If they do not wish to participate in the observational study or if they wish to withdraw from it at a later date, they will not have any disadvantages.</description>

          9. Current involvement in another study or trial.

         10. Women of child bearing potential or breast-feeding who cannot provide a negative
             pregnancy test.

             cannot be controlled medically.

         12. A medical condition interfering with a dual antiplatelet treatment.

         13. Known coagulopathy.

         14. Intracranial hemorrhage in the past 30 days apart from the target aneurysm.

         15. Ischemic stroke in the past 30 days.

         16. Myocardial infarction in the past 30 days.

         17. Major surgery in the past 30 days.

         18. Evidence of active infection at time of treatment.

         19. Co -morbidities or conditions with a life expectancy less than 12 months.

         20. Additional Exclusion criteria for ruptured aneurysm at the acute phase:

               1. The patient is clinically severely affected (Hunt and Hess grade IV and V).

               2. Severe vasospasm is proven during angiography.

               3. Proven parenchymal hemorrhage by CT or MRI.

               4. Proven subdural hematoma by CT or MRI.
