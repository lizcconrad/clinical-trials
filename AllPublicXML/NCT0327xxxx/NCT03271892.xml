      This is a prospective observational study.

        1. In the first part of the study, consenting eligible adult patients with low risk
           papillary thyroid cancer that is confined to the thyroid, are provided verbal and
           written information about their disease and the option of active surveillance (close
           monitoring with intention to treat if disease progresses or if the patient changes
           her/his mind), as an alternative to thyroid surgery (thyroidectomy - traditional
           standard of care). Patients are free to make their own disease management choice (ie.
           active surveillance or thyroidectomy) and the investigators are examining how often
           patients choose each of these options. The investigators are also examining the reasons
           for their choice.

        2. In the second part of the study, consenting, eligible patients who completed the
           preceding part of the study and chose either a) active surveillance, or b) thyroid
           surgery, are tracked with respect to clinical and psychosocial outcomes as well as
           quality of life. Patients who chose active surveillance are free to change their mind
           and have surgery at any point, even if the disease does not progress. The primary study
           outcome is decision regret at one year, in the respective groups of patients who chose
           active surveillance or thyroidectomy.

      This is a prospective observational study, consisting of multiple parts.

        1. In the first part of the study, eligible, consenting adult patients with low risk
           papillary thyroid cancer who have not had thyroid surgery, are provided with verbal and
           written information about the disease prognosis, surgical treatment outcomes, and the
           option of active surveillance (close monitoring with the intention of treatment if there
           is disease progression or if the patient changes her/his mind), as an alternative to
           immediately proceeding with thyroidectomy. The primary outcome of this part of the study
           is the final disease management decision of the patient (ie. active surveillance or
           thyroid surgery) and we are also examining patients' reasons for their choice.

        2. In the second part of this study, eligible consenting patients who completed the
           preceding part of the study and chose either: a) active surveillance, or b) thyroid
           surgery, are tracked with respect to disease, treatment, psychosocial outcomes, and
           quality of life. For patients under active surveillance, clinical follow-up is conducted
           at a participating study institution. For patients who choose surgery, surgery and
           related clinical follow-up may be performed at any institution (of the patient's
           choice), however, the thyroid cancer-related medical records are regularly reviewed.
           Questionnaires are mailed to patients at one year. The primary outcome for this study is
           decision regret (on the decision for active surveillance or surgery) at one year after
           initiating the disease management decision (ie. active surveillance or surgery). As the
           decision for surgery or active surveillance is up to the patient and the proportion of
           patients in each group is unknown, the results in respective groups will be reported
           separately for the primary analysis (and only compared if sufficient numbers are
           available in each group).

    <description>Patients under active surveillance choose to not have immediate thyroidectomy. Patients are closely monitored with respect to clinical status, ultrasound imaging, biochemical indices (thyroid function, thyroglobulin, and thyroglobulin antibodies) and any thyroid cancer-related treatments (if needed). Active surveillance is conducted at a participating study site. Criteria defining disease progression are established, and if such criteria are met, thyroid surgery is recommended to the patient. However, patients are free to choose to have thyroid surgery at any time, in the absence of disease progression. Thyroid cancer clinical and treatment outcomes are tracked by the study team.</description>

    <description>Patients who choose surgery, undergo thyroidectomy, as per current standards of care, by a surgeon of their choice in an institution of their choice. The treating surgeon, in discussion with the patient, will choose the extent of thyroid surgery that may be appropriate for the individual case. Post-surgical follow-up is per the discretion of the treating surgeon, endocrinologist, or other healthcare providers involved in the patient's thyroid cancer care. Thyroid cancer clinical and treatment outcomes are tracked by the study team.</description>
