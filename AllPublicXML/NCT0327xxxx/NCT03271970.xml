  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify factors that may contribute to conductive hearing
      loss. Conductive hearing loss is a type that is due to a problem with the outer or middle
      ear. Because of this, sound does not travel through the ear normally. Perforated tympanic
      membranes of study patients will be photographed during the patient's routine visit using a
      digital otoscope. These pictures will be used to analyze perforation size as an absolute
      value as well as a percentage of the tympanic membrane. Audiometric results and CT scans of
      temporal bone (reports and images) collected as standard of care will be evaluated. Images of
      CT scans will be imported into a medical imaging software for creation of anatomically
      realistic 3D models of the middle ear and mastoid air space. Structural analysis on each 3D
      model will be conducted and analyzed, the volume of middle ear and mastoid air spaces will be
      recorded, and data points will be correlated with perforation size and location to audiogram
      results.
