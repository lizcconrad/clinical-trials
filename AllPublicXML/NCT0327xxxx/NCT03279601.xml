    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of Capecitabine Combined With
      Dacarbazine(CAPDTIC) and Capecitabine Combined Temozolomide(CAPTEM) in advanced or metastatic
      gastrointestinal pancreatic and esophageal neuroendocrine tumor.In this prospective
      randomized phase II study, the investigators aim to compare the survival benefit as well as
      the safety forCapecitabine Combined With Dacarbazine(CAPDTIC) versus Capecitabine Combined
      Temozolomide(CAPTEM) in advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal pancreatic and esophageal
      neuroendocrine tumor.

             severe liver disease (active hepatitis, cirrhosis), uncontrolled diabetes or
             hypertension, or pulmonary disease ( interstitial pneumonia, obstructive pulmonary
             disease or symptomatic bronchospasm);

          7. Prior long term steroid therapy (excluding short term steroid treatment which is
             completed prior to &gt; 2 weeks of study enrollment)；

          8. Meningeal carcinomatosis;

          9. Patients with central nervous system(CNS) disorder or peripheral nervous system

         12. History of other malignancy. However, subjects who have been disease-free for 5 years,
             or subjects with a history of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or
             successfully treated in situ carcinoma, are eligible；
