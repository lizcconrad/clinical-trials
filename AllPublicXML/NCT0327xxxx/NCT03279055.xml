    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether an adapted version of SHUTi (Sleep Healthy
      Using the Internet), a six-session online program which has been found to be effective in
      other groups of people, will be useful in treating insomnia in adolescent and young adult
      cancer survivors.

    <description>Participants will be provided with an individual access code for SHUTi
SHUTi is delivered over 6 sessions, each taking 20-30 minutes
SHUTi is delivered by a virtual therapist
Participants will learn about the etiology and maintenance of their insomnia
Participants will learn how to maintain their sleep log
Participants will learn how to address lifestyle barriers that impact their sleep
Participants will be taught stimulus control techniques targeting non-sleep behaviors in the bedroom
Participants will learn a range of cognitive techniques that address the key cognitive factors that perpetuate poor sleep behavior
Participants will be taught how to gradually expand their restricted sleep</description>
