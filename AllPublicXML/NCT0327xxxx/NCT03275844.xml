  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital malformations correspond to defects in organ morphogenesis identifiable at birth
      or intrauterine life, affecting 2-3% of births. Inside of these malformations, Congenital
      Heart Disease corresponds, in particular, to structural defects of the heart or major blood
      vessels thereof may or may not be associated with other types of syndromes.The resolution is
      usually surgical.

      Also, these patients present a decrease in physical fitness, psychological imbalance, lower
      quality of life and risk significant morbidity and mortality from respiratory infections
      among other problems.

      This can have severe consequences for health in the medium and long term. The habits acquired
      during childhood and adolescence are determinant for the adult life, being relevant levels of
      activity and physical condition, especially in children with pathologies.

      In this way, it is vital to know from childhood parameters that indicate the baseline state
      of these patients according to the levels of physical activity, exercise capacity,
      nutritional status and quality of life. These will be key indicators to take into account in
      the future, to adapt rehabilitation plans that will reduce the effects of their condition.

      The objective of this protocol is To characterize the levels of Activity, and Physical
      Capacity of children with congenital heart disease regularly treated at the Cardiovascular
      Center of Dr. Luis Hospital Calvo Mackenna, compared to healthy children matched by age and
      sex.
