      This study is a prospective, single-arm, single-center, pilot study of bronchoscopic
      Radio-Frequency Ablation (RFA) treatment of target lung lesions, prior to surgical tumor
      resection. Up to ten (10) subjects will be treated at the investigational site.

      Subjects identified for this study will be those that have a surgical resection already
      scheduled as part of their lung cancer treatment. Patients who have consented to participate
      in this study (enrolled) will undergo screening assessments to evaluate the inclusion
      criteria associated with their lung cancer and general health. Only patients that meet all of
      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be scheduled for RFA
      treatment.

      Prior to RFA, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans will be used to characterize
      the lesion and determine the access pathways for ablation. At the time of the RFA procedure,
      a point-of-entry, along a bronchial wall, is created under an image-guided navigation system.
      The RFA catheter is advanced down the access path until it reaches the tumor and RF is
      administered at the prescribed dose. Upon completion of the RFA treatment, the subject is
      immediately prepared for surgical resection in accordance with their lung cancer standard of
      care. There are no follow-up visits as part of this study, the subject is excited following
      surgical resection.

      The resected tissue will undergo pathological evaluation for tissue viability.
