  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest tumor types, there is no effective treatment method
      clinically. Recently radical surgical resection is recommended for this cancer, How to
      improve the survival rate of patients is the doctors' goals . Postoperative chemotherapy can
      partly raise post-operative survival rate. the purpose of this study is to three chemotherapy
      regimens(gemcitabine monotherapy, S-1 monotherapy and combining nab-paclitaxel with
      gemcitabine),which is best regimens for raising patients' survival rate, and will provide a
      chemotherapy choice for clinic therapy of pancreatic cancer.
