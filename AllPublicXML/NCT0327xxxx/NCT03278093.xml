  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional study which will look at the effects of AFO's and vibrating insoles on
      balance performance in people with CMT disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Balance impairments and falls are more common in people who have Charcot Marie Tooth disease
      (CMT) than in people without the condition. CMT is a condition which affects the nerves
      causing a variety of symptoms including sensation impairments and weakness. The impairments
      are usually most evident in the feet and hands, but they can progress very slowly moving
      closer to the trunk. Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO's) are often prescribed to help with walking
      and daily function. So far the effects of AFO's on standing balance in people who have CMT
      have not been looked at. Insoles are also often prescribed to realign foot deformity and
      reduce pain. Insoles which give a vibratory input have had a positive impact on walking in
      older people but have not been looked at in balance and in CMT. Insoles which give a
      vibration feedback to the sole of the foot when worn have been designed. This study will look
      at whether the use of AFO's and the vibratory insoles have an effect on standing balance in
      people with CMT or related peripheral neuropathy. Balance measurements will be taken in a
      single session comparing a variety of postures. Patients will be recruited from neurology
      outpatient clinics at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical or genetically confirmed diagnosis of CMT or related peripheral neuropathy

          2. Mixed sensory and motor presentation

          3. Over 18 years

          4. Able to stand unsupported for five minutes

          5. Able to walk for 50m with or without a walking stick or orthotic devices

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of other significant neurological disorders (such as multiple sclerosis,
             cerebrovascular diseases, epilepsy, movement disorders), or major comorbidities (e.g.
             vestibular dysfunction, use of medication which may affect balance, cognitive
             impairment, presence of medical conditions in which exercise training may be
             detrimental).

          2. Presence of peripheral neuropathy caused by a condition other than CMT.

          3. Limb surgery during the six months prior to screening (or planned before final
             assessment).

          4. Women of child-bearing age if they are pregnant, planning a pregnancy during their
             time in the study or in the 12 weeks following giving birth. This is due to the
             effects of pregnancy on balance.
