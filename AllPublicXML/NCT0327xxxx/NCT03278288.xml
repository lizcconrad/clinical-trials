    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effectiveness of the WellWe-intervention in promotion of parental
      self-efficacy for healthy behaviors and mindfulness in parenting from the perspective of
      families. Aim is also to evaluate the effectiveness of the WellWe-intervention in
      facilitation of family-centered approach of the health visit in Child health clinic perceived
      by the families and Public health nurses (PHN). Half of the participants will receive
      WellWe-intervention and half of the participants will receive usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Families with pre-school aged children attend to regular health visits in Child health
      clinics on a yearly basis. During the health visits PHNs assess and promote the health and
      wellbeing of the whole family through health discussions.

      In this study we aim to evaluate whether the addition of gamified method into the health
      discussion promotes healthy behaviors and mindfulness of the families and increases the
      family-centered approach of health visit compared to the traditional method.

      WellWe-intervention includes the use of gamified WellWe app at home and during the health
      discussion in the Child health clinic. Usual care includes paper-based questionnaires filled
      by the parents and health discussion using these questionnaires in the Child health clinic.

    <description>In this study we use version of the PDAP consisting of 21 items covering contextual circumstances that may either facilitate or impede parental self-efficacy (PSE) for promoting healthy dietary and physical activity behaviors in preschool children. Responses are made on an 11-point Likert scale, with anchors at 0 (not at all confident), 5 (moderately confident), and 10 (completely confident).</description>
