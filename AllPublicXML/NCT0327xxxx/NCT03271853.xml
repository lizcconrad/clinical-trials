    <textblock>
      FirstSense Medical, LLC is a medical device company which has developed a breast cancer
      screening device, the Sentinel BreastScan II [SBS II]. This radiation free device is being
      developed to produce data which will be analyzed by Therma-Scan Reference Laboratory. Dr.
      Hoekstra, CEO of Therma-Scan, is the author of a published paper based on breast thermal data
      with a reported 95% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The SBS II examination will take
      approximately 7 minutes.

      This study is designed to evaluate the Sentinel BreastScan II as well as the analysis of data
      by Therma-Scan. SBS II thermal breast data is an adjunctive aid to standard breast imaging.
      Currently, mammography is one of the standards of care in screening for visible signs of
      breast cancer. Breast thermology is the analysis of the heat signature data from an examined
      breast. All study costs will be incurred by the sponsor. Study subjects will incur no cost to
      participate. All scientific data revealed in this protocol will be used for the specific
      objectives of the study. The SBS II is a non-significant risk device. There is no contact
      with the subject during the entire procedure.

  <why_stopped>
    Trial temporarily halted to conduct additional device testing to verify cooling data. This
    temporary halt is NOT due to a potential risk to subject safety.

    <description>To measure the sensitivity and specificity of thermographic analysis based on the Marseilles analytic protocol [ Th 1 thru 5 ] to biopsy results predicated on standard breast imaging criteria [ BIRADS analytical protocol, B1 thru B5 ]. The resultant BIRADS score and biopsy pathological results will be compared to thermographic analysis [ Th1 thru 5 ] for each subject. 50 subjects undergoing both thermography and standard breast imaging leading to biopsy [ BIRADS 3 thru 5 ] will then be compared by measuring the results of each, BIRADS for standard breast imaging v the Marseilles Th system used in thermographic analysis, for concordance or discordance of findings as measured on final pathological analysis. This analysis will be performed for each subsequent 50 patient cohort undergoing standard mammographic/ultrasound breast imaging analysis.</description>

    <description>The SBS II will automate the recording of thermal data used in the Therma-Scan manual thermology protocol by utilizing a thermal camera sensitive to changes in breast temperature. The SBS II system uses a very sensitive thermography camera that detects and visually displays heat patterns that naturally emanate from the breast. SBS II captures this data digitally for subsequent analysis by Therma-Scan.</description>
