      Differentiating hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from hypertensive heart disease (HHD)
      unavoidably encounters diagnostic challenges especially in patient of suspected HCM with
      history of hypertension. Diverse and overlapping forms of HCM can often lead to ambiguity
      when diagnosis is based on a single genetic or morphological index.

      The investigators have deduced a integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
      imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD, the investigators
      aim to identify their method in the current multi-center trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and hypertensive heart disease (HHD) present left
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), but the prognosis varies. Nevertheless, the feasibility of
      distinguishing these two conditions is limited by the fact that overlapping LVH and diverse
      forms of HCM can often lead to diagnostic ambiguity when diagnosis is based on a single
      morphological index. Diagnosis is more difficult in a patient with a history of hypertension
      and with left ventricular wall thickness between 11 and 15 mm. It also puzzles the situation
      when hypertrophy without outflow-track obstruction was found in hypertensive subjects which
      might not be explained solely by the history of hypertension.

      The investigators have deduced an integrated formula based on cardiac magnetic resonance
      (CMR) imaging and established a differentiating flow-chart between HCM and HHD. In this
      study, the investigators aim to explore the applicability of the quantifying scheme for
      distinguishing HCM from HHD in the multi-center trial.

    <description>The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was diagnosed by left ventricular hypertrophy via echocardiography (wall thickness &gt;15 mm) with either genetic determination of a pathogenic mutation or ) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (end-diastolic wall thickness &gt;15 mm) with resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction or hypertrophy in a recognisable pattern, i.e., ventricular bulge in apical-variant HCM. And then patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were evaluated by the predetermined differentiating formula.</description>

    <arm_group_label>hypertensive heart disease group</arm_group_label>
    <description>The diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease was based on medical history and conventional echocardiography. Long durations of uncontrolled hypertension for at least 5 years with systolic blood pressure [BP] ≥150 mm Hg or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg or both in the absence of other cardiac or systemic diseases were used as criteria. And then patients with hypertensive heart disease were evaluated by the predetermined differentiating formula.</description>

    <description>The healthy age-matched controls were generally volunteers with a normal electrocardiogram, normal echocardiographic examination, and overall normal CMR findings. And then patients with normal findings were were evaluated by the predetermined differentiating formula.</description>

        Consecutive subjects were prospectively enrolled into 3 cohorts between July 2017 and June
        2020. The cohorts were divided as follows: the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypertensive
        heart disease and control groups
