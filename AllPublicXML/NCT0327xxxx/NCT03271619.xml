    <textblock>
      Patients at risk of developing life-threatening heart rhythms may require the implantation of
      a small device called a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), which constantly monitors the heart
      rhythm and delivers an electrical shock to the heart when indicated, in order to return the
      heart back to a normal rhythm. Many thousands of these devices have been implanted and are
      electrically active in patients who collapse and need resuscitation.

      When a patient with an ICD collapses, the device may discharge without warning while a
      rescuer is performing external chest compressions (cardiac massage). Conventional ICDs placed
      below the left collar bone typically deliver 35-50 J energy when they discharge, but newer
      ICDs placed under the skin (S-ICD) alongside the breastbone deliver a larger energy when
      discharging; typically 50-80J energy.

      Rescuers performing external chest compressions on a patient during conventional ICD
      discharge have reported the sensation of a painful electrical shock and permanent nerve
      damage. In these situations, rescuers appear to have been exposed to electrical current from
      the ICD considerably in excess of that which is considered a safe threshold.

      Studies of surface current resulting from discharge of conventional ICDs have been reported
      in excess of 100 mA which is far in excess of the safe 1 mA limit, and puts the rescuer at
      considerable risk of tissue damage and possible dangerous heart rhythms. The newer S-ICDs
      deliver approximately 50% more energy and have the potential to result in exposure of a
      rescuer to even higher currents.

      With increasing numbers of the S-ICDs being implanted, and the inevitability that rescuers
      will soon find themselves exposed to leakage current from these devices, there is a need to
      examine the leakage currents arising from these devices and assess any subsequent risk to a
      rescuer performing external chest compressions.

      Rationale for Study:

      When patients undergo elective implantation of an ICD, the device is tested by inducing
      ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the patient and allowing the ICD to sense, charge and
      discharge in an attempt to shock the patient back into a normal rhythm. This provides a
      controlled, elective situation in which to measure the cutaneous current on the patient's
      skin which is the current to which a rescuer could potentially be exposed.

      By understanding the leakage currents from these devices, the investigators will be able to
      better understand the safety of rescuers in contact with patients fitted with an ICD and make
      specific recommendations to enable to safe undertaking of uninterrupted external chest
      compressions while the ICD may be discharging.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      Primary Objective:

      To measure cutaneous leakage current on the chest wall during conventional and S-ICD
      discharge.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To make recommendations based on this data regarding the safety of rescuers in contact with a
      patient during ICD discharge.

      ENDPOINTS

      Primary Endpoint:

      Maximum cutaneous current measured at multiple sites on the chest wall during ICD discharge.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective cohort study, aiming to study sequential patients
      undergoing elective ICD implantation and testing over a 12 month period at University
      Hospital Southampton.

      The patient will undergo elective ICD implantation according to normal protocol. There will
      be no change in their treatment. After induction of general anaesthesia, an array of small
      self-adhesive electrodes (similar to ECG 'dots') will be placed on the patient's chest wall,
      and connected to a multichannel recording device.

      After implantation of the ICD, the device will be tested as per normal protocol. VF is
      induced in the patient. The ICD senses this arrhythmia, charges and immediately delivers a
      shock to the myocardium. As this shock is delivered, the investigators will record the
      current reaching the surface electrode array using the multichannel recorder. Most patients
      only require one shock as defibrillation rates with ICDs are &gt;90%. If a second shock is
      required, the ICD will charge automatically and discharge once again. If this occurs, the
      investigators will also measure the cutaneous current at this second, higher energy level.
      The study is then concluded. Any subsequent shocks are delivered through external paddles and
      the investigators would not require any data from this stage of the procedure.

      STUDY POPULATION Number of Participants The investigators aim to assess 20 patients
      undergoing conventional ICD implantation and a further 20 patients undergoing S-ICD
      implantation.
