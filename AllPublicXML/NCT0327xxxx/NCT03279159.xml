  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of the study was to evaluate by non-invasive instrumental evaluations tolerance and
      hydrating activity of a face topic product, to be applied twice a day, morning and evening,
      for an uninterrupted period of 8 weeks, by volunteers of both sexes, aged 45-60, who meet the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria required by the study procedure .

      It was also aim of this study to evaluate the hydrating activity of a single product
      application on the skin damaged by repeated stripping corneum (short term evaluation versus
      untreated control area).
