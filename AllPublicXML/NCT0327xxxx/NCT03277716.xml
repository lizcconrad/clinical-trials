  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide. Despite the
      widespread application of surveillance programs in high-risk populations, patients continue
      to present with huge (≥ 10 cm) HCCs.And it's still a challenge to treat huge HCC
      nowadays.Surgical resection is currently the only curative treatment for huge HCCs ; however,
      only a minority of patients are candidates for curative resection. Sorafenib is recommended
      for the treatment of advanced HCCs, including huge HCCs, but the usage is severely limited by
      high adverse event rates and low efficiency. Thus, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is
      considered the first choice for huge unresectable HCCs. Several studies have concluded that
      TACE effectively improves the overall survival of patients with huge HCCs. Meanwhile,
      microwave ablation (MWA) now has been shown to be safe and effective for local tumor control
      in HCC patients. However, neither MWA nor TACE alone can achieve complete control of large
      HCCs . Therefore, the combination of TACE and MWA (TACE+MWA) is an appealing approach to
      treat HCCs. TACE+MWA now has been shown to improve overall survival rates compared with TACE
      alone in patients with small to large HCCs. But little data is available on TACE+MWA in
      patients with huge unresectable HCCs. Thus, the study was designed.

    <description>TACE: With the patient under local anesthesia, a 5F French catheter was introduced into the abdominal aorta via the femoral artery using the Seldinger technique. Hepatic arterial angiography was performed using fluoroscopy to guide the catheter into the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. Then, the feeding arteries, tumor, and vascular anatomy surrounding the tumor were identified. Subsequently, a microcatheter was super-selectively inserted into the feeding arteries. Then, a mixture solution containing chemotherapeutic agents and embolic agents were infused into the artery according to the size and blood supply of the tumors.</description>

    <description>MWA: All patients were instructed to fast from all foods for 12 hours preoperatively. During the procedure, a CT scan was used to locate the liver tumors, and to design the optimal puncture needle route. Routine disinfection and local anesthesia was applied around the puncture point, and a 16-gauge microwave antenna was gradually inserted into the tumor along the pre-determined angle. Settings of the MWA parameters depended on the manufacturer's recommendation and our experience.</description>
