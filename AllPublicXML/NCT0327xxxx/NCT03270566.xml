      An outcome assessor-blinded pilot randomised controlled trial of an ion-exchange water
      softener for the prevention of atopic eczema in neonates, with an embedded mechanistic study

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 6-month parallel group assessor-blinded pilot randomised controlled trial of an
      ion-exchange water softener for the prevention of eczema in neonates, with an embedded
      mechanistic study.

      The overall rationale is that by installing a domestic water softener around the time of
      birth, the infant will be exposed to softened water rather than hard water for bathing and
      that this will be less irritating to the skin than hard water and so associated with a lower
      risk of eczema development. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of
      conducting a subsequent definitive RCT that will investigate whether installation of a
      domestic water softener around the time of birth can prevent eczema in high-risk babies. The
      secondary objective is to explore the likely mechanisms by which water softeners might
      prevent eczema.

    <description>Ion-exchange water softeners exchange calcium and magnesium, amongst other divalent cations, for monovalent sodium cations using a polystyrene resin. The sodium ions come from sodium chloride (common salt). The salt needs to be topped up every 3-4 weeks and sufficient quantities of block salt will be supplied to participants. The water softener used in this study does not require electricity and has two cylinders of resin which are used alternately. A control valve alternates the flow between the two cylinders and ensures a constant supply of regenerated resin. Ion-exchange water softeners typically reduce downstream water hardness to close to zero.</description>
