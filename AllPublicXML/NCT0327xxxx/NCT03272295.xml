             not clinically significant by the PI or the appropriately qualified designee.

             nephrolithiasis), hepatic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, respiratory, metabolic,
             endocrine, haematological or other major disorder that, in the opinion of the PI or

             impact on the validity of the study results.
