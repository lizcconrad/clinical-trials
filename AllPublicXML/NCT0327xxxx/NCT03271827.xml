  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway management is a core clinical skill in anaesthesia. Pre-oxygenation prior to induction
      of anaesthesia is standard practice to prevent desaturation. Apnoeic oxygenation in adults is
      effective and prolongs the time to desaturation. The effectiveness of apnoeic oxygenation in
      the adult is well document, however evidence in the paediatric is lacking. Therefore, the aim
      of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of apnoeic oxygenation during airway
      management in children.

      This was a pilot randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either receive
      apnoeic oxygenation or standard care during the induction of anaesthesia. The primary outcome
      was the duration of safe apnoea, defined as a composite of the time to first event, either
      time for SpO2 to drop to 92% or time to successfully secure the airway, and the lowest SpO2
      observed during airway management. Secondary outcomes were number of patients whose SpO2
      dropped below 95% and number of patients whose SpO2 dropped below 92%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were included who were scheduled for elective surgery under general
             anaesthesia.

          -  Age: one eight years old.

          -  ASA I and II only.

          -  Patients with normal cardiorespiratory function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children undergoing dental surgeries in which nasal intubation is needed.

          -  Patients who suffered from quick drops in oxygen saturation more rapidly than healthy
             children due to different reasons such as: respiratory and pulmonary diseases, active
             or recent upper respiratory tract infection, syndromes with cardiopulmonary
             pathologies, cardiac anomalies, anaemia, depressed respiratory effort,
             ventilation/perfusion imbalance, Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), and airway
             obstruction.

          -  Patients reported with nasal obstruction.

          -  Patients with grades of laryngoscopic view (Cormack Lahane) greater than II, which
             indicates upper airway obstruction.
