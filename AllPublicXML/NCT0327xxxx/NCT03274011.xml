  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard treatment strategy for recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma patients now, especially after the second-line treatment. Most of the patients have
      the bad ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) score and prognosis. Chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy, surgery are usually unacceptable for them. Previous data showed that apatinib
      treatment significantly improved OS(overall survival) and PFS(progression-free survival) with
      an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or
      more lines of prior chemotherapy. Our study will observe the efficacy and safety of Apatinib
      for recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A phase II, prospective,
      single-arm, multicenter trial.

    <description>Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to and strongly inhibits vascular en-dothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a decrease in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular density. Previous data showed that apatinib treatment significantly improved OS and PFS with an acceptable safety profile in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy. Our study will observe the efficacy and safety of Apatinib for recurrent or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A phase II, prospective, single-arm, multicenter trial.</description>
