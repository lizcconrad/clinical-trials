  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, Phase II study including only patients on whom a decision to conduct
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has already been made. The primary objective of this study
      assess if quality of life was improved by RFA as assessed at baseline, 3 and potentially 6
      and 12 months following RFA for the benign lesions.

      RFA is an imaging guided percutaneous or intra-operative procedure that uses a probe on the
      end of a sharp needle that is inserted directly into the tumor. The tumor is ablated by
      heating the probe (using an electrical current alternating at radio frequency) which raises
      the temperature of the tumor potentially causing irreversible cell death.

      RF ablation is an alternative for local tumor control when other treatments (surgery,
      radiotherapy or chemotherapy) are not feasible (less effective or at higher risk). Thermal
      ablation at times is the only remaining alternative for patient cure, prolonged survival or
      palliation. Cryotherapy, and microwave, laser and focused ultrasound are alternative thermal
      ablation techniques used in adults but there has been no experience in children with these
      alternative methods.

      To be eligible for this study, patients must have acquired lesions at &lt; 21 years of age
      (central nervous system lesions are excluded from this study). Study participants will have
      the RFA procedure performed at Seattle Children's and will have follow-up evaluations at
      various time points post-RFA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Lesion acquired in childhood (at &lt;21 years of age)

          -  Any lesion location except CNS

          -  Any malignant tumor or metastasis

          -  Any benign lesion (e.g. desmoids, venous or lymphatic vascular anomalies, aneurysmal
             bone cysts, osteoid osteoma, tongue hypertrophy, or painful neuropathy)

          -  Patients with malignant disease have had histologic confirmation of disease at initial
             diagnosis.

          -  ≥ 90 day life expectancy

          -  Potential benefit of RFA outweighs risk as determined by PI

          -  Other local tumor control measures are not recommended for malignant lesion based on
             review in multidisciplinary team conference or the patient refuses recommended local
             tumor control measures

          -  The patient is not expected to become short of breath at rest after RFA (forced vital
             capacity ≥33% of normal by pulmonary function tests) if pulmonary RFA is considered

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infection.

          -  Patients with co-morbidities affecting inclusion criteria above.

          -  Patients who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          -  Patients who had a change in chemotherapy within one month before RFA

          -  Patients who have planned change in chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy (to same
             site as RFA) interventions within the first three months following RFA.
