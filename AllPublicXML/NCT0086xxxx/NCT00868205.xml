    <textblock>
      Food and beverage intake that leads to a decrease in the level of in vivo markers of
      oxidative stress indicates that such foods and beverages act as antioxidants (AOX) in humans.
      Coffee drinking at a high level (&gt; 900 ml/day) for a short period of time (1 week) has been
      shown to reduce DNA oxidative damage—as indicated by a decrease in the level of percent tail
      DNA (%T)— in study populations comprised mainly of young adults aged &lt; 30 years. It is not
      clear whether such findings remain present over a longer period of time, and to extend such
      findings across a population that is more representative of European adults who consume
      common daily intakes of coffee, which is a low-to-moderate daily intake level (&lt; 750 ml/day).
      As such, the investigators propose to determine the effect of drinking 3 and 5 cups of coffee
      per day (equivalent to 450 and 750 ml per day, respectively) for 8-weeks on markers of in
      vivo oxidative stress relative to control in a population of healthy adults free of chronic
      diseases aged 35 to 65 years. To ensure that overall health is considered, the investigators
      will also evaluate the effect on markers of cardiovascular health, inflammation, and glycemic
      control.

      Objective: The main objective of the present study is to determine the short- and mid-term
      effects of a coffee, on oxidative stress parameters in humans.

      Study design: randomized, placebo-controlled, investigator-blinded, 3-arm parallel Study
      population: 168 apparently healthy volunteers: males and females aged &gt;=35 and &lt;= 65 years.

      Intervention: The treatments consist of daily consumption of either:

      Treatment 1: 0.45 L coffee (3 cups) and 0.30 L bottled water daily or; Treatment 2: 0.75 L
      coffee (5 cups) daily or; Treatment 3: 0.75 L water daily Duration of the treatment
      intervention is 8 weeks. Before the intervention period starts, a run-in period of five weeks
      where all subjects maintain their low antioxidant diet (Dutch average) is conducted by all
      subjects in order to standardize the antioxidant intake of the subjects.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Mean level of %T as a measure of DNA oxidative damage at
      week 8. Secondary outcome is the mean level of 8-isoprostane in 24 hr urine.
