    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects selected for this study will be males 18 to 45 (inclusive) years of age.
             Weight range of the subjects shall be 135-246 pounds, with individual weight variation
             not more than 10% ± from normal for height and body frame (Metropolitan Life, 1983,
             Height, Weight, Body Chart).

          -  Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 21 days of
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood
             pressure, general observations, and history.

        At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of interim
        history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements.

        Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 21 days before beginning of the
        first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements. Clinical
        laboratory measurements will include the following:

        Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white blood cell
        count (with differential).

        Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphate
        Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood,
        and cells.

        HTLV III Screen: (pre-study only) Hepatitis-B Surface Ag Screen: (pre-study only) Drugs of
        Abuse Screen: (pre-study only) Subjects will be selected if all above are normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        . Subjects with a history of chronic alcohol consumption, drug addition, or serious
        gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, epilepsy, asthma,
        diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are greater than 20% outside the normal
             range may be restricted. If the clinical values are outside the range on testing, the
             subject will not be eligible to participate in the study unless the clinical
             investigator deems the result to not be significant.

          -  Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             should be excluded from the study.

          -  Subjects who use tobacco in any form will not be eligible to participate in the study.
             Three months abstinence is required.

          -  All subjects will have urine samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse as a
             part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures. Subjects found to have urine
             concentrations of any of the tested drugs will not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to starting the study.

          -  Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the
             start of the study will not be allowed to participate.

          -  Subjects who have been exposed to known hepatic enzyme inducting or inhibiting agents
             within thirty (30) days prior to dosing will not be allowed to participate.
