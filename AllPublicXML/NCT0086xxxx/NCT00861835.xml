    <textblock>
      Purpose: Previous studies suggested an increased diagnostic yield for bronchoscopic (FB)
      transbronchial needle aspirate (TBNA) specimens from mediastinal lymph nodes when using rapid
      on-site evaluation by cytopathology (ROSE) but were limited by lack of randomization. The
      investigators performed the first randomized-prospective trial comparing ROSE(R) to no
      on-site cytopathology assessment (NR).

      Methods: All patients referred were eligible. 78 patients were randomized to R or NR groups.
      For R procedures, further specimens were deferred until results were available from the
      on-site cytopathologist. Diagnoses made by all procedures were recorded. The primary
      end-points were specimen adequacy and diagnostic yield.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients included all adults referred for bronchoscopy with anticipated TBNA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were to be excluded only if the attending physician felt ROSE must be used
             for diagnosis or if the patient refused consent.
