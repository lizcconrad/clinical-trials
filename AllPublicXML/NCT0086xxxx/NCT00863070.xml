      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patients who have undergone exstrophy
      closure may be at risk for long-term orthopedic issues manifest by gait abnormalities. This
      study is a descriptive analysis of the study cohort's gait patterns and pelvic structure.

      Specific Aim 1: to determine whether patients with classic bladder exstrophy who underwent
      closure demonstrate gait abnormalities.

      Hypothesis 1: Patients undergoing closure of bladder exstrophy (with or without pelvic
      osteotomy) demonstrate gait abnormalities compared with a reference population.

      Hypothesis 2: Patients undergoing closure of bladder exstrophy (with or without pelvic
      osteotomy) will have below normal functional survey scores.
