      Primary Hypotheses of the study include:

        -  Metabolic profiles are influenced by gestational age, chronological age, type and degree
           of nutritional support and illness

        -  Metabolic profiles differ between neonates who receive commercial formula and neonates
           who receive primarily human breast milk

        -  Neonates who develop parenteral associated cholestasis have metabolic markers that
           identify at risk patients (high serum urea nitrogen, citrulline, histidine, methionine,
           and succinyl carnitine and low thyroxine, serine and glutamate)

        -  Neonates that have hypothyroidism have abnormal metabolic profiles (low tyrosine levels)

      Malnutrition is a common problem in the neonatal intensive care unit. Recent studies indicate
      that prematurely born neonates commonly develop a severe nutritional deficit during the first
      weeks after birth, referred to as extrauterine growth restriction. Despite an increase in
      growth during the second month of hospitalization, many neonates are ultimately discharged
      home having grown inadequately. The early nutritional deficit affects weight gain as well as
      growth in length and head circumference. Aggressive administration of parenteral amino acids
      to improve protein accretion rates in very preterm neonates has been supported in the
      literature. Although tolerance of high dose amino acids has been described, researchers
      acknowledge that sensitive tests to monitor amino acid toxicity are not readily available in
      the clinical setting.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To better define normal amino acid and acylcarnitine values and how they change in
           premature neonates

        -  To measure the effect nutritional support has (human breastmilk vs. formula) on amino
           acid and acylcarnitines profiles

        -  To measure the effect of illness (parenteral nutrition associated cholestasis) on amino
           acid and acylcarnitine profiles

        -  To better define abnormal metabolic profiles (low tyrosine levels) in neonates that have
           hypothyroidism.
