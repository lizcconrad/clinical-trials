    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial with an embedded cross sectional study
      exploring parental perceptions of their weight status and how it affects their perceptions of
      their child's weight status. This study uses an educational intervention in which parents are
      informed of their actual weight status and how it affects their child's health. We will study
      the effect of this intervention on the parent's perceptions of and level of concern for their
      own and their child's weight status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric obesity has tripled in the past 20 years. Obesity prevention early in life is
      important and parental participation is essential. Parents must recognize overweight in their
      child so health providers may engage them in a dialogue to change their child's diet and
      physical activity patterns, yet a large proportion of parents do not recognize that their
      child is overweight. Parents' misperception of their overweight child's weight status
      presents a barrier to treating obesity.

      This pilot study is a randomized controlled trial with an embedded cross sectional study
      exploring parental perceptions of their weight status and how it affects their perceptions of
      their child's weight status. This study uses an educational intervention in which parents are
      informed of their actual weight status and how it affects their child's health. We will study
      the effect of this intervention on the parent's perceptions of and level of concern for their
      own and their child's weight status.

      Our goal is to develop a primary care intervention that will enhance parental perceptions of
      overweight and motivation to make changes for their family. Pilot data collected here will
      support an R21 Exploratory/Developmental Clinical Research Grant in Obesity or a Centers for
      Disease Control (CDC) or Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJ) grant submission.

    <description>The intervention used in the randomized controlled trial consists of 1) measuring the parents' height and weight and 2) providing the parents with feedback on their calculated BMI on an educational handout (included in Appendix V). The purpose of the handout is to convey the following 5 messages:
Definition of BMI
How BMI is calculated
What the parent's BMI is based on the measurements taken
What weight category the parent is in (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese)
Children with overweight or obese parents are at higher risk of becoming overweight themselves.
The Research Assistant will verbally review the educational handout with the parent. The handout will be available in both English and Spanish.</description>
