    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer ranks the ninth in worldwide cancer incidence. Approximate 90% of bladder
      cancer is the malignancy of urothelium tissues, the urothelial cancer (UC). The mortality of
      bladder cancer is mainly due to recurrence and metastasis. Unfortunately, the currently
      available cytology or cystoscopy examination is of limited value because of low sensitivity
      of early disease. New biomarkers as well as detection technology are thus required to improve
      early diagnosis. By the aid of quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP), which allows
      detecting tumor-derived DNA from tissues and body fluids, DNA methylation-based assay is thus
      developing for early detection and prognosis.

      The goal of this proposed project is to develop a panel of DNA-methylation based biomarkers
      for UC diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of responses to therapy (especially the
      recurrence, invasion, survival, and responses to therapeutic agents). Although numerous
      studies have investigated the aberrant promoter hypermethylation in bladder cancers or UC,
      inconsistent results are observed. DNA hypermethylation determination may rely on not only
      the conditions of QMSP, but also the biopsy specimens of different race, environmental expose
      factors, and regional variation. We thus need to profile the DNA methylation pattern of UC
      patients in Taiwan to establish a panel of potential prediction biomarkers for local
      patients.

      In the recent years, technologies of genomics, expression analysis and proteomics have been
      brought to guide the study of risk assessment and early detection of cancers. This proposed
      study aims to develop a non-invasive DNA methylation-based assay system elucidating a panel
      of aberrantly hypermethylated genes from urothelial tumors and urine sediments, to improve
      the risk assessment of urothelial carcinoma; such as early diagnosis, prognosis, and
      prediction of response to therapeutic regimes. This proposal will establish several
      techniques to study the methylation status on gene promoter regions. Three tasks will be
      achieved in this study: (1) Profiling the aberrant DNA methylation in urothelial carcinoma
      and determining potential prediction biomarkers. (2) Establishing a non-invasive assay by
      detecting DNA hypermethylation status in exfoliated cells collected from void urine; (3)
      Mapping the DNA hypermethylation changes from normal to malignant urothelial tumors and
      studying the underlying mechanism. Through the collaboration of a genetic toxicologist
      (Te-Chang Lee, PhD, IBMS), a urologist (Yeong-Shiau Pu, MD/PhD, NTUH) and epidemiologists
      (Hung-Yi Chiou, PhD, Taipei Medical University), we will explore the risk biomarkers for
      urothelial carcinoma.

        Study subjects from the Department of Urology of NTUH. Those with urothelial
        carcinoma(bladder, renal pelvis and ureter) will be recruited in this study period. After
        they signed the informed consent,we will ask them some questions through face-to-face
        interview and collect 6-8ml blood and 50c.c. urine. Then genomic DNA will be extracted from
        these biospecimens to perform a non-invasive DNA methylation-based assay.
