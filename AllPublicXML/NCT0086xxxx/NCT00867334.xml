    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of imatinib mesylate in
      combination with panitumumab for the treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer that has spread
      to the liver. It will also assess the whether imatinib mesylate, either alone or in
      combination with panitumumab, is effective in treating this type of cancer. In addition, the
      study will evaluate the feasibility of a predefined lab score and whether it can predict
      which patients will respond to treatment with imatinib mesylate.

    <description>Patients will be entered into sequential cohorts with escalating doses of imatinib mesylate. After approximately 28 days of monotherapy treatment with imatinib mesylate, patients will be asked to have a liver biopsy performed (this biopsy is voluntary and is not required for continued participation in the study). All patients in this group will then receive imatinib mesylate in combination with standard-of-care doses of panitumumab. After approximately 1-2 months of combination treatment, patients will asked to have an additional liver biopsy performed (this biopsy is voluntary and is not required for continued participation in the study). Combination treatment will continue for the remainder of the subject's time in the trial.</description>

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of Stage IV Metastatic Colorectal Cancer with
             Liver Metastases, refractory or progressive after at least one (1) prior line of
             therapy that must include a fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) AND

          -  Documentation of wild type k-Ras expression in the liver lesion.

          -  At least one measurable site of disease (as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors, see Appendix 3), or other response assessment criteria, as appropriate.

          -  Must have ≥ 1 measurable liver lesion that can be accessed by CT guided biopsy.
