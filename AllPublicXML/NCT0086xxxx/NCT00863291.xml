  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acutely suicidal patient presents a complex and dangerous clinical dilemma. Many suicidal
      patients receive antidepressant medications, but the onset of action of these medications is
      at least three weeks, and despite their established antidepressant effect, they have not
      shown a clear anti-suicidal benefit. Psychoanalysts hypothesized that depression (often
      leading to suicidality) shares important characteristics with the psychological sequellae of
      object loss and separation distress. Endogenous opioids (endorphines) have been implicated in
      mediating social bonding and separation distress in mammals. Anecdotal evidence and several
      clinical studies found the mixed opioid agonist-antagonist buprenorphine to be an effective
      antidepressant with a rapid onset of action. It is therefore hypothesized that buprenorphine
      may be a novel and quick-acting treatment for acute suicidality, especially in the context of
      depression. The proposed double-blind study will examine the effect of buprenorphine on
      acutely suicidal inpatients. Depression, suicidality, and overall functioning will be
      assessed before, during and after a two-week buprenorphine/placebo trial. A small subgroup of
      patients will also be treated with short-term psychoanalytic psychotherapy throughout the
      study period. It is hypothesized that subjects who receive the active drug will show rapid
      improvements in objective and subjective measures of suicidality and depression.
