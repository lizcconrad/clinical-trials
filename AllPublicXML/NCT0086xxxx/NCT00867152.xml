      A Phase I, open label, randomized, three period, one-way, two cohort, adaptive crossover
      study to evaluate the effect of darunavir/ritonavir plus etravirine and lopinavir/ritonavir

    <textblock>
      The study is a three period, randomized, open label study. Approximately 18 healthy subjects
      will receive GSK1349572 50mg q24h for 5 days (Treatment A) in Period 1. Subjects will then be
      administered GSK1349572 50mg q24h in combination with either LPV/RTV 400/100 mg q12h and
      etravirine 200mg q12h (Treatment B, n=9) or DRV/RTV 600/100 mg q12h and etravirine 200mg q12h
      (Treatment C, n=9) for 14 days in Period 2 followed by a washout period. GSK1349572 PK data
      will be obtained from Periods 1 and 2 and used to inform decision making on Period 3. If
      GSK1349572 Cτ is reduced by more than 50% in Period 2 compared to Period 1, subjects will
      return to the clinic and receive GSK1349572 50mg q12h in combination with ETV and either
      DRV/RTV or LPV/RTV in Period 3. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples will be collected
      during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after the last dose of
      study drug. All doses of study drugs will be taken following a moderate fat meal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who: Is
             pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or Is postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be performed
             to confirm a post-menopausal status. For this study, FSH levels of &gt; 40 MlU/ml is
             confirmatory. For females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt, HRT should be discontinued for 2 weeks and then the subject
             rescreened, as HRT can suppress FSH.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 14 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg for men and ≥ 45 kg for women and BMI within the range 18.5-31.0
             kg/m2 (inclusive).

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first

             participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  If heparin is used in during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to
             heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  History of significant renal or hepatic diseases.

          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.

          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass
             grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) or

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
