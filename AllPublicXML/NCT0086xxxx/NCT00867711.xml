  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular predictors of pemetrexed and
      carboplatin response in tumor samples of a series of MPM patients extracting the DNA and
      genotyping for the TSER polymorphism.

    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor that usually has a poor
      prognosis. The combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed has recently become the standard of
      care in the first-line treatment of MPM. For patients who are unfit to receive a
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy, pemetrexed alone [7] or combined with carboplatin [8] has been
      proposed as an alternative treatment choice. The identification of molecular predictors of
      effective therapy is important for maximizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing useless
      treatment in cancer patients.

      The paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of patients will be collected. The tumor RNA and DNA
      will be extracted and genotyping, gene expression and gene copy number analyses will be
      performed with validated PCR and array-CGH techniques.
