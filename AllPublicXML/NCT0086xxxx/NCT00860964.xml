      The purpose of this trial is to study the efficacy and safety of low dose of estradiol
      valerate in the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

      Research purposes: To assess the Impact of hormone therapy on quality of life in early
      post-menopausal women; To assess the Impact of hormone therapy on cardiovascular system in
      early post-menopausal women; To assess the Impact of hormone therapy on cognitive function in
      early post-menopausal women; To assess the Impact of hormone therapy on osteoporosis in early
      post-menopausal women.

      Study Design:

      The clinical trial research was divided into 2 groups. Treatment group given estradiol
      valerate 1mg/d, periodic application of medroxyprogesterone 6mg/d for 10 days, calcium
      900mg/d, VitD200iu/d and exercise(Brisk walking every day 2 times, continued for 10 minutes
      each time). Control group given placebo, calcium,VitD and exercise were same with treatment
      group.
