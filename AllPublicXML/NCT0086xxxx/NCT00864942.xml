      This study is for subjects with a B-cell lymphoid malignancy (lymphoma) or chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that has come back after or did not get better with previous
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to find out the highest dose of lenalidomide that can
      be given together with bendamustine and rituximab. The study will also look what effects the
      combination of lenalidomide and bendamustine and the combination of lenalidomide,
      bendamustine and rituximab will have on patients and their disease.

      This is a Phase I, open-label, dose-escalation study of bendamustine and lenalidomide (BL)
      and also bendamustine,lenalidomide, and rituximab (BLR) in relapsed/refractory CLL and
      relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphomas. Phase I dose escalation will be done independently for
      the CLL and NHL groups. In addition, the study will be conducted in 2 parts. In part I of the
      study, the maximum tolerated dose of bendamustine and lenalidomide will be determined
      independently for the CLL and NHL groups. In part II of the study, CLL and NHL subjects will
      be enrolled at the MTD of BL determined in Part I for CLL and NHL and all subjects will
      receive rituximab. Part II of the study will determine the MTD of BLT independently for the
      NHL and CLL groups.
