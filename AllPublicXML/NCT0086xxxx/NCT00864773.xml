  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathophysiology of central serous chorioretinopathy remains controversial. traditional
      treatment is laser photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy.Recently Bevacizumab (Avastin,
      Genetech),an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),has known antipermeability
      properties and therefore may theoretically reverse the changes seen in central serous
      chorioretinopathy. The aim of this study is To investigate concentrations of growth factors
      and inflammatory cytokines and to report the effect of therapy with bevacizumab in eyes with
      central serous chorioretinopathy
