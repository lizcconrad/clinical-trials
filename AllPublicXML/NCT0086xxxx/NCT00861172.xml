  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is difficult to determinate prognostic criteria of Multiple Sclerosis with conventional
      MRI insofar as physiopathology is not well-known: the precise sequences of events leading to
      plaque formation and axonal injury are still not completely understood.

      Some elements involved in plaque formation can be studied thanks to MR techniques
      (cerebrospinal fluid and periveinular spaces, neuronal injury, microglia, and cerebral
      microcirculation's dysfunction).

      This study aims at giving a better understanding of MS plaques' physiopathology, using data
      from modern MRI through a longitudinal followed up with weakly MR 3T examination.

      The objective of this work are:

        -  study weakly development of the active MS plaque with multimodal MRI parameters using
           advanced MRI techniques: Veinography/3D FLAIR, Diffusion (CDA), Perfusion (CBV, CBF,
           MTT) MR Spectroscopy (NAA, myo-inositol, choline, lactate…) and enhanced 3DT1 sequences.

        -  define prognostic markers of MS aggressiveness (&quot;black holes&quot;)

        -  Study development of MS plaque around venous structures.

    <description>The follow-up will be scheduled for one year; it will consist in a weekly MR examination during the first two months, and subsequently on the 6th and the 12th months.
We will perform for each MRI exploration an intravenous injection of contrast agents: gadobutrol (gadovist 1,0 mmol/ml) which is a stable agent with a cyclic structure. This agent is few responsible for NFS, given their low capacity to liberate gadolinium GD3+ in tissues.
The same imaging protocol will be performed for each MR examination. Evaluation of creatinemia will be used before inclusion and during the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th MRI examination. Thus we will take advantage of catheter to perform the creatinemia blood test and to reduce the discomfort produced by the injection.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age between 18 and 50 years.

          -  Health coverage.

          -  Any form of MS defined by Mc Donald's criteria (2005).

          -  Patients having shown an enhanced plaque on a less than six month MRI examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an immunomodulating therapy like natalizumab (Tysabri) and intravenous
             immunosuppressive therapies. Other therapies will not be excluded from this study. For
             patients treated by systemic corticotherapy, a one-month delay will be necessary
             before a MRI examination.

          -  Cerebral microangiopathy (diabetes, arterial hypertension, vascularitis…)

          -  Patient with classical MRI contraindication like pace-maker, cardiac valvulosis,
             claustrophobia, allergy to contrast agent …

          -  Pregnancy or pregnancy desire.

          -  Patient with a low creatinine clearance &lt;60 ml/mn
