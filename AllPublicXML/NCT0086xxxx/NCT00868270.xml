  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of kidney scarring after UTI is approximately 5-57%. UTIs are caused mainly by
      bacteria that cause local and systemic immunological reaction that are accompanied by
      cytokines. These cytokines are a main factor in the inflammatory process. They are produced
      by leukocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells in the kidney
      tissue. Interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6 IL-8) were found in high levels in the urine of children
      and adults who suffer from UTIs. Other studies on animals have found a relationship between
      inflammatory reaction and scarring in the kidney. We hypothesize that we will find a similar
      relationship between the level of IL-6, IL-8 in the urine during acute pyelonephritis in
      children and the probability of kidney scarring.
