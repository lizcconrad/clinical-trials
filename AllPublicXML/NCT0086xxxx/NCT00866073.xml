  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label phase II trial to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of
      low-dose decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) not eligible for aggressive induction chemotherapy. AML patients above the age of 60
      years (no upper age limit) who have not previously received and are not eligible for,
      standard induction treatment of their disease will be eligible for this trial. Decitabine
      will be administered as a 3 hour infusion at 15 mg/m2 three times daily on three consecutive
      days (total dose 135 mg/m2). In all patients with &gt; 20000 WBC/µl, this treatment will be
      repeated 1 week later. In patients with white blood cells exceeding 50 000/μl, decitabine
      treatment will be preceded by cytoreductive doses of hydroxyurea.

      Hypothesis: If after 4 courses of Decitabine none out of 12 patients achieves a response
      (complete or partial remission, antileukemic effect), the protocol will be stopped. If at
      least one response is seen among the first 12 patients, 17 additional patients will be
      treated in an open, uncontrolled manner. If in 3 or more of these 29 patients a response is
      achieved, this treatment will be considered effective and will be studied further, otherwise
      it will be considered ineffective. At a preliminary analysis after recruitment of 29
      patients, encouraging results (response rate, tolerability) are prompting continuation of
      recruitment, with a planned inclusion of at least 60 patients, until initiation of the
      planned large, controlled phase II follow-up trial. Unexpected toxicities will be carefully
      evaluated. 29 patients were needed for the first two steps of this phase II study, at least
      60 patients are planned for the extension of the recruitment. Expected study duration for the
      first two steps was 15-20 months, with 35-40 months total when including the third step.
