      The trial will examine whether pharmacological treatment with donepezil, memantine or
      combination of memantine and donepezil is any better than a placebo (dummy) treatment in
      people with Alzheimer's disease who have reached the moderate to severe stage of illness.
      Using a double blind design, where neither the investigators nor participants know who is
      receiving which treatment, participants will be randomly assigned to one of these four
      treatment groups (donepezil and memantine, memantine only, donepezil only or placebo). In
      order to keep both the investigators and participants blind to drug allocation a double dummy
      design will be necessary. This means that each participant will receive 2 treatments − either
      an active form or placebo of each of the 2 study drugs.

      Hypotheses are:

        1. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who continue donepezil beyond the point of
           transition from moderate to severe dementia continue to show significantly less decline
           on ratings of cognitive function and activities of daily living over the following 12
           months than those discontinuing donepezil.

        2. Patients with AD who change to memantine therapy in place of donepezil at the point of
           transition from moderate to severe dementia show significantly smaller decline on
           ratings of cognitive function and activities of daily living over the following 12
           months than those who receive placebo.

        3. Patients given the combination of memantine and donepezil at the point of transition
           from moderate to severe dementia show significant additive or synergistic benefits on
           measures of activities of daily living and cognitive function after 12 months compared
           to those patients continuing on either drug as a single treatment.

      This trial will involve the withdrawal of drug participants that are currently on (donepezil)
      and in arm 4, the participant will only be on placebo treatment. It is important to include
      this arm of the study as a key objective in looking at the benefit of continuing donepezil
      and therefore a placebo arm should be present as a comparator. To reduce the risk to
      participants of withdrawing donepezil too early in their illness, an inclusion criteria is
      that the participant is at a stage in their disease whereby the prescribing clinician feels a
      change in drug prescription may be appropriate.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Participants will be patients who meet NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable or possible
        Alzheimer's disease (McKhann et al, 1984). In addition they will meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. SMMSE = 5 to 13 (13 chosen as NICE threshold of 10 plus 1 SD on SMMSE score)

          2. Continuously prescribed donepezil for at least 3 months

          3. Maintained on 10mg donepezil in previous 6 weeks.

          4. No changes in prescription of any psychotropic (antipsychotic, antidepressant,
             benzodiazepine) medication in previous 6 weeks.

          5. Prescribing clinician considers (based on NICE guidance, discussions with patient and
             carer and clinical judgement) that change of drug treatment (i.e. stop donepezil or
             introduce memantine) may be appropriate.

          6. Patient is community resident and has family or professional carer or is visited on at
             least a daily basis by carer.

          7. Patient agrees to participate if considered capable (see section 7.5)

          8. Main carer (informal or professional) consents to their own involvement and the
             patient's involvement -

        Exclusion Criteria:

        To maximise the generalisability of the study data, exclusions will be kept to a minimum.
        These will include:

          1. Patient has severe, unstable or poorly controlled medical conditions apparent from
             physical examination or clinical history.

          2. Patient is already prescribed memantine.

          3. Patient is unable to take trial medications because of contra-indications or previous
             adverse or allergic reactions.

          4. Patient is involved in another clinical trial.

          5. Clinician considers patient would not be compliant with trial medication. -
