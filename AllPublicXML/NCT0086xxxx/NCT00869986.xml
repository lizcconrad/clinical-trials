          5. Have the presence of systemic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             interfere with subject safety, compliance or evaluation of the condition under study
             (e.g. insulin dependent diabetes, lyme disease, clinically significant cardiac,
             hepatic, or renal disease, Human Immunodeficiency Virus, or Human T-Cell Lymphotrophic

             the first study-specific test, with the exception of corticosteroids or ACTH for
             relapse treatment

         11. Treatment at any time with an altered peptide ligand, cladribine, total lymphoid

             Anti-CD20,

         12. Any contraindications for MRI, e.g. pacemaker or known allergy to Gadolinium- DTPA

         13. Participation in any other trial of an investigational agent within 90 days prior to
             screening

         14. History of alcohol or drug abuse as specified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
