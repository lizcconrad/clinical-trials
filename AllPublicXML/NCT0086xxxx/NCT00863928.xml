    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the effect of a Belladonna and Opium suppository administered
      intraoperatively on post operative pain after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for prostate
      cancer. This is a blinded randomized study. 50% of patients will receive the suppository, 50%
      of patients will not. Neither you or your surgeon will know which group you are in.
