      The purpose of this study is to determine if imiquimod cream can reverse the growth of
      neurofibromas. Imiquimod is a skin cream that works by stimulating the body's immune system
      to respond to tumors. Imiquimod cream is approved for use in patients with various skin
      lesions, including actinic keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma, and external genital
      warts. Information from these studies, as well as previous laboratory studies, suggest that
      imiquimod cream may help shrink neurofibromas or keep them from growing.

      -  Three of the participant's tumors will be treated with imiquimod cream and one tumor
           (out of all the remaining tumors) will be followed without treatment (control tumor).

        -  Participants will be given a tube of imiquimod cream and be asked to apply it to the
           three tumors 5 times per week, for a full 6 weeks (Monday through Friday).

        -  Participants will be required to come to the hospital for examinations on Week 1, 2, 4
           and 6 (+/- 3 calendar days) and after their last dose of imiquimod cream on Weeks 9, 12
           and 18 (+/- 5 calendar days. The following tests and procedures will be performed: skin
           test; vital signs and measurements and photographs of the tumors. Participants will be
           asked to participate in an optional skin biopsy on Week 4 and research blood tests wil
           lbe taken on Day 1.

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of NF1 based on NIH criterial with two or more of the
             following characteristics:

               -  six or more cafe-au-lait macules (1.5cm or greater in size)

               -  skin fold freckling in the axilla or groin

               -  optic pathway glioma

               -  two or more Lisch nodules of the iris

               -  distinctive bony lesions such as dysplasia of the sphenoid wing or of a long bone
                  such as the tibia

               -  two or more neurofibromas of any type of 1 or more plexiform neurofibroma

               -  first degree relative with NF1

          -  Participants must have at least four cutaneous neurofibromas on skin exam with the
             following qualities:

               -  the lesion must be discrete by clinical exam and must not be contact with another
                  skin tumor

               -  the lesion must be amenable to measurement with calipers with minimum dimension
                  of 5mm and maximum dimension of 30mm

               -  the lesions must be located on the trunk, neck, or extremities (excluding the
                  hands and feet) and must be located in an area that can be photographed

               -  histologic confirmation of tumor type is not required in the setting of
                  compatible clinical setting

          -  No treatment with an investigation agent for cutaneous neurofibromas within the last 3
             months

          -  18 years of age or older

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and nursing women

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 6 weeks prior to entering

             administered more than 6 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to imiquimod

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
