    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of inotuzumab ozogamicin (CMC-544) in
      subjects with indolent Non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) that is refractory or has relapsed after
      multiple therapies including rituximab or radioimmunotherapy. The investigational drug will
      be given to subjects with indolent NHL by intravenous infusion at a dose of 1.8 mg/m2, every
      4 weeks.

    <time_frame>Assessed for up to 2 years, including planned assessments every 8 to 12 weeks from first dose of study drug. Follow-up period may have been extended beyond 2 years due to dosing delays and allowed study visit windows.</time_frame>
    <description>CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and disease-related symptoms; all nodes must have decreased to normal (less than or equal to [≤]1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter [GTD] for nodes more than [&gt;]1.5 cm before therapy) or ≤1 cm (short axis) in previously involved node; enlarged spleen prior to therapy must have regressed and be non-palpable; bone marrow lymphoma: infiltrate must have been cleared on repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. PR was defined as &gt;50% decrease in the sum of the product diameters (SPD) of up to 6 index lesions. No increase in size of other nodes, liver or spleen. Splenic and hepatic nodules must have regressed by greater than or equal to [≥]50% in the SPD or GTD (for single nodules). With exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs was usually assessable and no measurable disease should be present. No progression of non-target disease or new lesions.</description>

    <time_frame>Cycle 1: pre-dose, 1 hour; Cycle 3 &amp; 4: pre-dose, 1, 3, 48, 168 hours; Cycle 6 (if applicable): pre-dose; end of treatment: during clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were performed approximately 2 minutes apart. ECG assessments were pre-specified in the protocol to be time-matched with selected pharmacokinetic (PK) samples in order to conduct a concentration-QTc analysis. A study-specific QT correction factor was estimated using the un-averaged triplicate data and was used to calculate the study-specific corrected QT (QTcS). QTcS interval versus serum concentrations were modeled using a population analysis approach to identify potential effects of total calicheamicin exposure. Results for drug effects were based on the median Cmax for total calicheamicin across all participants: median Cmax was 61.3 ng/mL</description>

    <description>Triplicate 12-lead ECG measurements (each recording separated by approximately 2 minutes) were performed and average was calculated. The time corresponding to the beginning of depolarization to repolarization of the ventricles (QT interval) was adjusted for RR interval using QT and RR from each ECG by Fridericia's formula (QTcF = QT divided by cube root of RR). Maximum QTcF was categorized as less than or equal to (≤) 450 msec, &gt;450 msec to ≤480 msec, &gt;480 msec to ≤500 msec and &gt;500 msec. Participants are reported only once under the maximum QTcF interval observed at any of the time-points. Maximum increase from baseline was categorized as &lt;30 msec, ≥30 to &lt;60 msec (borderline) and ≥60 msec (prolonged) were summarized.</description>

After Cycle 1, the dose and/or the frequency may have been adjusted, based on toxicities. Participants who may have derived benefit from additional treatment may have continued to receive additional cycles of test article, up to a maximum of 2 additional cycles after achievement of a CR or up to a maximum of 8 cycles, whichever occurred first.</description>

          <description>Kaplan-Meier: a rule for calculating an estimate of survival. PFS was defined as time from enrollment to death from any cause without progression, progression during and after treatment, and initiation of all new anti-cancer treatments for the lymphoma. For participants with no event, censorship occurred at the date of last valid disease assessment. PD was defined in accordance with the International Response Criteria for NHL: 1) New lesion or increase by ≥50% of previously involved sites from nadir, 2) New lesion(s) &gt;1.5 cm (any axis); ≥50% increase in SPD of &gt;1 node; or ≥50% increase in longest diameter of previously identified node &gt;1 cm in short axis, 3) &gt;50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previous lesions (splenic or hepatic) and 4) New or recurrent involvement in bone marrow.</description>

        <description>Triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements were performed approximately 2 minutes apart. ECG assessments were pre-specified in the protocol to be time-matched with selected pharmacokinetic (PK) samples in order to conduct a concentration-QTc analysis. A study-specific QT correction factor was estimated using the un-averaged triplicate data and was used to calculate the study-specific corrected QT (QTcS). QTcS interval versus serum concentrations were modeled using a population analysis approach to identify potential effects of total calicheamicin exposure. Results for drug effects were based on the median Cmax for total calicheamicin across all participants: median Cmax was 61.3 ng/mL</description>
