      1. To evaluate the effectiveness of AST-120 (spherical carbon adsorbent) added to
           standard-of-care therapy in moderate to severe Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD III-IV), on
           time to first occurrence of any event of the triple composite outcome of initiation of
           renal replacement therapy, decline of eGFR 50% or more or doubling of serum creatinine
           (sCr) when compared with standard-of-care group;

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of AST-120 (spherical carbon adsorbent) to GFR and
           proteinuria;

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of AST-120 (spherical carbon adsorbent) to health related
           quality of life;

        4. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term AST-120 therapy in patients with
           CKD;

        5. To evaluate the all-cause mortality and hospitalization apart from those planned for
           operation and intervention)
