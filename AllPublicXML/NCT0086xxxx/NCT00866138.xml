      This phase 2 study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of masitinib (AB1010) in
      patients with relapsing/refractory t(4;14) Multiple Myeloma. Response and progression were
      assessed according to the Blad√© revised IMWG criteria1 from lowest point.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             or not expressing FGFR3 identified by FACS

          -  Patients with Multiple Myeloma progressing or relapsing after at least two prior
             therapies (including conventional chemotherapy and/or high dose therapy) or who get a
             reduction of M-protein less than 75% within 3 months after a high dose treatment
             (Melphalan 200mg/m2) or after the plateau obtained for 3 months duration following to
             a conventional chemotherapy

             weeks washout period before the inclusion in the study.

          -  Patients must have a clearly detectable and quantifiable monoclonal M- component value
