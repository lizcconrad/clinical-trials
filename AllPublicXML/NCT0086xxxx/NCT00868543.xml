    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy (weight loss and metabolic
      changes) of long (150 cm) versus very long (250cm) Roux alimentary limb gastric bypass in
      superobese (BMI&gt;50) patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicentre trial in which superobese (BMI&gt;50) patients will be randomly
      assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) for laparoscopic gastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with: a) long
      (150 cm) or b) very long (250cm) alimentary Roux limb. Patients will be included from three
      hospitals: Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital (Lithuania), Klaipeda District Hospital
      (Lithuania), Vaasa Central Hospital (Finland) ) where preoperative investigation, the same
      technique surgical procedures and follow up will be performed acording approved protocol.

      Approximate duration of subject participation

      Subjects in the study will participate for approximately 5 years:

        -  Preoperative investigation and surgery 3- 5 days in the hospital;

        -  First follow up visit: 6 months after surgery;

        -  Next follow up visits: 12, 24, 36, 48 months after surgery;

        -  Last follow up visit: 5 years after surgery.

        -  The interim results after 12, 24 and 36 months will be calculated and presented before
           end of the study.

    <description>The fundus is separated by linear cutter. The intestine is opened approximately 75 cm from the ligament of Treitz and approached to the stomach. The gastrojejunostomy is performed in antecolic position The jejunum has to be in an antimesenteric position. After removing the endocutter, the anastomotic incision is closed with a continuous suture. The distance between the gastrojejunostomy and jejunojejunostomy was measured on the antimesenteric border with the bowel on a stretch. The jejunojejunostomy is performed in 150cm distance from gastrojejunostomy. The anastomosis is made by a posterior staple line and an anterior suture line. Preparation of a small window for the endocutter branches into the jejunal mesenterium 2-3 cm proximal to the gastrojejunostomy and above the entero-intestinal anastomosis.</description>
