  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the
      efficacy of controlled-release (CR) formulation of paroxetine orally administered to patients
      with major depressive disorder (MDD) at a dose level in the range of 25 - 50 mg/day (initial
      dose level, 12.5 or 25 mg/day) once daily after evening meal for 8 weeks based on the
      decrease in HAM-D (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) total score, to evaluate the safety
      based on adverse events, laboratory data and vital signs, and to describe the efficacy and
      safety of immediate release (IR) formulation of paroxetine.

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D; 17 Items) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D measures the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD). It is a checklist of 17 items that are ranked on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The range for the total score (which is the sum of the scores of all 17 items) is 0-52; a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms. Mean change from baseline was calculated as the value at Week 8 minus the Baseline value.</description>

    <description>The HAM-D measures the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with MDD. It is a checklist of 17 items that are ranked on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The range for the total score (which is the sum of the scores of all 17 items) is 0-52; a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0); Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-point CGI-SI scale assesses the clinician's impression of the participant's current illness state. Scores on the CGI-SI range from 1 = not ill at all to 7 = among the most extremely ill. Mean change from baseline was calculated as the value at each time point minus the baseline value.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-point CGI-GI assesses the participant's improvement or worsening from baseline. Scores on the CGI-GI range from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much worse. Responders are defined as participants with a score of 1 or 2 = much improved.</description>

          <description>An initial dose of 12.5 or 25 milligrams (mg)/day of paroxetine CR was administered orally once daily in the first week of the treatment phase. Thereafter, 25-50 mg/day was administered once daily for 7 weeks. In the second week, participants who started the treatment from 12.5 mg/day were forced to receive the uptitrated dose of 25 mg/day, and participants who started the treatment from 25 mg/day were maintained at the same dose level. The dose level was increased by 12.5 mg/day at intervals of at least 1 week until sufficient efficacy was confirmed. During the taper phase, the last dose level in the treatment phase was reduced by 12.5 mg/day at weekly intervals to the final dose level of 12.5 mg/day to complete the treatment.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the HAM-D Total Score at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8</title>
          <description>The HAM-D measures the severity of depressive symptoms in participants with MDD. It is a checklist of 17 items that are ranked on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The range for the total score (which is the sum of the scores of all 17 items) is 0-52; a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms. Mean change from baseline was calculated as the value at each time point minus the Baseline value.</description>
          <population>FAS. The analysis was performed on the following datasets: the observed case (OC) dataset for Week 1 and the LOCF dataset for Weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, where missing values were imputed by the last observed value in the longitudinal data. One participant in the Paroxetine CR group was not included in the OC analysis for having a missing value.</population>

Scores on the CGI-SI range from 1 = not ill at all to 7 = among the most extremely ill. Mean change from baseline was calculated as the value at each time point minus the baseline value.</description>
