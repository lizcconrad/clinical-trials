      Background:

      By limiting the number of embryos transferred to the uterus to only a single embryo, the risk
      of multiple gestation can be reduced. In order to improve the effectiveness of single embryo
      transfer, the ability to select the embryo with the highest potential to develop into a
      healthy child is of vital importance. While embryos rated as high quality by standardized
      morphological assessment are associated with higher implantation and pregnancy rates, it is
      still not possible to predict with certainty which embryo will implant and has the highest
      potential to develop into a healthy child. An increasing body of evidence indicates that the
      incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in embryos is extremely high and good embryo
      morphology does not necessarily exclude an abnormal chromosomal constitution. Since
      aneuploidies are considered the main cause of embryonic wastage and loss, this phenomenon may
      be primarily responsible for the relatively poor pregnancy rates reported after IVF.

      The introduction of fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques for preimplantation
      genetic diagnosis has enabled screening of embryos for chromosomal aneuploidies before
      transfer. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) would be of special interest for couples
      that are thought to have a higher risk of developing chromosomally abnormal embryos, with the
      aim of improving their chances for an ongoing pregnancy after IVF. PGS is applied clinically
      in numerous IVF laboratories throughout the world, and high rates of chromosomal
      abnormalities have been reported in IVF derived embryos. However, a recent meta-analysis has
      shown that PGS is yet to have a significant impact on IVF outcomes. This may partly be
      explained by the fact that most aneuploidies observed at this stage originate during the
      first mitotic divisions of early preimplantation development, resulting in chromosomally
      mosaic embryos. If a chromosomally mosaic embryo is biopsied, this cell may not be
      representative for the remaining embryo.

      The investigators' group recently completed the first prospectively designed, randomized
      trial, comparing embryo aneuploidy rates following two ovarian hyperstimulation regimes in a
      group of 111 IVF patients. Milder stimulation was associated with a reduction in the number
      of oocytes retrieved and embryos generated. However, the proportion of chromosomally normal
      embryos was significantly increased. These results showed for the first time a direct
      correlation between the ovarian stimulation protocol and the incidence of chromosome
      abnormalities in the embryo. The observation that mild stimulation in some patients still
      resulted in a high oocyte yield and concurring higher proportions of abnormal embryos,
      underscores the need for further development of minimal stimulation approaches.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine whether the administration of hCG during the late follicular phase, instead of
      continuing with a fixed dose FSH, results in a more homogeneous cohort of growing follicles
      and the development of only the most competent oocytes, leading to lower aneuploidy rates in
      resulting embryos.

      Study design:

      Prospectively randomized, clinical study in 110 women undergoing IVF treatment

      Intervention:

      Randomization to one of two ovarian stimulation protocols:

        1. Conventional regimen with a daily dose of 225 IU recombinant FSH and GnRH agonist long
           protocol co-treatment

        2. Mild ovarian stimulation regimen using the endogenous FSH production by starting
           treatment on day 5 of the menstrual cycle with 150 IU / d recFSH with GnRH antagonist co
           treatment starting on day 6. As soon as two follicles reach 12 mm, treatment is
           continued with 200 IU / d rec hCG.

      In both arms, oocyte pick up, insemination and embryo culture will be performed according to
      standard procedures. On day 3, all suitable embryos will be biopsied and one or two
      blastomeres removed, depending on the number of cells within the embryo.

      FISH analysis will be performed for 10 chromosomes (1, 7, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, X and Y).
      Only chromosomally normal embryos will be transferred and cryopreserved. Embryos diagnosed as
      aneuploid or mosaic will be investigated for their implantation and developmental potential,
      by transferring them to an in vitro implantation model. After an extended culture period,
      implantation behaviour will be assessed and the entire embryo is reanalysed to detect the
      proportion of chromosomally abnormal cells. The implantation behaviour will be correlated to
      the type of abnormality and the chromosome(s) involved.

      Primary outcome parameters:

      Ovarian response, as assessed by the number of oocytes obtained and the proportion of
      chromosomally abnormal embryos per patient.

      Secondary outcome parameters:

      Number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rates and proportion of morphologically high
      quality embryos on day 3.

      Serum estradiol, LH, progesterone, androgen and hCG levels on cycle day 3 and day of hCG.
