      Evaluate long-term performance of the 4195 LV Lead. This evaluation is based on the number of
      lead-related complications occuring during the study compared to the number of leads enrolled
      in the study. The leads will be followed for 5 years after implant. This study is required by
      FDA as a condition of approval of the Model 4195 LV Lead and is integrated within Medtronic's
      post-market surveillance platform.
