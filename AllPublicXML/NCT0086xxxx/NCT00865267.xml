      The purpose of this study is to determine the duration of application of halobetasol
      propionate 0.05% ointment to be used in a definitive study of bioequivalence of to
      formulations of this ointment.

      Part A: To validate vasoconstrictor assay precision.

      Part B: To evaluate the dose response vasoconstriction profile of Ultravate® 0.05% ointment
      at different dose durations over a short period of time (0.17 - 4 hrs).
