    <textblock>
      The American College of Surgeons now requires screening for alcohol use in trauma centers.
      The purpose of this research study is to provide information about the best screening and
      treatment methods. The investigators hope the findings will provide information that will
      improve healthcare by reducing problems related to risky alcohol use. The trauma team is
      conducting a comparison of two different ways of talking about alcohol use. Participants will
      be randomized into one of the two study groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to guide further policy development regarding effective alcohol
      screening by: (a) comparing the effectiveness of two new, shorter screening tools for risky
      drinking patterns with the longer screening tool in current use; (b) assessing the outcomes
      of two different brief counseling interventions (BIs) with trauma patients screened to have
      risky drinking behaviors; and (c) examining the impact of the implementation of this new
      policy in a Level I Trauma Center.

      The Specific Aims will be accomplished by:

        1. Screening patients who are admitted to the Trauma Center, and conducting BIs for all who
           screen positive;

        2. Collecting formative qualitative data regarding participants' perceptions of benefits of
           drunken states, their individual risks, and perceived healthier alternatives;

        3. Collecting quantitative data (injury severity score and hospital length of stay) and
           correlating these data with patient demographics and responses on the different
           screening methods;

        4. Collecting follow-up data by telephone on self-reported alcohol use and trauma
           recidivism, using an interviewer-administered assessment;

        5. Collecting data on trauma recidivism from ED data, publicly available records, and
           patient self-report at 6-month telephone follow-up;

        6. Surveying trauma staff and physicians at three intervals regarding the process of
           implementing the new ACS policy, any perceived difficulties, and the perceived impact
