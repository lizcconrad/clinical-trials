  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through complex hormonal pathways, insulin resistance can lead to the activation of the
      sympathetic nervous system, and vice versa. Schobel et al. showed that in PE patients,
      mus-cle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is increased compared with normotensive pregnant
      and non-pregnant women. Studies assessing heart-rate variability and plasma noradrenalin
      concentrations also suggest increased sympathetic activity in PE. It has been hypothesized
      that sympathetic over-activity is a precursor of PE, normally compensated for by vasodilating
      mechanisms, but resulting in PE when the mechanisms fail. In addition to sympathetic
      activity, various markers of inflamma-tion are also associated with reduced insulin
      sensitivity, suggesting that chronic sub-clinical inflamma-tion could be part of the insulin
      resistance syndrome. The role of sympathetic over-activity and inflammatory markers in
      gestational diabetes has not been investigated

        Gestational diabetic women having or not hypertension with two control groups, one pregnant
        on non-pregnant. All the women are studied during night time to study the arousal of the
        sympathetic activity in the early morning hours
