  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a retrospective cohort study on patients who suffered a nosocomial
      infection in major hospitals in Vietnam. Data relating to patient demography include age,
      gender; medical history; APACHE II score; background conditions, infection details and
      antimicrobial therapy; and all-caused mortality, time of hospitalization and intensive care.
      The investigators hypothesis is that antimicrobial treatment inappropriate is highly
      dependent on incidence of antibiotic resistant pathogens, nonfermentative Gram-negative
      bacilli and ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae spp. Variables are demographic characteristics,
      background conditions, immunosuppressive therapy, antimicrobial susceptibility and
      inappropriate treatment is explored as possible predictors of mortality.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient was diagnosed as nosocomial infection defined according to criteria
             established by the US CDC. The diagnosis criteria for ventilator-associated pneumonia
             are modified from those established by the American College of Chest Physicians.

          -  Patient received empiric antimicrobial therapy within 24 hour from onset of infection
             and had antimicrobial susceptibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A patient was in part of a controlled clinical trial for the current infection
             episode.

          -  Patients with suspected infections by virus or fungus or tuberculosis will be
             excluded.
