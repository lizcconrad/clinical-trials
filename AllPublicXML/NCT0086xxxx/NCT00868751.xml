    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if tocilizumab is safe and effective for treating
      systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (soJIA). Another purpose is to see if
      tocilizumab helps reduce the amount of steroids (prednisone) needed to control symptoms of
      soJIA.

    <textblock>
      Systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (soJIA) is a type of arthritis (inflammation of
      the joints) that occurs with other symptoms including fever, swollen lymph nodes (glands),
      rash, and body aches. Because soJIA can be difficult to treat, children with soJIA can have
      severe problems from long-term use of steroids (prednisone). These problems include low bone
      density (weak bones), fractures, failure to grow properly, and large weight gain. The
      arthritis that occurs in soJIA often causes damage to many joints. This can make it hard to
      move around or do basic tasks like dressing. Also, a life-threatening illness called
      Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) can occur when starting, stopping, or changing drugs
      that are used to treat soJIA.

      SoJIA can be hard to treat and many children with soJIA do not respond to drugs that work for
      other kinds of arthritis. Research doctors have studied a chemical signal called IL-6 that
      the body uses to manage inflammation. This signal has been found to be very high in patients
      with active soJIA. A drug called tocilizumab (TCZ) has been designed to block IL-6. For about
      6 years, TCZ has been tested in Japan for treating soJIA. It is now being tested in studies
      in the United States. These studies can have very strict rules for enrolling patients. This
      trial is a single-patient research study for a subject who otherwise does not meet the rules
      for enrollment in ongoing trials.
