    <textblock>
      Patients with possible operable non-small cell lung cancer are randomised to conventional
      staging, or conventional staging and PET/CT. According to, patients with operable tumor will
      be referred to surgery, and the number of thoracotomies and futile thoracotomies wil be
      compared with the two groups in order to asses the possible benefit of PET/CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with possible operable NSCLC after staging with CT are randomised to PET-CT with FDG
      or not, prior to mediastinoscopy. All patients are referred to mediastinoscopy unless a
      positive FDG uptake results in a positive biopsy suggesting stage IV disease.

      Biopsies are performed according to the following criteria:

        1. Lymph nodes are numbered according the Mountain classification, and abnormal lesions
           must be confirmed histologically, by mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy.

        2. PET-positive lesions in the liver must be biopsied unless ultrasound or MRI
           unequivocally indicate the lesions are benign cysts or haemangioma.

        3. PET-negative adrenal lesions are accepted without biopsy if CT scan indicate the lesion
           is a benign adenoma.

        4. PET-positive bone lesions must be evaluated by plain x-ray, CT, MRI, or bone
           scintigraphy. In case of equivocal findings a biopsy must be performed.

        5. PET-positive brain lesions must be confirmed by CT or MRI.

      Number of patients:

      Patients with clinically operable NSCLC after CT-staging are included. All patients must have
      mediastinoscopy performed.

      All patients referred to mediastinoscopy can be randomised after informed consent. A total of
      430 consecutive, non-selected patients are planned. It is anticipated that approximately 60%
      of the referred patients with clinical stage I-IIIa NSCLC will undergo thoracotomy, and a
      risk of type I and II error of 5% and 10%, respectively, is accepted. Thus a total of 215
      patients are randomised in each arm in order to observe an absolute difference of 15% in the
      number of thoracotomies. This number seems to be sufficient to evaluate differences in the
      secondary endpoints.

      After inclusion of a total of 220 patients, corresponding to 110 PET-scans, an interim
      analyses are performed. In case of a highly significant difference in the number of
      thoracotomies (p &lt; 0,001) the study will be closed.
