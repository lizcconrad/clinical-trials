    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the use of cardiac CT in identifying atherosclerosis plaque in
      patients who have not been diagnosed with atherosclerosis and who have no symptoms of the
      disease but who are at risk of developing atherosclerosis based on traditional risk factors
      such as diabetes or a family history of coronary artery disease.

          -  Aymptomatic

               -  no chest pain, shortness of breath, angina or angina-equivalent that is assumed
                  to be related to myocardial ischemia
