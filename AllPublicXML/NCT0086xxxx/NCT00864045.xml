    <textblock>
      This study is the first randomised clinical trial performed in Asia with sertindole, aiming
      at comparing sertindole efficacy and safety to that of another atypical antipsychotic.

      Sertindole is a limbic-selective antipsychotic agent with a unique neuropharmacological
      profile. Sertindole has shown significant improvements relative to placebo against both
      positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (measured by PANSS total, PANSS negative and
      positive subscale scores). It is well tolerated and shows placebo-level incidence of
      extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Sertindole is associated with a dose-dependent increase in the
      QT interval, but this does not translate into an excess mortality with sertindole relative to
      that of other recently developed antipsychotics in their respective clinical development
      programmes.
