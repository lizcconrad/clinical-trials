      The aim of this study was to develop and pilot a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      parent-child intervention for 4-7-year-old children at risk for anxiety disorders. The
      20-session intervention was first piloted openly in 9 children (between 3/10/98 and
      1/1/2001). The intervention was then tested in 65 children in a randomized controlled trial
      versus a monitoring-only wait-list control condition. Children had to either have an anxiety
      disorder, behavioral inhibition, or be the offspring of a parent with an anxiety disorder who
      had elevated symptoms of anxiety. In practice all children but one had at least one anxiety
      disorder at baseline. Children were blocked on presence or absence of parental anxiety
      disorder and randomized to the intervention or to a no-intervention wait-list control group.
      The intervention consisted of 6 parent-only sessions, 8-13 child-parent sessions, and a final
      parent session. Post-trial assessments were conducted at six months, and at one-year
      follow-up. The hypotheses were that the children assigned to the intervention group would
      show significantly better improvement (measured via Clinician Global Impression-Anxiety
      Improvement scale and absence of anxiety disorders) than children assigned to the wait-list
      condition.

    <description>This is a cognitive-behavioral intervention modeled loosely after Kendall's &quot;Coping Cat,&quot; which includes 7 parent-only sessions and 8-13 child-only sessions. It focuses on helping parents learn strategies for coaching their child in coping with anxiety, and on teaching the child coping skills and carrying out exposure exercises in session and in parent-child homework assignments.</description>

          -  (In the controlled trial): Child judged clinically unable to wait six months for

          -  Suicidal Ideation

          -  Serious impairment in eating or sleeping habits

             functioning.

          -  All judgments of severity of symptoms/impairment are based on a clinician review of
             the Kiddie-SADS-E and a clinical evaluation with the family.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Study recruitment for the controlled trial occurred between February 2001 and January 2004. Children were recruited from the outpatient child psychiatry clinic at a general hospital, as well as through print ads in local newspapers and parent magazines, email advertisements to hospital employees, and posters at local pediatrics practices.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>We screened 103 children for the controlled trial, to enroll our target goal of 60-65 children. Of these 14 were ineligible (3 did not meet inclusion criteria, and 9 met exclusion criteria). Another 13 withdrew prior to completing baseline assessments, and 11 who did not complete baseline assessments were lost to follow-up. Thus 65 were enrolled.</pre_assignment_details>
