  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated intraocular pressure is still the main risk factor for development and progression
      of glaucoma. Several drugs exist on the market that may decrease IOP in glaucomatous
      patients. However, some patients cannot reach the target pressure despite a multitherapy with
      a combination of drugs, and are therefore addressed to surgical treatments. Forskolin is a
      natural compound that is a receptor-independent adenyl-cyclase activator, that increases
      intracellular cAMP. It has been shown to be able to decrease IOP after topical application,
      by a mechanism that is not used by the other drugs. Aim of the present study is to see
      whether oral administration of a food supplement containing forskolin (KRONEK) has any effect
      on the IOP of POAG patients with stable IOP obtained by treatment with either beta-blockers
      or prostaglandins.
