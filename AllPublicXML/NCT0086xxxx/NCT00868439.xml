  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of patiromer on serum potassium
      participants with heart failure. This study also assessed the safety and tolerability of
      patiromer in participants with heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multiple-dose study
      in congestive heart failure participants. Depending on the outcome from the initial cohort of
      100 participants (Part 1), a second cohort of 170 participants could have been enrolled (Part
      2). Based on the results of Part 1 of the study, Part 2 was not conducted.

      Participants were randomly assigned to and received patiromer (30 g/day) or placebo for up to
      28 days. All participants also received spironolactone; the initial spironolactone dose was
      25 mg daily and was increased to 50 mg daily for participants who had a serum potassium ≤ 5.1
      mEq/L on treatment Day 14. Study visits occurred on treatment Days 3, 7, 14, 17, 21 and 28. A
      safety follow-up contact was made 7 days after administration of last dose of study drug.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>120 subjects were randomized in Part 1 of the study (60 to each treatment group). Of these, 120 randomized subjects, 105 received either RLY5016 Powder for Suspension (n = 56) or placebo (n = 49).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants ≥ 18 y/o, had history of chronic HF, clinically initiated spironolactone therapy, serum K+ = 4.3 – 5.1 mEq/L at screening and baseline, and either had 1) CKD, w/ eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min and receiving HF therapies or 2) documented history of hyperkalemia led to discontinuation w/ aldosterone antagonist w/in 6 months prior to baseline.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Spironolactone + Patiromer
Participants received patiromer (15 g twice daily [BID]).
Participants also started spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg/day, which was increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks if the participant's serum potassium (based on local laboratory determination) was &gt; 3.5 mEq/L and ≤ 5.1 mEq/L. The spironolactone dose remained at 25 mg/day if the serum potassium was &gt; 5.1 mEq/L and ≤ 5.5 mEq/L. If, at any time, a participant’s serum potassium level was confirmed to be ≤ 3.5 mEq/L or &gt; 5.5 mEq/L based on local laboratory data, the participant was to be discontinued from the study.</description>

Participants also started spironolactone at a dose of 25 mg/day, which was increased to 50 mg/day after 2 weeks if the participant's serum potassium (based on local laboratory determination) was &gt; 3.5 mEq/L and ≤ 5.1 mEq/L. The spironolactone dose remained at 25 mg/day if the serum potassium was &gt; 5.1 mEq/L and ≤ 5.5 mEq/L. If, at any time, a participant’s serum potassium level was confirmed to be ≤ 3.5 mEq/L or &gt; 5.5 mEq/L based on local laboratory data, the participant was to be discontinued from the study.</description>
