      This study will investigate the toxicity, safety and pharmacokinetics of pretargeted
      radioimmunotherapy with anti-CEA x anti-hapten bispecific antibody TF2 and Lu-177-labeled
      di-HSG-DOTA peptide IMP-288. Furthermore, the sensitivity of pretargeted imaging with
      In-111-labeled IMP-288 as compared to standard methods of tumor detection, and the
      preliminary efficacy of the therapy.

             treatment is available

          -  WHO performance status: 0 or 1

          -  Having normal hematological function: Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 109/l; Platelet count &gt; 150
             x 109/l, without transfusion during the previous month; Hemoglobin &gt; 5.6 mmol/l

          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  ASAT, ALAT &lt; 3 x ULN

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN

          -  Cockcroft clearance &gt; 50 ml/min

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childÂ¬bearing potential (urine or serum)

          -  Age over 18 years

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known metastases to the brain

          -  Chemotherapy, external beam radiation or immunotherapy within 4 weeks prior to study.
             Limited field external beam radiotherapy to prevent pathological fractures is allowed,
             when unirradiated, evaluable lesions elsewhere are present.

          -  Prior angiogenesis inhibitors within 4 weeks; bevacizumab within 8 weeks

          -  Cardiac disease with New York Heart Association classification of III or IV

             an effective method of contraception

          -  Any unrelated illness, e.g. active infection, inflammation, medical condition or
             laboratory abnormalities, which in the judgement of the investigator will
             significantly affect patients' clinical status

          -  Life expectancy shorter than 6 months.
