      Background:

        -  Vitamin E is an antioxidant that reduces the damaging effects of oxygen in the body.
           Most American men (90%) and women (96%) do not get enough vitamin E from their diets;
           however, the amount of vitamin E needed by the body has been studied only in men, not
           women. In addition, it is unknown whether another antioxidant, vitamin C, helps vitamin
           E in protecting the body. Because vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin, how much body fat
           a person has could affect the amount of vitamin E needed for protection.

      Objectives: This study has three arms to examine vitamin E requirements:

        -  To determine the amount of fat required to get the best vitamin E absorption from a
           meal.

        -  To determine the amount (i.e., best dose) of vitamin E that must be consumed before it
           can be measured in the blood.

        -  To examine how vitamin E and vitamin C work together in the body, in conjunction with
           diet and vitamin supplements.

      Eligibility:

        -  Arms 1 and 2: Women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have a normal weight and
           body mass index (BMI) of 27 or less.

        -  Arm 3: Women between the ages of 18 and 40 years who have a normal weight (BMI 27), who
           are overweight (BMI &gt; 27), or who are overweight (BMI &gt; 27) and have non
           insulin-dependent diabetes.

      Design:

        -  Arm 1: Five studies, each lasting 1 month with 1 month off between studies (total study
           = 10 months). Participants will take 500 1,000 mg of vitamin C twice daily for 2 weeks
           before admission to the clinical center for 1 week.

        -  Study 1: Participants will eat breakfast containing a known amount of fat, after which
           they will take a vitamin E pill as well as receive an IV injection of vitamin E. Other
           foods contain only negligible amounts of vitamin E. Blood and urine samples will measure
           levels of vitamin E and other substances.

        -  Studies 2 5: Outpatient visits will consist of the same tests as in Study 1; however,
           the amount of fat in the breakfast will range from 0% to 40% in random order. During one
           of the studies, an adipose tissue biopsy will be collected to determine how much vitamin
           E is in the tissues.

        -  Arm 2: Five studies, each lasting 1 month with 1 month off between studies (total study
           = 10 months). Preparation for Arm 2 is the same as in Arm 1. The proportion of fat,
           muscle, and water in the body will also be measured.

        -  Study 1: Participants will eat breakfast containing 30% fat, after which they will take
           a vitamin E pill as well as receive an IV injection of vitamin E. Conditions and
           procedures are the same as in Arm 1.

        -  Studies 2 5: Outpatient visits will consist of the same tests as in Study 1; however,
           the amount of vitamin E in the breakfast will range from 2 to 30 mg in random order.

        -  Arm 3: Outpatient (2 to 6 weeks) and inpatient studies (4 to 6 weeks).

        -  Outpatient study: Participants will take 500 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily and provide
           blood and urine samples, as well as an adipose tissue sample.

        -  Inpatient studies: Two vitamin E inpatient studies. Before these begin, participants
           vitamin C blood levels will be reduced by means of a diet low in vitamin C. Blood tests
           will determine how quickly vitamin C leaves the body. Once the vitamin C level is
           reduced, the first vitamin E study will begin.

      Study A: The procedure for this study is the same as in Arm 2, Study 1.

      Study B: The procedure for this study is the same as in Study A, except that the participants
      blood vitamin C levels will be higher.

      Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) is essential for humans but determining human dietary requirements
      has proved difficult. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin E is not met by 96%
      of American women, without apparent harm. Because vitamin E is an antioxidant, optimum
      consumption of vitamin E may improve the health of obese women who experience high levels of
      inflammation and oxidative stress. We hypothesize that vitamin E functions as an antioxidant
      is related to its tissue stores, and that delivery to tissue stores can be calculated from
      plasma vitamin E turnover kinetics from slow release pools. We propose turnover kinetics as a
      new means to estimate vitamin E recommended dietary allowance. We will study vitamin E
      pharmacokinetics using dual stable-isotope labeled (deuterium) a-tocopherols administered
      orally and intravenously to healthy nonobese, overweight and overweight non-insulin requiring
      diabetic women. Blood samples will be collected at intervals and vitamin E measured by mass
      spectrometry. Because ascorbic acid (vitamin C) concentrations may alter a-tocopherol
      pharmacokinetics, subjects will be studied first at low and then high steady state plasma
      vitamin C concentrations. Before this main study, two preliminary trials will be performed.
      In preliminary trial 1, fat content for optimal absorption will be assessed because
      fat-content of a meal may alter vitamin E absorption. The fat content will be 0 - 40% of
      calories in the breakfast meal during which vitamin E will be administered. In preliminary
      trial 2, optimal fat content from preliminary trial 1 will be used, and the vitamin E dose
      will be varied. Vitamin E dose amount could non-specifically alter vitamin E kinetics. We
      will therefore determine the largest dose (2-30 mg) that does not non-specifically increase
      vitamin E turnover, with fat held constant. Additionally, we will measure vitamin E
      pharmacokinetics as a function of lipid peroxidation biomarkers to provide direct data that
      can be used to predict vitamin E requirements for women, and to set new recommendations for
      vitamin E intakes. We will explore new a-tocopherol functions, specifically whether gene
      transcription in human subjects is regulated by vitamin E status in relation to vitamin C
      status. Because vitamin E turnover may be affected by vitamin C concentrations, we will use a
      vitamin C depletion-repletion study design to investigate the relationship between vitamin C
      status and vitamin E turnover.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with the following diseases or abnormalities will not be eligible for the study:

          -  Digestive abnormalities, such as malabsorption or chronic diarrhea

          -  Organ malfunction, including (but not limited to) liver disease, pulmonary disease,

          -  Complications from diabetes such as kidney damage (renal insufficiency, serum
             creatinine &gt;1.8), eye damage (proliferative retinopathy), diabetic neuropathy,
             coronary artery disease, or peripheral vascular disease

          -  Tobacco smoking

          -  Use of medications (other than oral hypoglycemic agents, hormonal contraceptives and
             medications taken only on an as-needed basis).

          -  Alcohol or drug abuse

          -  Insulin treatment

          -  Pregnancy or lactation (a urine pregnancy test will be performed on all women with
             reproductive age before each part of the study or monthly as necessary)

             duration of the study.

        Patients on antihypertensive medication are excluded even if blood pressure is well
        controlled because antihypertensive medication may affect vitamin E status, thus
        introducing a confounding variable. Whether antihypertensive medication interacts with
        vitamin E is not

        known. Patients on insulin treatment are excluded because Insulin treatment indicates a
        more severe form of diabetes than the mild to moderate type two diabetes that need only
        dietary treatment or treatment with submaximal doses of oral hypoglycemic agents for
        adequate blood sugar control. The effect of insulin administration on vitamin E is unknown,
        and is a confounding factor that will make data interpretation difficult.
