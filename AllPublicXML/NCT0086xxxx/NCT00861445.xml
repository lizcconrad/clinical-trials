        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has clinically diagnosed pain attributed to diabetic distal sensory motor
             polyneuropathy for 1-5 years and a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (Type I or Type II).

          -  Subjects must have at least moderate pain (mean pain intensity ≥ 4 out of 10 during
             the baseline week on Likert scale).

          -  subjects must have good or fair diabetic control (Hgb A1c &lt; 10%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has other conditions that cause neuropathic pain at least as severe as the
             diabetic pain i.e. peripheral arterio-vascular disease.

          -  Subject receives treatment for seizures.

          -  Subject has had any amputations other than diabetically-related toe amputations.

          -  Subject has major skin ulcers.

          -  Subject has clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

          -  Subject is expected to take within 7 days prior to randomization and during the study:
             TCAs, mexiletine hydrochloride, lidoderm patch, tramadol, AEDs, dextromethorphan,
             opioids, capsaicin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen / paracetamol,
             skeletal muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, alpha-2-agonists (e.g. clonidine), drugs
             indicated for sleep disturbance (e. g. zolpidem tartrate, zaleplon) and
             over-the-counter medications with centrally acting properties.

          -  Subject has laboratory values which are outside the normal range and judged by the
             investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  At study entry, subject has liver function tests values (AST, ALT,alkaline
             phosphatase, total bilirubin and GGT) 2 times upper limit of normal.

          -  subject has impaired renal function, i.e., creatinine clearance is lower than 60
             mL/min.
