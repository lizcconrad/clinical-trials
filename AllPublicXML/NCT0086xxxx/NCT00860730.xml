      The clinical investigation is designed as a prospective and non-randomised study on a maximum
      of 150 patients. This study will be conducted at Investigational Centres in the European
      Community. A minimum number of 8 European Centres will be involved in the clinical
      investigation. A minimum of 15 patients will be enrolled at each Investigational Centre. The
      clinical follow-up requires evaluations at discharge (or 30 days if the patient is still
      hospitalized), 3-6 and 12 months following the procedure.The primary objective of this
      clinical investigation is to assess the performance of the Perceval S valve at 3-6 months
      after implantation in high surgical risk patients, who require a surgical intervention to
      replace the aortic valve.

      The design of the Perceval S prosthesis stems from the intention to offer an alternative to
      traditional flexible prostheses (stented and stentless biological valves) using conventional
      open-heart surgery. As a result of the sutureless implant procedure, in fact, patients could
      benefit from:

      Reducing aortic clamp times, with subsequent overall reduction of surgical timing and
      therefore reduction in related risks; Avoiding to pass the stitches through the annulus and
      sutures knotting, with consequent less risk of tearing aortic annulus and wall, damaging the
      bundle of His, embolizing foreign material in the vascular system.

          -  Subjects with aortic valve stenosis or steno-insufficiency;

          -  Subjects at high surgical risk and candidates for aortic valve replacement with a
             biological prosthesis;

          -  Subjects in NYHA functional classes III and IV with the Logistic EuroSCORE greater
             than 5%.

          -  Subjects who have agreed to participation in the clinical evaluation and who have
             signed the informed consent;

          -  Subjects who are willing to undergo all the medical follow-ups and echocardiographic
             examinations and laboratory tests that form part of this present protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects involved in any other clinical study for drugs or devices;

          -  Subjects who have previously undergone implantation with the Perceval S prosthesis
             being assessed;

          -  Subjects with previous implantation of valve prostheses or annuloplasty ring in mitral
             position;

          -  Subjects requiring simultaneous procedures, apart from septal myectomy and/or coronary
             by-pass;

             surgical correction;

          -  Subjects needing non elective intervention;

          -  Subjects with aortic annulus (after procedure for decalcification) of dimensions such
             that the implantation of a valve of size 21 or 23 mm is not possible (direct
             intra-operative measurement with sizer), in accordance with the indications reported
             in the Investigator's Brochure;
