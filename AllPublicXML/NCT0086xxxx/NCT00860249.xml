  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether patient outreach is effective at increasing
      compliance with preventative screenings for those patients who, based on national quality
      standards, have become newly eligible for screening measures. We hypothesize that educational
      outreach may increase completion rates.

    <time_frame>6 months from initial contact</time_frame>
    <description>What would have been reported as this Outcome Measure is the number of participants who completed screening. We planned to review electronic health records of participants 6 months post randomization to look for either: (1) note in free text MD note documenting receipt of one form of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening during study period or (2)lab results from fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy. Screening completion equaled presence of a lab result or physician note in chart. No patient charts were reviewed due to low accrual.</description>

    <description>Usual Care. Participants in this arm will receive Usual care until outcome assessment is performed at 6 months following randomization. At that time, they will be sent a letter reminding them to obtain the ordered preventative service test, however no further outcomes will be assessed. Thus, during the course of the study, all participants in this arm will have solely received usual care.</description>

          <description>This Outcome Measure would have reported the length of time, measured in days, that occurred between the date of randomization and the completed screening date. We planned to review the electronic health records of participants 6 months post randomization to look for either: (1)note in free text MD note documenting receipt of one form of CRC screening during study period or (2)lab results from fecal occult blood test, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy. Screening completion equaled presence of a lab result or physician note in chart. No patient charts were reviewed due to low accrual.</description>
          <population>Although 60 individuals were randomized to condition, the trial was halted prior to primary or secondary outcome chart reviews. Hence there are no results to report.</population>
