      To compare the rate of absorption and oral bioavailability of a test formulation of
      Sertraline 100 mg tablets manufactured by Purepac Pharmaceutical Company to an equivalent
      oral dose of the commercially available reference product, Zoloft® manufactured by Pfizer
      Inc. Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, subjects will consume a standard
      high-calorie, high-fat breakfast meal. This standard breakfast will begin 30 minutes prior to
      each dose.

             medication.

          -  Has participated in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to first dose of study
             medication.
