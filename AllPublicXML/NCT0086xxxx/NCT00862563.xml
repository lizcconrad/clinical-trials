  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study with 4 treatment
      groups; levetiracetam, zonisamide, topiramate, and placebo control. Subjects will receive
      study medications for 14 weeks. Potential subjects will be initially screened for interest in
      study participation and alcohol consumption level to determine basic eligibility by
      telephone, or in person. Individuals who meet telephone screening criteria will be scheduled
      for a clinic appointment to obtain informed consent and conduct screening assessments.
      Subjects who report average drinks per day that are within the guidelines for safe levels of
      alcohol consumption (i.e. 2 drinks/ day males; 1 drink/day females-HHS standard) in the two
      weeks prior to screening will be excluded. Subjects meeting screening criteria will be
      scheduled for a second randomization visit. During this visit baseline assessments will be
      obtained. Eligible subjects will then be randomized to a treatment group and will be provided
      with the first week's study medications. The goal is to directly compare the efficacy and
      tolerability of two novel anticonvulsants, zonisamide and levetiracetam, with placebo, and
      using topiramate, which has extensive evidence supporting its efficacy in alcoholism, as a
      positive control group. We believe that this will be the first direct comparison of these
      agents in alcoholism, and the results will provide information on the efficacy and safety of
      the medications.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design study with 4 treatment
      groups; levetiracetam, zonisamide, topiramate, and placebo control. This study evaluated the
      effects of zonisamide (400 mg per day) on alcohol consumption and its neurotoxic effects in
      subjects with AUDS. A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted using two
      comparator anticonvulsant drugs, topiramate (300 mg daily) and levetiracetam (2000 mg/day),
      which does not impair cognition. Topiramate was used as an active control in this study.

      Study medications were administered for 14 weeks, including a 2-week taper period. Target
      maintenance doses of study medications were administered to subjects during study weeks 8-12.
      Dosage reductions were made if needed to allow subjects to tolerate their study medication.
      During the medication taper phase of the study (Weeks 13-14) the Principal Investigator is
      allowed flexibility in the titration schedule in instances when the subject is experiencing
      events consistent with withdrawal, for example anxiety. Neurotoxicity of study drugs was
      assessed using neuropsychological tests and the AB-Neurotoxicity scale.

      An adaptive randomization procedures with sex and heavy drinking history being factors in the
      assignment of subjects to the treatment groups. will be done using sex and very heavy
      drinking. Very heavy drinking is defined as male subjects consuming more then 10 standard
      drinks per day and female subjects consuming more then 8 standard drinks per day for more
      then 40 percent of the days in the screening TLFB.

      Medication adherence was facilitated using Brief Behavioral Compliance Enhancement Treatment.
      It is a brief, standardized therapy that emphasizes medication adherence as being crucial to
      the improvement of drinking behavior.

      Subject assessments included, but were not limited to the following:

      1) TLFB, 2) Adverse Events (AEs) assessment ,3) A-B Neurotoxicity Scale (weeks
      1,4,8,12,15),and 4) Neuropsychological battery Assessments- including the Controlled Word
      Association Test (COWAT) and Digit and Spatial Span portions of the Wechsler Memory Scale-
      3rd (weeks 1,12).

The Vocabulary subtest is used to evaluate verbal knowledge, verbal expressiveness, and fund of information. The Matrix Reasoning subtest measures nonverbal reasoning and general intellectual ability. Scores range between 55 to 157, with the higher scores indicating greater intelligence. The mean score for this test is set to be 100.</description>
