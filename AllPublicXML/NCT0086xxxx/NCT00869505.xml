    <textblock>
      Memantine is a glutamate receptor antagonist that has been reported to reduce
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) symptoms in case studies of treatment-resistant
      individuals. The investigators hypothesized that memantine is an effective augmenting agent
      to standard intensive residential treatment of severe OCD. An intent-to-treat,
      single-blinded, naturalistic case-control design is employed. The sample includes subjects
      receiving standard treatment at the McLean/ MGH Intensive Residential Treatment (IRT)
      program, half of whom also receive memantine augmentation. Admission, monthly and discharge
      measures of OCD, depression and psychosocial functioning are collected by raters blinded to
      augmentation status. Matched controls are selected based upon gender, initial OCD severity,
      psychosocial functioning, and timing of admission. Descriptive and comparative analyses are
      conducted via SPSS, statistical significance is defined at p&lt;0.05, clinically significant
      response is defined by a 25% reduction, and 'marked response' is defined by a 50% improvement
      in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive severity (Y-BOCS) scores, using a
      last-observation-carried-forward approach. The Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) scale
      captures global clinical change.

        The study population comprised 44 subjects who received standard treatment at the MGH/
        McLean Hospital OCD Institute Intensive Residential Treatment (IRT) program, admitted
        between May 1999 and December 2007.
