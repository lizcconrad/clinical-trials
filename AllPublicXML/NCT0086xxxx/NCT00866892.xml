  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most pediatric lacerations occur indoors and are considerably noncontaminated. Wounds that
      occur outside of the house where dirt often enters the laceration, irrigation and scrubbing
      with soap has been proven effective at decreasing post-laceration infections. To date there
      are no pediatric prospective studies addressing a less aggressive approach to face and scalp
      wound preparation in pediatrics. We argue that wiping wounds with sterile gauze soaked in
      sterile saline will not increase infection rates as compared to our current practice. In our
      emergency departments, the current standard of care for all lacerations is aggressive wound
      preparation: irrigation and scrubbing. This occurs regardless if the wound is contaminated or
      not. Research has proven that irrigation and scrubbing is unwarranted in adults with face and
      scalp lacerations. We want to perform a pilot/feasibility study comparing our two emergency
      campuses. One campus will serve as the control site, while the other will be the intervention
      site. In this pilot study, our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of the intervention and
      provide data that a less aggressive approach to wound preparation is just as effective as our
      standard of care. We hope this project leads to further discussion about how we manage
      noncontaminated lacerations and provides a stepping-stone to a larger, appropriated powered
      study.
