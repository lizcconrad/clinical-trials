      The purpose of the study is the assessment of the barrier impairment, clinical skin condition
      and bacterial colonization status in patients with atopic eczema following topical treatment
      with K201 cream and a comparator twice daily over a 4-week treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  signed written informed consent obtained;

          -  male or female patients, 18 years or older;

          -  manifest atopic eczema diagnosed according to Hanifin and Rajka;

          -  two comparable lesional areas of 20 - 50 cm2 with a distance of at least 5 cm,
             clinical condition of atopic eczema mild to moderate (meeting Hanifin and Rajka´s
             criteria;

          -  TEWL in the lesional areas at least 12 g/m²h, TEWL value differences ≤ 30 % are
             allowed between both lesional areas;

          -  the physical examination must be without disease findings unless the investigator
             considers an abnormality to be irrelevant to the outcome of the study;

          -  sexually active females of childbearing potential should either be surgically sterile
             hysterectomy or tubal ligation), or should use a medically accepted contraceptive
             regimen:systemic contraceptive (oral, implant, injection), diaphragm or cervical cap
             with intravaginal spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), condom with intravaginal
             spermicide.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  acne, eczema other than atopic eczema, hyper- or hypopigmentation or tattoos in the
             treatment areas;

          -  suntan which in the opinion of the investigator prevents correct assessments

          -  dark-skinned persons whose skin color prevents ready assessment of skin reactions;

          -  evidence of drug or alcohol abuse;

          -  pregnancy or nursing;

          -  UV-therapy within 6 weeks before first treatment;

          -  participation in another clinical study involving pharmaceutical products in the 28
             days preceding or during the study;

          -  symptoms of a clinically significant illness that may influence the outcome of the
             study in the four weeks before and during the study;

          -  known allergic reactions to components of the study preparation and the comparator;

          -  treatment with systemic or locally acting medications which might counter or influence
             the study aim (e.g. antihistamines or glucocorticosteroids) within two weeks before
             the beginning of the study (exception: asthma may be found in patients with atopic
             eczema,therefore inhalation with corticosteroids in patients with asthma accompanying
             atopic eczema will be allowed at a dose not exceeding 1 mg/day. The dosage should
             remain constant throughout the study period);

          -  in the opinion of the investigator or physician performing the initial examination the
             patient should not participate in the study, e.g. due to probable noncompliance or
             inability to understand the study and give adequately informed consent;

          -  patient is institutionalized because of legal or regulatory order.
