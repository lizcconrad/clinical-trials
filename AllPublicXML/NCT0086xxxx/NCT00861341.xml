    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how pioglitazone and aspirin affect platelets in
      the blood of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Platelets are small cells in the blood that
      help with blood clotting. Pioglitazone is a drug that is used to lower blood sugar and fats
      by helping the body to use insulin correctly. Pioglitazone is presently used to treat
      diabetes but has not been approved for non-diabetics. This study will determine whether
      pioglitazone reduces the activity of platelets in people who are or are not also taking
      aspirin.

      Blood samples will be taken at time 0 to measure platelet aggregation. 30mg Pioglitazone will
      be ingested and another blood sample will be obtained 90-180 minutes later for platelet
      aggregation. After 6-9 days, subjects will ingest 81mg of aspirin. Another blood sample will
      be obtained 2-24 hours later for baseline determination of platelet aggregation and
      activation after taking aspirin. Subjects will then ingest 30mg pioglitazone and a final
      blood sample will be obtained 90-180 minutes later to measure platelet aggregation.

    <description>Platelet aggregation was performed by the turbidimetric method of Born with simultaneous measurement of ATP release using a Chrono-log Lumi-Aggregometer with AGGRO/LINK for Windows Software version 5.1.6. Platelet rich plasma was placed in a silicone-coated cuvette with constant stirring at 1200 rpm using a siliconized stir bar for measurement of aggregation and ATP release. Aggregation was initiated using arachidonic acid (0.5 mM). At each time point the results are shown for maximum percent aggregation with arachidonic acid for all subjects. Sample 1 was obtained at baseline (BL). Sample 2 was drawn on the same day after ingestion of a single dose of 30 mg of pioglitazone. Sample 3 was obtained 6-9 days later after the subject had ingested a single 81 mg dose of aspirin (ASA), and sample 4 was drawn later that day after ingestion of 30 mg of pioglitazone.</description>

Platelet rich plasma was placed in a silicone-coated cuvette with constant stirring at 1200 rpm using a siliconized stir bar for measurement of aggregation and ATP release. Aggregation was initiated using collagen (2ug.mL). At each time point the results are shown for maximum percent aggregation with collagen for all subjects. Sample 1 was obtained at baseline (BL).

        <title>Percent Platelet Aggregation Induced by Collagen</title>
        <description>Platelet aggregation was performed by the turbidimetric method of Born with simultaneous measurement of ATP release using a Chrono-log Lumi-Aggregometer with AGGRO/LINK for Windows Software version 5.1.6. Platelet rich plasma was placed in a silicone-coated cuvette with constant stirring at 1200 rpm using a siliconized stir bar for measurement of aggregation and ATP release. Aggregation was initiated using collagen (2ug.mL). At each time point the results are shown for maximum percent aggregation with collagen for all subjects. Sample 1 was obtained at baseline (BL). Sample 2 was drawn on the same day after ingestion of a single dose of 30 mg of pioglitazone. Sample 3 was obtained 6–9 days later after the subject had ingested a single 81 mg dose of aspirin (ASA), and sample 4 was drawn later that day after ingestion of 30 mg of pioglitazone.</description>
