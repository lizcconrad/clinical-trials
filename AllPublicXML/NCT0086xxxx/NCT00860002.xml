    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyomas (i.e., fibroids, myomas) are the most common gynecologic tumors in women
      of reproductive age (1). Clearly, the majority of such lesions are asymptomatic (2). Symptoms
      directly attributable to these benign tumors represent the most common reason for laparotomy
      in non-pregnant women in the United States (3,4), and also in Taiwan (5). Whereas in decades
      past, hysterectomy was seen almost as a panacea for uterine leiomyomas, more recently
      attention has been paid to the development of pharmaceutical agents and less-invasive
      procedures (6). Frequently, such procedures are designed to retain the uterus (6). Of these,
      myomectomy may be a choice among the uterine-sparing treatments for symptomatic uterine myoma
      (7,8).

      The surgical mode of access usually employed in myomectomy is traditional exploratory
      laparotomy or its modificationâ€”mini-laparotomy (MLT) (9) or ultra-mini laparotomy (UMLT)
      (10,11), though recently, laparoscopy (12-14) or a combination of laparoscopy and MLT (9),
      vaginal surgery (15), and hysteroscopic myomectomy (16-21) have represented valid
      alternatives. However, myomectomy alone provides varying degrees of symptom control and a
      high percentage of recurrence, not only for the tumors themselves, but also for the symptoms.
      For example, one study reported that symptom resolution varied from 84.0% to 100% depending
      on different items and 21 (19.4%) of 108 patients experienced a recurrence after an average
      interval of 16 months (range, 1.8-47.4 months) (22). Therefore, an alternative or additional
      therapy might be required to provide longer durable symptom control and minimize tumor
      recurrence. One of the strategies is laparoscopic uterine vessel occlusion (LUVO), also known
      as laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion (LUAO) (23,24).

      The rationale for using LUVO in the management of symptomatic myomas is found in the
      successful experience with uterine-artery embolization (UAE), which was introduced in 1995 as
      an alternative technique for treating fibroids (25). Since then it has become increasingly
      accepted as a minimally invasive, uterine-sparing procedure, and studies have reported the
      relief of excessive menstrual bleeding or pressure in 80-90% of patients (26-32). LUVO
      provided similar relief of symptoms (89.4% with symptomatic improvement and 21.2% with
      complete resolution of symptoms) in 2001 in a 7- to 12-month follow-up of 87 patients after
      LUVO (33).

      Since that time there has been rapid growth in the use of this treatment with various
      modifications, such as simultaneous accompaniment with myomectomy either through laparoscopy
      or ML, and there has been considerable research into its outcome (22,34-42). However, in our
      previous data, we found that a combination of LUVO and myomectomy provided definite
      effectiveness in symptom control for these women with symptomatic uterine myomas (98.1% to
      100% symptom resolution depending on various kinds of items), minimized tumor recurrence, and
      rendered the vast majority of re-interventions unnecessary (22). Myomectomy can be performed
      by the laparoscopic approach or by ML when patients are undergoing the LUVO procedure. Before
      2002, we often used ML to perform myomectomy (22). However, we have shortened the incision to
      less than 4 cm, creating ultramini-laparotomy (UMLT) to perform myomectomy (10,11,43).

      Since many conservative therapies might provide less or more therapeutic effects on the
      symptom control and disease status, the aim of this prospective study tries to evaluate the
      therapeutic outcomes of these symptomatic uterine myomas after different kinds of therapies
      in the coming 5 years at Taipei Veterans General Hospital.

        Women between 2009 and 2014 booked for treatment who had symptomatic uterine myomas, will
        be included in the present study. All the treatments for symptomatic uterine myomas,
        including medical treatment with different kinds of medication, and uterine-sparing surgery
        including myomectomy, which is performed through traditional exploratory laparotomy (LT),
        mini-laparotomy (MLT), ultramini-laparotomy (UMLT), laparoscopy (L), the vagina (V) or
        hysteroscopy (H), and LUVO and combination therapy, and the definite treatment of
        hysterectomy, through different routes, such as vagina, laparoscopic assistance, and
        convention exploratory laparotomy. All patients should have uterine fibroids with symptoms,
        comprising either menstrual problems such as menorrhagia and pain, or compression syndrome,
        including a bulge-like sensation and frequency. These women will be informed that they can
        choose to be treated with any one of the above-mentioned procedures, based on their
        willingness and preference.
