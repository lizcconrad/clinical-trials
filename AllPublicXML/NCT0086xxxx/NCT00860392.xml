  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two approaches to the measurement of fatty acid oxidation (ketone
      body flux and ketone body concentration) and determine which method demonstrates superior
      sensitivity and variability in the detection of moderate increases in ketogenesis rates.
