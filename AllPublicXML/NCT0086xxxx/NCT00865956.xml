  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disease management (DM) programs are being increasingly utilized by health plans to
      coordinate care, improve quality of care, and control costs in chronically ill individuals.
      DM programs for specific medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, congestive heart
      failure, and asthma, have demonstrated improvements in health outcomes and a number of
      studies have found economic benefits to these programs as well. There are fewer data
      evaluating multi-disease DM programs, and results have been mixed. Additionally, data on such
      programs specifically targeting substance-using populations are limited, although they are
      promising. Prior utilization and hospitalization data from Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns
      Hopkins Health Care, and Priority Partners Managed Care Organization (PPMCO) suggest that a
      substantial portion of high-utilizing, high-cost, medically complex patients have a substance
      use diagnosis.

      The investigators hypothesize that a comprehensive DM program for medically-complex substance
      users with a history of hospitalization, consisting of intensive nurse case management along
      with behavioral incentives to reinforce engagement in primary care, can decrease inpatient
      days and costs, as well as improve outcomes for substance use, depression, and physical and
      mental functioning. The investigators will compare the case management/behavioral incentives
      intervention to usual care among a group of medically-complex, substance-using, PPMCO
      enrollees. Usual care will include access to all existing Priority Partners care management
      programs, and usual The investigators believe that this research will make an important
      contribution to the development of models of chronic care that improve health and promote the
      best use of health care resources. Additionally, the investigators believe this project will
      promote the study and development of systems to improve the health of substance-using adults,
      an underserved and often marginalized group.
