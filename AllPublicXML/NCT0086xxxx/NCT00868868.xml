    <textblock>
      A randomized clinical trial evaluating the use of a pedometer and brief exercise coaching in
      prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy. The investigators want to
      demonstrate if there are less side effects of hormonal therapy and better quality of life in
      patients who made regular exercise.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate effectiveness of regular exercise and well-being all patients will complete
      questionnaires about sexual function (IIEF-15) and quality of life. We will also perform at
      each visits anthropometrics measurement of waist, leg and arm, weight and vital signs.
      Biochemical analysis and prostatic specific antigen will be done periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Histologically proven prostate cancer

          -  Treatment plan is to administer long term ADT (androgen deprivation therapy).

          -  Patient must currently be treated with ADT for at least 2 weeks before enrollment in
             trial, and for no more than 6 months. Patient treated with a maximum androgen blockade
             strategy, combining an anti-androgen agent with a LHRH analog agent are admissible to
             this protocol, but not patients treated only with an anti-androgen agent alone.

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Zoladex, Casodex (if applicable), or any component of these
             product, or to other similar agents

          -  Severe cardiac disease (New York Heart Association class III or greater)

          -  Severe lung disease

          -  Uncontrollable pain

          -  Unstable bone lesion

          -  Any co-morbidity restraining the patient's ability to walk alone or to modify his
             walking habits (eg Parkinson's disease, advanced multiple sclerosis, leg amputation,
             ...)

          -  Any concomitant condition that would make it undesirable, in the physician's opinion,
             for the subject to participate in the trial or would jeopardize compliance with the
             protocol.

          -  Any contraindication to undertake the 6-minutes walk test (unstable angina or
             myocardial infarction during the previous month, a resting heart rate of more than
             180, systolic blood pressure of more than 180, and a diastolic pressure of more than
             100). The patient must have his cardiovascular conditions stabilized and controlled
             before enrollment in the trial.

          -  Unwillingness or incapacity to consent to trial participation.
