  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) treatment to the chest is a standard way of trying to decrease symptoms
      like cough or shortness of breath. Before any RT can be delivered, it must be planned, either
      using conventional x-rays (&quot;fluoroscopy&quot;) or using computer tomography (&quot;CT&quot;) scanning. This
      study is being done because the investigators do not know which of these two common ways of
      RT planning is better for balancing both treating the cancer and decreasing side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard RT planning will be performed under conventional simulation, followed by
      CT-simulation (for study purposes only). Retrospectively, 3D treatment fields will be
      designed using the CT-simulation data, and compared to the actual treatment fields planned
      using x-rays. Coverage of the tumour volume will be assessed, together with doses, field
      sizes and beam positions, to determine relative undercoverage of tumour and overcoverage of
      normal tissue between the two planning methods, if any.
