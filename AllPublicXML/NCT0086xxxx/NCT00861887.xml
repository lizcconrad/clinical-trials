      BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile-associated colitis is an infection of the large bowel,
      usually associated with previous use of antibiotics. The disease course may be complicated by
      fulminant disease requiring removal of the colon or by multiple recurrences requiring
      re-hospitalization. The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection is rising,
      and it poses an increasing burden on the health system. For example, in one of our previous
      studies we found that 804 in-patients and 568 out-patients had a positive test for
      Clostridium difficile toxin at Beaumont Laboratories in 2003. The standard treatment is a 2
      week course of Vancomycin or Metronidazole. The clinical response to Metronidazole appears to
      be declining, and many practicing clinicians prefer Vancomycin as a first-line treatment. The
      recurrence rate after the treatment is similar for Vancomycin and Metronidazole and is
      usually in the range of 15-25%, although recent reports noted a recurrence rate up to 50%
      during outbreaks with a virulent strain. Recently, it has been suggested that a 2 week
      duration of treatment might not be adequate in clearing the infection.

      Our HYPOTHESIS is that a prolongation of Vancomycin treatment from 2 weeks to 4 weeks will
      lead to a decrease rate of recurrent Clostridium Difficile colitis.

      METHODOLOGY: Patients with a first episode of Clostridium difficile colitis will be offered a
      prolonged course of Vancomycin. It will be disclosed that this is not the standard of care,
      but that a prolonged course might decrease the relapse rate. After the initial treatment with
      Vancomycin 125 mg four times daily, the patients will be randomly assigned to receive either
      2 weeks of Vancomycin 125 mg four times daily or 2 weeks of placebo. The placebo solution
      will be prepared by our pharmacy to match the color and taste of the Vancomycin solution. The
      initial 2 weeks of therapy for both groups will be dispensed at patients' pharmacy. Patients
      will be called back at the end of 2 weeks and the blinded-phase drugs will be dispensed by
      our pharmacy staff.

      We will ask permission for a follow-up phone call at the end of treatment (1 month) and at a
      3-month interval. The patients will be followed longitudinally for a 3-month period. At the
      end of the follow-up interval, a review of any new medical records of the patient will be
      made and the patient will be contacted by phone for further details.
