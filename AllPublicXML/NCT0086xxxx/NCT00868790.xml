  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety and efficacy of MK-3577. The primary efficacy hypothesis was
      that, after 4 weeks of treatment, either the morning (AM) administration or the evening (PM)
      administration of MK-3577 provides superior reduction of 24-hour weighted mean glucose (WMG)
      levels compared to placebo (PLA). The primary safety hypothesis was that MK-3577 is well
      tolerated compared to placebo.

    <textblock>
      This was a 4-period/5-treatment crossover study. Each period was 4 weeks. The 5 treatments
      consisted of MK-3577 10 mg once daily (QD) in the AM, MK-3577 6 mg QD in the evening (PM),
      MK-3577 25 mg twice daily (BID), metformin 1000 mg BID, and placebo to MK-3577/placebo to
      metformin. Participants were to be randomized to one of 14 treatment sequence arms. A subset
      of participants in each group was to domicile (stay overnight) at selected clinical sites at
      Baseline, Week 4 (end of Period 1), and Week 8 (end of Period 2) to undergo 24-hr blood
      sample.

    <description>The primary efficacy outcome in this study was the assessment of 24-hour weighted mean glucose (WMG) levels for domiciled participants after 4-week treatment (Periods 1 and 2 only). At selected study sites, a subset of participants domiciled (stayed) overnight and underwent 24-hour blood sampling at the Week 0 Visit (Baseline), Week 4 Visit (end of Period 1), and Week 8 Visit (end of Period 2). Domiciled participants were not expected to follow a weight-maintaining diet while receiving standard meals from a dietician or licensed healthcare professional. WMG was calculated as the weighted average value of the glucose from the 24-hour blood sample (for Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8) and analyzed using a Longitudinal Data Analysis (LDA) model. Results were expressed as the change from baseline after 4-week treatment in 24-hour WMG.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, is also an AE.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (BL) After 4-Week Treatment in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 Visit (Baseline), Week 4 Visit, Week 8 Visit, Week 12 Visit, Week 16 Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting blood samples were obtained during study site visits at Baseline (Week 0 Visit) and Week 4 of each treatment period (Week 4 Visit, Week 8 Visit, Week 12 Visit, Week 16 Visit). Participants were counseled to fast (no food or drink except water and non-study medications, as directed) for at least 12 hours prior to all study visits. FPG was analyzed using an LDA model, and change from baseline (Week 0) after 4-week treatment in FPG was reported.</description>

    <measure>Change From BL After 4-Week Treatment in 2-hour Post-Meal Glucose (PMG) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 Visit (Baseline), Week 4 Visit, Week 8 visit</time_frame>
    <description>Two-hour PMG was analyzed in both non-domiciled and domiciled participants. Non-domiciled participants completed a 3-point meal tolerance test (MTT) at Week 0 (Baseline) and Week 4 Visits of Treatment Period 1. Participants completed 12-hr fasting prior to the Week 0 (Baseline) and Week-4 clinic visits. Fasting blood samples were obtained at the beginning of these clinic visits, after which participants consumed a standardized meal (1 nutrition bar and 1 can of nutrition drink), and then completed the MTT, in which plasma glucose was measured at 30 min and 120 min (2 hr) post-meal. The 2-hr PMG data also include data from domiciled participants, based on 2-hr post-morning meal glucose levels in the 24-hr blood glucose sample at the Week 4 and Week 8 Visits. The 2-hour PMG was analyzed using an LDA model, and change from baseline (Week 0) after 4-week treatment in 2-hour PMG was reported.</description>

    <description>Blood samples were obtained from all participants to measure LDL-C levels at Week 0 (Baseline) and Week 4 of each treatment period (Week 4 Visit, Week 8 Visit, Week 12 Visit, and Week 16 Visit). For each visit, LDL-C was measured over 2 days. The average of duplicate measurements (when available) was used in the analysis.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 118 participants were randomized to one of 14 treatment sequence arms on this cross-over study. Each participant received 4 out of 5 treatments over 4 treatment periods. Before randomization, participants who had prior antihyperglycemic agent (AHA) treatment had a 4-week AHA wash-off, and all participants had a 2-week placebo run-in.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline (BL) After 4-Week Treatment in Weighted Mean Glucose (WMG)</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy outcome in this study was the assessment of 24-hour weighted mean glucose (WMG) levels for domiciled participants after 4-week treatment (Periods 1 and 2 only). At selected study sites, a subset of participants domiciled (stayed) overnight and underwent 24-hour blood sampling at the Week 0 Visit (Baseline), Week 4 Visit (end of Period 1), and Week 8 Visit (end of Period 2). Domiciled participants were not expected to follow a weight-maintaining diet while receiving standard meals from a dietician or licensed healthcare professional. WMG was calculated as the weighted average value of the glucose from the 24-hour blood sample (for Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8) and analyzed using a Longitudinal Data Analysis (LDA) model. Results were expressed as the change from baseline after 4-week treatment in 24-hour WMG.</description>

        <description>Two-hour PMG was analyzed in both non-domiciled and domiciled participants. Non-domiciled participants completed a 3-point meal tolerance test (MTT) at Week 0 (Baseline) and Week 4 Visits of Treatment Period 1. Participants completed 12-hr fasting prior to the Week 0 (Baseline) and Week-4 clinic visits. Fasting blood samples were obtained at the beginning of these clinic visits, after which participants consumed a standardized meal (1 nutrition bar and 1 can of nutrition drink), and then completed the MTT, in which plasma glucose was measured at 30 min and 120 min (2 hr) post-meal. The 2-hr PMG data also include data from domiciled participants, based on 2-hr post-morning meal glucose levels in the 24-hr blood glucose sample at the Week 4 and Week 8 Visits. The 2-hour PMG was analyzed using an LDA model, and change from baseline (Week 0) after 4-week treatment in 2-hour PMG was reported.</description>

Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, is also an AE.</description>
