      Background:

        -  Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary for the development of cervical
           cancer. Worldwide, infection with HPV types 16 and 18 accounts for approximately 70
           percent of cervical cancer cases. Available data suggest that prophylactic vaccination
           against HPV types 16 and 18 is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing persistent
           cervical infections and resultant disease from these types for at least 5 years
           following vaccination. This study is extension of a 2004 study in which 7,466 women in
           Costa Rica were randomized into vaccinated and control groups. The study described here
           proposes to extend follow-up of women recruited into this trial and vaccinated with the
           HPV-16/18 vaccine at the start of CVT for up to an additional 6 years, for a total of up
           to 10 years of follow-up. We expect to provide the HPV-16/18 vaccine to women in the
           control arm of the trial after the initial 4 years of follow-up are completed, and
           propose to follow them for an additional period as well. We will also enroll and follow
           a new group of approximately 3000 women who will be followed with state-of-the-art
           screening and will serve as an unvaccinated control group (UCG) during the extended
           follow-up period.

      Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the 10-year global impact of HPV-16/18 vaccination of young adult women.

        -  To evaluate determinants of the immune response to HPV and the vaccine and markers of
           long-term protection.

        -  To evaluate the natural history of HPV and cervical disease in vaccinated and
           unvaccinated populations.

      Eligibility:

        -  Participants in the original 2004 study who lived in the Guanacaste province and few
           areas of Puntarenas close to Guanacaste will be eligible for the LTFU study. Women who
           received the HPV-16/18 vaccine at the start of CVT will be invited for up to 6 years of
           additional follow-up, and women who were originally in the control arm of CVT and were
           offered the HPV-16/18 vaccine at crossover will also be invited for additional
           follow-up. Newly recruited controls (3,000) will be matched to the participants of the
           original study. Women in the original study were born between July 1978 and November
           1987, lived in Guanacaste or nearby Puntarenas province, and had no history of cervical
           cancer or hysterectomy.

      Design:

        -  At enrollment, newly recruited controls will receive extensive screening and treatment
           for cervical neoplasia.

        -  All women (vaccinated and controls) will be followed at 2-year intervals for up to 6
           years. Questionnaire data will be collected. Pelvic examinations will be performed at
           each visit. Cervical secretions and cells will be collected. Women with evidence of
           cervical abnormalities will have accelerated screening and will be referred to
           colposcopy for evaluation and treatment if needed.

        -  A subset of women will have extra clinic visits and extra blood and saliva samples
           collected to allow study of the immune response to the vaccine and to the disease
           itself.

      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is necessary for the development of cervical cancer.
      Worldwide, infection with HPV types 16 and 18 account for approximately 70% of cervical
      cancer cases. Currently available data suggest that prophylactic vaccination against HPV
      types-16 and 18 is nearly 100% effective in preventing persistent cervical infections and
      resultant disease from these types for at least five years following vaccination. Intramural
      NCI and a group of Costa Rican investigators have had long-time involvement in studies to
      elucidate the natural history of HPV and cervical cancer, and in the development of
      prophylactic HPV vaccines. In 2004, we initiated a community-based randomized clinical trial
      in Costa Rica to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a bivalent virus-like particle HPV-16/18
      vaccine. The study successfully randomized 7,466 women; active follow-up of these women is
      underway and is planned for 4 years. Herein, we propose to extend follow-up of women
      recruited into this trial and vaccinated with the HPV- 16/18 vaccine at the start of CVT for
      up to an additional 6 years, for a total of up to 10 years of follow-up. We expect to provide
      the HPV-16/18 vaccine to women in the control arm of the trial after the initial 4 years of
      follow-up are completed, and propose to follow them for an additional 2 years, to monitor
      vaccine safety and to maximize detection of persistent infections and lesions resultant from
      HPV exposure that occurred before cross-over to the HPV vaccination (a subset of these women
      will be followed for the entire 10 years). We will also enroll and follow a new group of
      approximately 3000 women who will be followed with state-of-the-art screening and will serve
      as an unvaccinated control group (UCG) during the extended follow-up period. Women will be
      screened at two year intervals. Women with evidence of cervical abnormalities will have
      accelerated screening and will be referred to colposcopy for evaluation and treatment if
      needed. Questionnaires and biological specimens collected during this follow-up period will
      allow for many unique scientific and women's health questions to be addressed.

      There are three overarching objectives for this effort. They are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the 10-year global impact of HPV-16/18 vaccination of young adult women;

        2. To evaluate determinants of the immune response to HPV and the vaccine, and markers of
           long-term protection; and,

        3. To evaluate the natural history of HPV and cervical disease in vaccinated and
           unvaccinated populations.

      This research will provide invaluable data that will allow for the continued investigation
      into the risks and benefits of the prophylactic HPV vaccine.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Gender: Female

          -  Age: Women born in or between July 1978 and November 1987

          -  Residence: Residents of Guancaste Province and a few areas of Puntarenas closest to
             Guanacaste at some point during 2005

          -  Language: Able to speak/understand Spanish

          -  Mental Competence: Apparently mentally competent

          -  Consent: Written informed consent obtained prior to enrollment

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The following criteria will be checked at the time of enrollment for potential participants
        of the unvaccinated control group. If any apply, the participant will not be included in
        the study.

          -  History of cervical cancer,

          -  History of hysterectomy,

          -  Any important medical condition or other criteria that the investigator considers that
             precludes enrollment,

          -  Vaccination with Gardasil or Cervarix will be an exclusionary criterion, but few women
             are expected to have received these vaccines at the time of enrollment. Use of these
             vaccines after enrollment is not a criteria for study interruption but we plan to
             collect information on vaccination history so that the few women who report having
             been vaccinated with one of the HPV vaccines after enrollment can be evaluated
             separately at analysis.
