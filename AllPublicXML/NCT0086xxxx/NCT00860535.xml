    <measure>Growth Factor Signature (GFS) Variability at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to Day 1 Predose</time_frame>
    <description>The GFS was measured by microarray analysis using the entire 101 gene signature. The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same patient. The signature has 101 genes in two oppositely regulated arms, which are pre-specified. The expression of genes in the UP arm goes up with increasing pathway activity, and the expression of genes in the DOWN arm goes down with increasing pathway activity.
The GFS variability was represented by the GFS change between two baseline samples (Mean GFS Fold Ratio [Screening to Day 1 Predose]).</description>

    <measure>Growth Factor Signature (GFS) Change From Baseline Measured by Time Weighted Average (TWA) for Days 1 to 22</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 22 Days After Initiation of Therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The GFS was measured by microarray analysis using the entire 101 gene signature.
The TWA is the area under the curve (AUC) divided by the time interval (for this study it was the AUC of gene-expression divided by Days 1 to 22).
Participants with blast phase Ph+ CML or Ph+ ALL were measured for change in the GFS post-treatment when treated with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib, using Microarray. Change was represented as the GFS Fold Ratio of TWA for Days 1 to 22 to Baseline.</description>

    <description>Patients on standard of care treatment will have blood drawn to evaluate biomarker changes in response to treatment with BCR-ABL inhibitors over a ~3.5 month period.
Part I will enroll patients who are beginning treatment with imatinib (recommended dose 400 mg every day [qd]), dasatinib (recommended dose 70 mg twice a day [bid]), or nilotinib (recommended dose 400 mg bid).
Part II will enroll patients who are changing from imatinib therapy to either dasatinib or nilotinib. A decision to initiate Part II will be made based on analysis of the results of Part I.</description>
