  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) examination of the
      pancreaticobiliary system is done indirectly by radiologic means. Contrast is injected into
      the bile and/or pancreatic duct and outline of the duct is then viewed by fluoroscopic
      imaging. Frequently this is followed by diagnostic maneuvers (tissue acquisition) or
      therapeutic interventions (stone removal, stent insertion). Direct visualization of the bile
      and pancreatic ducts (cholangioscopy/pancreatoscopy) was developed 15 years ago and was shown
      to be superior to the indirect radiological view. The procedure did not become widely used
      secondary to high procedure related costs and equipment prone to failure. Recently a much
      improved (more affordable and more durable) cholangioscope was developed and approved by the
      FDA. The goal of this study is to prospectively record our experience with cholangioscopy and
      pancreatoscopy performed as medically indicated as part of standard medical care.

    <description>Defined based on the indication for SpyGlass. For cases involving biliary or pancreatic stones the procedure was considered successful when complete stone clearance was accomplished. For cases involving established or suspected nonstone-related lesions of the pancreatobiliary system, success was defined when all of the following criteria were met: successful advancement of the SpyScope to the desired target, adequate visualization of the area of interest and successful applications of all diagnostic and/or therapeutic maneuvers that were deemed necessary based on the endoscopic findings.</description>
