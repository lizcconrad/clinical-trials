  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of cancer is often improved if two or more drugs are used in combination. In animal
      studies, the use of the combination of ON 01910.Na (a new, unapproved drug) and irinotecan or
      oxaliplatin (two approved and extensively used anti-cancer drugs) gave better results against
      tumor cells than the use of any of the single drugs alone. In addition, the use of the
      combinations did not result in an increase of side effects. This clinical trial will
      determine what is the highest dose of ON 01910.Na that can be given safely in combination
      with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin in human patients.

      This is an open-label, 2-arm, dose-escalation combination-therapy study in which patients
      with advanced malignancies will be assigned by the Investigator to dosing with either
      irinotecan plus ON 01910.Na (Group A), or oxaliplatin plus ON 01910.Na (Group B). The
      Investigator will make this assignment using clinical judgment, taking into consideration the
      patient's tumor type, UGT1A1 genotype when applicable (i.e., patients considered for
      treatment in Group A will be tested for UGT1A1 genotype, if not already known, and patients
      homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele will be excluded from Group A), prior treatment, and
      current clinical condition. Patients will be enrolled in 1 of 8 Cohorts (4 sequential Cohorts
      in Group A and 4 in Group B) of 3 patients each. Up to 6 additional patients will be tested
      at the MTD. Groups A and B will enroll and proceed simultaneously.

    <description>ON 01910.Na will be administered by IV infusion over 24 hours once per week in a 6-week cycle (6 doses per cycle). The dose of ON 01910.Na will start at 250 mg/m2 and will proceed to higher dose levels after safety evaluation.
The suggested starting dose of Irinotecan is 180 mg/m2 administered by intravenous (IV) infusion over 90 minutes every 2 weeks of a 6-week cycle (3 doses per cycle). Reductions in the starting doses according to recommendations of current approved prescribing information may be considered after review of patients' medical histories and potential tolerances to treatment with the chemotherapy agent.</description>
