  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted in Japanese newly diagnosed locally advanced SCCHN patients in order
      to assess tolerability and feasibility of Cetuximab plus concomitant boost radiotherapy (RT)
      regimen (the study treatment) and its safety profile (i.e. AEs: adverse events). In addition,
      efficacy (i.e. anti-tumor effect) of the study treatment is also evaluated.

    <description>Severity was assessed according to the toxicity criteria defined in the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3.0, where grade 1 denoted mild, grade 2 moderate, grade 3 severe, and grade 4 lifethreatening or disabling. In the case of adverse events not contained within the NCI-CTCAE, the investigator was responsible for assessing the severity of the AE (grades 1 to 4) based on the jeopardy to the subject's health and well-being, and the ability of the subject to function during the event.</description>

    <description>Patients receive Cetuximab at an initial dose of 400 mg/m^2 of Cetuximab to be infused 6 or 7 days before starting radiotherapy, followed by subsequent weekly infusions at a dose of 250 mg/m^2 of Cetuximab and RT (72.0 Gy total in 42 fractions) for the next 6 weeks of the treatment course. Subjects will receive Cetuximab until radiographically documented progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity occurs or consent is withdrawn. If RT is delayed, administration of Cetuximab every 7 days is continued. If RT is discontinued for any reason, treatment with Cetuximab monotherapy every 7 days is continued.</description>
