  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the response rate in platinum-resistant, KRAS
      wild-type, ovarian cancer patients who are treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      (Caelyx®) in combination with biological treatment panitumumab (Vectibix®).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer have few therapeutic options and
      the response rates are only 10-20% using non-cross-resistant chemotherapeutic agents.

      New biologic agents in combination with chemotherapy or other treatment modalities may result
      in improvement in survival.

      Recent results in colorectal cancer have clearly indicated that KRAS mutant tumors do not
      respond to treatment with EGFR inhibitors.

      Panitumumab (ABX-EGF) is the first fully human monoclonal antibody specific to the EGF
      receptor. To date, panitumumab has been evaluated in combination with chemotherapy in
      patients with CRC, NSCLC, and SCCHN.

      No previous studies have evaluated the effect of panitumumab in epithelial ovarian cancer
      based on KRAS mutation status.

               -  A: First line treatment with a platinum containing regimen with either
                  progression or no response during 1.line chemotherapy, or relapse within 6 months
                  after end of 1. line chemotherapy, OR

               -  B: Patients receiving second line with a platinum containing regimen with either
                  progression or no response during second line chemotherapy, or relapse within 6
                  months after end of second line chemotherapy
