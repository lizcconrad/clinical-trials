  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clofarabine is known to have a stronger anti-tumor effect than Fludarabine and has shown its
      efficacy in treating aggressive acute leukemias. In addition, evidence is that it is
      well-tolerated with manageable side effects especially in elderly patients. Thus, replacing
      Fludarabine with Clofarabine in a reduced intensity transplant regimen may provide a regimen
      with increased anti-tumor activity without adding significant risks of toxicity.The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of clofarabine in combination with
      IV busulfan and ATG as the backbone of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation for the treatment of patients with high-risk MDS/AML or
      ALL not eligible to conventional or standard myeloablative allo-SCT.

    <description>A conservative approach has been used for the determination of the dose due to the high risk studied population, e.g., decrease to 30 mg m²/day for a 4-day course of clofarabine. Clofarabine will be started at Day -8 to allow improvement of liver function tests, if any, by time of allo-HSCT. Clofarabine (C) 30 mg/m²/day for 4 days (day -8 to day-5). Busilvex (B): 3.2 mg/kg/day for 2 days (day -4 and day-3)Thymoglobuline (T): 2.5 mg/Kg/day for 2 days (day -2 and day-1). Graft (G) at day 0 GVHD prophylaxis: Cyclosporine 3 mg/kg/day starting day-1. Genzyme provided supplies of clofarabine for all patients included in the study.</description>
