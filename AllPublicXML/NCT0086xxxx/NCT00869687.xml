    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study involves research to evaluate new collagen (the elastic
      fibers that provide skin with its strength and resilience) formation in the skin following
      injections of Sculptra (Poly-L-Lactic Acid or PLLA). The secondary objectives of the study
      are to better understand the human skin responses to Sculptra and to assess the safety of
      Sculptra injections.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergies or an allergic reaction to local numbing medications (e.g.,
             lidocaine, etc.), latex, or silicone.

          -  History of forming large scars following an accident or surgery.

          -  History of any bleeding problems.

          -  Redness, swelling, or signs of infection behind the right or left ear between the area
             of the earlobe and hairline.

          -  Pimples, rashes, scarring or any other skin changes behind the right or left ear
             between the area of the earlobe and hairline.

          -  History of any medical problems (for example, heart attack, stroke, diabetes/high
             blood sugar, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe asthma, rheumatoid
             arthritis, emphysema, breathing problems). Subjects with high blood pressure or high
             cholesterol may qualify for the study if there have been no changes in their
             medications for three (3) months.
