  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study of JVRS-100. The study will proceed in 2
      stages to minimize the number of patients treated at doses substantially below the
      recommended phase 2 dose. In stage 1, an accelerated titration schema will be followed with
      one patient at each dose level. Stage 2 will commence after a dose limiting toxicity is
      observed in stage 1 or after the maximum dose for stage 1 is reached. Stage 2 will follow a
      modified Fibonacci schema with 3-6 subjects at each dose level until a recommended phase 2
      dose is determined. The cohort will then be expanded to a maximum of 12 patients to more
      fully evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study of JVRS-100. The study will proceed in 2
      stages to minimize the number of patients treated at doses substantially below the
      recommended phase 2 dose. In stage 1, cohorts of three will be treated at each dose level
      however doses will be doubled from level to level. Stage 2 will commence after a dose
      limiting toxicity is observed in stage 1 or after the maximum dose for stage 1 is reached.
      Stage 2 will follow a modified Fibonacci schema with 3-6 subjects at each dose level until a
      recommended phase 2 dose is determined. The cohort will then be expanded to a maximum of 12
      patients to more fully evaluate the recommended phase 2 dose. The Principal Investigator will
      assign dose level to be administered to all patients.

    <description>3 patients will be enrolled at a given dose level. If one of these patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity, an additional 3 patients will be enrolled at the given dose level. If the 1st 2 subjects enrolled and treated at a given dose experience dose limiting toxicities, no additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose. Dose escalation may proceed if &lt; 2/6 patients at a given dose level experience a LDT. If ≥ 2/6 patients experience a DLT at a given dose level, the next lower dose level will be considered the RP2D. If a patient does not complete the 3 infusions of JVRS-100 during Cycle 1 for reasons other than toxicity, another patient will be accrued at the same dose level. Once the RP2D is established, the cohort will be expanded to a total of 12 patients.</description>
