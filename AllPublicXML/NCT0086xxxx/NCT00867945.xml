      The investigators hypothesize that pregnancy-induced analgesia might be the result of
      enhanced descending noxious inhibitory activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy-induced analgesia has been described in several studies (Gintzler 1980; Sander and
      Gintzler 1987; Jarvis et al. 1997). Obvious mechanisms underlying pregnancy-induced analgesia
      involve hormonal changes during gestation (Fillingim and Ness 2000). Existing studies during
      pregnancy and peripartum have focused on standard characteristics of nociception, using
      non-dynamic quantitative sensory testing such as pain threshold/tolerance or suprathreshold
      stimuli (Goolkasian and Rimer 1984; Sengupta and Nielsen 1984; Cogan and Spinnato 1986;
      Dunbar et al. 1988; Whipple et al. 1990; Shapira et al. 1995; Saisto et al. 2001; Bajaj et
      al. 2002; Carvalho et al. 2006; Ohel et al. 2007), with its relative limitations of studying
      only the afferent nociceptive input produced in the peripheral nervous system.

      The two systems that are of prime importance in pain modulation within the CNS are the
      inhibitory system (descending noxious inhibitory control (DNIC)) and the excitatory system,
      with the balance of pain being more heavily influenced by the former (Godfrey and Mackey
      2008).

      The primary aim of this study is to use psychophysical tests to study both the inhibitory and
      excitatory pain pathways using the DNIC paradigm and temporal summation longitudinally during
      pregnancy, compared to an age-matched control group of non-pregnant women.

      We added the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) sub-population to the PIA study to study them as a
      control group (in addition to studying non-pregnant controls and pregnant women). We are
      studying this sub population prior to their egg retrieval procedure and a short phone survey
      with participants post egg-retrieval. If the subject becomes pregnant, we would recruit them
      to enroll in the PIA pregnant population cohort.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant Cohort: Inclusion criteria for participation are (1) women aged between 18
             and 45 yr, (2) nulliparous or ASA physical status class I or II women, (3) singleton
             pregnancy, (4) no more than 14 completed weeks gestational age at the time of
             enrollment into the study, (5) uncomplicated pregnancy, and (6) delivery planned to be
             conducted at UW/Stanford University.

          -  Non-pregnant Control Cohort: Inclusion criteria for participation are (1) women aged
             between 18 and 45 yr, (2) nulliparous or ASA physical status class I or II women, (3)
             and not planning on taking oral-contraceptives or carrying a hormonal-coated IUD.

        Non-inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant Cohort: Non-inclusion criteria are (1) multiparous women, (2) non-English
             speaking women (subjects have to be able to understand the DNIC procedure and answer
             questionnaires), (3) women unable to understand the concept of VNPS at the time of
             informed consent (involving mental health issues), (4) a history of anxiety or
             depression, or chronic consumption of opiates, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants;
             and (5) intake of opioids, acetaminophen, or NSAIDs 48h prior to the psychophysical
             test.

          -  Non-pregnant Control Cohort: Non-inclusion criteria are the same as the Pregnant
             Cohort as well as (6) irregular menstrual cycles (defined as &lt; 21 days or &gt; 35 days).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant Cohort: Exclusion criteria is a pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia or
             preterm delivery (&lt; 37 weeks gestation).

          -  Non-pregnant Control Cohort: Exclusion criteria is development of irregular cycles.
