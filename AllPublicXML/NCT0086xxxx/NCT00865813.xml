    <description>Instillation of anesthetic eye drops.
Asepsis
Placement of surgical cloths and drapes
Infiltration of the involved region with anesthetic solution plus adrenalin in1:200.00 dilution.
Trephination of the most typical area of the lesion with a punch (2mm in diameter) of stainless steel by applying gentle pressure and twisting the trephine until its introduction into the suspicious lesions
Removal of the excised tissue with the aid of an insulin needle or conjuntival forceps, the base then bein cut with an number 11 surgical blade</description>
