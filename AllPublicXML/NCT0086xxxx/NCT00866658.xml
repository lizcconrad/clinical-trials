  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to placebo, as an add-on treatment to basal insulin with or without sulfonylurea,
      over a period of 24 weeks of treatment.

      The primary objective is to assess the effects of lixisenatide, when added to basal insulin,
      on glycemic control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction at Week 24.

      The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide on body weight, 2-hour
      postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) after standardized meal challenge test, percentage of
      patients reaching HbA1c less than 7 percent (%), percentage of patients reaching HbA1c less
      than or equal to 6.5%, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), change in 7-point self-monitored plasma
      glucose (SMPG) profiles, change in daily basal insulin and total insulin doses; to evaluate
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and anti-lixisenatide antibody development.

    <description>Symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose less than 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L) or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose measurement was available. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose less than 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 57 centers in 4 countries between March 10, 2009 and June 23, 2010.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 437 patients were screened of which 126 (28.8%) were screen failures; main reason for screen failure was glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values being out of the defined protocol range (greater than or equal to 7% and less than or equal to 10%). A total of 311 patients were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was symptomatic hypoglycemia event in which the patient required the assistance of another person and was associated with either a plasma glucose less than 36 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration, if no plasma glucose measurement was available.</description>
