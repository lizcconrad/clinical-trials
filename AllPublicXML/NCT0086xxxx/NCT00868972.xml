    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is associated with progressive loss of renal
      function, refractory hypertension and flushing edema, responsible for mortality and
      morbidity, especially in the elderly. Current treatment includes restoration of the renal
      arterial lumen by endovascular stent placement and/or intensive medical therapy. There is no
      unanimous consent on which patients could benefice of the endovascular procedure due to the
      high rate of renal adverse events especially linked to atheroembolic disease. Recently, renal
      revascularization using a device which consents distal embolic protection of the kidney
      demonstrated to be a &quot;safe&quot; auxiliary procedure in a few non randomized studies.
      Interestingly atheromatous debris was detected in 60 to 80% of these devices analyzed after
      the procedure suggesting that these devices could prevent atheroembolism in a substantial
      proportion of patients. On the other hand, only a randomized controlled study can prove that
      renal stent with distal embolic protection is superior to renal stent alone in preserving
      kidney function.

      Therefore, the present study aims to compare the effects of renal artery stent placement with
      or without distal embolic protection on renal function in ARAS patients.

      Method:

      Patients with an ARAS of ≥70% and hypertension not responsive to at least 2 antihypertensive
      medications and/or renal failure (estimated GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are randomly assigned to
      stent placement alone or stent placement with distal embolic protection (FILTER WIRE EX;
      Cordis Endovascular, USA).

      Other medications consist of statins, anti-hypertensive drugs and antiplatelet therapy.
      Patients are followed for 3 months. The primary outcome of this study is a statistical
      significant difference in kidney function measured as Cr clearance and cystatin C level in
      the 2 groups at three months. The trial will include 150 patients.

      This is a randomized trial of patients with an ostial ARAS and refractory hypertension and or
      renal failure. Patients will be randomized to:

      (i) renal artery stent placement with distal embolic protection (ii) renal artery stent
      placement without distal embolic protection To both groups an optimal medical treatment
      consisting of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapy will be added.

      Patients with an ostial ARAS associated with an estimated GFR of &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2 according
      to the MDRD formula and/or refractory hypertension are enrolled in this trial. Ostial ARAS is
      defined as a luminal reduction of ≥70% of the renal artery within 1 cm of the aortic wall, in
      the presence of atherosclerotic changes of the aorta. Stenosis evaluation can be performed on
      intra-arterial angiography.

      Medical therapy: Irrespective of baseline serum cholesterol values, the patients will be
      treated with lipid-lowering therapy: 10 mg of rosuvastatin. Any lipid-lowering medication
      currently used is discontinued and replaced by rosuvastatin. Hypertension is treated with the
      following drugs: ACE-inhibitors together, loop diuretic, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.
      The target BP is &lt;140/90 mmHg. Patients will receive anti-platelet therapy, aspirin 75-100
      mg/od plus ticlopidine 250 mg bid for one month. Considering that smoking is a major renal
      risk factor, smokers will be advised to stop.

      Medical therapy is identical in the two treatment arms. In both groups patients will start
      with aspirin 100 mg/od and ticlopidine 250 mg bid at least five days before admission. The
      stent (Palmaz-Corinthian IQ/Palmaz Genesis, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical, NV/SA) will be placed
      during an in-patient admission according to a standardized protocol. To Patients randomized
      to the embolic protection the device (FILTER WIRE EX; Cordis Endovascular, USA) will be
      placed distal to the arterial stenosis before stent placement.

      Randomization will be done using random numbers tables The only people aware of the assigned
      procedure will be the radiologists' team. Researchers and technicians who will follow the
      patients and analyze the plasma and urinary samples will be blinded to the assigned
      treatment.

      Clinical follow-up is scheduled after 1 and 3 months. Analysis of results: The difference in
      the mean change of cystatin C respect to baseline between both treatment arms will be
      assessed including 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The effects on renal function of the
      two treatment strategies will be evaluated with multivariate linear regression analysis,
      considering also the eventual role of age, smoking, diabetes, lipids level, proteinuria,
      bilateral or unilateral renal artery stenosis, BP and renal function at baseline
