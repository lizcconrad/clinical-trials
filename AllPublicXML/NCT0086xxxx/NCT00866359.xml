    <measure>Pain of Oral Ulcers as Measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Day 85</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 85</time_frame>
    <description>A 100-mm VAS pain scale for oral ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a single sheet of bond paper. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was measured by ruler and recorded. When responding to a VAS item, participants specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

    <description>Comparison of the percentage of participants who were oral ulcer-free (complete response: free from active oral ulcers), or whose oral ulcers were reduced by ≥ 50%, (partial response) between the apremilast-treated and the placebo-treated groups.

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 3 study sites in Turkey and 3 sites in the United States. The first participant enrolled was enrolled on October 23, 2009 and the last participant enrolled was enrolled on May 08, 2012.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive study drug (apremilast or placebo). Since the incidence and severity of Behçet’s Disease differ between males and females, randomization was stratified by gender.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Pain of Oral Ulcers as Measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at Day 85</title>
        <description>A 100-mm VAS pain scale for oral ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a single sheet of bond paper. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was measured by ruler and recorded. When responding to a VAS item, participants specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

        <population>The ITT population included all randomized participants with at least one oral ulcer evaluation (including the baseline evaluation). A LOCF approach was applied for participants terminated early from the study.

          <description>Area under curve (AUC) from Day 1 to Day 85 (AUC^85) for the number of oral plus genital ulcers per day was determined using the trapezoidal rule and divided by the days between the date of the last observation and baseline.

        <description>A 100-mm VAS pain scale for oral ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a single sheet of bond paper. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was measured by ruler and recorded. When responding to a VAS item, participants specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

          <description>The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index consists of three component scores, a participant's perception of disease activity, a clinician's overall perception of disease activity and a Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index Score. The score ranges from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates higher level of disease activity (worsening) and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>A 100-mm VAS pain scale for oral ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a single sheet of bond paper. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was measured by ruler and recorded. When responding to a VAS item, participants specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

          <description>A 100-mm VAS pain scale for genital ulcers was completed by the participant at timepoints specified in the protocol. Each 100-mm VAS was presented to the participant on a single sheet of bond paper. The participant was asked to draw a single line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represented the severity of their pain during the previous week, with 0 mm (the left-hand end of the scale) representing no pain and 100 mm (the right-hand end of the scale) representing the worst pain imaginable. The distance of the perpendicular line from the left-hand end of the scale was measured by ruler and recorded. When responding to a VAS item, participants specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

        <description>The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index consists of three component scores, a participant's perception of disease activity, a clinician's overall perception of disease activity and a Behçet's Disease Current Activity Index Score. The score ranges from 0 to 12. A higher score indicates higher level of disease activity (worsening) and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first treatment of any study drug, and within 28 days after the last dose of the last study drug.

Severity grades according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE) on a 1-5 scale: Grade 1= Mild AE, Grade 2= Moderate AE, Grade 3= Severe AE, Grade 4= Life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5=Death related to AE.</description>
