      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the hyperbaric oxygen treatment reduces
      pain and improve the life quality in trigeminal neuralgia patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trigeminal neuralgia(TN) is a recurrent severe shooting neuropathic pain. Treatment of this
      pain continues to be a challenge in clinical pain management. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has
      been used of neuropathic diseases, which can improve blood partial pressure of oxygen, reduce
      edema, relieve neural oppression and attenuate inflammatory response. The hypothesis of this
      protocol is that hyperbaric oxygen treatment could relieve neuropathic pain and improve the
      quality of life in TN patients. Visual analogue scale (VAS) and the mcgill pain questionnaire
      (MGPQ) will be assessed before the initiation of the study, after hyperbaric oxygen (HBO)
      treatment and at monthly intervals for the subsequent 3 months. Titration of dosage and pain
      frequency will be recorded throughout the study. Clinical global impression (CGI) by the
      individual patient will be evaluated at monthly intervals after HBO treatment.

Hyperbaric oxygen treatment: While in the hyperbaric chamber the subjects breathe 100% oxygen saturation with mask at 2.0bars.
Mock hyperbaric chamber treatment: The subjects breathe air freely in the imitation environment chamber at 1.0bars.</description>
