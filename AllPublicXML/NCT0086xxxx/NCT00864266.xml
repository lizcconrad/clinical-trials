  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to identify a predictive molecular signature for response to
      chemotherapy, according to WHO criteria, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer by
      studying the transcriptome (miRNAs and mRNAs) and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs)
      by using high throughput techniques.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

          -  Obtention of a biopsy of the tumour according to the procedure defined in the protocol

          -  NSCLC of any stage to be treated by standard conventional first-line chemotherapy, as
             defined in the ELCWP guidelines (www.elcwp.org)

          -  Presence of at least one assessable lesion

          -  Availability for participating in the detailed follow-up of the protocol

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Age above 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who was previously treated with chemotherapy for NSCLC or who has any
             contra-indication precluding the administration of conventional chemotherapy for NSCLC

          -  NSCLC treated by exclusive surgery or radiotherapy

          -  A history of prior malignant tumour, except non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix or of the bladder or cured malignant tumour (more than 5-year
             disease free interval)
