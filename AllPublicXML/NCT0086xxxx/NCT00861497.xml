  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide access to bifeprunox for patients, who have completed
      previous studies with bifeprunox, and require continued treatment with bifeprunox, other
      treatment not being adequate. A further purpose is to investigate the safety and side-effects
      of bifeprunox during long-term treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-controlled, open-label, flexible-dose, international multi-centre extension
      study. The patient population consists of male and female patients with schizophrenia, who
      have completed open-label bifeprunox studies 10206 or 10265, and require continued treatment
      with bifeprunox, other treatments not being feasible as judged by the investigator.
