      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MP-5971 in facilitating stone
      passage after Shock Wave Lithotripsy treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shock Wave Lithotripsy (SWL) is widely utilized as a first line therapy in patients with
      renal calculi. SWL is associated with limited morbidity, however, complications relating to
      stone fragment passage after treatment can occur, the most serious being ureter obstruction.
      In addition, the growth and agglomeration of residual fragments after SWL treatment, in
      approximately 40% of patients, will lead to another stone episode within 12 months. Adjunct
      therapy with MPC-5971 should reduce the risk of complications of residual stone fragments by
      facilitating passage, preventing blockage and inhibiting growth and enlargement of residual
      fragments. This is based on MPC-5971's ability to increase urinary inhibitors against growth
      and agglomeration of stone fragments and by reducing urinary saturation of calcium oxalate
      and uric acid. The objective is to see a decrease in fragment complications and a significant
      increase in the stone free rate at 3 months following SWL treatment in combination with
      MPC-5971.
