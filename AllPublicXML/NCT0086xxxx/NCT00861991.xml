      Background: Empathy is critical to clinician-patient communication and patient outcomes.
      Perspective-taking, an intervention demonstrated in other contexts to induce empathy, has
      never been studied in a medical context. As a first step in evaluating its potential clinical
      value, the studies described below assess perspective taking in a series of clinical skills
      examinations. These examinations are simulated clinical encounters: students encounter and
      are evaluated by standardized patients (SPs)--actors trained to take on patient roles. Though
      not real clinical encounters, clinical skills examinations have been demonstrated to test
      clinical competency well enough to be incorporated into the licensure examination of the
      National Board of Medical Examiners.

      Objective: To assess if perspective-taking improves the satisfaction of standardized patients
      in three clinical skills examinations.

      Hypothesis: Students receiving a perspective taking intervention will receive better
      standardized patient satisfaction scores than control students.

      Design and Setting: Three randomized, controlled studies. Studies 1 and 3: Junior medical
      students(N = 503), 6-station clinical skills examination. Study 2: physician assistant
      students (N = 105), 3-station clinical skills examination.

      Intervention: The intervention students received a perspective-taking instruction prior to
      their examination asking them to put themselves in their &quot;patients&quot; shoes and to imagine what
      they were thinking and feeling. The control students received standard pre-examination
      instructions. Simulated patients were blind to study condition. Main Outcome Measure:
      Simulated patient satisfaction scores.
