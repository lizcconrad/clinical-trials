      To determine if propranolol, amitriptyline, or topiramate decreases headache frequency in
      patients with chronic post-traumatic headaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 240 patients meeting International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)
      diagnostic criteria for chronic post-traumatic headaches will be enrolled. Subjects will be
      recruited from the Neurology Clinic at Madigan Army Medical Center. Study participants will
      be U.S. Army soldiers who sustained a mild traumatic head injury while deployed to a combat
      theater resulting in chronic post-traumatic headaches. Subjects will be randomized to
      placebo, propranolol (target dose 80 mg a day), amitriptyline (target dose 50 mg a day), or
      topiramate (target dose 100 mg a day) for 3 months.

      The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of headache days per month on the third
      month of treatment. Secondary outcome measures will include the proportion of subjects with
      at least a 25% reduction in headache frequency, headache severity (0-10 scale), headache
      duration (hours), headache-related disability (measured by the Headache Impact Test and
      Migraine Disability Assessment Scale), PTSD symptom checklist score, and medication side
      effects and tolerability.
