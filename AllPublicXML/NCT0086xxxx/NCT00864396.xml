      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with twice-daily Lansoprazole
      30mg (Prevacid 30mg) and behavioral modifications for reflux is superior to treatment with
      behavioral modifications for reflux alone in the treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).

      Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is a disorder caused by acid-induced damage to the larynx and
      pharynx (voice box and throat). The standard care for persons with this disorder is treatment
      with highly potent anti-acid medications (proton pump inhibitors - Prevacid is one of these.
      NExium, Aciphex and Prilosec are others). These medications are currently approved by the FDA
      for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Although the use of these
      medications in persons with LPR is widely accepted and sanctioned, this research is being
      done because these medications are not currently approved by the FDA for this use. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with twice-daily Lansoprazole 30mg
      (Prevacid 30mg) and behavioral modifications for reflux is superior to treatment with
      behavioral modifications for reflux alone in the treatment of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR).
