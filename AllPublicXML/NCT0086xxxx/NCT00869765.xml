  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among antidepressant treatments, Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stands as the most effective
      in treating acute depression. However, patient concerns with the cognitive side effects of
      ECT have encouraged the development of new and more focal forms of brain stimulation such as
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The investigators' current study of tDCS as a
      treatment for depression suggests that this technique has antidepressant effects and is safe,
      painless and well tolerated. However, not all patients may respond to this treatment and the
      concern of possible relapse in some patients who respond to tDCS has raised interest in
      finding treatments that may enhance and prolong the antidepressant effects of tDCS. This
      study will investigate whether D-Cycloserine, a medication shown to lengthen the effects of
      tDCS on brain activity, can also enhance/prolong the antidepressant effects of tDCS in people
      suffering from depression.

Conductive rubber electrodes (7 x 5 cm, 35 cm2) covered by sponges soaked in saline will be used, held in place by a head band. The current will be gradually increased to the level of 2 mA over 30 seconds (to avoid the sensation of a flash).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject met inclusion criteria for study HREC 07305 (a sham controlled study of
             transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a treatment for depression).

          2. Subject completed study HREC 07305.

          3. Subject either did not reach remission at the end of trial (defined as MADRS score of
             â‰¤ 10) or suffered an early relapse (within a month of finishing the trial).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis (as defined by DSM-IV) of: any psychotic disorder (lifetime); bipolar
             disorder; eating disorder (current or within the past year); obsessive compulsive
             disorder (lifetime); post-traumatic stress disorder current or within the past year);
             mental retardation.

          2. History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (as per DSM-IV criteria) within the
             last 3 months (except nicotine and caffeine).

          3. Inadequate response to ECT in the current episode of depression.

          4. Subject is on regular benzodiazepine medication which it is not clinically appropriate
             to discontinue.

          5. Subject requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high suicide
             risk.

          6. Neurological disorder or insult, e.g., recent stroke (CVA), which places subject at
             risk of seizure or neuronal damage with tDCS.

          7. Subject has metal in the cranium, skull defects, or skin lesions on scalp (cuts,
             abrasions, rash) at proposed electrode sites.

          8. Female subject who is pregnant, or of child-bearing age, sexually active and not using
             reliable contraception (urine test for pregnancy will be used)
