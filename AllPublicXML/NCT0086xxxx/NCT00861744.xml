  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two measles, mumps and rubella conjugate vaccines
      (manufactured by GSK and Merck and Company ) in terms of the immune response elicited and
      safety with a six month follow-up after first vaccination. Additionally, antibody persistence
      will be assessed one and two years after administration of MMR vaccine.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol amendment 1 and 2, Oct 2009.
