      The purpose of the study is to determine whether senicapoc can decrease changes in FEV1
      following allergen challenge in atopic allergic subjects.

      Based on the unmet medical need for new agents in the treatment of asthma and the role of
      KCa3.1 in the function of several different cell types involved in the inflammatory response,
      and the effects seen in an animal model of allergic asthma, it is reasonable to explore the
      utility of senicapoc, a KCa3.1 blocker, as a novel treatment of asthma. This study will test
      the ability of senicapoc to alleviate bronchospasm induced by an allergen challenge in
      patients with allergic asthma. It is analogous to the study performed in animals in which
      senicapoc demonstrated the ability to reduce airway resistance and hyper-responsiveness
      induced by airway challenge with antigen and carbachol, respectively. This study is also the
      first to test the ability of senicapoc to reduce airway inflammation, which is the key
      pathophysiologic process in asthma. In summary, with a demonstrated safety profile across a
      wide range of doses in humans and efficacy in an animal model of allergic bronchospasm and
      hyper-responsiveness, the initiation of exploratory studies of senicapoc for treatment of
      asthma is justified.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of asthma (as defined by the Global Initiative in Asthma definition or having
             been previously treated for asthma);

          -  Baseline (pre-bronchodilator) forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) ≥70% of
             predicted;

          -  Clinically acceptable medical history, physical examination, 12 lead ECG, vital signs,
             and clinical laboratory tests );

          -  Positive response on screening to skin prick test to either house dust mite, cat hair,
             or grass pollen;

          -  A positive inhaled methacholine challenge with a PC20 ≤ 8 mg/mL (within 6 months prior
             to Screening Visit 1);

          -  Screening allergen challenge demonstrates that the subject experiences both an early
             and late asthmatic response. The early asthmatic response must include a fall in FEV1
             of equal to or more than 20% from the post saline value, on at least one occasion,
             between 5 and 30 minutes after the final concentration of allergen. The late asthmatic
             response must include a fall in FEV1 of equal to or more than 15% from the post saline
             value, on at least three occasions, two of which must be consecutive, between 4 and 10
             hours after the final concentration of allergen;
