  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the mass balance of [14C]-talampanel. To characterize the metabolism of [14C] talampanel in plasma, feces, and urine. To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of total radioactivity, talampanel, and N-acetyl talampanel.</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To explore the effect of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) genotype on the PK and metabolism of [14C] talampanel. To further assess the safety and tolerability of talampanel.</measure>
