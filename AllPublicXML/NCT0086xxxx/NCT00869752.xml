      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as MK-0646, can block tumor growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      etoposide and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of MK-0646 when
      given together with etoposide and cisplatin and to see how well it works in treating patients
      with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the recommended phase II dose of MK-0646 in combination with a standard
           etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy regimen in patients with extensive stage small cell
           lung cancer. (phase I)

        -  To assess the toxicity and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. (phases I and
           II)

        -  To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of this regimen in these patients. (phase I)

        -  To assess the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of objective response rate, as well as
           complete response rate in these patients. (phase II)

        -  To assess progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen. (phase II)

        -  To explore the predictive and prognostic impact of biomarkers in patients treated with
           this regimen. (phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of MK-0646 followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive MK-0646 IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV and etoposide
      IV once daily on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 to 8 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment,
      patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) may continue MK-0646 in the
      absence of disease progression, with temporary discontinuation while undergoing prophylactic
      cranial irradiation or thoracic radiotherapy.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline (pre-dose) and periodically for biomarker and
      pharmacogenetic correlative studies. Blood samples are analyzed for changes in expression of
      IGF biomarkers (e.g., IGF-1, IGF-2 and IGF-PB), haplotype tagging analysis of the IGF-1R, and
      evaluation of the immunoglobulin G fragment C receptor polymorphisms.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with responding
      disease (i.e., CR, PR, or stable disease) are followed every 3 months until relapse or
      progression.
