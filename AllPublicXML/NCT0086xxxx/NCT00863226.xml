      This clinical trial will evaluate a new non-invasive, non-significant risk, device therapy as
      an adjuvant symptomatic treatment for some of the signs and or symptoms of Parkinson's
      Disease (PD). The device utilizes patented technology involving extremely low level
      electromagnetic fields.
