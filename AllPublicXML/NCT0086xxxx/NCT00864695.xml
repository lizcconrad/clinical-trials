      Descriptive analytic survey of 1137 and 518 patients aged 16 years or more before and after
      anesthesia exposure, respectively to assess the anesthesiologist-patient relationship role on
      patient postoperative perception of the binominal anesthesia-anesthesiologist. The aim of
      this study was to assess the anesthesiologist-patient relationship role on patient
      postoperative perception of the binominal anesthesia-anesthesiologist.

      A questionnaire was used to determine patient characteristics and perception of
      anesthesia/anesthesiologist, as well as fears and concerns related to anesthesia. This
      descriptive-analytic study was based on opinions and information provided before and after
      anesthesia by individuals who were hospitalized in the Botucatu Medical School (BMS) Hospital
      to undergo surgery under anesthesia administered by the Anesthesiology Service of BMS
      Department of Anesthesiology. A questionnaire including structured questions aimed at
      determining patient characteristics (age, gender, race, marital status, education level,
      birthplace, provenance, surgical service of origin, occupation, history of anesthesia
      exposure) and perceptions of anesthesiologists/anesthesia, as well as open-ended questions
      that allowed respondents to add free comments, recorded as spoken, about their concerns
      before and after anesthesia. The post-anesthesia interview also included questions regarding
      the administration of pre-anesthetic drugs, recall of the anesthesiologist in the operating
      room, satisfaction with the care provided by the anesthesiologist.
