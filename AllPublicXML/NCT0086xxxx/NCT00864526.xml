        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All subjects selected for this study will be at least 18 years of age.

          2. Each subject shall be given a general physical examination within 28 days of
             initiation of the study. Such examination includes, but is not limited to, blood
             pressure, general observations, and history.

        Each female subject will be given a serum pregnancy test as part of the pre-study screening
        process.

        At the end of the study, the subjects will have an exit evaluation consisting of interim
        history, global evaluation, and clinical laboratory measurements.

        Adequate blood and urine samples should be obtained within 28 days before beginning of the
        first period and at the end of the trial for clinical laboratory measurements.

        Clinical laboratory measurements will include the following as a minimum:

        Hematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, platelets, and white blood cell
        count (with differential).

        Clinical Chemistry: creatinine, BUN, glucose, SGOT/AST, SGPT/ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline
        phosphatase.

        Urine Analysis: pH, specific gravity, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, occult blood,
        and cells.

        HIV Screen: (pre-study only)

        Hepatitis-B, C Screen: (pre-study only)

        Drugs of Abuse Screen: (pre-study and at check-in each dosing period)

        Electrocardiograms of all participating subjects will be recorded before initiation of the
        study and filed with each subject's case report forms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with a history of alcoholism or drug addiction (during past 2 years), or
             serious gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic or cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis,
             epilepsy, asthma (during past 5 years), diabetes, psychosis or glaucoma will not be
             eligible for this study. [Subjects who have had a cholecystectomy will not be eligible
             unless approved by the sponsor.]

          2. Subjects whose clinical laboratory test values are outside the reference range may be
             retested at the discretion of the clinical investigator. If the clinical values are
             outside the range on retesting, the subject will not be eligible to participate in the
             study unless the clinical investigator deems the result to not be significant.

          3. Subjects who have a history of allergic responses to the class of drug being tested
             should be excluded from the study.

          4. All subjects will have urine/saliva samples assayed for the presence of drugs of abuse
             as part of the clinical laboratory screening procedures and at check-in each dosing
             period. Subjects found to have urine/saliva concentrations of any of the tested drugs
             will not be allowed to participate.

          5. Subjects should not have donated blood and/or plasma for at least thirty (30) days
             prior to the first dosing of the study.

          6. Subjects who have taken any investigational drug within thirty (30) days prior to the
             first dosing of the study will not be allowed to participate.

          7. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or who are likely to become pregnant
             during the study will not be allowed to participate. Female subjects of child bearing
             potential must either abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable barrier method
             (e.g. condom, IUD) of contraception during the course of the study (first dosing until
             last blood collection) or they will not be allowed to participate. Subjects who have
             used implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives anytime during the 6 months prior
             to study dosing, or used oral hormonal contraceptives or a contraceptive transdermal
             patch within 14 days before dosing will not be allowed to participate.

          8. All female subjects will be screened for pregnancy prior to dosing each study period.
             Subjects with positive or inconclusive results will be withdrawn from the study.

          9. Subjects with positive HIV or hepatitis screen will not be allowed to participate in
             the study.
