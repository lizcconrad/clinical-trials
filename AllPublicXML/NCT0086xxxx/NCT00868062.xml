  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In situations such as dehydration, illness and surgery, fluid 'drips' are given to patients
      to keep them hydrated. Different fluids stay in the circulation for different lengths of
      time. For example, some types of fluid remain in the circulation for a short time which means
      patients would need to be given more fluid to achieve the desired effects. Giving a lot of
      fluid to sick patients can in itself cause problems, for example, it can affect the way the
      bowels work and delay the patient's recovery from illness. In these situations the
      investigators use specialized fluids called colloids, that are designed to stay in the
      circulation for longer. This means a smaller amount of fluid needs to be used and less
      problems are likely to occur. There are two different types of colloids that are commonly
      used, but the investigators do not know which of them is better. The purpose of this study is
      to investigate which of the two different colloids (one is called Gelofusin and the other is
      called Voluven) works better in patients who undergo surgery. Knowing which of the two fluids
      works best in patients will help us improve the care of surgical patients. The investigators
      hypothesis is that the fluid that has the larger size of molecules as part of the solution
      will work better during surgery.

      To study the responses of patients to 1 litre infusions of Gelofusine (succinylated gelatine
      40g/L) and Voluven (6% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.9% saline) over 1 h intraoperatively. In
      particular, the extent and time course of the effects of the two infusions on haematocrit,
      serum albumin, serum biochemistry, plasma expanding capacity and the resultant urinary
      responses will be measured
