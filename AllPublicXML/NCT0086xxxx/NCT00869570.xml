      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Sorafenib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor. Giving radiation therapy together with capecitabine and sorafenib before
      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be
      removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of capecitabine
      when given together with sorafenib and external-beam radiation therapy and to see how well it
      works in treating patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the recommended dose of neoadjuvant capecitabine when given together with
           sorafenib tosylate and external-beam radiotherapy in patients with K-ras mutated,
           locally advanced rectal cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the efficacy and safety of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, dose-escalation study of capecitabine followed by a
      phase II study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and oral sorafenib tosylate once daily on days
      1-33. Patients also undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19,
      22-26, and 29-33. Approximately 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, patients
      undergo surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 8 weeks and then periodically for
      up to 3 years.

    <description>Sorafenib: day 1 to 33 (5 weeks, including Saturday and Sunday) every 24 hours, immediately or within two hours after RT according to the dose escalation table during phase I, and the recommended dose during phase IIa. The intake stops at the last day of RT. On nonradiotherapy days (e.g. Saturday, Sunday), the tablets have to be taken at the same time as during the week.
Capecitabine: day 1 to 33 (5 weeks, including Saturday and Sunday) according to dose escalation table during phase I, and at the recommended dose during phase IIa. The intake stops in the evening of the last day of RT.
External beam RT: Monday through Friday for 5 weeks starting on day 1 (daily fraction 1.8 Gy, final dose 45 Gy) each day at the same time (e.g. 11:00 a.m. daily).
Surgery: 6 weeks (± 1 week) after radiochemotherapy (RCT) has been completed</description>
