    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop tools enable people who are paralyzed to operate
      technology and access computers. These tools are called brain computer interfaces (BCIs).
      BCIs would let a person use brain signals to operate technology.

      The purpose of this research is to develop tools to help people who are paralyzed. These
      tools are called brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs would let a person use brain signals
      to operate technology. The investigators want to make a BCI that can be used to operate
      commercially available technologies for communication, environmental control or computer
      access. The BCI would replace a keyboard to let people operate these technologies without
      moving. However, the investigators need people to test the BCI so that the investigators can
      see how well it can replace a keyboard. The investigators want to understand how well it can
      work so that the investigators can make it useful for people who are paralyzed. The
      investigators will ask people to use the BCI to do things like make a communication system
      speak or type words on a computer.

    <measure>Accuracy of Typing With BCI Keyboard.</measure>
    <time_frame>mean score from 3 sessions over 29 days</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy for the sentence typed in each environment was calculated as the percentage of characters for which the result character matched the target character. The target characters were determined based on the next character needed to complete the sentence to be copied. In the case of errors, the next character was therefore a backspace to correct the error. The target characters were modified by subject comments to account for errors in selecting the next character.
Once sentence was typed in each environment in each session on a separate day. From the three repeated sessions, there were therefore 9 total sentences per subject with 3 measures for each environment. These were treated as repeated measures for the analysis.</description>
