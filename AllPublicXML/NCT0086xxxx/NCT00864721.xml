      The purpose of this research study is to find out what effects (good and bad) sunitinib has
      on patients and their NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, the activity and tolerability of sunitinib malate (Sutent) will be examined in
      previously untreated elderly patients (&gt;70 years old) felt not to be candidates for standard
      cytotoxic chemotherapy.
