  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was specifically designed to provide additional information on the mechanism of
      action of direct renin inhibition postulating the higher-level RAS cascade inhibition. The
      purpose of this study was to compare the prolonged efficacy and safety of aliskiren to that
      of telmisartan in mild to moderate hypertensive patients in the 24 hrs Ambulatory Blood
      Pressure Monitoring setting after a one week treatment withdrawal.

    <measure>Change in 24 Hour (24-Hr) Mean Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (MASBP) From the End of the Active Treatment Period to Day 7 of the Withdrawal Period</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor measured a participants's blood pressure over a 24 hour period using an automated validated monitoring device at week 12 (end of the active treatment) and at week 13 (end of the day 7 withdrawal period). The 24 Hour MASBP was calculated by taking the mean of all Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure readings for the 24 hour period. The difference of the 24 hour MASBP from the end of the active treatment to Day 7 of the treatment withdrawal period was calculated using a two way analysis of variance with treatment and region as factors.</description>

    <description>An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor measured a participants's blood pressure over a 24 hour period using an automated validated monitoring device at Baseline (at Randomization) and at week 13 (day 7 of the withdrawal period). The 4 Hour MASBP and MADBP was calculated by taking the mean of all Ambulatory Blood Pressure readings during the 24 hour period. The difference of the 24 hour measurements from baseline to day 7 of the withdrawal period were calculated using a two way analysis of variance with treatment and region as factors and baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) as Measured at All Study Visits During the Double-blind Treatment Period and During the Treatment Withdrawal Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 13 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood Pressure was measured in the office after the patient was sitting for 5 minutes. The average of 3 readings 1-2 minutes apart were used in the analysis.
The change in the double-blind period was calculated from the end of active treatment at week 12 to the Baseline (Randomization) using Analysis of Covariance with treatment and region as factors and baseline msSBP as a covariate.
The change in the treatment interruption period was calculated from day 7 of the withdrawal period at week 13 to the end of the active treatment using Analysis of Variance with treatment and region as factors.</description>

    <description>Blood Pressure was measured in the office after the patient was sitting for 5 minutes. The average of 3 readings 1-2 min. apart were used in the analysis.
The change in the double-blind period was calculated from the end of active treatment at week 12 to the Baseline (Randomization) using Analysis of Covariance with treatment and region as factors and baseline msDBP as a covariate.
The change in the treatment interruption period was calculated from day 7 of the withdrawal period at week 13 to the end of the active treatment using Analysis of Variance with treatment and region as factors.</description>

        <title>Change in the Mean Diastolic Sitting Blood Pressure (msDBP) as Measured at All Study Visits During the Double-blind Treatment Period and During the Treatment Withdrawal Period</title>
        <description>Blood Pressure was measured in the office after the patient was sitting for 5 minutes. The average of 3 readings 1-2 min. apart were used in the analysis.
The change in the double-blind period was calculated from the end of active treatment at week 12 to the Baseline (Randomization) using Analysis of Covariance with treatment and region as factors and baseline msDBP as a covariate.
The change in the treatment interruption period was calculated from day 7 of the withdrawal period at week 13 to the end of the active treatment using Analysis of Variance with treatment and region as factors.</description>
