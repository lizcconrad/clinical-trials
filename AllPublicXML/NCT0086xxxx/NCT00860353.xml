  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how well tolerated and safe AZD2551 is at different
      dose levels in healthy, non-smoking males. It will also investigate how quickly AZD2551 is
      absorbed into and cleared by the body

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to portfolio and logistical issues, this study will not be re-started at the present time.
    The study is not being terminated for safety reasons.
