  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study to investigate the feasibility of creating a personalized
      therapeutic cancer vaccine within the body. A vaccine contains a source of tumor antigen and
      an adjuvant. In this study, tumor antigen is generated by freezing a tumor by a minimally
      invasive percutaneous (through the skin) cryoablation procedure. The study drug, AlloStim, is
      injected into the ablated tumor to promote development of an anti-tumor immune response.

      This is a Phase I/II clinical study to investigate the feasibility of creating a personalized
      anti-tumor vaccine within the body of patients with advanced cancers. The aim of the study is
      to evaluate the safety of administration and anti-tumor effect of a vaccine protocol that has
      three separate phases. Cancer patients generally present with an immune response to cancer
      biased to a Th2 response, while a Th1 response is considered necessary for mediating
      anti-tumor immunity. The first step of the study consists of three (3) weekly intradermal
      priming doses of AlloStim. The aim of this step is to create Th1 immunity to the alloantigens
      in AlloStim, thus increasing the number of Th1 cells in circulation. The second step of the
      protocol involves the cryoablation of a selected tumor lesion followed by an intratumoral
      AlloStimTM injection. The aim of this step is to generate tumor-specific CTL killer cells in
      the circulation. The final step is an intravenous infusion of AlloStim. The aim of this step
      is to activate circulating Th1 cells, killer cells, and natural killer cells The further aim
      of this step is to create an inflammatory environment that can break-down the ability of the
      tumor to avoid an anti-tumor immune response.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older

          -  Metastatic cancer refractory to at least one course of active chemotherapy or prior
             radiation therapy, including metastatic breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small
             cell lung cancer, ovarian or other gynecological cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic
             or other GI cancer, melanoma, head or neck cancer or lymphoma/plasmacytoma.

          -  Measurable disease determined upon review of abdominal and/or chest CT scan within 60
             days of evaluation for study inclusion with a target tumor lesion for cryoablation
             located in liver, kidney, bone, pancreas, lymph node, skin, neck or prostate deemed to
             be accessible for percutaneous access.

          -  Acceptable cryoablation procedure technique risk: the target tumor for ablation must
             have adequate distance from adjacent vasculature and other organs to permit safe
             application of cryoprobe (generally, more than a 2.5cm clearance of the cryoprobe from
             any vital structure such as the bowel, inferior vena cava, or aorta). The safety
             assessment of the cryoprobe placement will be made an attending radiologist based on
             imaging studies.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;180 days

          -  No bevacizumab (Avastin®) within 6 weeks of planned cryoablation procedure

          -  ECOG status 0-1

          -  No concurrent medication known to interfere with platelet function or coagulation
             (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, clopidogrel, or warfarin) unless such medications can be
             discontinued for an appropriate time period based on the drug half-life and known
             activity (e.g., aspirin for 7 days) prior to cryoablation procedure

          -  No low molecular weight heparin preparations unless can be discontinued 8 hours prior
             to cryoablation

          -  At least 2 weeks since prior cytotoxic chemotherapy

          -  Absolute granulocyte count ≥ 1,200/mm3

          -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

          -  PT/INR ≤ 1.5

                  receiving anti-coagulation treatment with an agent such as warfarin or heparin
                  may be allowed to participate. For patients on warfarin, the INR should be
                  monitored weekly prior to the cryoablation day 21 to assure INR is stable.
                  However, heparin or warfarin must be withheld prior to cryoablation such that the
                  above criteria are met.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 times ULN

          -  Chronic use (&gt; 2 weeks) of greater than physiologic doses of a corticosteroid agent
             (dose equivalent to &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone) within 30 days of the first day of
             study drug treatment

               -  Topical and inhaled corticosteroids are permitted

          -  Concomitant autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
