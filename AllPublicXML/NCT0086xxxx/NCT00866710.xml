      Background: Parkinson's disease affects up to 3% of persons over the age of 65. Lower urinary
      tract symptoms are a frequent cause of diminished quality of life in elderly persons and
      occur in up to 40% of persons with Parkinson's disease. While the exact mechanisms have not
      been determined, detrusor hyperactivity (hyperactivity of the bladder muscle) leading to
      symptoms of overactive bladder and urge incontinence is common. Behavioral and exercise-based
      therapies have relatively no side effects and have been shown to be an effective treatment
      for urge symptoms of overactive bladder in the aged population.

      Hypothesis and Specific Aims: Behavioral therapy using pelvic floor muscle exercises will
      result in a 50% decrease in the number of incontinence episodes in elderly persons (age &gt; 50)
      with Parkinson's disease. The specific aims for this pilot study include the following:

        1. Complete a course of behavioral therapy using computer-assisted biofeedback in 20
           subjects with UI associated with PD and determine how many potential subjects need to be
           screened and enrolled to achieve this sample size.

        2. Determine the proportion of these patients who achieve a 50% or greater reduction in UI
           episodes.

        3. Examine whether responsiveness is associated with characteristics of the Parkinson's
           disease, in particular disease severity as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease
           Rating Scale (UPDRS).

        4. Assess the effectiveness of behavioral therapy without the use of computer-assisted
           biofeedback instruction in 10 additional subjects with PD and UI.

      Methods: The first 20 participants will be enrolled in an 8-week treatment trial of
      behavioral therapies and pelvic floor muscle exercises with computer-assisted biofeedback.
      Ten additional participants will be enrolled in the 8-week treatment trial of behavioral
      therapy, but will not have computer-assisted biofeedback. Voiding diaries as well as urinary
      symptom and quality of life questionnaires will be used to assess response.

      If persons with Parkinson's disease can complete the treatment trial and achieve a reduction
      in episodes of urinary incontinence with behavioral techniques this would lay the foundation
      for a larger, placebo-controlled trial. Assessment of responsiveness associated with severity
      of Parkinson's disease would also provide important information about the utility of this
      treatment strategy.

    <description>Participants will be taught pelvic floor muscle exercises as well as urge suppression strategies to overcome the urge to void. In the first 20 participants, computer-assisted biofeedback will also be utilized to help participants identify the pelvic floor muscles and contract and relax these muscles while keeping the abdominal muscles relaxed</description>

             which is difficult to defer

          -  Willingness to attend clinic visits

          -  Willingness to keep bladder diaries

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Cognitive impairment, as evidenced by a Folstein mini-mental status examination (MMSE)
             of &lt; 24, or inability to produce an interpretable 7-day bladder diary

          -  Use of an indwelling urinary catheter

          -  Suggestion of bladder outlet obstruction as evidenced by having been prescribed
             in-and-out catheterization in the past 12 months, having a post-void residual by
             bladder ultrasound of ≥300 milliliters or a peak voiding flow rate of ≤ 4 mL/min on a
             void ≥ 125 mL in volume

          -  Severe uterine prolapse past the vaginal introitus

             pulmonary disease as evidenced on physical exam

          -  Genitourinary cancer with ongoing surgical or external beam radiation treatment

          -  Any unstable health condition expected to result in hospitalization or death within in
             the next 3 months as determined by principal investigator.
