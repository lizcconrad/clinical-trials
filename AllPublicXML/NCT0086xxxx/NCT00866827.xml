  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controversy exists in the treatment of airway hemangiomas ranging from tracheotomy, various
      lasers, to open removal, none of which have proven to be a gold standard. Venous
      malformations of the airway are difficult to treat and also require laser therapy or open
      removal and often repeated treatments are required. Similarly airway lymphatic malformations
      can require multiple treatment modalities as well as multiple procedures and are infrequently
      eradicated when extensive. New uses for various lasers and differing treatment protocols are
      frequently developed. Review of the treatment modalities and efficacy of these methods is
      required. The goal of this research is to determine protocols for treatment of airway
      vascular malformation and to evaluate our results from treatment of these lesions.
