      The goal of the study is to gain a better understanding of the molecular changes responsible
      for causing prostate cancer and that examination of tissue and blood samples will help in the
      development of improved screening and therapeutic approaches.

      The goal of this study is to identify novel genetic elements that are aberantly expressed
      throughout prostatic neoplastic progression. The approaches proposed exploit the known
      familial arm of prostatic cancer, using established molecular genetic approaches, and extend
      these studies to sporadic prostatic cancer using a novel technique of differential display.
      Application of the latter technique to colon cancer in the American population establishes
      this tumor type as a high priority for scientific investigation and this study is part of an
      initiative to address this problem. Presently the studies in the field of prostate are
      under-represented. The collection of tissue samples from patients diagnosed with prostate
      cancer. Patients will also provide a blood sample at the time of their surgery and
      potentially post-op from 6 mos to 5 years. Samples will also be obtained from patients who's
      biopsy turns out to be non-prostate cancer. These samples will be obtained shortly following
      the biopsy out to 6 months after the biopsy.

      Surplus tissue following pathologic review requirements will be snap frozen and processed for
      extraction of RNA. mRNA will be reversed transcribed to make cDNA with the prime
      5'TCCTTAGAAC, followed by 40 cycles of palindromic PCR using the sam eprimer. Amplified cDNA
      (35 S-labled) will be analysed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Comparative analysis of cDNA
      amplified products will serve to identify aberrantly expressed candidate genes. Such products
      will be isolated, sequenced and evaluated as to their role in establishing the neoplastic
      pheotype and the potential utility as a marker of prostatic neoplastic progression.
