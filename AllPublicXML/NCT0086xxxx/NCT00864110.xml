      This is a multi-center Phase 1 b study designed to expand the patient safety using
      99mTc-EC-DG with SPECT/CT imaging and to expand the patient radiation dosimetry and
      pharmacokinetic database using 99mTc-EC-DG in patients who have non-incisional biopsy
      definitive evidence of Non-small Cell Lung Cancer as compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female patients at least 18 years old with untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer who
      have non-incisional biopsy definitive evidence of disease (or cytology results from a
      bronchoscope procedure confirming NSCLC) and who have been previously certified (per Centers
      for Medicare and Medicaid Services requirements)by their physicians will be consented for the
      study. The study consists of a screening visit, gold-standard 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging followed
      by the investigational agent 99mTc-EC-DG with SPECT/CT(if the PET/CT was performed as part of
      the pre-study activities on a qualified PET camera for this study, the SPECT/CT must be done
      within 45 days of the PET/CT imaging procedures). The study procedures can be performed
      within 5-7 days of signing the informed consent. During the 99mTc-EC-DG SPECT/CT visit of the
      study, pharmacokinetic (PK) blood draws and urine collection will be taken and radiation
      dosimetry (Planar Imaging) will be performed at specified time points post 99mTc-EC-DG
      injection. Patients will be seen 24 hours after the 99mTc-EC-DG injection for safety and
      final PK blood and urine collection. A 21-day follow-up period (after the SPECT/CT image)
      will allow the investigator to acquire additional imaging, surgical, pathology and treatment
      documentation (an actual patient visit is not required at the 21 day follow-up time point).

               -  A morning scan (08:00-12:00) will require fasting from midnight (or as per the
                  site's fasting/diet restrictions);

               -  An afternoon scan (12:00-onward) will require a minimum 6 hour fast (or as per
                  the site's fasting/diet restrictions);

          -  Be able to eat a high protein/low carbohydrate meal as the last meal before SPECT/CT
             and PET/CT imaging (or as per the site's fasting/diet restrictions);

             between PET/CT and SPECT/CT imaging (if the PET/CT is performed as part of pre-study
             activities on a qualified PET camera for this study, the SPECT/CT must be done within
             45 days of the PET/CT imaging procedure)];

          -  Have safety laboratory values that in the opinion of the Investigator do not place the
             patient at undue risk if the patient were to participate in the study. This includes

             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any clinically significant safety concerns (laboratory, electrocardiogram [EKG],
             physical examination, other) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would place the
             patient at undue risk if the patient were to participate in the study;

          -  Undergoing any current treatment for cancer (radiation therapy, surgery or
             chemotherapy)

          -  Diabetic with insulin dependence (Patients who have a known insulin dependence for
             diabetes can be included in the study if the standard of care protocol in place at the
             clinical site provides for the management of the patient's glucose level sufficiently
             to allow the PET/CT imaging to be performed. The same glucose management used for the
             PET/CT imaging should be applied to the SPECT/CT imaging procedures. A waiver will be
             required to be completed by the clinical site and approved by the sponsor or
             designee);

          -  Patient weight above the SPECT/CT and PET/CT table weight limit;

          -  Failure to have a non-incisional biopsy definitive diagnosis (or cytology report from
             a bronchoscope) for NSCLC (a copy of the biopsy/cytology report must be available to
             the investigator within 28 days of Visit 1);

          -  Will not agree to use an effective means of contraception for the duration of the
             study (males and females);

          -  Known hypersensitivity to EC-DG or FDG or similar compounds including any of the
             inactive ingredients;

          -  Known or suspected pregnancy, lactation or planned pregnancy (females and male
             partners);

          -  Clinically significant mental illness (to be determined by the Investigator);

          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to screening visit or
             participating in an ongoing clinical study (this criteria can be overruled by the
             Principal Investigator with appropriate documentation of the reason for the
             exception);

          -  Patient has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability to
             provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that might confound the
             interpretation of the study results or put the patient at undue risk.
