      The aim of this study is to investigate the hand function in patients with poly-and
      dermatomyositis and compare this to healthy individuals and norm values and secondly if hand
      function correlates to activity performance and health related quality of life.

      The study is a cross-sectional study. To assess hand function the investigators will measure
      grip force with Grippit and arm/hand mobility using EPM-ROM scale. The activity performance
      will be measured with Myositis Activities Profile and health related quality of life will be
      assessed with SF-36.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that hand function is reduced in comparison to the healthy
      population and that hand function affects both activity performance and health related
      quality of life.

        A total of 50 patients diagnosed with polymyositis or dermatomyositis were identified
        through the myositis registry at the rheumatology clinic at Karolinska University Hospital,
        Stockholm, Sweden.
