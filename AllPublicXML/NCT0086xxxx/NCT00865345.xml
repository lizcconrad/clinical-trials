      The purpose of this study is to assess the performance of the subcutaneous glucose sensor
      over an extended sensor life. The sensor is currently approved for 3 days of use and this
      study will examine sensor safety and accuracy when used for six days. This study will also
      test sensor safety and accuracy when inserted in an alternate body location (buttock area in
      addition to abdomen area). The study hypothesis is that the sensor performance will not
      greatly diminish when used for six days, or in an alternate insertion area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Medtronic MiniMed Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor was originally approved by the FDA for
      commercialization as part of the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) on June 15, 1999
      (PMA 980022). The Sensor is composed of a microelectrode with a thin coating of glucose
      oxidase beneath several layers of biocompatible membrane. This same sensor is used as part of
      the Guardian REAL-Time System, the latest advance in continuous glucose monitoring, which is
      based on the CGMS. Similar to the CGMS, the Guardian REAL-Time System has been developed for
      use in conjunction with a standard home blood glucose meter. The Guardian REAL-Time received
      regulatory approval from the FDA in 2006.

      As currently used, the Subcutaneous Glucose Sensor is labeled for a maximum use duration of
      72 hours, using only the abdomen area as an insertion site. Recent studies have shown that
      the useful sensor life could extend beyond three days, and it is reasonable to expect a
      significant percentage of sensors to last six days. It is the goal of this study to confirm
      sensor performance accuracy data from one of these recent studies. The sensor is also
      commonly worn in body areas other than the abdomen (such as the buttock). This study will
      also demonstrate sensor accuracy when used in an alternate site.

    <time_frame>Days one through six of sensor use</time_frame>
    <description>The primary accuracy parameter (primary effectiveness endpoint) was the comparative readings of paired sensor and YSI glucose readings, measured on days 1 through 6. Accuracy is defined as within 20% agreement between YSI and paired sensor (within 20 mg/dL if YSI &lt;80 mg/dL). Accuracy ranges from 0 - 100, with higher number suggests better accuracy.</description>

    <description>Device related moderate adverse event: low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but is usually improved by simple therapeutic remedy Device related severe adverse event: interrupts a subject's daily activity and typically requires intervening treatment. Note: device related determination is made by the site that there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by the device.</description>
