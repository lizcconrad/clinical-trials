  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Babies in the newborn intensive care unit who are dependent upon intravenous nutrition for a
      long period of time frequently develop liver damage. The fat used is called intralipid and is
      made from soybean oil. There is a suggestion in the literature that using fishoil based fats
      called omega-3 fat emulsions can decrease or even reverse this liver damage. We will offer
      babies with evidence of liver damage and no ability to eat,the Omegaven and see if the liver
      damage reverses.

      Babies in the newborn intensive care unit with evidence of liver damage from TPN, as
      indicated by a direct bilirubin of greater than 2.5 , and who will not be fed for at least
      another month will be offered the trial. they will be changed from the intralipid to Omegaven
      as the source of their fat. We will continue routine monitoring of their nutrition and liver
      function.
