    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab beyond progression has been proven to be safe in the community setting (BRiTE)
      and in the post-marketing study (BEAT), and confirmed its efficacy and safety in the first
      line with all regimens of chemotherapy. A total of 1,953 patients were treated in BRiTE. At
      median follow-up of 17.5 mo, there were 1,369 1st PD and 839 deaths. Among patients with 1st
      PD, 65.2% received any 2nd-line chemotherapy, 34.8% received cetuximab, and 53.8% received
      BBP. In a multivariate analysis, Bevacizumab beyond first progression and exposure to any
      2nd-line chemotherapy were independently associated with increased overall survival (both p &lt;
      0.0001). Bevacizumab beyond progression appears to be associated with longer overall in
      BRiTE.

      The investigators planned a prospective study to prove this phenomenon of bevacizumab beyond
      progression.

      Patients should have been treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as a 1st line treatment,
      and after 1st progression, these patients will be accrued in this study of bevacizumab plus
      chemotherapy as a 2nd line treatment, and the combined chemotherapy will be chosen by
      physician's decision in consider with previous chemotherapy.
