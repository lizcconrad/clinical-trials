      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others
      find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving
      bortezomib together with gemcitabine hydrochloride and rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride when given together with rituximab and to see how well they work in
      treating patients with progressive or relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of combining VELCADE (bortezomib) with gemcitabine
      (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with recurrent lymphoma after standard therapy.

      II. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine and Rituxan (rituximab)
      administered in combination with VELCADE given on a 21-day (old schema - Schema I) or 28-day
      (amended schema - Schema II) schedule.

      Secondary:

      I. To obtain preliminary data for response to this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of bortezomib and gemcitabine hydrochloride
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV), gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 3-4 hours,
      and rituximab IV on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
