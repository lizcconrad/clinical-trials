      The purpose of this study is to determine whether participation in pulmonary rehabilitation
      improves balance in people with respiratory disease.

    <textblock>
      Falls and chronic respiratory are two major health concerns affecting morbidity and mortality
      in older adults. Several factors that predispose falls, such as reduced balance, have been
      documented in people with respiratory disease. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs, which
      involve customized exercise prescription, are recommended to improve quality of life and
      disease management in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are
      many documented benefits to participation in such programs; however, the impact on balance
      and other falls risk factors has not previously been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this
      study is to investigate the effect of a pulmonary rehabilitation program on balance and falls
      risk factors in individuals with respiratory disease. This study will enhance the current
      management of respiratory disease by improving our understanding of the effects of pulmonary
      rehabilitation.

    <measure>Standing Balance - Sway Path</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Standing balance was measured using a force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) from which centre of pressure (COP) trajectories were derived at a sampling frequency of 100Hz. Participants stood on the force plate during the following two conditions: normal stance (feet hip-width apart) with eyes open and eyes closed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic balance was measured using the timed up and go (TUG) and Four Square Step Test (FSST). For the TUG, the time taken for the subject to stand from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around and return to the chair was recorded {Podsiadlo, 1991 #31}. Subjects were asked to do this as quickly and safely as possible. High test-retest reliability of the TUG has been reported in older community-dwelling individuals {Steffen, 2002 #34}. In the FSST, subjects were asked to step to four corners of a square in a clockwise and then counter-clockwise direction as quickly as possible {Dite, 2002 #1181}. The time taken to complete this circuit was recorded. This test has been shown to have high inter-rater and test-retest reliability {Dite, 2002 #1181}.</description>

    <measure>Standing Balance - Critical Point in Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Standing balance was measured using a force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) from which centre of pressure (COP) trajectories were derived at a sampling frequency of 100Hz.

    <measure>Standing Balance - Critical Point in Distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Standing balance was measured using a force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) from which centre of pressure (COP) trajectories were derived at a sampling frequency of 100Hz.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance Confidence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Activity-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale measures balance confidence during sixteen activities of progressive difficulty, such as going up and down stairs, reaching for objects and walking in crowded areas {Powell, 1995 #5}. It asks subjects to rate their level of confidence in performing an activity without losing balance on an 11-point scale ranging from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (completely confident). The score is calculated as the average score for each item. This questionnaire has been shown to be sensitive to detect changes in function following rehabilitation {Myers, 1998 #6} and has proven internal consistency and test-retest reliability {Powell, 1995 #5}.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of Falling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FESI) assesses fear of falling during a range of physical and social activities {Yardley, 2005 #1}. It asks about an individual's concern about the possibility of following during participation in sixteen common activities, such as cleaning the house, ascending and descending stairs and walking in various environmental conditions. Answers range from 1, &quot;not at all&quot; concerned, to 4, &quot;very&quot; concerned, on a 4-point scale, and score is calculated as the average response. This questionnaire has been shown to have excellent internal and test-retest reliability {Yardley, 2005 #1}.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confidence in Disease Management</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-pulmonary rehabilitation) and follow-up (post-pulmonary rehabilitation) at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The COPD Self-Efficacy Scale evaluates level of confidence in ability to manage or avoid breathing difficulty during a range of situations such as feeling frustrated and lifting heavy objects {Wigal, 1991 #3}. Possible answers range from &quot;very confident&quot; (5 points) to &quot;not at all confident&quot; (1 point) and the average score per question is calculated. This scale has been shown to have excellent internal consistency and good test-retest reliability.</description>

        <title>Dynamic Balance</title>
        <description>Dynamic balance was measured using the timed up and go (TUG) and Four Square Step Test (FSST). For the TUG, the time taken for the subject to stand from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around and return to the chair was recorded {Podsiadlo, 1991 #31}. Subjects were asked to do this as quickly and safely as possible. High test-retest reliability of the TUG has been reported in older community-dwelling individuals {Steffen, 2002 #34}. In the FSST, subjects were asked to step to four corners of a square in a clockwise and then counter-clockwise direction as quickly as possible {Dite, 2002 #1181}. The time taken to complete this circuit was recorded. This test has been shown to have high inter-rater and test-retest reliability {Dite, 2002 #1181}.</description>

        <title>Balance Confidence</title>
        <description>Activity-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale measures balance confidence during sixteen activities of progressive difficulty, such as going up and down stairs, reaching for objects and walking in crowded areas {Powell, 1995 #5}. It asks subjects to rate their level of confidence in performing an activity without losing balance on an 11-point scale ranging from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (completely confident). The score is calculated as the average score for each item. This questionnaire has been shown to be sensitive to detect changes in function following rehabilitation {Myers, 1998 #6} and has proven internal consistency and test-retest reliability {Powell, 1995 #5}.</description>

        <title>Fear of Falling</title>
        <description>The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FESI) assesses fear of falling during a range of physical and social activities {Yardley, 2005 #1}. It asks about an individual’s concern about the possibility of following during participation in sixteen common activities, such as cleaning the house, ascending and descending stairs and walking in various environmental conditions. Answers range from 1, “not at all” concerned, to 4, “very&quot; concerned, on a 4-point scale, and score is calculated as the average response. This questionnaire has been shown to have excellent internal and test-retest reliability {Yardley, 2005 #1}.</description>

          <title>Standing Balance - Critical Point in Distance</title>
          <description>Standing balance was measured using a force plate (AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) from which centre of pressure (COP) trajectories were derived at a sampling frequency of 100Hz. Participants stood on the force plate during the following two conditions: normal stance (feet hip-width apart) with eyes open and eyes closed.</description>

Study participants received an individualised exercise program which means that exercises given and number of pulmonary rehabilitation sessions attended were not standardized between study participants.</limitations_and_caveats>
