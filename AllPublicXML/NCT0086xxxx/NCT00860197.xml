  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether coffee consumption:

        -  increases immune responses

        -  decreases inflammatory status
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological studies suggest that coffee consumption is associated with protective effects
      against several types of chronic diseases. Recent data have shown that certain coffee
      components may possess anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancing properties. Low-grade
      inflammation and poor capacity of immune response is highly prevalent in elderly subjects.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether coffee consumption improves immune and
      inflammatory status in healthy elderly subjects. To sort out the role of antioxidants, we
      will test 2 different soluble coffee, i.e. fully torrefied coffee and partially torrefied
      coffee.
