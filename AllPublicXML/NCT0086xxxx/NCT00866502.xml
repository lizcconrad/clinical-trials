    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product sNN0031,
      containing Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), when administered directly into one of the
      fluid filled cavities in the brain using an implanted catheter and an implanted SynchroMed®
      II pump. Patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease will be enrolled.

    <textblock>
      Tremor, rigidity, slow movement, poor balance, and difficulty walking are characteristic
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that are associated with degeneration of
      dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain. Administration of growth factors that stimulate
      neuronal stem and progenitor cells is one possible approach to restore the dopaminergic
      activity. The drug product sNN0031 containing the endogenous growth factor PDGF has been
      demonstrated to reduce the typical symptoms in animal models of PD.

      NeuroNova intends to investigate whether intracerebroventricular administration of PDGF in
      the form of the drug product sNN0031 can improve motor function in patients with PD. In this
      first study the safety and tolerability of treatment for 2 weeks followed by 10 weeks
      follow-up will be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female. Females should either be post-menopausal (at least 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with FSH levels &gt;40
             mIU/mL), be surgically sterilized (bilateral oophorectomy w/o hysterectomy), or use
             adequate contraception (oral contraceptives, intrauterine device or double barrier
             contraception, i.e., condom + diaphragm, condom or diaphragm + spermicidal gel or
             foam.) during the duration of the study.

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) of moderate severity (modified Hoehn
             &amp; Yahr Stage IIb-III).

          -  Effect duration of oral L-dopa dose intake ≤4 hours

          -  Score ≥30 on motor part (part III) of UPDRS at defined off (&gt;12 hours after last dose
             intake)

          -  Dopaminergic responsiveness with at least 33% decrease in the UPDRS part III score
             after administration of L-dopa

          -  Disease duration at least 5 years

          -  Age 30 to 75 years

          -  Stable anti-Parkinson treatment for at least 3 months

          -  Ophthalmologic examination with normal findings regarding vascular structure and
             function

          -  MRI examination of the brain and cervical spinal cord within 3 months before
             anticipated implantation of the device with no findings of tumors or potential sources
             of pathological bleedings, or abnormality that may interfere with the assessments of
             safety or efficacy or would, in the judgment of the investigator, represent a surgical
             risk to the subject.

          -  Values of coagulation parameters including platelet count, normalized prothrombin
             complex (PK-INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) within normal ranges.

          -  The subject is medically able to undergo the surgery required for stereotactic
             implantation of the catheter and infusion pump.

          -  Has been given written and verbal information, has had opportunity to ask questions
             about the study, and understands time and procedural commitments

          -  Signed consent (written) to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Atypical form of PD including repeated head trauma, drug- or toxin-induced PD, and
             other neurological conditions including Shy-Drager syndrome (multiple system atrophy),
             progressive supranuclear palsy, Wilson's disease, Huntington's disease,
             Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
             olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and post-traumatic encephalopathy

          -  Concurrent dementia with a score of 20 or lower on the MMT rating scale

          -  Concurrent clinically significant depression with a score of 16 or higher on the MADRS
             rating scale, equivalent to moderate or severe depression.

          -  Exposure to neuroleptic drugs blocking dopamine receptors within 6 months

          -  History of structural brain disease including tumors and hyperplasia

          -  History of increased intracranial pressure

          -  Prior surgical procedures or implantation of device for the treatment of PD

          -  Prior exposure to any formulation of PDGF-BB (including topical)

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure &gt;160 mmHg systolic or &gt;90 mmHg
             diastolic.

          -  Any disorder that precludes a surgical procedure (eg, signs of sepsis or inadequately
             treated infection), alters wound healing (e.g. including bleeding disorders), or
             renders chronic ICV delivery or device implants medically unsuitable.

          -  Presence of risk for increased or uncontrolled bleeding and/or risk of bleeding that
             is not managed optimally. Physicians should specifically investigate anatomical
             factors at or near the implant site (e.g., vascular abnormalities, neoplasms, or other
             abnormalities), underlying disorders of the coagulation cascade, platelet function, or
             platelet count (e.g., hemophilia, Von Willebrand's disease, liver disease, or other
             medical conditions), and the administration of any antiplatelet or anticoagulant
             medication (e.g., aspirin, Plavix, NSAIDs) in the pre- or perioperative period. Any of
             those conditions or drugs could place a patient at an increased risk for
             intraoperative or postoperative bleeding.

          -  Presence of an implanted shunt for the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or an
             implanted central nervous system (CNS) catheter.

          -  Presence of cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, implantable programmable
             intraspinal drug pumps, or any other device that may interfere or interact with the
             programmer, without prior approval by Medtronic.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters as
             assessed by the investigator

          -  Ongoing medical condition that according to the investigator would interfere with the
             conduct and assessments in the study. Examples are medical disability (eg, severe
             degenerative arthritis, compromised nutritional state, peripheral neuropathy) that
             would interfere with the assessment of safety and efficacy of investigational product
             or device performance, or would compromise the ability of the subject to undergo study
             procedures (eg, MRI, PET), or to give informed consent.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial with an investigational drug or device within
             3 months prior to Screening visit.
