    <textblock>

      cope better with their current circumstances.

      The goal of the current proposed research project is to investigate the potential efficacy of
      a group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention aimed at improving emotional
      well-being, specifically mood, adjustment and quality of life (QOL), after Spinal Cord
      Injury(SCI). The intervention will be adapted to meet the unique needs of patients suffering
      from an SCI. The study objectives are:

      (1) to evaluate the impact of a brief CBT intervention aimed at decreasing emotional distress
      and improving quality of life; (2) to evaluate the sustainability of CBT therapeutic gains
      over time; (3) to conduct sub group analyses in order to better determine why some patients
      may improve post CBT, while others may not.
