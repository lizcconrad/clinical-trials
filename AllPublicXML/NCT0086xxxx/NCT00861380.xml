  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of GSK Biologicals' pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine (GSK1024850A), administered according to different vaccination schedules,
      against invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae as well as vaccine impact
      on the occurrence of hospital-diagnosed pneumonia cases, tympanostomy tube placement and
      outpatient antimicrobial prescriptions.

      This study will also explore vaccine impact on occurrence of respiratory tract infections
      (RTIs), including acute otitis media (AOM) in a subset of children in Turku area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between, and including, 6 weeks to 18 months of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

             subject.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous vaccination with any registered, non-registered or investigational
             pneumococcal vaccine other than the study vaccine, or planned use during the study
             period. If a child belongs to a high risk group for pneumococcal infections for which
             a licensed pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is made locally available, the subject can
             not be enrolled in the study and should be referred to the specific immunization
             program.

          -  Previous vaccination against Hepatitis B virus with any registered, non-registered or
             investigational vaccine, or planned use of such a vaccine other than the study vaccine
             during the study period.

          -  Previous vaccination against Hepatitis A virus with any registered, non-registered or
             investigational vaccine, or planned use of such a vaccine other than the study vaccine
             during the study period.

          -  Known severe hypersensitivity to any component of the study vaccines, including
             neomycin.

          -  Any medical condition that would contraindicate the initiation of routine immunization
             outside a clinical trial context.
