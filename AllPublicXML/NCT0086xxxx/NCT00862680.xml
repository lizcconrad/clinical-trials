  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adjusting the PET/CT scanner to allow
      for breathing motion can improve the quality of PET/CT images.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Routine PET/CT scans are taken while patients are breathing normally. The motions made by
      breathing can reduce the image quality of the scan. Minimizing the effects of this motion by
      taking the images and processing the scans differently may improve the image quality.

      The PET/CT Scan:

      If you agree to take part in this study, a small plastic box (weighing less than 1 ounce)
      will be placed on your abdominal area before your routine PET/CT scan. This box is used to
      track your breathing motion. This information will be used to help process the scan.

      Your PET/CT scan will be performed as usual. During the scan, the researchers will focus on
      your lower chest/upper abdomen (areas that experience breathing motion). Having to focus on
      this area might extend the scan by up to 12 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be complete when your scheduled PET/CT scan is
      complete.

      This is an investigational study. The imaging focused on your lower chest/upper abdomen
      during the scan is investigational.

      Up to 75 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
