      The aim of this study is to assess whether activity thermogenesis increases in patients
      undergoing bariatric surgery post-operatively compared to pre-operatively. The investigators
      will assess non-exercise activity thermogenesis using a validated Physical Activity
      Monitoring System and doubly labeled water, immediately pre-operatively and again at 6 and 18
      months post-operatively. PAMS has been validated in lean and obese individuals. This is to
      assess energy expenditure, activity thermogenesis and NEAT during the phase of greatest
      weight loss and once weight loss has plateaued. This will permit us to address our primary
      hypothesis that activity thermogenesis as a fraction of total daily energy expenditure
      increases in patients undergoing bariatric surgery 6 and 18 months post-operatively, compared
      to pre-operatively.
