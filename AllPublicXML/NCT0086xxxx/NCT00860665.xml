  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening colonoscopy has been established as the most effective means of colorectal cancer
      prevention. This is based on the fact that colonoscopy detects and removes colonic polyps
      (adenomas) which are known to progress to cancer if left untreated. The present study
      examines the question whether case volume (i.e., the number of colonoscopies performed per
      year) correlates with colonoscopy quality, i.e., adenoma detection rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      21 private practice gastroenterologist endoscopists from Berlin performed a prospective
      quality assessment study including at least 10.000 screening colonoscopies. After informed
      consent, patients data are included (age, sex, family history, colonoscopy performance
      parameters and findings, therapy performed, histology of biopsies and/or polypectomies,
      complications (immediate and late) and patient acceptance. The latter was retrieved by
      patient questionnaires returned after a minimum of 2 weeks. Data were centrally collected in
      an anonymized way

      Primary outcome parameter:

        -  Correlation of adenoma detection rate with case volume and other confounding factors
           (e.g., withdrawal time)

      Secondary outcome parameters:

        -  Complications and method of assessment (immediate recording versus later questionnaire
           enquiry)

        -  Quality of bowel preparation in relation to outcome Patient acceptance in relation to
           procedural factors (e.g., sedation)

        -  Quality of pathology reports and histologic outcome of polypectomy

      Later follow-up (after 5-10 years) of the preventive effect of colonoscopy is planned and has
      been part of the protocol and patient consent form.
