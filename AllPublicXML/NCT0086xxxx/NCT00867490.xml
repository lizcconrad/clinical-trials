    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of aliskiren plus hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
      in patients who do not achieve controlled blood pressure levels after treatment with another
      specified antihypertensive medication. There was an optional study extension for the first
      eligible 60 patients who wanted to participate that contains the triple therapy with
      amlodipine 5 mg and aliskiren 300 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg.

      Title of study extension: An open-label, multicenter extension to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of a 4 week therapy with amlodipine 5 mg and aliskiren 300 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg in
      hypertensive patients not adequately responding to a 4 week therapy each with the
      combinations of candesartan 32 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg followed by aliskiren 300mg
      plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg

    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) During the Core Phase of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Phase 2 to end of Phase 2</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. A calibrated sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, systolic/diastolic blood pressure were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. A calibrated sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, systolic/diastolic blood pressure were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>
