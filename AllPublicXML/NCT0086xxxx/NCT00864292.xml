  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be followed every 6 months for a total of 5 visits (Month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24).
      The first visit is the screening and entry visit which can occur at any time after the
      subject finishes SEARCH 001 study but preferably it should occur approximately 6 months after
      SEARCH 001 study completion.

      At each visit, patients will undergo the following

        1. Assessment of function including activity of daily living questionnaire

        2. History of medical illnesses, medication history

        3. Neurological examination: All patients will have a neurological evaluation and
           neuropsychological evaluation to characterize neurocognitive and neurological status.
           (It is possible that patients within the non-dementia group will meet criteria for
           dementia after close testing is completed).

        4. Neuropsychological assessment:

        5. Thai Depression Inventory.

        6. HIV viral load and storage of blood for proviral DNA level

      Final outcome assessment based on all available data. If possible, it is intended that these
      diagnoses will be determined through monthly VTC conference calls with UH investigators. This
      consensus conference will include the Thai investigators, the UH neurologist, the UH
      neuropsychologist and the UH principal investigators.
