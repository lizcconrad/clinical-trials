  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence in the literature that COPD should not be considered as a
      localised pulmonary disorder but as a systemic disease involving pathology in several extra
      pulmonary tissues. Well characterized systemic features are a chronic low grade systemic
      inflammation, altered body composition and a skeletal muscle fibre type shift. There are
      indications that an absolute or relative increase of fat mass puts COPD patients at increased
      risk for cardiovascular pathology while muscle atrophy is associated with a high prevalence
      of osteoporosis and with impaired physical function. The origin of systemic inflammation is
      poorly understood. Both endogenous and exogenous risk factors contribute to systemic
      inflammation and extra-pulmonary manifestations of COPD.

      Overall objective of study 3:

      To compare the pattern and severity of the systemic inflammatory profile in relation to
      skeletal muscle weakness and cardiovascular risk profile in COPD patients with mild to
      moderate disease compared to non-susceptible smokers.

      Specific objectives:

        1. To study the relative contribution of pulmonary and extra pulmonary factors on exercise
           capacity, skeletal muscle function and health status

        2. To relate diet, physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors to body composition,
           skeletal muscle function and exercise capacity status

        3. To study the influence of the emphysema phenotype on extra pulmonary pathology in COPD

        4. To study muscle fibre type size and composition and to relate muscle oxidative phenotype
           with insulin sensitivity, inflammation (local and systemic) and molecular signatures of
           oxidative energy and protein metabolism.

      Study design:

      Cross-sectional study. Healthy smoking subjects and COPD patients will undergo extensive
      clinical, metabolic and inflammatory assessment at the university clinics in Groningen,
      Maastricht and CIRO Horn.

      Study population:

      Totally 60 subjects will be included

        -  30 healthy subjects who after 20 pack years smoking have no signs of COPD (age 40-75
           years)

        -  30 COPD patients with GOLD stage II (age 40-75 years)

      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:

        1. Smoking history and behaviour, diet and physical activity level assessed by
           questionnaire

        2. Extensive lung function and CT scanning of the lung, ECG

        3. Candidate genes for muscle dysfunction and CVD risk

        4. Body composition (BIA, waist-hip ratio, DEXA-scan)

        5. Systemic inflammation

        6. Advanced Glycosylated Endproduct (AGE)

        7. Glucose tolerance test

        8. Risk factors of metabolic syndrome

        9. 6 minute walking distance

       10. Handgrip strength

       11. Skeletal muscle function by isokinetic dynamometry

       12. Physical activity level and pattern by accelerometry

       13. Muscle oxidative phenotype, fibre cross-sectional area and molecular signatures obtained
           in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies before and after incremental cycle ergometry

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness (if applicable):

        -  Totally 22 hours will be spend in the hospital during 3 visits

        -  CT-scanning of the lung is associated with a radiation burden of 0.8-1.6 mSv (dependent
           of body weight)

        -  50 ml peripheral blood (v. cubiti)

        -  Muscle biopsy may be associated with temporary pain and haematoma

        -  Drawing of arterial blood from the radial artery rarely leads to bleeding and transitory
           nerve damage (numb feeling in wrist/hand area).
