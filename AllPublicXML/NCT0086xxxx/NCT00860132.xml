  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The economic and social burden of hip fractures is expected to increase dramatically, but
      financial resources remain limited. This calls for the investigation of innovative new forms
      of organization and integration of medical, surgical and rehabilitation services for these
      patients.

      The study will investigate economical aspects associated with implementation of a
      comprehensive orthogeriatric ward for elderly hip fracture patients in a general hospital,
      compared with the classic model of orthopedic treatment followed by rehabilitation period.
