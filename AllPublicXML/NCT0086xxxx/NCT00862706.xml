          5. Serum HBV DNA level &gt; or = 5 log10 copies/mL as determined by the COBAS™ Amplicor HBV
             PCR assay at the central study laboratory

          6. Willing and able to comply with the study drug regimen and all other study
             requirements.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subject is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) at Screening.

          2. Subject is of reproductive potential (men and women) and unwilling to use double
             barrier method of contraception. It is required that double barrier method of
             contraception be used (i.e. condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) by
             subjects of reproductive potential (men and women) regardless of whether a hormonal
             agent is also used as a method of contraception.

          3. Subject is co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 or HIV-2). Patients will be tested for antibodies to
             HCV, HDV, and HIV at the Screening visit in assessments performed at the central
             laboratory.

          4. Subject previously received lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, telbivudine or
             an investigational anti-HBV nucleoside or nucleotide analog at any time. Precluded
             therapies include, but are not limited to, the following: any previous exposure to
             lamivudine, adefovir or other PMEA analogs (tenofovir, MCC-478), lobucavir, entecavir,
             emtricitabine (FTC), L-FMAU, L-Fd4C, or other investigational anti-HBV
             nucleosides/nucleotides.

          5. Subject has received interferon or other immunomodulatory treatment for HBV infection
             in the 12 months before Screening for this study. Precluded therapies include, but are
             not limited to, interferon agents (alpha-, beta- or gamma-interferons), thymosin,
             IL-12, or other putative systemic immunomodulators.

          6. Subject has a history of or clinical signs/symptoms of hepatic decompensation such as
             ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, or spontaneous bacterial
             peritonitis.

          7. Subject has a medical condition that requires prolonged or frequent use of systemic
             acyclovir or famciclovir (e.g., for recurrent herpes virus infections, etc). Prolonged
             use means episodic treatment with these agents for periods exceeding 10 days every 3
             months, or chronic suppressive therapy.

          8. Subject has a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or findings suggestive of
             possible HCC, such as suspicious foci on imaging studies or elevated serum
             alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. In patients with such findings, HCC must be ruled-out
             prior to Screening for the present study.

          9. Subject has one or more additional known primary or secondary causes of liver disease,
             other than hepatitis B (e.g., alcoholism, autoimmune hepatitis, malignancy with
             hepatic involvement, hemochromatosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's
             Disease, other congenital or metabolic conditions affecting the liver, congestive
             heart failure or other severe cardiopulmonary disease, etc.). Gilbert's syndrome and
             Dubin-Johnson syndrome, two benign disorders associated with low-grade
             hyberbilirubinemia, will not exclude patients from participation in this trial.

         10. Subject has a history of clinical or laboratory evidence of pancreatitis or
             demonstrates a clinical or laboratory course consistent with pancreatitis within 12
             weeks of study screening.

         11. Subject is currently abusing alcohol or illicit drugs, or has a history of alcohol
             abuse or illicit substance abuse within the preceding two years. For the purposes of
             the present study, alcohol abuse is arbitrarily defined as frequent consumption of
             alcoholic beverages with an average daily intake of more than 40g of ethanol or 3
             beers or the equivalent. Patients currently on methadone maintenance treatment
             programs are NOT eligible for this study due to potential interference with the study
             evaluations.

         12. Subject has a medical condition that requires frequent or prolonged use of systemic
             corticosteroids (e.g., severe asthma, severe arthritis or autoimmune conditions, organ
             transplantation, adrenal insufficiency, etc).

         13. Subject has any other concurrent medical or social condition likely to preclude
             compliance with the schedule of evaluations in the protocol, or likely to confound the
             efficacy or safety observations of the study (e.g., concurrent malignancy; history of
             unstable angina or repeated myocardial infarction; uncontrolled asthma or diabetes;
             unstable thyroid disease or other significant hormonal condition; frequent or
             uncontrolled seizure disorder; severe psychiatric disorder requiring psychotropic
             medication; active tuberculosis, pneumonia, or other severe infection under current
             treatment; lives in a country other than that of the investigative site; or has other
             medical or social circumstances likely to interfere with the schedule of evaluations).

         14. A history of treated malignancy (other than hepatocellular carcinoma) is allowable if
             the subject's malignancy has been in complete remission, off chemotherapy and without
             additional surgical intervention, during the preceding 3 years.

         15. Subject has a history of myopathy, myositis, or persistent muscle weakness or
             peripheral neuropathy (polyneuropathy).

         16. Subject has a known history of allergy to nucleoside analogues.

         17. Subject is enrolled or plans to enroll in another clinical trial of an investigational
             agent while participating in this study.

         18. Subject has any of the following laboratory values at Screening:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1500/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;11.0 g/dL (men) or &lt;10.0 g/dL (women)

               -  Platelet count &lt;75,000/mm3

               -  ALT (SGPT) &gt;10x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &gt;1.5x ULN

               -  Total bilirubin &gt;2.0x mg/dL

               -  Prothrombin time &gt;2.0 seconds above ULN

               -  Serum amylase or lipase &gt; or = 1.5x ULN

               -  Serum albumin &lt;3.3 g/dL

               -  Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) &gt;50 ng/mL. If AFP is &gt;50 ng/mL, the subject must
                  have an imaging study of the liver demonstrating no evidence of tumor within 60
                  days prior to study entry.
