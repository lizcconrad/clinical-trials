  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disorder in which there is a
      progressive loss of dopamine-containing neurons. The understanding that PD is a syndrome of
      dopamine (DA) deficiency led to the introduction in the clinical practice of L-dopa, a
      precursor of DA that crosses the blood brain barrier, and also to the use of selective
      inhibitors of MAO-B, the major DA metabolising enzyme in humans.

      Safinamide is an inhibitor of MAO-B. This study is to evaluate the long term safety and
      tolerability of safinamide in PD patients, that have already completed a previous clinical
      study with Safinamide. The physical and neurological conditions as well as other safety
      parameters will get compared from baseline to subsequent visits.

    <description>All subjects to receive first 50mg/d Safinamide with an increase of target dose of 100mg/d after 14 days of taper period until end of treatment visit. In case of any intolerance the daily dose of 100mg might be decreased to 50mg/d. Patients permanently discontinuing treatment will enter a 7day taper phase before treatment discontinuation at a dose of 50mg/day. Subjects already taking 50mg/d may stop Safinamide immediately.</description>

    <description>The Investigational Medicinal Product will be provided by the Sponsor in the form of tablets at dosage strengths of safinamide 50 mg (small - 7 mm) or safinamide 100 mg (large - 9 mm).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. the subject has completed a previous clinical study with Safinamide in PD

          2. the subject successfully completed all trial requirements of the antecedent trial

          3. if female, they must be either post-menopausal for at least 2 years, surgically
             sterilized or have undergone hysterectomy or, if of child bearing potential, they must
             be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method of contraception for four
             weeks prior to, during and four weeks after the last dose of study medication. For the
             purpose of this trial women of child bearing potential are defined of all female
             subjects after puberty unless they are postmenopausal for at least two years, are
             surgically sterile or are sexually inactive

          4. subjects must be willing and able to participate in the trial and provide written
             informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. the subject experienced a clinically significant adverse effect to attributable to
             Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) during a previous trial that could put the
             subject at risk for further treatment with Safinamide

          2. if female, the subject is pregnant or lactating

          3. any medical issues, which have emerged since the initial clinical trial, that in the
             opinion of the investigator precludes a subject's ability to participate in this
             open-label trial
