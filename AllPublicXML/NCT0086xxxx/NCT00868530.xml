    <description>Incidence of FVIII inhibitor was defined as any result determined as positive at local laboratory, and confirmed at central laboratory. Incidence was stratified by participant exposure history: Minimally Treated Patients (MTPs): those who had received at least 1 prior FVIII infusion, and &lt;= 100 documented Exposure Days (EDs), while Previously Treated Patients (PTPs): those who had received &gt;100 documented prior EDs. When number of prior EDs for an individual was not known to be at least 100, participants were included in the MTP population.</description>

    <description>Xyntha for on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes were according to investigator prescription during the 6 months observation period. The recovery assessed by determining the Factor VIII (FVIII) concentration (FVIII:C) levels in individual subjects at the initial and final visits. The dose of Xyntha for recovery assessments is: single 50 IU/kg (±5 IU/kg) IV bolus infusion. All Xyntha administrations occurred in the clinic (hospital).</description>
