  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study for patients with type 1 diabetes, whom are already scheduled
      to have desensitization treatment to help increase the chance of receiving a pancreas
      transplant.The study staff will be looking at medical records in order to collect past,
      present and future information for each subject's medical condition and/or transplant. There
      are no additional study tests, procedures or devices needed for our analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Please note that this study is observational. The treatment of each patient will be at the
      discretion of the care physician. The study investigators will ONLY be performing data
      collection and analysis.

      Post transplant all patients will receive one additional cycle of plasma exchange with a
      moderate dose of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) (0.4 mg/Kg). Antibody titers will be
      monitoring prior to plasma exchange and immediately following the treatment. At this point,
      since donor antigens are known, only antibodies to these antigens will be tested to minimize
      cost. We anticipate that in some patients, especially if the original titer of donor-specific
      antibody (DSA) was high (&gt; 1:128), a rise in DSA will be observed following transplant. If
      indeed DSA will be present, additional monitoring will be initiated and the patient will be
      treated further with plasma exchange/IVIg cycles, with antibody monitoring before and
      immediately after each cycle. If no DSA are detected, patients will be monitoring on a every
      other day schedule for the first week; weekly for the next 3 weeks and monthly up to 6 months
      post transplant. Additional testing will be performed in the event of any clinical evidence
      of graft dysfunction, or following sever infection events.

      Patient will be followed to 12 month post transplant or until one of the end points is
      reached:

        1. pancreas graft failure: defined by return of hyperglycemia and resume of insulin
           therapy;

        2. patient death due to all causes with functioning graft

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success of surgical engraftment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-operative day 1</time_frame>
    <description>This is measured by standard blood flow perfusion scan. Adequate blood flow is demonstrated by appropriate radioactive tracer uptake by the pancreas allograft. Lack of blood flow will prompt immediate surgical intervention.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Track the improvement of glycemic control.</measure>
    <time_frame>Standard-of-care labs throughout duration of study</time_frame>
    <description>Standard of care laboratory values measured routinely include: fasting and post-prandial glucose determination, serum C-peptide levels, improvement of Hemoglobin (A1C) levels post-transplant.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rejection free graft survival.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 Month follow-up from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Serum amylase &amp; lipase measured. Rising levels/aberrant glycemic control may indicate allograft rejection. Treatment - pancreas allograft rejection: 1) diagnosed by pancreas allograft biopsy; 2) if rejection, staining for C4d, repeat to DSA to determine rejection (acute antibody meditated humoral vs. acute cellular); 3) acute humoral rejection treated w/plasma exchange, then by Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) (0.5 gm/kg) every other day, daily polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) at 1.25 mg/kg. Treatment duration based on clinical response. Baseline immunosuppressive medications maintained during treatment.</description>

    <measure>Patient and graft survival.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 Month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Patient and graft survival will be calculated at this time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tracking infection risks</measure>
    <time_frame>Standard of care benchmarks through 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Screening for viral infections will be performed according to standard of care protocol. Asymptomatic or symptomatic Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia will be treated in consultation with Transplant Infectious Diseases Services. Testing for bacterial and fungal infections will be guided by clinical suspicion. Active infection will again be treated in consultation with the Transplant Infectious Diseases Service.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bleeding complications</measure>
    <time_frame>At 12 Months follow-up time points</time_frame>
    <description>Though increased risks for bleeding have been associated with repeated plasma exchanges that deplete clotting factors, review to evaluate whether the limited number of plasma exchanges used in the standard of care protocols will show a minimal increase of risks for bleeding. At 12 Month follow-up time points, the number of bleeding episodes, their temporal relation to plasma exchange, and frequency of requirement for factor replacement will be analyzed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reversal or halting of diabetic complications</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6, 12, 18, 24 Months</time_frame>
    <description>For diabetic nephropathy, serum creatinine levels and urine microalbuminuria will be measured. the use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker, or aldosterone receptor blocker will be noted. For diabetic retinopathy, patients will be referred to an ophthalmologist at the 12 and 24 Months time points to measure diabetic retinal changes based on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) grading system.</description>
