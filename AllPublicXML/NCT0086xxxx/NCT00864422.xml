  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The motor cortex of the brain changes following chronic pain and injury, and this is linked
      to pain-associated changes in motor behaviour. This study aimed to investigate whether
      therapeutic exercises in patients with chronic pain can induce reorganisation of the motor
      cortex and restore normal motor behaviour. The investigators hypothesised that motor training
      can induce reorganisation of the motor cortex and that these changes are related to improved
      motor behaviour.

      The sensory and motor systems can reorganize following injury and learning of new motor
      skills. Recently we observed adaptive changes in motor cortical organization in patients with
      chronic back pain, which are closely linked to changes in motor behavior. Although
      pain-related alterations in behavior can be trained and are associated with improved
      symptoms, it remains unclear whether these meaningful functional outcomes are related to
      motor cortical reorganization. Here we investigate the effects of two interventions in people
      with chronic back pain: skilled motor training and a control intervention of self-paced
      walking exercise. We measured motor cortical excitability (motor threshold (MT)) and
      organization (center of gravity (CoG) and map volume) of the deep abdominal muscle,
      transversus abdominis (TrA), using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In addition,
      motor behavior of TrA was assessed during single rapid arm movements. The study helps to
      elucidate the mechanisms of specific motor exercises in chronic back pain management.

    <description>This involves training subjects to independently and cognitively activate the deep abdominal muscles, transversus abdominis, with minimal or no activity in other trunk muscles. The contraction is held for 10 seconds and subjects complete three blocks of ten contractions, twice per day for two weeks. This training protocol is commonly used clinically for people with chronic back pain.</description>

    <description>The control intervention involves walking exercises for ten minutes, twice per day. Subjects are advised to walk at their own pace with no instructions on activation of specific trunk muscles. The exercise is performed over two weeks.</description>
