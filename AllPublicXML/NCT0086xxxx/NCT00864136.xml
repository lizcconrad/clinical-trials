    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, non-interventional post-marketing surveillance study is to
      obtain data on safety and efficacy of Mirena in treatment of prolonged or heavy menstrual
      bleeding (Menorrhagia) under daily-life treatment conditions.

      It is planned to conduct the study in about 10 countries with a total of 1000 patients. In
      several countries, a comparator group will also be documented.

      For each patient, an initial visit and one to three follow-up visits after about 3, 6 and 12
      months will be documented by the treating physician on the case report form. Observations
      include the patient's demographic parameters (date of birth, height, weight, race and smoking
      habits), previous contraceptives and menorrhagia treatment, gynaecological history, baseline
      menstruation, result of insertion, concomitant medications and diseases as well as
      menorrhagia symptoms. Overall treatment success will be evaluated at the end of treatment
      including number of weeks until improvement and reduction of menstrual bleeding with respect
      to duration and severity, and patient's satisfaction.

      The &quot;MiCo - Mirena or conventional medical treatment for menorrhagia&quot; study consist of two
      parts, MiCo Asia-Pacific and MiCo MA0901 (Rest of World).

      Data from both parts will be analysed in separate pools as well as in a global pool. The
      trial alias are IMPACT Nos. 14697, 14536 (NCT01085487).
