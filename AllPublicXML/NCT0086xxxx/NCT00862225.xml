      Randomised, double-blind and prospective clinical study to examine the mechanism of action of
      the Petasites hybridus leaf extract IG-RD-001 (Ze-339, petasol butenoate complex) compared to
      desloratadine and placebo in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis of all degrees of
      severity (provoked by grasses). The treatment arm with desloratadine is an established
      standard treatment and is intended to ensure the comparative methodology of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergic rhinitis since at least 2 years

          -  Age: = &gt; 18 years

          -  Consent in accordance with the AMG (=German Drug Law)

          -  Positive skin test, skin prick test or positive RAST for grasses The skin prick test
             is positive if the wheal is &gt;= 3 mm greater than control; a skin test is positive if
             the wheal is &gt;= 7 mm greater than control

             sclerosis, Aids, HIV infection and other autoimmune diseases
