  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether patients controlling their own sedation during
      colonoscopy are less likely to need help breathing than when an anesthesiologist controls the
      medicine, and whether we can predict when the need for help will occur. The pump used in the
      study is approved for clinical use by the FDA, as are the medicines used in the pump.

    <description>The Graseby 3300 PCA pump will be loaded with a mixture of propofol 10 mg/cc containing 10 µg/cc remifentanil. The loading and demand doses will be individualized based on patient weight, height, age, and gender.
The initial loading phase of sedation will be performed by the anesthesiologist to permit estimation of patient sensitivity. Following the initial loading dose, a series of button presses will be issued by the anesthesiologist to achieve a state of moderate sedation, as determined by a decrease in BIS to the range of 75-80. Once this state has been reached, the button will be transferred to the patient for Patient C0ntrolled Sedation.</description>
