    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study to estimate the
      effects of daily oral dosing of 800 mg pazopanib on electrocardiographic parameters (QTc
      interval duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with solid tumors. Moxifloxacin, will
      serve as a positive control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      designed to estimate the effects of repeated, once daily oral dosing of pazopanib on
      electrocardiographic parameters with a particular focus on its effect on cardiac
      repolarization (QTc interval duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with solid
      tumors. Moxifloxacin, a drug known to cause mild QTc interval prolongation, is included as a
      positive control to validate the ability of the study to detect a small prolongation in the
      QTc interval. Digital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be extracted from continuous ECG
      recordings obtained via a Holter monitor. The effects of pazopanib and moxifloxacin on
      cardiac repolarization will be compared with placebo.

      This study will also assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma
      concentrations of pazopanib and its metabolites and their effects, if any, on cardiac
      repolarization, specifically on the QT interval.
