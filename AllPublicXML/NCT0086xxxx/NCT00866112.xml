  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with mobility disabilities are at greater risk than the general population for
      incurring health problems. Many of these conditions are preventable through behavior and
      lifestyle changes such as exercise and physical activity. Recent evidence suggests that
      people with disabilities experience the same physiologic response to exercise as the general
      population. Nonetheless, nearly three-fourths of those with disabilities report being
      entirely sedentary or not active enough to achieve health benefits. Despite some knowledge of
      issues that limit physical activity among this population, few studies have investigated
      methods for promoting physical activity adoption among people with disabilities, including
      wheelchair users. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a behavioral
      intervention to promote physical activity adoption over 6 months and maintenance of physical
      activity over another 6 months by community-dwelling manual wheelchair users.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be experiencing a permanent disability of at least 6 months that limits mobility

          -  Have not been moderately to vigorously physically active for the past 6 months

          -  Be willing to attend the educational workshop

          -  Receive physician approval for participation

        Exclusion criteria include:

          -  Presence of medical conditions such as uncontrolled cardiovascular problems that the
             patient's physician identifies as being contraindicated for exercise
