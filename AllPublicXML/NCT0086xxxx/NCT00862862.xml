      Objective: The objective of the study is to evaluate the ability of current vancomycin dosing
      strategies to attain the pharmacodynamic target of an area under the curve (AUC) to minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio greater than 400:1 for patients with a suspected or
      documented Staphylococcus aureus infection.

      Primary Outcome: The primary outcome is the percentage of vancomycin dosing regimens that
      achieve AUC:MIC ratio &gt; 400 on the first occurrence of vancomycin use in patients with a
      suspected or documented S. aureus infection at The Nebraska Medical Center.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        1. To assess the probability that vancomycin AUC:MIC ratios obtained from The Nebraska
           Medical Center patients exceed a therapeutic threshold using S. aureus MICs from
           isolates obtained from The Nebraska Medical Center.

        2. Using MIC data from the TRUST Study database (large national surveillance database) and
           the vancomycin AUC data obtained from TNMC patients, perform a Monte Carlo analysis that
           will assess the probability of achieving a therapeutic vancomycin threshold with a large
           number of isolates.

      Study Design: This is a prospective cohort study with a retrospective chart review component.

      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: Inpatients of The Nebraska Medical Center will be included
      if they are 19 years of age or older, prescribed intravenous vancomycin therapy with a dosing
      interval of 24 hours or less, and therapy is continued for at least 3 doses or five half
      lives. Exclusion criteria consists of an estimated creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min,
      concurrent use of dialysis, and pregnancy.

      Interventions: For the prospective component eligible patients will be consented and
      enrolled. A vancomycin trough level will be determined as normal standard of care thirty
      minutes prior to the appropriate vancomycin dose, followed by a vancomycin peak level one
      hour after the end of the infusion. Serum concentration time data will then be used to
      calculate an AUC. The retrospective component of the study will involve a chart review of
      patients treated with vancomycin in which a serum trough and peak level was obtained and
      calculation of the AUC as described.

      Evaluations: Serum concentration time data will be used to calculate an AUC for each patient
      enrolled in the study and from all charts reviewed that meet criteria. MIC data will be
      determined for Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from The Nebraska Medical Center. The
      two sets of data will then be used to calculate an AUC:MIC ratio. The AUC:MIC data will be
      compared to the goal ratio of greater than 400. Additionally, using the AUC data from our
      patients and the MICs derived from a large national surveillance data base, a Monte Carlo
      analysis will be completed to determine the probability of achieving therapeutic ratios.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  19 years of age or older

          -  Admitted to an inpatient care unit at The Nebraska Medical Center

          -  Prescribed intravenous vancomycin therapy with a dosing interval of 24 hours or less

          -  Vancomycin therapy that lasts for at least 3 doses or 5 half-lives as scheduled with
             no dosage changes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than 30 ml/min using the Cockroft-Gault
             equation (in patients over the age of 65 a SCr of 1.0 mg/dL will be assumed for all
             patients with a reported SCr less than 1.0 mg/dL). Ideal body weight will be used for
             the Cockroft-Gault equation unless the actual body weight is less than the ideal body
             weight.

          -  Patients requiring any form of dialysis

          -  Pregnancy
