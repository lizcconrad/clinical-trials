         16. Female subjects: use of contraceptives (oral, emergency [Plan B®], transdermal,
             implant, Mirena® IUD, NuvaRing®) within 30 days before drug administration or a depot
             injection of progestogen drug (e.g. Depo-Provera®) within 1 year before drug
             administration.

         17. Female subjects: evidence of pregnancy or lactation.
