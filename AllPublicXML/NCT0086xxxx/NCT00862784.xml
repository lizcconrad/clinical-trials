      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) in participants
      with metastatic colorectal cancer when treated with the monoclonal antibody IMC-1121B
      (ramucirumab) in combination with the modified FOLFOX-6 [folinic acid (FA) + fluorouracil
      (5-FU) + oxaliplatin, mFOLFOX-6] chemotherapy regimen as first-line therapy.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to measured progressive disease or death due to any cause up to 28.1 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesion and/or new lesion. For participants who had no PD or death or had started new therapeutic anticancer treatment, PFS was censored at their last radiographic tumor assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response or Partial Response [Objective Response Rate (ORR)]</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to date of objective progressive disease up to 23.8 months</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion. ORR is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until disease progression or recurrence divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>First dose to death due to any cause up to 28.1 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from first dose to the date of death due to any cause. For participants who were alive or were lost to follow-up, OS was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Time of response to time of measured progressive disease up to 22.2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of response was defined as the time from first objective status assessment of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to the first time of progression or death as a result of any cause. CR or PR is classified by the investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion.</description>

        <description>PFS was defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of progression of disease (PD) or death due to any cause. PD was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. PD is ≥20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and/or unequivocal progression of non-target lesion and/or new lesion. For participants who had no PD or death or had started new therapeutic anticancer treatment, PFS was censored at their last radiographic tumor assessment.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response or Partial Response [Objective Response Rate (ORR)]</title>
        <description>ORR is the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion. ORR is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until disease progression or recurrence divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>

Oxaliplatin 85 milligrams/square meter (mg/m²) intravenous infusion over 2 hours on Day 1; FA 400 mg/m² intravenous infusion over 2 hours on Day 1; 5-FU 400 mg/m² intravenous bolus injection over 2 to 4 minutes, immediately following the FA infusion; 5-FU 2400 mg/m² intravenous continuous infusion over 46 hours immediately following bolus 5-FU injection on Days 1 and 2.
This regimen was repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Complete Response or Partial Response [Objective Response Rate (ORR)]</title>
          <description>ORR is the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) + partial response (PR), as classified by the investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.0. CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is a ≥30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions without new lesion and progression of non-target lesion. ORR is calculated as a total number of participants with CR or PR from the start of study treatment until disease progression or recurrence divided by the total number of participants treated, then multiplied by 100.</description>
