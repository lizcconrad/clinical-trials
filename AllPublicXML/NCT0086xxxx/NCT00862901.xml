      This research is intended to explore a new approach to therapy when breast cancer recurs in
      the skin. The treatment, known as continuous low-irradiance photodynamic therapy, or CLIPT,
      has shown great promise in animal studies. The investigators goal is to evaluate CLIPT in
      people, using a novel light delivery system, to assess its side effects and the benefit it
      has in treating cancer. The investigators goal is to develop a safe, effective therapy that
      can be given in the doctor's office or possibly at home.

      The goal of this research is to conduct a Phase I clinical study to assess the toxicity,
      safety and feasibility of a novel cancer treatment, Continuous Low Irradiance Photodynamic
      Therapy (CLIPT). This research will provide translation of recent promising preclinical work
      to human subjects with recurrent breast cancer.

      BACKGROUND: Patients who develop post-mastectomy chest wall skin recurrence and fail
      conventional radiation therapy have few therapeutic options that can result in durable
      control. High-irradiance photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown efficacy in patients with
      chest-wall progression of breast cancer that have failed radiation, surgery, and
      chemotherapy. However its clinical application has been severely limited as currently
      employed methods of PDT result in virtually 100% of patients develop skin necrosis, large
      areas of full-thickness ulceration, slow healing and chronic wound pain. In the rat and
      rabbit-brain tumor models, reducing the laser irradiance and increasing the exposure time to
      achieve a similar total fluence (fluence = irradiance x time) to standard PDT, avoids tissue
      necrosis while inducing apoptosis in the tumor but not normal tissue.

      HYPOTHESIS: Low dose-rate (low irradiance) PDT may reduce or eliminate skin toxicity and
      enables treatment of skin/subcutaneous chest wall metastases in skin previously subjected to
      ionizing radiation.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

      1) determine the fluence of CLIPT resulting in toxicity (maximum tolerated dose), defined as
      ulceration or necrosis of previously irradiated skin (non-tumor bearing skin within the prior
      ionizing radiation field) or normal skin, 2) evaluate the feasibility, ergonomics and safety
      of performing CLIPT via a proprietary electronically targetable fiber-optic &quot;patch&quot; placed
      directly on tumor-bearing, surrounding uninvolved previously irradiated skin and normal
      integument 3) study the tumor-bearing integument for clinical response to therapy by
      measuring complete, partial and no response to CLIPT.

      STUDY DESIGN: We will perform a standard dose (laser fluence) escalation trial (holding drug
      level constant) in human subjects with post-mastectomy skin recurrences that have failed
      ionizing radiation therapy and assess toxicity in previously irradiated and normal
      integument.

      POTENTIAL OUTCOMES &amp; BENEFITS: Therapeutic options for post-mastectomy cutaneous recurrences
      failing conventional radiotherapy are limited. If the pre-clinical results are replicated in
      human subjects, Phase II studies to evaluate CLIPT would be warranted. The long-term goal is
      to develop an unobtrusive, large-area CLIPT system in the form of a fiber-optically woven
      &quot;garment&quot; that can be worn by the patient outside the hospital setting for repeated and
      extended periods without causing skin breakdown or pain.

    <description>A Diomed laser will deliver 630nm (red spectrum) light through a Fiber optic Patch. The Fiber Optic Patch will be compatible with the laser, delivering light to a designated region on the patient's skin. Patients will receive a single intravenous injection of Photofrin (0.8mg/kg body weight) 36 - 48 hours prior to the CLIPT procedure. PDT will be delivered over 24 hours for the dose of each arm. Patients will be enrolled in sequential cohorts of six, at increasing laser intensity until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.</description>
