          2. Volunteers who have completed the screening process within 28 days prior to Period I
             dosing.

          3. Volunteers who are healthy adult men and women 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive, at

          5. Volunteers who are healthy as documented by the medical history, physical examination
             (including but may not be limited to an evaluation of the cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, respiratory and central nervous systems), vital sign assessments,
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory assessments, and by general
             observations. Any abnormalities/deviations from the normal range that might be
             considered clinically relevant by the study physician and investigator will be
             evaluated for individual cases, documented in study files, and agreed upon by both the
             study physician and investigator prior to enrolling the volunteer in this study and
             for continued enrollment.

          6. Volunteers who have a negative urine drug screen.

          7. Female volunteers must have a negative pregnancy screen.

          8. Female volunteers practicing an acceptable method of birth control as judged by the
             investigator(s), such as condom with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide,
             intrauterine device (IUD), or abstinence throughout the duration of the study; or of
             postmenopausal (no menses) status for at least 1 year; or surgically sterile

             hematologic, endocrine, or neurologic system(s) or psychiatric disease as determined
             by the clinical investigator(s).

          3. Volunteers whose clinical laboratory test values outside the accepted reference range
             and when confirmed on re-examination is deemed to be clinically significant.

          4. Volunteers who demonstrate a reactive screen for hepatitis B surface antigen,
             hepatitis C antibody, or HIV antibody.

             metabolism in the 28 days prior to Period I dosing.

          8. Volunteers who report a history of clinically significant allergies including drug
             allergies.

          9. Volunteers who report a clinically significant illness during the 4 weeks prior to
             Period I dosing (as determined by the clinical investigators).

         10. Volunteers who report a history of drug or alcohol addiction or abuse within the past
             year.

         11. Volunteers who demonstrate a positive drug abuse screen for this study prior to Period
             I dose administration.

         12. Volunteers who currently use tobacco products.

         13. Volunteers who report donating greater than 150 mL of blood within 28 days prior to
             Period I dosing. All subjects will be advised not to donate blood for four weeks after
             completing the study.
