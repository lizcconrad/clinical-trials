  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the major complications of heart surgery is kidney injury, which occurs in up to 30%
      of patients and is associated with poor outcomes including death. We have found that patients
      whose hemoglobin concentration before surgery is lower than normal (i.e., are anemic) are at
      particularly high risk for this complication, likely because their hemoglobin concentration
      drops to very low levels during surgery, which reduces delivery of oxygen to the kidneys,
      increases blood loss, and necessitates blood transfusions. We and others have shown that
      these events are individually harmful to the kidneys, and can lead to kidney injury. We
      believe that we can prevent these events from occurring, and as a result reduce the risk of
      kidney injury, if we transfuse anemic patients at least 1 day before surgery rather than
      during surgery.

      In anemic patients undergoing cardiac surgery, prophylactic transfusion of red blood cells
      (RBCs) before surgery will reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) after surgery by
      mitigating three inter-related risk factors for AKI.

    <description>Sixty anemic (Hg 100-120 g/L) adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB will be randomized to the 'advance RBC transfusion' (ART) group or the standard-of-care RBC transfusion' (SRT) group (1:1 ratio).
In the ART group, subjects will receive 1-2 units of stored RBCs 1-2 days before surgery to reach a target Hb of 130-140 g/L. Each unit of blood will be transfused over 2 hours under medical supervision, with appropriate monitoring and management of fluid status to ensure patients are not over-hydrate</description>
