          -  Administration of licensed vaccines within 4 weeks prior to enrolment in this study.

          -  Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol up to 30 days
             after the second vaccination with H5N1 vaccine.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the first study vaccination.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to vaccines.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccines.

          -  Acute clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal functional
             abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening tests.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

          -  Serious chronic disease including any medically significant chronic pulmonary,
             cardiovascular, renal, neurological, psychiatric or metabolic disorder, as determined
             by medical history and physical examination..

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the first study vaccination or during the study.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
