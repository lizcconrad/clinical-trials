        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Availability of subject for the entire study period and willingness to adhere to
             protocol requirements as evidenced by the informed consent form duly signed by the
             subject.

          2. Males aged from 18 to 50 years with a body mass index (8MI) within 19-30; demographic
             data (sex, age, ethnic group, body weight, height and smoking habits) will be recorded
             and reported in the final report.

          3. Clinical laboratory values within the laboratory's stated normal range; if not within
             this range, they must be without any clinical significance and must be recorded as
             such in the CRF.

          4. Healthy according to the laboratory results and physical examination

          5. Normal cardiovascular function according to ECG.

          6. Subjects should be non- or ex-smokers.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Significant history of hypersensitivity to citalopram or any related products as well
             as severe hypersensitivity reactions (like angioedema) to any drugs.

          2. Presence or history of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease, or any
             other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects.

          3. Presence or history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, neurologic,
             psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic or dermatologic disease.

          4. Use of MAO inhibitors within 14 days of day 1 of the study

          5. Maintenance therapy with any drug, or significant history of drug dependency, alcohol
             abuse (&gt; 3 units of alcohol per day, intake of excessive alcohol, acute or chronic),
             or serious Psychological disease.

          6. Any clinically significant illness in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study.

          7. Use of enzyme-modifying drugs in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study (all
             barbiturates, corticosteroids, phenylhydantoins, etc.).

          8. Participation in another clinical trial in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this
             study.

          9. Donation of 500 mL or more of blood (Canadian Blood Services, Hema-Quebec, clinical
             studies, etc.) in the previous 56 days before day 1 of this study.

         10. Positive urine screening of drugs of abuse.

         11. Positive results to HIV, HBsAg or anti-HCV tests

         12. History of fainting upon blood sampling
