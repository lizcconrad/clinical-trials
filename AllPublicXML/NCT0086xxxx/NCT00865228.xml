  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the role of time of dosing on the lipid-lowering
      effects of lapaquistat acetate, once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), in subjects with
      hypercholesterolemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemias are a group of metabolic disorders produced by raised concentrations of
      lipoproteins, especially low-density lipoprotein cholesterol the lipoprotein that transports
      endogenous cholesterol from the liver to the peripheral tissues. Increased cholesterol and
      triglyceride levels lead to an increased risk of arteriosclerosis, the underlying cause of
      heart attack, strokes and peripheral vascular disease. Despite changes in lifestyle and the
      availability of potent lipid-lowering agents, cardiovascular disease continues to be the
      major cause of death in Western Europe and North America.

      Lapaquistat acetate is being developed by Takeda for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
