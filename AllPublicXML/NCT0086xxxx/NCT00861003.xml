      This prospective study examines the differences among several measures of adherence to
      antipsychotic medications in outpatients with schizophrenia. Adherence is assessed by using
      self-report, physician report, pill count and electronic monitoring. The rates of
      adherence/non-adherence with various tools will be manifested. The association between
      antipsychotic adherence/non-adherence and various clinical status, including psychotic
      symptoms, depressive symptoms, side effects, neurocognitive function and insight are
      analyzed. Participants are assessed at baseline during a visit to their outpatient clinic and
      followed up for 8 weeks.
