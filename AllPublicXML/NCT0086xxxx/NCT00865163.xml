      LASER is designed to gather data about ischemic an bleeding complications for a period of 12
      months after a PCI with the aim to optimize the therapy of these patients.

      The LASER Registry will collect data from unselected patients on how the problem of stents on
      the background of full anticoagulation is approached by the investigators. On the collected
      data the LASER registry will

        -  document the frequently used treatment modalities how patients requiring stents on the
           background of full anticoagulation with Vitamin K Antagonists are currently managed

        -  will document the associated cardiac event rates with each currently used treatment
           strategy

        -  will document the associated bleeding rates with each currently used treatment strategy

      With these data available, the LASER Registry will allow

        -  to define an optimised treatment regimen for the treatment of patients on full
           anticoagulation with Vitamin K Antagonists receiving one or more coronary stents

        -  to allow the appropriate sample size calculation for the design of a subsequent
           randomised comparison of continuous triple anticoagulation versus this optimised
           treatment regimen in such patients.

      <textblock>
        Patients with significant symptomatic coronary artery disease who for this reason undergo
        PCI with implantation of one or more drug eluting stent(s) (DES) or bare metal stent(s) and
        requiring Vitamin K Antagonist based full anticoagulation therapy (target INR 2-4,5) for
        any clinical indication.

        The LASER Registry will collect the data of 1000 patients with the need for oral
        anticoagulation and 1000 matched control patients without the need for oral
        anticoagulation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with significant symptomatic coronary artery disease (stable angina class II
             or more (CCS) , unstable angina, NSTEMI, or STEMI) and who for this reason do undergo
             percutaneous coronary revascularization with one or more drug eluting stent(s) (DES)
             or bare metal stent(s)

          -  Patients requiring Vitamin K Antagonists based full anticoagulation therapy (target
             INR 2-4,5) for any clinical indication

          -  Age: &gt;18 years; no upper age limit

          -  Informed consent has been obtained that the patient agrees to be fol-lowed up for up
             to one year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have been treated with a combined anticoagulant &amp; antiplatelet therapy
             within the previous two months

          -  Overt or constant occult bleeding that cannot adequately be treated (proton pump
             inhibitors, H2-blockers e.g.)

          -  Any contraindication to the use of thienopyridines

          -  Any contraindication to the use of aspirin

          -  Severe liver or kidney disease

          -  Any reason that creates sufficient doubts that follow-up can be obtained with
             reasonable efforts

          -  Any other reason that in the eye of the investigator makes the patient unsuitable for
             the participation in the registry

          -  For female patients only: pregnant or not on oral contraceptives or child bearing
             potential
