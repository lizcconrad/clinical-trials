    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have not yet received
      any treatment for their disease.

      Current therapy for this disease includes the use of combination chemotherapy regimens
      containing Fludarabine and Rituximab, which have been found to be very effective for CLL. In
      this study, subjects will receive Fludarabine and Rituximab. After 3 cycles or 6 cycles of
      Fludarabine and Rituximab treatment, they will receive Lenalidomide. We are doing this
      research because we are attempting to improve the response, or outcome, of Fludarabine and
      Rituximab in previously untreated CLL patients. Lenalidomide is a drug that alters the immune
      system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support
      tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.
      Lenalidomide is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of specific
      types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and in combination with dexamethasone for patients
      with multiple myeloma (MM). MDS and MM are blood disorders that involve different types of
      blood cells. It is not approved for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is currently being
      tested in a variety of cancer conditions. In this case it is considered experimental.

      This research is being done because we are attempting to find a better treatment for chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia. We do not know the effect of Lenalidomide following the regimen of
      Fludarabine and Rituximab.

      The hypothesis of the study is that adding Lenalidomide after the standard treatment regimen
      of Fludarabine and Rituximab will have better outcomes than treatment with Fludarabine and
      Rituximab alone.

      This is a single institution Phase II study where all enrolled patients with untreated CLL
      will receive fludarabine and rituximab (FR) combination therapy. Subjects who demonstrate
      Stable disease or Progressive disease after completing 3 cycles of FR will receive
      lenalidomide monotherapy for a maximum of 6 cycles. Subjects who achieve &gt;/= PR after
      receiving 3 cycles of FR will receive 3 additional cycles of FR (maximum of 6 cycles). Upon
      completion of FR treatment subjects will receive lenalidomide monotherapy for a maximum of 6
      cycles.

      Response assessment will be performed for Module A (FR): after every cycle, but would include
      imaging after cycle 3 if clinically indicated. Response assessment will be performed for
      Module B (Lenalidomide monotherapy): Before starting Lenalidomide therapy, after every cycle
      and on completion of therapy. Imaging for Module B would be obtained before starting
      lenalidomide therapy, and on completion of therapy. Bone marrow biopsies will be performed
      prior to starting therapy in Module A (FR), prior to starting Module B (Lenalidomide), and on
      completion of Module B. Bone marrow biopsies can be obtained once during Lenalidomide therapy
      at the discretion of the investigator. Minimum residual disease assessment of bone marrow
      specimens should include immunohistochemistries and flow cytometry. Additional studies on
      bone marrow specimens will be sent for flow cytometric analysis (standard or four color
      flow), ZAP-70 immunohistochemical stains and FISH analysis (13q deletion, trisomy 12, 11q
      deletion, and 17p) will be performed at the time intervals described above.

      Response will be assessed according to the Cheson Criteria.

      Blood specimens for optional correlative studies will be drawn on Day 0 prior to FR, prior to
      starting lenalidomide, 90 days after initiation of lenalidomide, and 7 days after the last
      dose of lenalidomide.

Complete response rate is defined as an achievement of all of the following: Peripheral blood lymphocytes (evaluated by blood and differential count) below 4 × 109/L (4000/μL), absence of significant lymphadenopathy (lymph nodes must be &lt; 1.5 cm), absence of splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, absence of constitutional symptoms, normal blood counts, and bone marrow sample must be at least normocellular for age, with less than 30% of nucleated cells being lymphocytes. Lymphoid nodules should be absent.</description>
