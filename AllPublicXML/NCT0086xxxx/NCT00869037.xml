    <textblock>
      The recovery from knee replacement surgery often involves a significant amount of pain. The
      best way to prevent/treat this pain is unknown. This study will compare two accepted methods
      of pain control in order to determine which is superior. The first method involves the
      injection of a solution containing multiple medications into the knee joint at the time of
      surgery. The second method involves the placement of a catheter adjacent to the femoral nerve
      which senses pain from the knee. This catheter is used to deliver local anesthetic which
      serves to block the transmission of pain signals from the nerve. The catheter will be left in
      place until 2 days after surgery. This method is combined with injection of local anesthetic
      in a particular area of the knee joint at the time of surgery. Patients will be followed
      until 2 days after surgery in order to determine which method is superior. We believe the
      second method will be deemed superior.

    <description>A 20 ml bolus of saline will be given through the sham femoral nerve block catheter. Periarticular infiltration solution containing 400 mg Ropivicaine, 30 mg Ketorolac, 5 mg Epidural Grade Morphine, and 0.6 ml of 1:1000 Epinephrine will be made up to a volume of 100 ml with saline. Intra-op, 20 ml will be injected into the posterior capsule; 40 ml in the quadriceps mechanism, retinacular tissues, medial and lateral collateral ligaments; 40 ml in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The sham catheter will be connected to a saline infusion running at 15 ml/hr until the morning of post-operative day 2.</description>

    <description>A 20 ml bolus of 0.2% Ropivacaine will be given via a femoral nerve catheter. Periarticular infiltration will be performed intra-op. 20 ml of 1% Ropivacaine in the posterior capsule; 20 ml of normal saline in the quadriceps mechanism, retinacular tissues, medial and lateral collateral ligaments; 20 ml of normal saline for the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Postoperatively, the femoral catheter will be infused with 0.15% Ropivacaine running at 15 ml/hour until the morning of post-operative day 2</description>
