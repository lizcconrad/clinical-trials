  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition, affecting 10-15% of patients with
      allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma. Cat-PAD is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived
      peptide desensitising vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of cat allergy.

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of Cat-PAD in
      controlled asthmatics treated with either inhaled salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or
      inhaled corticosteroids with a LABA and to explore the efficacy of Cat-PAD in these subjects
      using the Late Phase Skin Response, Early Phase Skin Response, and Conjunctival Provocation
      Test.

      This study is designed as a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      multiple dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Cat-PAD in cat allergic
      subjects with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and controlled asthma. The efficacy of Cat-PAD
      will also be explored in these subjects using the EPSR, LPSR, CPT, and levels of cat specific
      IgE. A single centre will be initiated first, with a second centre included as a backup, if
      needed, to enable recruitment numbers to be met.

      Three cohorts will be studied, depending on the treatment used to control the subject's
      asthma:Cohort 1 - inhaled salbutamol only, Cohort 2 - inhaled corticosteroid only, Cohort 3 -
      inhaled corticosteroid plus a LABA

      The study will consist of 3 study periods. In Period 1, Screening will be performed up to a
      maximum of 8 weeks before randomisation and may consist of one or two visits to the clinic,
      at the investigator's discretion. Baseline Challenge will consist of a single visit 1 to 4
      weeks before randomisation.

      In Period 2, subjects in each cohort complying with the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomised to either 3 nmol Cat-PAD or placebo. Treatments will be administered every 2 weeks
      (±2 days) for 14 week

      In Period 3, Post Treatment Challenge consist of a single visit 24-28 weeks after the first
      administration in the treatment period and assessments will be performed identical to those
      at the baseline challenge. Follow-up will be conducted 3-10 days after PTC.

             malignant, psychiatric, major physical impairment) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
