  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently standard of care for preventing blood clots in total knee replacement patients is
      the drug Fragmin which is a daily injection for 10 days after surgery. Patients are in
      hospital for 3 to 5 days after total knee replacement surgery and patients are taught in
      hospital to do their injections.

      The investigators would like to introduce the drug Pradax. Pradax is a Health Canada approved
      once a day, oral drug that may prevent blood clots in the patient's leg. In this study the
      patient will receive the standard of care injection drug Fragmin while in hospital but on
      discharge home the patient will take the oral drug Pradax daily (2 tablets 110mg) for 10
      days.

      We will enroll one hundred patients who are scheduled to have a total knee replacement. If
      you have signed the consent form for this study you will receive the standard of care
      treatment for blood clots, which is a daily injection drug called Fragmin. On the day of
      discharge from hospital study patients will receive a ten day supply of oral Pradax. to be
      taken once a day. The Orthopaedic research coordinator will call the study patients at post
      discharge day three and five to check on compliance and or concerns. All total knee
      replacement patients whether in study or not are seen in the Orthopaedic clinic at post op
      day 10 for staple removal and again at the 6 week point, 3 month, and 6 month and 1 year
      point. Standard of care x-rays are done also at these visits.

    <description>Pradax (dabigatran etexilate) is a prodrug that when converted to the active from in the liver and plasma it becomes a reversible, competitive direct thrombin inhibitor. Thrombin catalyses the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into soluble fibrin, the final step in the coagulation cascade. Pradax competitively blocks the active site of both free and clot-bound thrombin, preventing the development of a thrombus. they will take 110 mg 1-4 hours post op. and 220mg daily until 10 days post op.</description>
