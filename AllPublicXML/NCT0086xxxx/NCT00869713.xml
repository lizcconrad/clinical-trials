    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated Rift
      Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine in adults
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives are to assess safety of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine, Inactivated
      (TSI-GSD 200) and to assess immunogenicity of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Vaccine, Inactivated
      (TSI-GSD 200). The secondary objective is to assess incidence of RVF infection in vaccinated
      personnel

    <description>All subjects: 1.0-mL (SQ)doses on day 0, once between days 7 &amp; 14, &amp; once between days 28-42. Initial responders: A 6-month mandatory vaccine booster dose (1.0 mL, SQ) will be given if the PRNT80 is ≥1:40 after the primary series. Subsequent booster doses will be given for PRNT80 titer &lt;1:40. Initial non-responders: Individual who has a PRNT80 titer &lt;1:40 following the primary series may be administered a booster dose before 6 months. The individual will not receive the mandatory 6-month booster dose. Once an initial non-responder achieves PRNT80 ≥1:40, additional booster doses will be given for subsequent PRNT80 &lt;1:40). All subjects: RVF booster dose will be administered within 90 days after a PRNT80 result of &lt;1:40.</description>

             booster, RVF PRNT80 &lt;1:40 within past 1 year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Older than 65 years of age for the primary series vaccination (able to receive booster
             doses if no other contraindications).

          2. Clinically significant abnormal lab results, including evidence of Hepatitis C,
             Hepatitis B carrier state, or elevated (2 times normal) liver function tests.

          3. Personal history of immunodeficiency or current treatment with immunosuppressive
             medication.

          4. Confirmed positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) titer.

          5. Any medical condition that, at the discretion of the physician, may jeopardize the
             safety of the subject.

          6. Any serious or life-threatening allergies to any component of the vaccine: formalin
             human serum albumin neomycin streptomycin fetal rhesus lung cells RVF virus
             inactivated

          7. Administration of any Investigational New Drug (IND) product or any vaccine within the
             28 days before RVF vaccination.

          8. Any unresolved adverse event resulting from a previous immunization.
