      This is a phase I study aimed at identifying safe doses of DMXAA in patients with solid
      tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation study conducted at a single center in New Zealand. Patients
      received dimethylxanthenone acetic acid (DMXAA) IV over 20 minutes once every three weeks, up
      to a maximum of 12 courses.

      Cohorts of 3 patients received escalated doses of DMXAA until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) was determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients had solid tumors for which there was no standard therapy or were refractory to
      conventional therapy.
