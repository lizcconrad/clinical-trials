  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathy results from damage to the nerves in the feet and legs. It is usually experienced
      as pain, tingling or numbness. In HIV-infected people, neuropathy can result from the
      infection itself or be a side effect of antiretroviral treatment. The purpose of this study
      is to determine whether two different drugs, methadone and duloxetine, reduce
      neuropathy-associated pain in HIV-infected people. This study will also examine whether
      utilization of both of these drugs is more effective than treatment with only one.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral neuropathy is now recognized as the most common neurological complication of HIV
      disease and its treatment. Before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was
      introduced, the prevalence of HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) was already
      estimated to be 35%, mostly contained to populations with moderate to advanced
      immunosuppression. Now, since the advent of HAART, the prevalence of HIV-associated
      neuropathy has increased to 52%, possibly due to a combination of antiretroviral toxic
      neuropathy (ATN), decreased mortality, and accumulated medical comorbidities.

      Successful treatment of neuropathic pain is inherently difficult, and treatment of
      HIV-associated neuropathic pain is particularly complicated. To date, evidence supporting
      effective therapies for neuropathic HIV-associated pain is lacking, despite several types and
      classes of drugs having been evaluated in clinical trials. This study will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of duloxetine, methadone, and the combination of duloxetine and methadone
      in painful HIV-associated neuropathy. Both of these drugs are approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) but for purposes unrelated to HIV-associated neuropathy, and no previous
      studies have utilized these two treatments for this purpose.

      For this study, 120 participants with painful HIV-associated neuropathy will be recruited.
      The trial will last for approximately 23 weeks. Each participant will receive a total of 4
      study treatments. The following treatment pairings will be given in a sequence determined by
      randomization:

        1. duloxetine and methadone placebo

        2. methadone and duloxetine placebo

        3. duloxetine and methadone

        4. duloxetine placebo and methadone placebo

      Each treatment period will last 4 weeks and will be followed by a 1-week combined taper and
      washout.

      People wishing to enroll in this study will have a screening visit that will last about 3
      hours. During this visit, participants will have an HIV test, physical exam, neurologic exam,
      blood drawn, electrocardiogram (EKG), and a pregnancy test, if applicable. Participants will
      also be asked about their current health and any medications they may be taking. They will
      also be asked about their mood and be given the results of tests performed at the screening
      visit.

      If screening qualifies participants for the study, they will return for a pre-entry visit
      lasting 2 hours. During this visit, participants will have a limited physical exam and be
      asked about changes in their health or medicines since screening. Participants will also be
      given a pain diary with instructions to record neuropathy pain every day for each of the 7
      days before beginning the study and throughout the study.

      After beginning the study, participants will return to the clinic for another 8 visits. These
      visits are at the end of each 4-week treatment period and at the end of each 1-week crossover
      period. At each visit, there will be a limited physical exam and participants will answer
      questions about their health and medications. Participants will also be told the results of
      routine lab tests and pregnancy tests performed during the study.

    <time_frame>During the fourth treatment week of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was measured on an 11-point Likert numerical rating scale, ranging from 0=``No pain&quot; to 10=``Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.
Participants were given pain diaries at weeks 0, 5, 10, and 15. They started the diary 7 days prior to their clinic visits at weeks 0, 4, 9, 14, and 19. During the 7 days, each morning, they recorded their pain level due to neuropathy by circling the number that best described their neuropathy pain on average over the past 24 hours.</description>

    <time_frame>At the fourth treatment week of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D is a 20-item self-report rating inventory measuring characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. Participants were asked to score each item: (0) Rarely, (1) Occasionally, (2) Sometimes, and (3) Most of time. Some items are multiplied by -1 to change direction. The overall CES-D score is simply the sum of 20 items. The highest possible total CES-D score is 48, and the lowest possible score is -12. The total CES-D score is considered missing if more than 4 items are not answered.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Participants were recruited across 8 of 15 study sites in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group system between August 2009 and October 2010. The sites were: Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Harvard MGH, Houston AIDS Research Team, Metrohealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Northwestern University, UC San Diego Medical Center, Washington Univ., Univ. of Colorado.</recruitment_details>

Methadone and matching placebo were initiated at 5mg twice daily (BID), titrated to 5mg three times daily (TID) on Day 6,and thereafter titrated to target dose of 10mg TID by Day 11. Duloxetine and matching placebo were initiated at 30mg daily for 5 days and thereafter titrated to a target dose of 60mg daily at Day 6. Each treatment period lasted four weeks and was followed by a 1-week combined taper and washout. Flexible dosing allowed participants to receive either the target ceiling dose or the maximum tolerated dose of study treatments.</description>

          <description>Participants will receive treatment in the following order: (Period 1, Weeks 1 to 4) duloxetine placebo and methadone placebo, (Period 2, Weeks 6 to 9) duloxetine and methadone, (Period 3, Weeks 11 to 14) duloxetine placebo and methadone, (Period 4, Weeks 16 to 19) duloxetine and methadone placebo
Methadone and matching placebo were initiated at 5mg twice daily (BID), titrated to 5mg three times daily (TID) on Day 6,and thereafter titrated to target dose of 10mg TID by Day 11. Duloxetine and matching placebo were initiated at 30mg daily for 5 days and thereafter titrated to a target dose of 60mg daily at Day 6. Each treatment period lasted four weeks and was followed by a 1-week combined taper and washout. Flexible dosing allowed participants to receive either the target ceiling dose or the maximum tolerated dose of study treatments.</description>

        <title>Mean Nighttime Pain Measure on an 11-point Likert Scale</title>
        <description>Pain was measured on an 11-point Likert numerical rating scale, ranging from 0=``No pain&quot; to 10=``Pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.
Participants were given pain diaries at weeks 0, 5, 10, and 15. They started the diary 7 days prior to their clinic visits at weeks 0, 4, 9, 14, and 19. During the 7 days, each morning, they recorded their pain level due to neuropathy by circling the number that best described their neuropathy pain on average during the night time.</description>

Very much improved
Much improved
Minimally improved
No change
