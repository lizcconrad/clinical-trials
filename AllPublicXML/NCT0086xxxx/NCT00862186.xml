      This study will investigate self-management of cancer-related fatigue by adolescents through
      pilot study of an evidence based educational resource.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue is a prevalent and distressing symptom which has a significant impact
      on quality of life for children and adolescents with cancer and their families. Evidence
      based guidelines issued by the Oncology Nursing Society and National Comprehensive Cancer
      Network recommend educational interventions for preventing and treating cancer-related
      fatigue.The primary study aim is to examine the relationships among: intensity of
      cancer-related fatigue; frequency of use of an evidence based educational resource for
      self-management of cancer-related fatigue; and perceived helpfulness of resource use. The
      secondary aim is to examine the relationship between the Fatigue Scale-Adolescent (FS-A) and
      the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS) 'tired' item as measures of intensity of cancer-related
      fatigue. The tertiary aim is to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining
      adolescents with cancer for longitudinal study of cancer-related fatigue.

    <description>The FS-A is a 14-item self-report instrument which measures on a 5 point scale ranging from '1 - not at all' to '5 - all the time' the extent to which each of 14 statements describes how the respondent has been feeling during the past 7 days (Hinds et al., 2007). The potential score range is 14-70; higher scores represent greater fatigue (Hinds et al., 2007). The scores (1 through 5) on the Likert-type scales for resource use and resource helpfulness were determined at each post baseline time point, as were change from baseline values for the FS-A. All FS-A change from baseline values, per Resource Use or Resource Helpfulness Categorization, were combined regardless of post-baseline time point.</description>

    <description>'Fatigue Facts &amp; Fixes' is an evidence based educational resource for adolescents with cancer. It is a bright colored laminated 8.5x11 double sided page. One side features information on cancer-related fatigue: &quot;Why am I so tired?&quot; (description of cancer-related fatigue); &quot;What causes fatigue?&quot; (contributing factors - environmental, personal/behavioral, cultural/family/other, and treatment-related); and &quot;What can help me to not be so tired?&quot; (alleviating factors - environmental, personal/behavioral, cultural/family/other, and treatment-related). The other side is a 'Do Not Disturb' sign with a pillow graphic which adolescents can use in the hospital or at home when they need some quiet time and which may also serve to attract their interest to the resource.</description>

          <description>'Fatigue Facts &amp; Fixes' is an evidence based educational resource for adolescents with cancer. It is a bright colored laminated 8.5x11 double sided page. One side features information on cancer-related fatigue: &quot;Why am I so tired?&quot; (description of cancer-related fatigue); &quot;What causes fatigue?&quot; (contributing factors - environmental, personal/behavioral, cultural/family/other, and treatment-related); and &quot;What can help me to not be so tired?&quot; (alleviating factors - environmental, personal/behavioral, cultural/family/other, and treatment-related). The other side is a 'Do Not Disturb' sign with a pillow graphic which adolescents can use in the hospital or at home when they need some quiet time and which may also serve to attract their interest to the resource.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Slow enrollment resulting in low accrual - only 15 participants rather than the 60 planned - therefore unable to complete analysis.</limitations_and_caveats>
