  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether HSCT from matched family or unrelated donors (MD) is equivalent to the
      HSCT from matched sibling donors (MSD). To evaluate the efficacy of HSCT from mismatched
      family or unrelated donors (MMD) as compared to HSCT from MSD/MD. To determine whether
      therapy has been carried out according to the main HSCT protocol recommendations. The
      standardisation of the treatment options during HSCT from different donor types aims at the
      achievement of an optimal comparison of survival after HSCT with survival after chemotherapy
      only. To prospectively evaluate and compare the incidence of acute and chronic GvHD after
      HSCT from MSD, from MD and from MMD.

    <intervention_name>Transplantation with Stem Cells from Umbilical Cord</intervention_name>
    <description>According to results from published experiences in children following suggestions are given:
Number of Cells:
Number of nucleated cells infused exceed 2,5x10*7/kg recipient BW or
Number of nucleated cells collected exceed 3x10*7/kg BW
Number of CD34+ cells infused exceed 2x10*5/kg Recipient BW
GVHD-prophylaxis:
• MSD: CSA 3 mg/kg as described in the protocol + Prednisolone 1 mg/kg (day O to day 15, then tapering until day 28)
• UD: as above + additional immunosuppression according to local protocols; ATG might increase risk of infectious complication and might be replaced by other drugs according to local protocols.
HLA-matching for unrelated CB: a matched UB is defined by 6/6 HLA matches (A, B antigenic medium resolution and DRB1 allelic) and allocate to the transplantation group &quot;MD&quot;. Less than 6/6 HLA matches allocate the patient to the &quot;MMD&quot; group.
If many choices available ABO- major incompatibility should be avoided.</description>
