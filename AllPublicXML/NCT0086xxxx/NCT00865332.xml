      Background:

        -  Brain imaging studies, genetic research, and investigations of stress have provided more
           information about the role of dopamine in processing reward and punishment, and in
           vulnerability to substance dependence. Researchers are interested in learning more about
           how the brain responds to rewards, including drugs of abuse, and how these responses may
           involve genetic factors or previous stressful events.

        -  Researchers intend to use the drug amphetamine to increase levels of dopamine in the
           brain and study the effects through two kinds of scanning: functional magnetic resonance
           imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET).

      Objectives:

        -  To examine the relationship among dopamine function, brain activity, reward processing,
           genetic profile and exposure to stress in normal healthy adults.

        -  To examine the variation in these factors between normal healthy adults and individuals
           with current cocaine-dependence.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals 18 to 45 years of age who are either current cocaine users or healthy
      volunteers with no history of substance abuse or dependence.

      Design:

        -  The study will consist of an initial evaluation session and six study visits, four of
           which will involve fMRI scans (3 hours each) and two of which will involve PET scans (8
           to 9 hours each).

        -  Cocaine-using participants will enter the inpatient clinical research ward at the
           National Institute on Drug Abuse Addiction Research Center the night before each
           scanning session and will be discharged the following day. Healthy volunteer subjects
           will not be required to stay overnight and will arrive as outpatients for the PET
           session. Participants will not be released until researchers have determined that
           participants are not experiencing significant effects of the drug.

        -  Initial session (1): Participants will complete questionnaires about past reactions to
           stressful situations, and will be trained to do thinking tasks that will be performed in
           fMRI visits. The tasks will be practiced in a mockup of an MRI machine.

        -  MRI sessions (2-5): Participants will receive either oral amphetamine or a placebo, and
           will perform thinking, short-term memory, and reward tasks during MRI scanning as
           directed by researchers.

        -  PET sessions (6-8): Participants will receive either oral amphetamine or a placebo, and
           will provide blood samples during the PET scanning sessions. Participants will have
           short breaks during the PET scanning sessions.

      Objective: This protocol will integrate functional brain imaging of reward processing,
      together with assessment of the response to oral dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH), monoaminergic
      genotyping, and evaluation of past exposure to stress, in order to examine: (1) the
      relationship between these factors (i.e. dopamine function, brain activity, reward
      processing, genetic profile and exposure to stress) in normal healthy adults; and (2)
      variation in these factors between normal healthy adults and individuals with current
      cocaine-dependence, and how this variation contributes to observed behavioral and functional
      differences between these populations.

      Study Population: The study populations will consist of adult (18-45 years old) healthy
      volunteers with no history of substance abuse or dependence and a matched group of
      individuals with current primary cocaine-dependence.

      Experimental Design and Method: After being medically cleared and giving informed consent,
      each participant will undergo fMRI (four sessions, on separate days) and PET scanning (two
      sessions, on separate days). All brain imaging sessions will take place after single-blind
      administration of either d-AMPH (0.43 mg/kg orally) or placebo. Functional MRI will commence
      after dosing and will include several measures (both cognitive and affective) designed to
      activate neural circuitry involved in the processing of reward and punishment. PET scanning
      will also take place after d-AMPH or placebo and will involve administration of the
      radioligand [18F] Fallypride to assess CNS dopamine function.

      Outcome Measures: This study is concerned with differences in the noted factors between
      experimental cohorts (controls vs. cocaine-dependent adults) and conditions (baseline vs.
      post d-AMPH). The primary outcome measures, used to ascertain these differences, will be: (1)
      the percentage change in fMRI BOLD signal during performance of measures of reward processing
      and cognitive function; (2) alterations or differences in the binding potential of
      [18F]Fallypride; (3) variations in genes related to DArgic function between individuals and
      groups, and the contribution of this variation to other outcome measures; and (4) history of
      exposure to stressful events and its role in behavioral and functional outcomes.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Aged between 18 - 45 years;

               2. In good health, based on history and physical examination; and

               3. Right-handed (as assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory; Oldfield,
                  1971)

        All participants in the cocaine group must meet DSM-IV criteria for cocaine dependence at
        the time of participation. Cocaine-dependent participants must also be positive for cocaine
        use in their urine toxicology screen.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Potential participants for either experimental group will be excluded from participation in
        this study according to the following criteria:

          1. Current drug use: Subjects may smoke regular cigarettes, use moderate amounts of
             alcohol and caffeine, or smoke an occasional marijuana cigarette. Moderate alcohol use
             is defined as for men, less than ten drinks and for women less than 7 drinks of liquor
             (1.5 oz) or the equivalent beer (12 oz) or wine (5 oz) per week. Moderate caffeine use
             is defined as less than 500 mg of caffeine per day, where one 5-oz serving of coffee
             and 2 12-oz servings of caffeinated soft drinks or tea each contain 100 mg. Occasional
             marijuana use is defined as less than or equal to 2 cigarettes/month. Participants may
             not use alcohol or marijuana for at least 24 hours prior to scanning, but will be
             allowed to smoke regular cigarettes according to their normal usage pattern.
             Participants who do not meet these guidelines for current drug use will not be allowed
             to participate in this study.

          2. Current or Past Medication Use: Volunteers may not currently use chronic (defined as
             daily for more than 10/14 days in the last month) prescription or over the counter
             medications that might interfere with the imaging signal (PET or MRI) or which may
             interact adversely with any of the substances being given in this protocol. This will
             include, but not be limited to, anti-hypertensive, anti-allergy, and pain medications.
             In addition, the use of psychotropic medications, particularly antidepressants or
             antipsychotic medication, will be exclusionary. Past use of antidepressant medication
             will be evaluated on a case by case basis; however, use of MAOI's within 14 days of
             AMPH administration will be exclusionary due to the possibility of precipitating
             hypertensive crisis. Over the counter or prescription medications may be used on an
             occasional basis (for example, for the treatment of self-limited conditions, such as
             occasional headache, musculoskeletal discomfort, allergic symptoms or pain), but
             medications which can interact with AMPH such as Vitamin C, L-glutamine, sodium
             bicarbonate, and sodium phosphate will be exclusionary. In addition, current use of
             over-the-counter estrogen-like compounds will be exclusionary for female participants.
             Subjects who have previously had significant exposure to medications that act on the
             DA system (antipsychotics, psychostimulants) will also be excluded from the study.

          3. CNS disease: History of known structural brain abnormalities (e.g. neoplasm,
             subarachnoid cysts), cerebrovascular disease, infectious disease (e.g. abscess),
             history of head trauma (defined as documented loss of consciousness &gt; 5 min or injury
             requiring hospitalization), history of seizures as an adult, sleep apnea, or tic
             disorder will all be exclusionary.

          4. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, or systemic disease: Repeated (measured on three separate
             occasions) diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg, or systolic blood pressure &gt; 135 mm
             Hg, known arrhythmia, symptomatic or known coronary artery disease; history of
             endocarditis, cerebral embolism, obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, active
             tuberculosis, known endocrine disease (derangements in adrenal, thyroid, bone or
             reproductive function), known chronic renal or hepatic dysfunction, known HIV
             seropositive, known current autoimmune disease involving the CNS, glaucoma, allergy to
             amphetamine, dextroamphetamine or known hypersensitivity to sympathomimetic amines.

          5. Female participants who are currently pregnant or nursing will not be allowed to
             participate in this study. Female subjects will be given a serum pregnancy test a
             maximum of 24 hours prior to each PET session and a urine pregnancy test on the day of
             each fMRI session.

          6. Radiation exposure: Any subject who has participated in any research studies in which
             he/she received a radiation exposure or has been exposed to radiation for medical or
             other purpose , which in combination with the present study would result in a total
             effective radiation exposure (from research studies) exceeding 5.0 rem in a year will
             be excluded.

          7. Children under the age of 18 will be excluded to avoid unnecessary exposure to
             radiation to this population.

          8. Presence in body of metallic implants or materials that could be moved by the magnet
             of the MRI scanner will exclude participants from this study. This will include, but
             not be limited to, pacemakers, surgical implants, aneurysm clips, dental braces, or
             bullet(s). A history of working with metal with consequent possible metal fragments in
             the body may also result in study exclusion.

          9. Miscellaneous exclusionary criteria: Body mass greater than 300 lbs. Hematocrit &lt;
             39.0% for males or &lt; 35.0% for females. Participants will also be excluded if veins
             are inaccessible.

         10. Claustrophobia will also serve as an exclusion criterion.

        Control Participants

        In addition to those criteria outlined above, potential control participants will be
        excluded if they meet the following criteria:

          1. Current or past psychiatric illness: DSM-IV criteria will be used (DSM-IV, APA, 1994)
             to determine this criterion. No subject with a current axis I diagnosis will be
             allowed to participate.

          2. History of Drug Abuse: Control volunteers reporting either current or a significant
             history of illicit drug abuse (defined as single illicit substance use of more than 30
             times in a lifetime for any given substance, except marijuana) will be excluded from
             the study.

          3. Positive urine toxicology screen for either amphetamines or cocaine prior to study
             participation.

        Cocaine-Dependent Subjects

        Candidates for the cocaine-dependent group will be excluded from the study if:

          1. They are actively seeking or engaged in substance abuse treatment.

          2. They are dependent on other substances except nicotine or cocaine at the time of
             participation.
