  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiple-center Phase 2 study designed to expand the patient safety and clinical
      information using 99m Tc-Ec-DG with Spect/CT imaging, to develop procedures and methods for
      evaluation of the imaging studies, to determine comparability of diagnostic information
      between SPECT and SPECT/CT imaging and to to compare the safety and efficacy of 99m Tc-EC-DG
      SPECT/CT with 18F-FDG PET/CT in imaging patients with biopsy confirmed diagnosis of Non-small
      Cell Lung Cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Male and female patients at least 18 years of age with untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
      who have non-incisional biopsy definitive evidence of disease (or from cytology results from
      a bronchoscope procedure) and who have been previously certified (per centers for Medicare
      and Medicaid Services requirements) by their physicians will be consented for the study. The
      study consists of a screening visit, gold-standard 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging followed by the
      investigational agent 99m Tc-Ec-DG SPECT/CT. The study procedures can be performed within 5-7
      days of signing the informed consent. [To better meet the standard of care at each clinical
      location, the PET/CT can be performed as part of pre-study procedures on a PET/CT camera
      previously qualified by the site to meet the standards required for the study. If this
      occurs, the SPECT/CT must be performed within 45 days of the PET/CT imaging procedures.]
      Patients will be seen 24 hours after the 99m Tc-Ec-DG injection for safety. A 21-day
      follow-up period (after the SPECT/CT image) will allow the investigator to acquire additional
      imaging, surgical, pathology and treatment documentation. [An actual patient visit is NOT
      required at the 21-day follow-up time point.]

          -  Undergoing any current treatment for cancer (radiation therapy, surgery or
             chemotherapy);

          -  Diabetic with insulin dependence (Patients who have a known insulin dependence for
             diabetes can be included in the study if the standard of care protocol in place at the
             clinical site provides for the management of the patient's glucose level sufficiently
             to allow the PET/CT imaging to be performed. The same glucose management used for the
             PET/CT imaging should be applied to the SPECT/CT imaging procedures. A waiver will be
             required to be completed by the clinical site and approved by the sponsor or designee;

          -  Patient weight above the SPECT/CT and PET/CT table weight limit;

             study (males and females);

          -  Known hypersensitivity to EC-DG or FDG or similar compounds including any of the
             inactive ingredients;

             partners);

          -  Clinically significant mental illness (to be determined by the Investigator);

          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within 30 days prior to screening visit or
             participating in an ongoing clinical study (this criteria can be overruled by the
             Principal Investigator with appropriate documentation of the reason for the
             exception);

          -  Patient has a condition the Investigator believes would interfere with the ability to
             provide informed consent or comply with study instructions, or that might confound the
             interpretation of the study results or put the patient at undue risk.
