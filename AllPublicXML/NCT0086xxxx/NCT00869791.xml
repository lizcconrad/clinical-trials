    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, multicenter, open-label, single and multiple oral dose, two-treatment,
      two-period, crossover study in LD-experienced subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      Subjects received 7 days of one treatment (IPX066 or IR CD-LD) followed by an approximate
      7-day washout period followed by another 7 days of the other treatment (IR CD-LD or IPX066).
      During the approximate 7-day washout period, subjects took their prestudy CD-LD regimen.
      Pharmacokinetic and efficacy/pharmacodynamic measurements were done on Days 1 and 8. Safety
      measures (electrocardiograms [ECGs], clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, adverse events
      [AEs], and concomitant medications) were evaluated over the course of the study.

    <measure>8-Hour Efficacy Using Day 1 Tapping</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment period - three times prior to dosing in the clinic, and at half-hour intervals through the 8-hour measurement period</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in &quot;Tapping: has been used as a surrogate endpoint for assessing subject being &quot;On&quot;. Finger Tapping: the number of times the subject could tap two counter keys 20 cm apart alternately in 1 minute with the most affected arm assessed every 30 minutes on Day 1. Subjects performed the 60-second tapping measurement three times prior to dosing in the clinic, and at half-hour intervals through the 8-hour measurement period on Day 1 of each treatment period. More hours &quot;On&quot; during treatment represented better outcome. For the Tapping measurement, the protocol defined a 20% change from the average of the predose measurements as the time to &quot;On.&quot; Each half-hour interval counted as 0.5 hour. Any measurement below a 20% improvement was considered time &quot;Not On.&quot; If patient required redosing then primary analyses adjusted for redosing in calculating the results.</description>

    <measure>8-Hour Efficacy Using Day 1 Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre dosing and at hourly intervals through the 8-hour measurement period on day 1</time_frame>
    <description>To determine efficacy on Day 1 the UPDRS (unified Parkinson's disease rating) Part III score, a clinician-scored measure of motor function, was collected immediately predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h post dose. The UPDRS Part III motor exam analyzes multiple motor functions like speech, facial expression, tremor, rigidity, movement, posture, gait etc. Each parameter is assigned values from 0 to 4, with 0 being normal and 4 being the most affected. The total range is 0 - 108, with lower scores indicating a better outcome.The average of post dose was calculated for day 1.</description>

    <measure>Result Summary of Day 1 Dyskinesia Evaluated by Investigator Assessment for Each Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose and then every 30 min upto 8 h after dosing on Day of 1 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>To determine 8h efficacy on Day 1 the on site investigator assessments of &quot;ON&quot;, &quot;OFF&quot; and &quot;state of dyskinesia&quot; for each subject was collected predose (-1, -0.5, and 0 hours) every 30 min for up to 8 hours after dosing . For all subjects duration of (1) OFF time (2) ON time without dyskinesia, (3) ON time with non-troublesome dyskinesia and (4) ON time with troublesome dyskinesia was calculated for both treatments. Definition of &quot;ON&quot; was based on a 20% change from predose measure, and the results were analyzed in the standard manner of a two way crossover design. The trial inclusion criteria included ability of subject to differentiate &quot;ON&quot; state from &quot;OFF&quot; state per investigator's assessment.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetics Measurements to Determine Cmax for Carbidopa (CD) and Levodopa (LD) Plasma Concentrations From Samples Collected Pre-dose and at Different Time Points on Day 1 and Day 8 of Periods 1 and 2 of Both Treatment Arms.</title>
        <description>For both treatment arms: Sequence 1 (IPX066, Washout, then IR CD-LD) and Sequence 2 (IR CD-LD, Washout, IPX066), blood samples for measurement of LD and CD plasma concentrations were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after dosing on Day 1 (referred to as Single-Dose data); and at pre-dose, 0.5, 1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 hours after dosing on Day 8 (referred to as Multiple-Dose data). Maximum (peak) drug concentration (Cmax in nanograms/milliliter) was estimated using Single-Dose data and Multiple-Dose data.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 and on Day 8 after a week of intervention in each treatment arm: Arm 1 (IPX066 first, washout, then CD-LD IR) and Arm 2 (CD-LD IR first, washout, then IPX066)</time_frame>
        <population>The study was designed to assess the single and multiple-dose PK and PD of IPX066 and IR CD-LD in subjects with advanced PD.14 subjects first received IPX066 (Period 1), then IR CD-LD (Period 2). 13 Subjects first received IR CD-LD (Period 1), then IPX066 (Period 2).

        <title>Pharmacokinetics Measurements to Determine Area Under the Concentration-time Curve for the Dosing Interval for LD and CD Concentrations From Blood Collected Pre-dose and at Different Time Points on Day 1 and Day 8 of Periods 1 and 2 of Treatment Arms.</title>
        <description>For both treatment arms: Sequence 1 (IPX066, Washout, then IR CD-LD) and Sequence 2 (IR CD-LD, Washout, IPX066), blood samples for measurement of LD and CD plasma concentrations were collected pre-dose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, and 8 hours after dosing on Day 1 (referred to as Single-Dose data); and at pre-dose, 0.5, 1,1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 hours after dosing on Day 8 (referred to as Multiple-Dose data). Area under the concentration-time curve for the dosing interval (AUC Tau) in hour*nanogram/milliliter was estimated using Single-Dose data and Multiple-Dose data.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 and on Day 8 after a week of intervention in each treatment arm: Arm 1 (IPX066 first, washout, then CD-LD IR) and Arm2 (CD-LD IR first, washout, then IPX066</time_frame>
        <population>The study was designed to assess the single and multiple-dose PK and PD of IPX066 and IR CD-LD in subjects with advanced PD. 14 subjects first received IPX066 (Period 1), then IR CD-LD (Period 2). 13 Subjects first received IR CD-LD (Period 1), then IPX066 (Period 2). All 27 subjects that were treated in the study were included in the PK analyses.</population>

        <title>8-Hour Efficacy Using Day 1 Tapping</title>
        <description>Improvement in &quot;Tapping: has been used as a surrogate endpoint for assessing subject being “On&quot;. Finger Tapping: the number of times the subject could tap two counter keys 20 cm apart alternately in 1 minute with the most affected arm assessed every 30 minutes on Day 1. Subjects performed the 60-second tapping measurement three times prior to dosing in the clinic, and at half-hour intervals through the 8-hour measurement period on Day 1 of each treatment period. More hours “On” during treatment represented better outcome. For the Tapping measurement, the protocol defined a 20% change from the average of the predose measurements as the time to “On.” Each half-hour interval counted as 0.5 hour. Any measurement below a 20% improvement was considered time “Not On.” If patient required redosing then primary analyses adjusted for redosing in calculating the results.</description>

        <description>To determine efficacy on Day 1 the UPDRS (unified Parkinson's disease rating) Part III score, a clinician-scored measure of motor function, was collected immediately predose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h post dose. The UPDRS Part III motor exam analyzes multiple motor functions like speech, facial expression, tremor, rigidity, movement, posture, gait etc. Each parameter is assigned values from 0 to 4, with 0 being normal and 4 being the most affected. The total range is 0 - 108, with lower scores indicating a better outcome.The average of post dose was calculated for day 1.</description>

        <description>To determine 8h efficacy on Day 1 the on site investigator assessments of &quot;ON&quot;, &quot;OFF&quot; and &quot;state of dyskinesia&quot; for each subject was collected predose (-1, -0.5, and 0 hours) every 30 min for up to 8 hours after dosing . For all subjects duration of (1) OFF time (2) ON time without dyskinesia, (3) ON time with non-troublesome dyskinesia and (4) ON time with troublesome dyskinesia was calculated for both treatments. Definition of “ON” was based on a 20% change from predose measure, and the results were analyzed in the standard manner of a two way crossover design. The trial inclusion criteria included ability of subject to differentiate “ON” state from “OFF” state per investigator’s assessment.</description>
