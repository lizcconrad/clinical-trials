  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic ulcers are common sequelae of leprosy. The objectives of this study are to
      analyze the clinic-epidemiological characteristics of patients attended at one specialized
      dressing service from a leprosy-endemic region of the Brazilian Amazon and to evaluate the
      effect of Low Level Laser Therapy on wound healing of these patients.

    <intervention_name>Low level laser therapy (LLLT)</intervention_name>
    <description>The LLLT equipment was an indium-gallium-aluminnium-phosphide (InGaAlP) semiconductor laser with a maximum output power of 40 mW, continuous radiation emission of visible red light with 660 nm wavelength (+/- 10 nm) and a spot area of 0.04 cm². The energy density used was 4 J per point in the wound edges and 2 J/cm² in the wound bed with a power density of 1 W/cm2.
Wound beds were irradiated using a scanning technique with no direct contact.</description>
