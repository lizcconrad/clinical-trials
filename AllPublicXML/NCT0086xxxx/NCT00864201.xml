    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this exploratory study are to evaluate the effects of bosentan on
      hemodynamics (via cardiac catheterization) during exercise in patients with Pulmonary
      Arterial Hypertension (PAH) who have abnormal hemodynamics during exercise but normal
      hemodynamics at rest. The authors hypothesize that early treatment may change the course of
      disease progression by improving hemodynamics during exercise, thus delaying disease
      progression.
