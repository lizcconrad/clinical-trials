        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Healthy subjects at least 18 years of age.

          2. Availability of the subject for the entire study period and willingness to provide
             written informed consent after being informed of the nature of the study.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2 (calculated using the BMI Calculator on
             the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] website available at
             http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/index.htm, last accessed 19 Mar 07) and a weight
             of at least 110 pounds.

          4. Good health as determined by a lack of clinically significant abnormalities in health
             assessments performed at Screening, as judged by the physician.

          5. Females were required to use a medically acceptable method of hormonal contraception
             or abstinence throughout the entire study period and for one week after the study is
             completed

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Hypersensitivity to nabumetone (Nabumetone) or related compounds.

          2. Conditions that affected the absorption, metabolism, or passage of drugs out of the
             body (eg, sprue, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, colitis, liver, kidney, or thyroid
             conditions).

          3. Recent history (within 1 year) of mental illness, drug addiction, drug abuse, or
             alcoholism.

          4. A hematocrit value of ≤ 33.0% for females and ≤ 37.0% for males.

          5. Donation of &gt; 500 mL of blood in the past 8 weeks prior to study drug dosing or
             difficulty in donating blood.

          6. Receipt of an investigational drug within the 4 weeks prior to study drug dosing.

          7. Currently taking any systemic prescription medications, excluding hormone
             contraceptives, within the 7 days prior to study dosing or over-the-counter medication
             within 3 days of study dosing. This prohibition did not include vitamins or herbal
             preparations taken as nutritional supplements for non-therapeutic indications, as
             judged by the attending physician.

             Any nonprescription medication consumption reported was to be reviewed by the
             investigator prior to dosing. At the discretion of the investigator, these volunteers
             could be enrolled if the medication was not anticipated to alter study integrity.

          8. Regular smoking of more than 5 cigarettes weekly or the regular daily use of
             nicotinecontaining products beginning 3 months before study drug administration
             through the final evaluation.

          9. Female subjects who were lactating or had a positive pregnancy test at Screening and
             prior to each of the treatment periods.

         10. Alcohol, grapefruit beverages or foods, caffeine, or xanthine beverages or foods
             beginning 48 hours before each study drug administration through the last
             pharmacokinetic (PK) sample of each treatment period. Such restricted items included
             coffee, tea, iced tea, Coke®, Pepsi®, Mountain Dew®, chocolate, brownies, etc.

         11. Regular use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (examples
             include barbiturates, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenylhydantoins, phenothiazines,
             cimetidine, omeprazole, macrolides, imidazoles, fluoroquinolones) within 30 days prior
             to study drug administration.

         12. Positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg), and hepatitis C antibody at Screening.

         13. Positive test results for drugs of abuse or pregnancy at Screening and prior to each
             study drug dosing period. Any deviation from these inclusion and exclusion criteria
             must have been approved by the investigator and/or the sponsor on a case-by-case basis
             prior to enrollment of the subject. The protocol deviation waiver must have been
             documented by the investigator and/or the sponsor.

        No subject was allowed to enroll in this study more than once.
