    <textblock>
      This study will compare radiosurgery (focused radiation, Gamma Knife Radiosurgery) with
      temporal lobectomy (standard surgical care) as a treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy.
      Patients who have seizures that begin in their temporal lobe that are not controlled with
      medications into the trial will be offered entry. Patients with a high likelihood of having
      their seizures controlled with open surgery will have treatment randomized between the
      standard surgery and radiosurgery. A prior study has shown that focused radiation
      (radiosurgery) may also reduce or eliminate seizures arising from the temporal lobe. The main
      study hypothesis is that radiosurgery is as safe and effective as temporal lobectomy in
      treating patients with seizures arising from the medial temporal lobe.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Gamma Knife radiosurgery with
      temporal lobectomy in the treatment of patients with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy.
      Aim 1 is designed to compare the seizure-free outcomes and morbidity of radiosurgery for
      patients with drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy with those of open temporal lobectomy.
      Our primary hypothesis is that radiosurgery will be non-inferior to lobectomy with respect to
      seizure-free rates at 25-36 months following therapy (one-year of seizure freedom beginning 2
      years after treatment).

      Aim 2 is designed to compare the neuropsychological outcomes in patients undergoing
      radiosurgery and temporal lobe surgery, in particular with respect to verbal memory function
      for language-dominant hemisphere treated patients. Our hypothesis is that patients treated
      for speech-dominant temporal lobe seizures with temporal lobectomy will show greater
      reduction in verbal memory than patients treated with radiosurgery.

      Aim 3 is designed to determine what changes occur in the quality of life of patients with
      temporal lobe epilepsy following radiosurgical treatment as compared with open surgery. Our
      primary hypothesis is that there will be improvements (comparing baseline with 3 years
      post-treatment) in quality of life measures in both groups. Our secondary hypothesis is that
      both open surgery and radiosurgery subjects will undergo transient reductions in quality of
      life measures caused by treatment effects during the first year following treatment, but that
      quality of life will improve for subjects who become seizure-free, independent of treatment
      group.

      Aim 4 is designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of radiosurgery compared with open
      surgery. Specifically, the marginal cost-utility ratio will fall below $50,000/QALY, a
      threshold thought to indicate that outcomes are considered worth the cost.

    <description>The stereotaxic frame will be secured to the skull with four pins. Patients will be taken to the MRI unit and receive a stereotaxic MRI. MRI data will be transferred to the Gamma Knife computer. Each patient will receive radiation to the mesial temporal lobe during a single treatment session. The amygdala and anterior 2cm of the hippocampus as well as the immediately adjacent parahippocampal gyrus will be included in the radiosurgical target. Patients will receive 24Gy to the 50% isodose line using an unlimited number of isocenters. The brainstem and optic nerve plus chiasm will receive less than 10 Gy and 8 Gy, respectively. After treatment, the stereotaxic frame will be removed from the patient's head.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:

        Adults (18 years and older) of either gender who would otherwise be eligible for temporal
        lobe resection will be offered enrollment for randomization to RS or ATL.

          1. Seizure type: Patients must have simple and/or complex partial seizures with or
             without secondary generalization.

          2. Seizure Frequency: Patients must have at least 3 complex partial seizures during the 3
             month (12 week) baseline seizure diary period with at least 1 of 3 seizures occurring
             within the last 2 months (8 weeks).

          3. Patients with electrographic evidence of seizures arising from one temporal lobe, with
             radiographic evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis in the same temporal lobe will be
             included. Patients with normal MRIs, bilateral hippocampal damage, or cortical lesion
             will be excluded.

          4. Subjects should be on stable doses of antiepileptic medications for at least 3 months
             prior to treatment.

          5. All female patients of childbearing age will have documented that they are using a
             safe and effective means of birth control and will have a negative urine pregnancy
             test completed within 1 week prior to their treatment.

          6. Patients should be able to understand the potential benefits and risks of this therapy
             and be able to understand the protocol and sign their own consent forms. For these
             reasons, only patients 18 years and older and with I.Q. greater than or equal to 70
             will be included.

          7. Patients with any focal neurologic deficit that would make it difficult to detect a
             new radiation-associated injury will be excluded. All patients will receive formal
             visual field testing (Humphrey) and patients with visual field deficits will be
             excluded.

          8. Patients with radiographic evidence of other pathologies such as vascular
             malformations or tumors will be excluded.

          9. Patients with diabetes mellitus or hypertension will be excluded from this study
             because radiation injury to the brain is more common in these patients.

         10. Subjects should not have significant psychiatric conditions that would make accurate
             assessment of seizure frequency difficult, as judged by the principal investigator.
             Such conditions include a history of non-epileptic seizures, psychosis (other than
             post-ictal psychosis) and severe mood disorders including suicide attempt within past
             12 months or noncompliance with psychotropic medications.

         11. Patients with a history of significant past or present medical disorders determined
             severe enough to prevent participation in a surgical trial by the principal
             investigator are excluded.

         12. Patients with any progressive neurological disorder (such as multiple sclerosis or
             systemic lupus erythematosis) are excluded.

         13. Patients with a history of poor compliance with past antiepileptic drug therapy as
             judged by the principal investigator are excluded.

         14. Patients with a recent history of abusing drugs or alcohol with significance as judged
             by the principal investigator are excluded.

         15. Patients who are receiving any investigational drugs at the time of enrollment are
             excluded.

         16. Patients with current use of vigabatrin are excluded. Past use does not exclude a
             patient pending a normal formal visual field test.

         17. Patients with currently functioning vagal nerve stimulators (VNS) are excluded. Past
             use does not exclude a patient as long as the device is explanted. Indwelling VNS
             electrodes are permitted in agreement with each center's policies on brain MRI
             imaging.

         18. Patients who can not be anticipated to participate for the full 36 months of the trial
             will be excluded.

         19. Native English speakers from the U.S. or other English speaking countries or patients
             who learned English before age 5 and were educated in English. Spanish speaking
             patients can be included as long as the study site can provide an officially
             translated (IRB approved) consent form in Spanish. Non-Spanish speaking patients with
             English as a second language (ESL) and/or non-English and non-Spanish speaking
             patients can be included only under the following conditions: 1) the study site must
             be able to have the consent form translated into the patient's native language using
             an official translator, and 2) the study site's neuropsychologist must be willing and
             able to assess the patient at baseline and post-treatment at 12, 24, and 36 months in
             that patient's native language to ensure the patient's safety.
