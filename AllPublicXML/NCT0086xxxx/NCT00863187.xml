      Background:

      The ability of the immune system to function declines with aging. This is reflected by a
      marked decrease in the responsiveness to vaccinations and to infectious agents.
      Consequentially, there is a profound reduction in the quality of live and an increased
      dependency on the health systems. Studies have shown that the production of B lymphocytes in
      the bone marrow declines with aging and long-lived B cells accumulate in the periphery. Thus,
      instead of a juvenile repertoire of B cells that is capable to recognize any new pathogen,
      the repertoire of the elderly becomes more restricted and fails to respond to new antigens.

      Working hypothesis and aims: We hypothesize that the dramatic change in the cellular
      composition in aging reflects homeostasis pressures that are set by long-lived peripheral B
      cells. Here, the investigators hypothesize that altering the homeostasis, by active depletion
      of the peripheral B cells, will revive B lymphopoiesis in the BM and rejuvenate the
      peripheral repertoire of B cells in aging. Consequentially, this will significantly improve
      immune responsiveness of aged individuals to new antigenic challenges.

      Methods:

      The investigators propose a parallel study in human and mouse. For our clinical study we will
      use old lymphoma patients that were treated with the B cell depleting therapy, RITUXIMAB, for
      transient B cell depletion and established full B cell reconstitution. We will test the
      responsiveness of these patients to hepatitis B vaccine and compare it to aged-matched
      control group. The investigators will also use old human CD20 transgenic mice where B cell
      depletion is imposed by anti human CD20 antibodies. In these experiments we will study
      physiological and immunological changes to understand aging mechanisms in the B lineage.

      Expected results: We expect that old patients treated for B cell depletion will have an
      increased responsiveness to the hepatitis B vaccine relative to the control group.

      Importance:

      The investigators propose an efficient approach to improve immune response in the elderly
      population. This will increase efficacy of vaccination, reduce morbidity and improve quality
      of life. It will also reduce the cost of medical treatment. In addition, this study will show
      that senescence in the B lineage can be reversed, which is in contrast to the general
      concepts of aging.

      Probable implications to the welfare and health of the aged population Medicine:

      Improving the immune competence will increase efficacy of vaccination, reduce morbidity, and
      reduce dependency on health systems. This will significantly improve the quality of life.
