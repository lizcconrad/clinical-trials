    <textblock>
      This is a single center open label phase II study of lenalidomide in IPSS Int-1 with
      increased blasts or hematologic needs with 5q31.1 deletions who have failed to respond to
      standard dose lenalidomide., IPSS Int-1 with increased blasts or hematologic needs without
      5q31.1 deletions, and Int-2 and high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with or
      without 5q31.1 deletions, regardless of whether they have received lenalidomide previously or
      not. Patients will receive two cycles of 50 mg daily lenalidomide given on days 1-28 out of a
      42 day cycle. Within each of the two cycles of lenalidomide, patients will be given up to
      three weeks with no drug treatment to recover. Patients who fail to respond after two cycles
      of treatment may receive two additional cycles if stable. Patients who develop clinical
      response may continue to receive drug until disease progression.

    <description>Patients diagnosed with high risk Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), regardless of 5q deletion status, will receive lenalidomide, 50mg/day orally, on days 1-28 of a 42 day cycle for 2 cycles. At this point, patients meeting protocol specified response criteria will proceed to Continuing Therapy on a reduced dose of lenalidomide until progression.
Patients not achieving response will receive 2 additional cycles of treatment, whereupon response will again be assessed. Patients achieving response at this point will proceed to Continuing Therapy as described.
Patients without evidence of response after 4 cycles will be taken off-study.</description>

          -  MDS or MDS/AML

          -  Patients must not have received any other treatment for their disease, including
             hematopoietic growth factors, within three weeks of beginning the trial

          -  ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 at study entry

          -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory REMS® program, and be
             willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®.

          -  Patients must have no clinical evidence of CNS or pulmonary leukostasis, disseminated
             intravascular coagulation, or CNS leukemia.

          -  Subjects must agree to use appropriate contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females. (Lactating females must agree not to breast feed
             while taking lenalidomide).

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study.

          -  Use of any other experimental drug or therapy within 21 days of baseline.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide.

          -  Concurrent use of other anti-cancer agents or treatments.

          -  Patients may not have received prior AML induction chemotherapy or stem cell
             transplant. However, patients with secondary MDS who have received a stem cell
             transplant for other indications (eg lymphoma, multiple myeloma) will be eligible.
