      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Beclomethasone
      Dipropionate/Formoterol single inhaler in a twice daily regimen in patients with mild to
      moderate persistent asthma. Patients are randomised to receive either Beclomethasone
      Dipropionate/ formoterol single inhaler (total daily dose : BDP/FF 400/24 µg) or
      Beclomethasone CFC (total daily dose : BDP 1000 µg) during 12 weeks of treatment.
