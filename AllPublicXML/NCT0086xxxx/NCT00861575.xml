      This is a continuous blood banking study that will archive plasma and blood permitting DNA
      and plasma analysis at a future date. Subjects are recruited at the time of a clinically
      required procedure and blood samples are collected and banked and used for future research.
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the interaction of multiple phenotypes and
      genotypes and their impact on cardiovascular disease events and measures of atherosclerosis
      progression.
