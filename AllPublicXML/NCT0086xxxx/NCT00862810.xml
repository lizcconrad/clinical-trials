      To determine if delayed dosing of recombinant human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent (Types
      6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccine in 9-18 year old girls elicits an equivalent immune response
      (geometric mean titers to HPV 6,11,16, and 18 as measured one month after receipt of a 3rd
      dose of HPV vaccine) when compared to vaccine delivered according to the recommended dosing
      schedule. This is a prospective observational study of healthy 9-18 year old female patients
      receiving either a second or third dose of HPV vaccine as part of their well child care.
      Immune responses to HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 will be measured both before and 1 month after
      the third dose of HPV vaccine with the purpose of comparing the immune responses to HPV
      vaccine when administered at naturally occurring longer dosing intervals to the immune
      response to HPV vaccine when administered as routinely recommended.

      Girls receiving a 3rd dose of HPV vaccine in addition to concomitantly administered vaccines
      by injection were randomized to receive either the HPV vaccine first or their concomitantly
      administered vaccines first. Pain following vaccination was assessed in each arm using the
      Faces Pain Scale - Revised.

      Please note: This record refers only to the randomized portion of the study where pain
      following vaccination was assessed. Please refer to NCT02280642 for the observational portion
      of the study.

    <description>Participants with Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) score higher in arm where HPV received compared to arm where concomitant vaccines received.
The Faces Pain Scale Revised is a dimensionless 10 point likert scale used to assess self-reported pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most pain you can imagine). Greater pain scores are indicative of more severe pain.</description>

        <title>Pain Following HPV Vaccine</title>
        <description>Participants with Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) score higher in arm where HPV received compared to arm where concomitant vaccines received.
The Faces Pain Scale Revised is a dimensionless 10 point likert scale used to assess self-reported pain intensity on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most pain you can imagine). Greater pain scores are indicative of more severe pain.</description>
