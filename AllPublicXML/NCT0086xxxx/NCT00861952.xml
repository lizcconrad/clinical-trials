  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of Neuragen (a natural health product
      oil rubbed into the skin) is effective at reducing pain and improving the quality of life in
      people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of diabetic neuropathy and development of diabetic ulcers varies based on the
      severity (lack of blood sugar control) and duration of diabetes. Estimates of rates of
      occurrence vary although one prospective study showed 7.2% of newly diagnosed ulcer-free
      diabetics developed ulcers within one year of being diagnosed. Current treatment initiatives
      aimed at educating diabetic patients on how to prevent diabetic ulcers and mange peripheral
      neuropathy have had varied success. Chronic pain is the number one reason that this
      population seeks help from medical professionals. Diabetics are particularly predisposed to a
      potentially disabling form of chronic pain known as peripheral neuropathy. In fact, over 50%
      of diabetics have painful neuropathy, or will develop this condition. Other than the primary
      goal of addressing blood sugar levels, conventional treatment of diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy involves prescription gabapentanoids or opiod analgesics, both of which have
      considerable cost and may be associated with side effects from long-term use and overall
      limited success rates. Neuragen is an over-the-counter natural health product that may be a
      safe and effective treatment option for this disease. Using a randomized double-blind placebo
      control clinical trial the effects of Neuragen on pain, function and quality of life will be
      assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women of at least 18 years of age

          -  Established diagnosis of neuropathic pain for at least the past 3 months duration, and
             type 1 or type 2 diabetes, confirmed by primary care physician and/or neurologist. By
             signing the informed consent, participants agree to have the study coordinator contact
             their physician for confirmation of diagnosis.

          -  Pain of at least level 4 on a 0-10 scale, and not over 9, despite other treatments on
             intake.

          -  Presence of dynamic tactile allodynia or pinprick hyperalgesia

          -  Normal cognitive and communication skills (as judged by investigator) and ability to
             complete self-report questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Previous or continuing use of NeuragenÂ®

          -  Evidence of other types of pain as, or more severe, than the pain under study

          -  Major psychological conditions requiring treatment

          -  History of eczema/atopy/anaphylaxis or unusual skin reactions. This will be assessed
             using a subjective question (Have you ever suffered from eczema? Or experienced a skin
             reaction to a substance? Or experienced an anaphylactic reaction?)

          -  Self reported sensitivity to perfumes, essential oils, odors.

          -  Changes to current pain management regime within the previous month prior to start of
