  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      This study is a prospective clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of a chitosan-coated
      nasal packing (ChitoFlex® used in conjunction with the HemCon Nasal Plug) in the management
      of difficult spontaneous epistaxis and to evaluate its healing effect on nasal mucosa.

      The introduction of products that enhances hemostasis can have clinical advantages when
      associated with traditional nasal packing. These advantages include a better hemostatic
      control and the reduction of nasal packing duration. Furthermore, this study will help
      determine if there are any non-desirable effects that chitosan may have on the nasal cavity,
      such as the production of fibrosis and foreign body reaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epistaxis is a common reason for emergency department visits and otolaryngology referral.
      Management methods of epistaxis include nasal packing, chemical or electric cauterization,
      and arterial ligation or embolization.

      There are numerous nasal packing products available in the market, and are used to stop or
      prevent nasal bleeding. The ideal nasal pack should be efficient in controlling bleeding,
      have antimicrobial properties and be well tolerated. Currently, there is no perfect nasal
      pack, but some are closer to ideal than others. Nasal packs can be classified into
      non-absorbable and absorbable nasal packs.

      Recently, a new hemostatic product has been introduced in the market, and used as a military
      wound bandages, the ChitoFlex®. ChitoFlex® is made of chitosan, a naturally occurring,
      bio-compatible polysaccharide. Because chitosan has a positive charge, it attracts red blood
      cells, which have a negative charge. The red blood cells create a seal over the wound as they
      are drawn into the bandage, forming a very tight, coherent seal. The ChitoFlex® -dressing has
      been demonstrated by AATCC Test Method 100-2004, Evaluation of Antibacterial Finishes
      (Technical Manual of the America Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists) as an
      antibacterial barrier in laboratory testing with a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative
      bacterial organisms.

          <title>Epistaxis Group</title>
          <description>Subjects presenting with epistaxis that have not been controlled by traditional nasal packing, or that recurred immediately upon removal of the nasal packing will be included in this study. Subject will be evaluated during the packing period to determine the effect of hemostasis. Chitosan coated packing will be removed after 48 hours. Subjects' nasal cavities will be examined endoscopically to evaluate bleeding control, morphological changes induced by the chitosan coated packing.
One week after the removal of the packing, the patients will be endoscopically examined to assess the healing of the packed area, to monitor control of bleeding, and observe any potential delayed reaction to the packing material.</description>
