      The aims of the investigators' study are to characterize the nature of constipation in
      idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and to evaluate the usefulness of biofeedback therapy in
      constipated IPD patients.

    <textblock>
      The medical treatment of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) alleviates constipation
      symptoms due to the restoration of autonomic dysfunction. However, additional laxatives are
      usually needed in these patients. Other suppository treatments included stool softeners,
      dopamine-receptor agonists, botulinum toxins, and prokinetic medications such as tegaserod.
      Biofeedback therapy (BFT) has been the gold standard for functional constipation with
      dyssynergic defecation or rectal hyposensitivity. However, researchers have not tried to
      evaluate its usefulness in constipated IPD patients up to now. The aims of our study are to
      characterize the nature of constipation in IPD and to evaluate the usefulness of BFT in
      constipated IPD patients.
