    <textblock>
      Tumor patients receiving conventional tumor therapies are included into this study. The
      patients are randomized into two groups receiving either additive homeopathic therapy or not.
      Two questionnaires referring to subjective feeling and life quality are filled out by the
      patients with each visit to the outpatients Department. One of them is the QLQC30
      questionnaire of the EORTC. The results of the questionnaires of the two groups are compared.

      Quality of life is an important issue for cancer patients, especially during the periods of
      chemotherapy and radiation. Preliminary results have revealed positive effects of add-on
      homeopathy on quality of life as well as subjective well-being. Patients are receiving
      classical homeopathy with administration of either globules and/or dilutions. With each
      appointment, patients complete two questionnaires.
