  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and test an educational intervention for dementia in
      primary care, combining timely diagnosis, psychosocial support around the period of diagnosis
      and management concordant with guidelines.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dementia presents many challenges for primary care. Early diagnosis is important as this
      allows those with dementia and their family care networks to engage with support services and
      plan for the future. These actions can relieve the significant psychological distress that
      people with dementia and close supporters may experience , and provide knowledge about the
      availability of medical and psycho-social support that can improved functioning and morale

      The main efforts to improve the identification and diagnosis of dementia should logically be
      targeted at primary care as this is the first point of contact for most individuals and their
      carers when faced with experiences of 'ill health'. There is, however, evidence that dementia
      remains under-detected and sub-optimally managed in general practice . An educational
      intervention that could enhance clinical practice, improving the skills of practitioners in
      the recognition of and response to dementia syndromes, could therefore be beneficial to
      people with dementia and their families, and potentially to health and social services.

Tailoring of the education programme is carried out in a three step process: 1) an educational needs analysis is carried our using a standard checklist to identify aspects of dementia care which the practice perceives as problematic for them; 2) a prescription for education is then written to address shortcomings; 3) the best forms of learning are then identified.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with memory or other cognitive impairments suggestive of dementia syndrome

          -  those with a formal diagnosis of dementia, of any type.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients and carers who are already involved in concurrent research

          -  If the key professional feels that an approach to the person with dementia or their
             carer would be inappropriate, for example the dementia is very severe, or that an
             approach may increase distress

          -  and any other important reason that the key professional may have for why the person
             with dementia or their carer should not be contacted.
