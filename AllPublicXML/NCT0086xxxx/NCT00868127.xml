    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term safety of lapaquistat acetate, once
      daily (QD), as monotherapy or in combination with other lipid-lowering agents in Subjects
      with Hypercholesterolemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elevated plasma cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) and various other plasma lipid imbalances
      (dyslipidemias) are major risk factors for coronary heart disease. Normally, the balance
      among cholesterol synthesis, dietary intake, and degradation is adequate to maintain healthy
      cholesterol plasma levels. However, in patients with hypercholesterolemia, elevation in
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol leads to atherosclerotic deposition of cholesterol in the
      arterial walls. Consequently, it has been established that lowering the low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduces cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. As a result of this finding, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
      Treatment Panel III identifies control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as essential in
      the prevention and management of coronary heart disease. Additional lipid risk factors
      designated by Adult Treatment Panel III include elevated triglycerides, elevated non-high
      density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
      Lipoproteins rich in triglycerides, such as very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, appear
      to contribute to atherosclerosis, whereas the apparent protective effect of high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol may be limited at low density lipoprotein concentrations.

      Lapaquistat acetate is a squalene synthase inhibitor currently under development at Takeda
      for the treatment of dyslipidemia.

      Participants in this study have primary hypercholesterolemia and have completed either the
      12-week monotherapy protocol 01-04-TL-475-008 (NCT00143663) or the 24-week atorvastatin
      add-on study 01-04-TL-475-009 (NCT00143676).
