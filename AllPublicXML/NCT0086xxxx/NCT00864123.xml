      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven efficacy for treatment of pediatric
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, CBT does not help all children and those who
      benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion. Recent clinical trials in adults
      with other anxiety disorders (acrophobia and social phobia) provided support for using a
      medication called D-Cycloserine (DCS) to enahnce the outcome of exposure-based psychotherapy.
      Given this, DCS may augment CBT in youth with OCD, an anxiety disorder that is conceptually
      similar to acrophobia. With this in mind, the investigators are conducting a randomized,
      double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of DCS to determine whether it had any short-term
      clinical benefits on CBT in youth with OCD. Forty children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a
      primary diagnosis of OCD will be screened and, should they meet relevant criteria, randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment conditions: (1) CBT plus DCS, or (2) CBT plus placebo. All
      patients will receive 10 sessions of CBT A rater will assess participants at 3 separate time
      points.

    <textblock>
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven efficacy for treatment of pediatric
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, CBT does not help all children and those who
      benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion. The behavioral theory that
      underlies CBT is based on two components, namely fear conditioning and extinction. On a
      neural level, CBT incorporates similar mechanisms to those involved in fear conditioning.
      Antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptor, which is involved in
      learning and memory, block both fear learning and extinction. Evidence suggests that
      D-Cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist at the NMDA glutamate receptor, augments associative
      learning and extinction as a form of learning in animals and humans. Recent clinical trials
      in adults with other anxiety disorders (acrophobia and social phobia) provided support for
      DCS dosing as facilitating associative learning that occurs during exposure-based
      psychotherapy. Given that CBT is based on the principles of extinction, DCS may augment CBT
      in youth with OCD, an anxiety disorder that is conceptually similar to acrophobia. With this
      in mind, I propose to undertake a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled pilot study of
      DCS to determine whether it had any short-term clinical benefits on CBT in youth with OCD.
      Forty children and adolescents (ages 8-17) with a primary diagnosis of OCD will be screened
      and, should they meet relevant criteria, randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      conditions: (1) CBT plus DCS (25 or 50mg depending on weight), or (2) CBT plus placebo. All
      patients will receive 10 sessions of CBT based on the protocol used in POTS (2004).
      Participants will take DCS or placebo 1 hour prior to each therapy session. A blinded,
      independent evaluator will assess participants at 3 separate time points. Two of the
      assessments (Baseline, Post-treatment) will be comprehensive in nature (e.g., diagnostic
      interview, self-reports, CY-BOCS, laboratory tests), whereas one midpoint assessment will
      involve administration of CY-BOCS, CGI, CGI-S, and Adverse Symptom Checklist only. Results
      from this study may have powerful clinical implications by providing preliminary support for
      pharmalogical agents that enhance the effectiveness of standard E/RP. Such agents may have
      utility in improving outcome, reducing premature therapy termination, and targeting patients
      who have been treatment refractory.

    <description>The CY-BOCS is a 10-item semi-structured measure of obsession and compulsion severity over the previous week. This measure served as the primary outcome index. Scores range from 0-40 with higher scores representing more severe symptoms.</description>

    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point clinician rating of severity of psychopathology. Ratings range from 1 (&quot;no illness&quot;) to 7 (&quot;extremely severe&quot;). A single rating is chosen for the CGI-S; thus, there are no summary scales/scores.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Symptom Checklist (ASC; Goodman, 2005).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>This index assesses adverse side effects that have been associated with DCS, as well as other commonly used psychotropic agents (e.g., SRIs). There are no summary scales for this. Rather, it reflects the presence or absence of 30 potential side effects on a 0-3 scale (0=not at all, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=severe) that are associated with study interventions.</description>

Sessions 1-4 will be held twice weekly; thereafter sessions will be held on a weekly basis. This evidence-based E/RP intervention (POTS, 2004) includes psychoeducation, cognitive training, and exposure and response prevention. By design, this manual provides sufficient flexibility to accommodate the child's developmental needs and address maladaptive parent-child interactions (e.g., accommodation).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The child must receive a principal diagnosis of OCD at Baseline, based on DSM-IV
             criteria. This diagnosis will be derived from the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule

          -  Refusal of parent to accept random assignment to treatment condition

          -  A positive diagnosis in the caregiver of mental retardation, psychosis, clinically
             significant tics, or other psychiatric disorders or conditions that would limit their
             ability to understand E/RP (based on clinical interview)

          -  Weight less than 25.0 kg or greater than 80.0kg
