  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot feasibility study is assessing the safety and technical performance of the
      Neurostep™ System for the restoration of independent gait in subjects with gait disorder
      (i.e. foot drop) secondary to a CNS lesion (e.g. stroke).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neurostep™ System is a neurostimulation investigational medical device. The entire system
      is designed to be implanted into the subject's leg via a surgical procedure, during which
      electrodes are attached to the peripheral nerves responsible for sensing and stimulating the
      proper muscles that lift the foot during normal walking.
