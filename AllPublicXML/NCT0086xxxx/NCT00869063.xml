    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the effectiveness of once daily application of a
      diclofenac sodium topical patch in reducing acute pain due to mild to moderate wrist sprain,
      strain or contusion when applied to the painful area.

      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be conducted in
      patients with a mild to moderate wrist sprain, strain or contusion.

      Eligible patients will be randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment to
      either the diclofenac topical patch or a matching placebo patch to be applied once daily for
      7 days. Patients will return to the clinic for assessments on Day 3 and Day 7; a follow-up
      assessment will be conducted on Day 14. Patients will complete an electronic diary in which
      assessments including pain intensity, pain relief and functional disability will be recorded
      twice daily. Ratings of the quality of sleep will also be recorded in the diary each morning,
      and the use of study treatment and rescue medication will be recorded in the diary each day.
