      This study aims to evaluate the effect of age and BMI on the pharmacokinetics and safety of
      Sancuso®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sancuso® (granisetron transdermal system [TDS] or patch) was approved by the United States
      (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 2008, indicated for the prevention of
      nausea and vomiting in patients receiving moderately and/or highly emetogenic chemotherapy
      regimens of up to 5 consecutive days' duration.

      While in vivo pharmacokinetic studies with Sancuso® in healthy adults and in subjects
      receiving chemotherapy have been conducted, there are limited data from subjects who have
      altered skin integrity due to advanced age or poor nutritional status related to chronic
      illness. In addition, available data suggest that granisetron is delivered into subcutaneous
      fat and is released from that compartment over time. It is possible that individuals with
      varying nutritional status and resultant differences in subcutaneous fat would have
      differences in pharmacokinetics.
