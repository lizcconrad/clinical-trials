      BACKGROUND: Brain ischemia and injury are commonly contributed to perioperative morbidity and
      mortality after neurosurgery. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon whereby
      brief periods of ischemia followed by reperfusion in one organ provide systemic protection
      from prolonged ischemia. To investigate whether remote preconditioning protects the brain
      injury in patients undergoing elective neurosurgery, a randomized trial will be performed in
      current study.

      DESIGNING Thirty patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial meningioma will be
      randomize assigned to neurosurgery with RIPC or conventional neurosurgery (control). Remote
      ischemic preconditioning consist of three 5-min cycles of right upper limb ischaemia, induced
      by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the upper arm and inflated to 200 mm Hg, with an
      intervening 5 min of reperfusion during which the cuff is deflated. Cerebral injury was
      assessed by S-100b, NSE, and neurological function scores in different time points.

      EXPECTED RESULTS RIPC will reduce the incidence of cerebral injury.

      CONCLUSIONS:

      In patients undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial meningioma, RIPC reduces the
      incidence of postoperative cerebral injury.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients referred for primary elective neurosurgery were invited to participate in the
             study at the time of scheduling for operation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants were excluded if they were &gt;70 years of age

          -  Required concomitant procedures other than neurosurgery

          -  Had experienced an acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infraction within 3 months

          -  Were unable to give informed consent

          -  Were taking sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents or nicorandil drug therapy because
             these agents have been shown to effect preconditioning.
