    <textblock>
      Ablation of atrial fibrillation is a well established treatment method to restore normal
      sinus rhythm and eliminate the need for continued antiarrhythmic therapy and anticoagulation.
      Absence of symptomatic and asymptomatic atrial fibrillation should be considered necessary
      for discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy. Presently, recurrence of atrial fibrillation
      is usually determined with the use of a non looping event monitor which is typically used by
      the subject at the time of symptomatic arrhythmia. This method does not detect asymptomatic
      atrial fibrillation. Random asymptomatic recording can be added, but the chance for detecting
      recurrence of arrhythmia is not great. Too frequently, the success rates of AF ablation
      procedures are inflated by insufficient follow up and patient's limited compliance in
      reporting and recording episodes of recurrent arrhythmias. Often times, it is very
      inconvenient for patients to wear external event recorders. Allergies to the sticky pads that
      are needed for most of the external monitoring devices continues to be a problem. Implantable
      loop recorders have the advantage of detecting symptomatic and asymptomatic atrial
      fibrillation continuously. They also offer the convenience of monitoring for up to 18 to 24
      months without significant patient discomfort. However, implantation and explantation of
      these devices involves a limited surgical procedure as well as considerable experience. In
      this study we attempt to assess the differences in these two types of monitoring systems in
      assessing the long term efficacy of AF ablation.
