      This study will look at the inflammatory (changes usually associated with infection/injury to
      the body) and bowel permeability (bowel's ability to allow contents to enter the body)
      effects of a Western-style diet (high fat and low in calcium) and a prudent-style diet (low
      fat and high in calcium) on the colon (large bowel). This study may provide information to
      prevent colorectal cancer in a high-risk population
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Compared to a prudent-style diet, does a western-style diet increase colorectal
      inflammation thereby increasing gut permeability and causing increased endotoxins and markers
      of systemic inflammation.

      This is a single blind crossover study. Subjects will be randomized to begin on either a WD
      or a PD for 30 + 3 days. Once that dietary intervention is complete, subjects will have a
      four (4) week wash-out period and then will be placed on the other dietary intervention for
      30 + 3 days. The following study measures are performed during both the dietary intervention
      study periods. All the baseline tests will be repeated at the end of each dietary
      intervention period.
