      Primary objective:

        -  To evaluate whether 12 weeks of clopidogrel is superior to ticlopidine in terms of lower
           risk of the safety events of interests in patients with peripheral arterial disease
           (PAD)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the risk of bleeding adverse events, serious adverse events and overall
           safety of clopidogrel with ticlopidine

        -  To compare the risk of vascular events of clopidogrel with ticlopidine

        -  To document the long-term safety of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks

        -  To document the vascular events of clopidogrel for a total of 52 weeks
