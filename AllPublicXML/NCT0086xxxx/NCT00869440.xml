      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of CNS 7056 as a procedural
      sedative at three dose levels compared to midazolam during a diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-finding study assessing the safety
      and efficacy of three dose levels of CNS 7056 compared with midazolam in patients undergoing
      diagnostic upper GI endoscopy.

      Patients who meet all study entry criteria and complete screening procedures will be randomly
      assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: CNS 7056 0.10 mg/kg,0.15 mg/kg, or 0.20 mg/kg; or
      midazolam 0.075 mg/kg. Patients will receive their assigned treatment administered as a
      single intravenous injection by a syringe driver over 1 minute. The endoscopy will be started
      when a Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score of ≤3 has been
      reached, but no earlier than 90 seconds after Time 0 (the start of study drug injection).
      Rescue with sedative medication (midazolam 1-2 mg) will be permitted at the discretion of the
      administering physician.

      Efficacy assessments will consist of the MOAA/S scores, Aldrete scores, and drowsiness
      measures using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Cognitive function will be assessed by the
      HVLT-R™ and memory for the procedure by the Brice Questionnaire.

      Safety assessments will include adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs, ECGs,
      pulse oximetry measurements, clinical laboratory tests, and pain on injection using a VAS.
