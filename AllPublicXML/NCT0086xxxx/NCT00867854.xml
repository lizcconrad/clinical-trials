    <textblock>
      This laboratory-based sub-study of ATN 061 and ATN 071 will examine the effect of early
      treatment followed by treatment de-intensification to atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r)
      monotherapy on steady-state frequencies of replication-competent CD4+ T cell Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 reservoirs or cell-associated infectivity (CAI) and persistent
      low-level viremia (LLV), and their contribution to successful long-term control of HIV-1
      replication among HIV-1 infected adolescents and young adults.

    <description>25 evaluable subjects from ATN 071 will also be enrolled. These subjects will have initiated HAART according to current DHHS guidelines (CD4+ T cells &lt; 350 cells/mm3), had viral load suppression to &lt; 100 copies/ml at 24 through 48 weeks on HAART and maintained suppression to &lt; 400 copies/ml through week 80.</description>

    <description>This sub-study does not involve additional treatment of any ATN 061 or ATN 071 study subjects. The only intervention involved is the requirement for whole blood collection (40 ml and 60 ml) to be drawn at the same time as four ATN 061 study visits (36, 48, 56, and 80 weeks) for subjects co-enrolled into ATN 061. When these time points coincide with ATN 061 Central Laboratory samples, the 60 ml blood sample will not be collected. For subjects co-enrolled into ATN 071, there are also two samples of whole blood collection (40 ml and 60 ml) required to be drawn at four time points but at weeks 36, 48, 56, and 80 after the initiation of HAART.</description>

        treatment de-intensification at week 48 of HAART.

        Twenty-five &quot;control&quot; subjects initiating HAART based on current Department of Health and
        Human Services (DHHS) guidelines at CD4+ T cell levels &lt; 350 cells/mm3 and maintained on
