    <textblock>
      This research study uses radiation or a gene therapy agent, TNFerade in addition to a
      dendritic cell vaccine in patients with locally advanced or low volume metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. The use of TNFerade or radiation serves to generate cell death stimulating the immune
      response. The dendritic cell vaccine may direct a distant and lasting effective anti-tumor
      immune response to achieve a local and systemic clinical benefit.
