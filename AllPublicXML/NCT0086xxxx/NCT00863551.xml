    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the penetration through the blood-brain-barrier of trospium chloride at
      plasma steady state (Day 10) in elderly subjects with overactive bladder symptoms. Trospium
      levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peak and trough plasma levels will be measured.
      Baseline and day 10 post-dose neurocognitive testing will be compared using a reliable change
      index to assess if any study subject shows evidence of a clinically and statistically
      significant change in memory.

    <measure>Percentage of Study Subjects With No Clinically Significant Effect on Neurocognitive Function Total Recall Score as Measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) at Day 10 Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 10</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R is an instrument used to measure verbal learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and yes/no delayed recognition. The total recall score was the sum of 3 'free recall' learning trials, and reflects the patient's ability to learn. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 36 (best memory).</description>

    <description>The HVLT-R is an instrument used to measure verbal learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and yes/no delayed recognition trial. The delayed recall score provides a measure of the patient's recent memory.

The total recall score is the sum of 3 free recall learning trials, and reflects the patient's ability to learn. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 12 (best memory). Due to technical problems associated with the administration of the test, the results were invalid.</description>

    <description>The BVMT-R is an instrument used to measure visual learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and a yes/no delayed recognition trial. The delayed recall score, derived from the delayed recall trial, provides a measure of the patient's recent memory. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 12 (best memory). Due to technical problems associated with the administration of the test, the results were invalid.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Study Subjects With No Clinically Significant Effect on Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) Total Score at Day 10 Post-Dose</title>
        <description>The BVMT-R is an instrument used to measure visual learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and yes/no delayed recognition trial. The total recall score is the sum of 3 free recall learning trials, and reflects the patient’s ability to learn. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 12 (best memory). Due to technical problems associated with the administration of the test, the results were invalid.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Study Subjects With No Clinically Significant Effect on Neurocognitive Function as Measured by the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) Delayed Recall Score at Day 10 Post-Dose</title>
        <description>The BVMT-R is an instrument used to measure visual learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and a yes/no delayed recognition trial. The delayed recall score, derived from the delayed recall trial, provides a measure of the patient’s recent memory. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 12 (best memory). Due to technical problems associated with the administration of the test, the results were invalid.</description>
