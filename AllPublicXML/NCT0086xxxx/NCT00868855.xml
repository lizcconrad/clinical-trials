  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in USA. Contemporary cardiac care has
      substantially reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with severe coronary artery
      disease. However, patients with mild to moderate coronary artery stenosis (&lt;70% stenosis)
      often present in the future with life threatening acute coronary syndrome which carries
      significant mortality and morbidity. It is difficult to predict outcomes in these patients
      before the events because the lack of complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying
      acute coronary syndrome and the lack of reliable markers that will predict major adverse
      cardiac events (MACE). Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is released from endothelial
      cells and a major factor that prevent thrombosis in the coronary artery, the cause of acute
      coronary syndrome. Endothelial dysfunction impairs t-PA release. Therefore, we hypothesize
      that patients with impaired coronary artery t-PA release will have significantly higher risk
      for future MACE due to intrinsic fibrinolytic dysfunction that leads to increased thrombosis
      risk.

      To test this hypothesis, we will determine whether intrinsic endothelial fibrinolytic
      dysfunction predicts MACE in patients with non-significant CAD. The study will measure t-PA
      release mediated by bradykinin, a major mediator for t-PA release. This will involve infusion
      of bradykinin into left main coronary artery of individuals who have undergone routine
      cardiac catheterization (clinically indicated). We will take blood samples from the coronary
      sinus and measure t-PA and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and activity levels.

      Tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA) is a protein in the blood which breaks down clots and
      plays an important role in preventing myocardial infarction. It is produced by the
      endothelial cell lining of the blood vessels. Previous studies demonstrate that t-PA is
      released in response to the hormones bradykinin and acetylcholine. Impaired t-PA release upon
      bradykinin stimulation may indicate endothelial dysfunction that leads to the development of
      acute coronary syndrome. In this project, we will determine whether impaired t-PA release can
      predict future occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. The study will involve individuals
      getting routine left heart cardiac catheterizations (indication for cardiac catheterization
      is solely based on clinical indication). Prior to the procedure, patient will have two blood
      samples (5 ml each) collected from their forearm before and after 2 minutes blood pressure
      cuff inflation on their arm. After routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization and there is no
      severe coronary artery stenosis (&lt;70% stenosis), research protocol will be initiated. Study
      includes infusion with increasing doses of bradykinin into their left main coronary artery,
      and sample small amounts of blood from their coronary sinus (15 ml total).

    <description>Bradykinin, 0.2 ug - 2ug/minute, one time intracoronary infusion over 6 minutes. Drug (bradykinin) will be infused into the left main coronary artery via diagnostic catheter (JL4) at an escalating rate of 0.2, 0.6, 2 g/ml (1ml/min). A 5F Multipurpose catheter will be advanced to coronary sinus for blood sampling.</description>
