  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data suggest that women taking drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have higher
      amounts of drugs in their body compared with men taking the same dose of anti-HIV drugs. The
      reason for this higher drug exposure has not been determined. The primary purpose of this
      study is to examine whether the pharmacokinetics (factors that determine the amount of drug
      in the body) of anti-HIV drugs change during different phases of the menstrual cycle in women
      and ultimately result in higher amounts of drug in the body compared with men. In other
      words, we plan to examine whether changes in sex hormones throughout the menstrual cycle
      affect the amount of anti-HIV drugs in women. The antiretroviral drugs atazanavir, ritonavir,
      tenofovir and emtricitabine will be studied. This study will be conducted in healthy women
      since HIV may change the pharmacokinetics of anti-HIV drugs.

          <title>Ritonavir Systemic Exposure During the Luteal Phase (Days 20-25 After Menses)</title>
          <description>Systemic exposure determined by area under the concentration time curve was measured by blood drawn for PK assessment at the following times: 0 (time of dose), 0.5, 1, 2, 4,6, 8, 12 and 24 hours. The Luteal phase starts on day 14 of the menstrual cycle when estrogen and progesterone levels are beginning to increase. This lasts 14 days or until Day 1 of the Follicular phase. Dose administration and PK during the Luteal phase, would have been drawn on day 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25 start of Follicular phase).</description>
