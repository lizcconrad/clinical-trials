      The goal of this study is to determine the association between genotypes and diet. The weight
      and weight loss data are already available from the previously completed study called: A to Z
      Study - Benefits and Risks of Alternative Weight Loss Strategies - A Clinical Trial, which
      was performed from 2003-2005 at Stanford University. In the present study, Interleukin
      Genetics will obtain DNA samples from the previously enrolled study subjects to investigate
      genetic influence of the response to macronutrient compositions of low caloric diets to
      weight loss.

      Interleukin Genetics has derived, through an extensive search of the scientific literature, a
      genetic test panel in the area of Weight Management (WM), which includes the genes that have
      been shown to affect body weight. These genes have been associated with elevated risk for
      obesity.

        The study population for the A to Z study are premenopausal women who are overweight (BMI
        27-40 kg/m2) but in otherwise good general health. Overweight participants with potentially
        confounding health conditions are excluded (eg., hypertension, diabetes, heart disease,
        cancer). Children were not included in this study. The participants were asked to agree to
        a random assignment to dietary plans.
