      The purpose of this study is to utilize high-resolution CMR carotid imaging for the
      characterization of carotid wall volumes and plaque content in patients with clinical
      significant carotid atherosclerosis. Patients who are scheduled to undergo an imaging
      procedure will be recruited from the cath lab. Upon enrollment, blood samples conventional
      and genetic profiling will be collected. For patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy,
      tissue from the carotid vessel will be collected during their procedure. Comparison of the MR
      images with tissue and/or blood samples will be made. Length of time in the study will be
      approximately 1 day. There will be no study-related patient follow-up.
