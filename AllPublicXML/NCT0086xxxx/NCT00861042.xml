        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has successfully completed a previous trial with SPM 927 in diabetic
             neuropathy and, in the investigator's opinion, would benefit from long-term
             administration of SPM 927.

          -  Subject has stable, good or fair diabetic control (HbA1c ≤10% ).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has other conditions that cause neuropathic pain at least as severe as the
             diabetic pain, i.e. peripheral arterio-vascular disease.

          -  Subject receives treatment for seizures.

          -  Subject has had an amputation related to diabetes, other than toe amputation.

          -  Subject has major skin ulcers.

          -  Subject has clinically significant ECG abnormalities.

          -  Subject expects to take during the study: TCAs, mexiletine hydrochloride, lidoderm
             patch, tramadol, AEDs, dextromethorphan, opioids, capsaicin, skeletal muscle
             relaxants, benzodiazepines or over-the-counter medications with centrally acting
             properties.

          -  Subject has laboratory values which are outside the normal range and judged by the
             investigator to be clinically significant.

          -  Subject has liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, or
             GGT) ≥ 2x ULN at Visit 1.

          -  At Visit 1, subject has impaired renal function, i.e., creatinine clearance (ClCr) is
             lower than 60 mL/min.
