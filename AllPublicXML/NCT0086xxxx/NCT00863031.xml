    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine whether screening followed by brief PSC provided by
      primary care doctors could improve the quality of life of elderly patients with unrecognized
      psychological problems in primary care. The following hypotheses were tested:

        1. Elderly patients screened positive of psychological problems had poorer health-related
           quality of life (HRQOL) than those who were screened negative.

        2. Primary care doctors could be trained to provide brief PST.

        3. Brief PST by a trained primary care doctor could improve the HRQOL of the elderly who
           were screened positive for psychological problems.

      Design &amp; methods: A prospective single-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 299
      patients aged 60 or above without any known psychological diseases but screened positive for
      psychological problems by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Subjects were
      randomised to problem-solving (PST) or video-viewing (placebo). All subjects continued with
      their usual care and were followed up by telephone at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks.Changes in SF-36
      HRQOL scores, HADS scores and monthly consultation rates at 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks within
      groups and between groups.
