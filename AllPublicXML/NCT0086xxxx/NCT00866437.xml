  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EVE-PMS technology is intended for determination of intolerance or sensitivity to sex
      hormones, among women suffering from severe PreMenstrual Syndrome (PMS).

      The system includes skin testing panel for identification of hormones to which the patients
      might be sensitive. Tests are applied close to the ovulation period and the skin reaction is
      examined in 20 minutes, 48 hours and daily during the following month. Results of skin tests
      and patient's history will determine the value of EVE-PMS Skin-Test Panel as a diagnostic
      tool for severe PMS patients.

          3. Suffers from known dominant severe symptom of breast swelling and tenderness (level
             7-10 according to standard scale of PMS symptoms severity)

          4. Other severe symptoms of Premenstrual syndrome (based on WHO and ACOG criteria). This
             may include one or more of PMS symptoms with level 7-10 according to standard scale of

          6. At least one of the PMS symptoms caused avoidance of or less participation in hobbies
             or social activities

          7. At least one of the PMS symptoms interfere with relationships with others:

             i. Timing of PMS symptom(s): during the 14 days prior to onset of menstrual flow
             (rather than spotting) and up to 5 days during the menstrual flow.

        ii. Pattern and length of PMS symptomatic period: minimum of 2 days, up to 14 days.

        iii. For PMS diagnosis two out of last three consecutive menstrual cycles were monitored by
        daily monitoring of symptoms.

        iv. Timing and length of asymptomatic phase: day 6 to at least day 10 of the menstrual
        cycle.

        v. Cyclicity - presentation of the 'off-on' phenomenon: there should be a clear shift from
        no PMS symptoms to PMS symptoms.

          2. Oral contraceptives during last three months, including hormonal IUD (trade name

          3. Serious health problems.

          4. Unexplained menstrual disorders.

          5. Treated by hormones (estrogen and progesterone).

          6. For healthy: Irregular or abnormal test results.
