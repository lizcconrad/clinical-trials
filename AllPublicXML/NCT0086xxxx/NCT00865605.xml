      The purpose of this study is to compare the vasoconstriction response profile and
      bioequivalence between one innovator lot of Ultravate® 0.05% ointment and one test/generic
      lot of Halobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment (Alpharma USPD, Inc.).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject understands the study, is willing to participate, and gives written informed
             consent.

          -  Subject demonstrates adequate vasoconstriction to the screening topical corticosteroid
             Halobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment within 30 days of dosing.

          -  Subject is a non-smoking (minimum of 14 days), male or female, ages of 18 - 65 years,
             inclusive.

          -  Subject is within 20% of their ideal body weight as defined by the 1999 Metropolitan
             Life Insurance Company Height and Weight Tables.

          -  Subject is judged by the Investigator to be healthy on the basis of pre-study medical
             history.

          -  Subjects of child-bearing potential agree to use an acceptable method of birth control
             during study participation (e.g. abstinence, any prescribed birth control method,
             double barrier method, Le. condom plus foam, condom plus diaphragm).

          -  Subject is willing to refrain from excessive consumption of sodium in food or beverage
             48hrs before and for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject is willing to shower using the same soap/cleansers for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Subject is willing to follow study restrictions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a past or current medical condition that might significantly affect
             pharmacodynamic response to topical corticosteroids.

          -  Subject has diabetes mellitus, clinically significant hypertension or circulatory
             disease.

          -  Subject is taking any medication on a regular basis that could modulate blood flow
             (constrictor or dilator), with the exception of any prescribed birth control method
             and hormone replacement therapy. Examples of such drugs include nitroglycerin, anti-
             hypertensives, antihistamines, NSAIDs, aspirin, phenylpropanolamine, phentolamine or
             any other medications deemed inappropriate by the Investigator.

          -  Subject is planning to use any exclusionary over-the-counter (OTC) medications within
             48 hours prior to or throughout the study that could modulate vascular blood flow.

          -  Subject intends to start, stop or change dose of any prescription or OTC medication
             within 48 hours prior to or throughout the study. Acetaminophen may be administered,
             if needed.

          -  Subject has used prescription or OTC topical medications on the ventral forearms
             within 1 month prior to study conduct.

          -  Subject has a history of sensitivity/allergy to the ingredients found in the test
             formulations or has a history of adverse reactions to topical or systemic
             corticosteroids.

          -  Subject has a significant history of allergy to soaps, lotions, emollients, ointments,
             creams, cosmetics, adhesives, or latex.

             psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, etc.

          -  Subject has a history of significant dermatologic cancers, for example, melanoma or
             squamous cell carcinoma. Basal cell carcinomas that were superficial and do not
             involve the investigative site are acceptable.

          -  Subject has an obvious difference in skin color between arms or the presence of a skin
             condition, scar tissue, tattoo or coloration that would interfere with placement of
             test sites, their assessments, their reaction to drug or could compromise the safety
             of the subject.

          -  Subject has used topical medications on the ventral forearms within 1 month prior to
             dosing.

          -  Subject has used a tobacco product within 14 days of study conduct.

          -  Subject has a clinically significant history of drug abuse or alcoholism.

          -  Subject has donated or received blood within 30 days prior to dosing.

          -  Subject's caffeine intake is greater than 500 mg per day (1 cup of coffee contains
             approximately 85 mg of caffeine).

          -  Subject is unwilling to abstain from alcohol or caffeine for 48 hours prior to and
             throughout the study.

          -  (Females only): Subject is pregnant or lactating.
