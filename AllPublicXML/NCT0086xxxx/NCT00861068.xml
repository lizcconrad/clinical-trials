        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has clinically diagnosed painful postherpetic neuralgia present at least six
             months after healing of a herpes zoster skin rash and has at least one form of
             allodynia

          -  Subject must have at least moderate pain (mean pain intensity ≥ 4 out of 10 during the
             baseline week on Likert scale).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has other conditions that cause pain at least as severe as the postherpetic
             neuralgia.

          -  Subject has had any surgical treatment or any neurolytic injections for PHN

          -  Subject has clinically significant ECG and laboratory abnormalities.

          -  Subject is receiving treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), muscle relaxants,
             mexiletine, topical analgesics, antidepressants, opioids, non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, benzodiazepines, and antiviral agents.

          -  Subject has liver function tests (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and
             GGT out of the reference range) &gt; 1,5 x ULN (upper limit of normal) at visit 1

          -  Subject has serum creatinine ≥ 2 times the upper limit of reference range at Visit 1.
