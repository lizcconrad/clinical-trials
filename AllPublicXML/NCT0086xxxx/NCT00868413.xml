             or murine monoclonal antibodies;

          -  Has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant; Exhibits evidence of other
             uncontrolled condition(s) including, but not limited to: uncontrolled systemic
             infection, diagnosis of fever and neutropenia within 1 week prior to study drug
             administration;

          -  Has underlying, predisposing condition of bleeding or currently exhibits signs of
             bleeding; Has a recent history of non-chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenic associated
             bleeding;

          -  Currently receiving or requires anticoagulation therapy;

          -  Has active immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or a history of being refractory to
