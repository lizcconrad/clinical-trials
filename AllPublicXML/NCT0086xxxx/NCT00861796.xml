    <textblock>
      This Phase II study will test whether CYR-101, a CNS-active compound with novel
      pharmacological profile and devoid of dopamine D2 receptor binding properties, is efficacious
      when administered orally in the management of patients with a diagnosis of DSM-IV
      schizophrenia.
