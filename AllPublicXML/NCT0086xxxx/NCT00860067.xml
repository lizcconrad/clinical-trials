  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to show that quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine
      (Q/LAIV; MEDI3250) produced antibody levels similar to those produced by the commercial
      vaccine, FluMist.

      This randomized, double-blind, active controlled, multicenter study enrolled 1,800 subjects
      who were 18 to 49 years of age. Subjects were randomized by site in a 4:1:1 fashion to
      receive a single dose of Q/LAIV, trivalent FluMist containing an influenza B strain from the
      Yamagata lineage (FluMist/B/Yamagata), or trivalent FluMist containing an influenza B strain
      from the Victoria lineage (FluMist/B/Victoria). The study was conducted at multiple sites in
      the USA in the influenza off-season.

             effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including oral, transdermal, or implanted

      <recruitment_details>A total of 1,924 participants provided written informed consent and were screened for the study. Of these, 1,800 participants were randomized into the study at 18 sites in the USA from 23Mar2009 and 26Mar2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants who provided written informed consent and who met the eligibility criteria were randomized by site at a 4:1:1 ratio to receive Q/LAIV, FluMist/B/Yamagata, or FluMist/B/Victoria. The randomization incorporated a block design with a fixed block size of 6.</pre_assignment_details>

Each 0.2 mL dose contained 10^7.0 ± 0.5 fluorescent focus units (FFU) of each of 4 temperature sensitive, cold-adapted, attenuated, 6:2 reassortant influenza strains (A/H1N1 [A/South Dakota/6/2007], A/H3N2 [A/Uruguay/716/2007], B/Victoria [B/Malaysia/2506/2004], and B/Yamagata [B/Florida/4/2006]).</description>

          <title>The Number of Participants Experiencing Each Solicited Symptom From Administration of Investigational Product Through 14 Days Post Vaccination</title>
          <description>Solicited symptoms were fever ≥ 100.4°F (38.0°C), runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, headache, generalized muscle aches, decreased activity level (lethargy) OR tiredness/weakness, decreased appetite. Collection of specific solicited symptoms (sore throat, headache, generalized muscle aches) was omitted when, according to the judgment of the investigator, the subject was too young to reliably report a particular symptom.</description>
          <population>The Evaluable Safety Population for solicited symptoms included participants who received any investigational product (Q=1198; All FM=600) and for whom any follow-up solicited symptom safety data were recorded during the summarized period (Q=1197; All FM=597).</population>

          <population>The Safety Population included participants who received any investigational product (Q=1198; All FM=600) and for whom any follow-up safety data were recorded (Q=1198; All FM=598).</population>
