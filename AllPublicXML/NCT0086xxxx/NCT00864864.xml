    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if sunitinib can get past the blood-brain
      barrier and into the brain tumor. Sunitinib has shown promising results in treating other
      cancers and works by blocking blood flow to tumors, which may prevent them from growing
      further. At the present time, there is no chemotherapy that can cure glioblastoma. The reason
      why chemotherapy is not fully effective is that many drugs cannot penetrate into brain
      tumors. This is due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which normally protects
      the brain from substances in the blood.

      -  Participants will take the study drug, sunitinib, for 7 days prior to their surgery. The
           surgery is part of the routine care for glioblastoma and will be performed on Day 8. The
           study drug is supplied in capsule form and is to be taken at home.

        -  On Day 7 participants will come to the clinic and have the following tests and
           procedures performed: Neurological and physical examination; vital signs; and blood
           samples. On day 9 (the day after the surgery) an MRI scan will be performed.

        -  Fourteen days after the participants surgery (Day 22), they will restart sunitinib
           treatment. They will take the study drug once a day for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week
           rest period (no study drug treatment). This 6 week period is called a cycle of study
           treatment. Participants can continue to receive cycles of study treatment as long as
           their disease does not progress and they do not experience any serious side-effects.

        -  Before each new cycle of study treatment (once every 6 weeks) the participant will come
           into the clinic for the following tests: Neurological and physical examination; vital
           signs; blood sample; urine sample; MRI scan of the brain (done every even cycle).
