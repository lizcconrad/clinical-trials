  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pilot study is designed to evaluate the overall safety and feasibility of a strategy
      based on subcutaneous delivery of furosemide. It will be used to inform the subsequent
      evaluation phase of the study (separate protocol). The primary objective of the study is to
      determine if a strategy of a novel subcutaneous delivery of furosemide is safe and feasible
      in patients with acute heart failure.

    <textblock>
      Multi-center, open-label, pilot study conducted in 2 phases. Each phase will enroll 20
      subjects that will be used to inform the study design of the SUBQ-HF Study (approximately 300
      evaluable patients randomized to either usual inpatient care or early discharge with home
      subcutaneous furosemide for 1-7 days).

      Inpatient Pilot Phase:

      Eligible in-patients will be approached for participation. Subjects who consent for
      participation will be treated with subcutaneous furosemide for 48 hours, during which they
      will remain in the hospital. This will be primarily a safety and feasibility assessment.
      There will be no formal hypothesis tested, and statistical analysis will be descriptive in
      nature.

      Outpatient Pilot Phase:

      Eligible in-patients who are nearing discharge will be approached for participation. Subjects
      who consent for participation will be instructed on use of device, discharged to home and
      treated at home with subcutaneous furosemide for 1-7 days. This will be primarily a safety
      and feasibility assessment. There will be no formal hypothesis tested, and statistical
      analysis will be descriptive in nature.
