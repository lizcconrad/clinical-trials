  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to test a systems-level approach to disseminate a
      multicomponent, multilevel intervention consisting of educational materials about
      transplantation and the new kidney allocation system targeting dialysis facility Medical
      Directors, staff, and patients. Roughly 750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 end stage renal
      disease Network regions across the United States will be randomized to receive intervention
      materials. The overall goal of the study is to extend the influence of the national
      allocation policy in reducing disparities in early steps in kidney transplant access.

      The purpose of the ASCENT study is to test a systems-level approach to disseminate a
      multi-component intervention consisting of in the era of the new national kidney allocation
      policy and educational materials targeting dialysis facility Medical Directors, staff, and
      patients. The investigators will randomize ~750 dialysis facilities in up to 18 End Stage
      Renal Disease Network regions across the United States, where approximately half of
      facilities will receive the intervention materials and half will receive an informational
      brochure. This pragmatic, clinical effectiveness-implementation study will test the
      effectiveness of the multicomponent, multilevel interventions consisting of a tailored,
      facility-specific transplant and disparity performance report, educational videos for staff
      and dialysis patients, and an educational webinar for dialysis facility Medical Directors and
      staff.

    <description>Medical directors will be provided performance feedback reports that are a summary of clinical performance of transplant and racial disparity performance over a period of time aimed at providing information to allow them to assess and adjust their transplant performance. The report will emphasize tailored facility-specific information on the mean time on dialysis for patients in that facility and transplant access performance measures, such as wait listing and transplantation, including the magnitude of racial disparity, detailing when a facility is performing below the national or regional average.</description>
