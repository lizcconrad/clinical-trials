  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intestinal permeability is one of the main pathophysiological mechanisms involved
      in irritable bowel syndrome. The expression of some intestinal tight junction proteins is
      decreased mostly in IBS-diarrhoea patients. This decrease is correlated with increased
      intestinal permeability. Currently, no test used in clinical practice could assess intestinal
      permeability.

      We hypothesis plasmatic zonulin could reflect intestinal permeability in IBS patients.

      The goal of our study is to look for a correlation between plasmatic zonulin and increased
      colonic permeability (assessed by the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins by
      western blot) in IBS patients and to look for a role of intestinal low-grade inflammation and
      microbiota.

      Population :

      IBS patients with diarrhoea or IBS with constipation or mixed with worsening of symptoms

      Outcomes measures :

      Plasmatic zonulin (ELISA kit) Occludin expression in colonic biopsies (western blot)
