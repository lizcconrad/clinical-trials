    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the organization of the motor circuit in a group of
      patients suffering from dystonia compared with a group of healthy controls. Deep Brain
      stimulation is a functional neurosurgery technique consisting in neuromodulation of the motor
      circuit that has been applied to dystonia. The efficiency of this technique depends on the
      relative preservation of the function and the structure of the motor network .

      The assessment of neuronal circuit by advanced techniques of functional neuroimaging in this
      study might contribute to expand our understanding of the abnormalities in motor circuit
      activation and the integrity of CNS structure underlying dystonia. This study might
      contribute therefore to the refinement of Deep brain stimulation indications and techniques
      in complex dystonia syndromes

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advances in the field of functional neurosurgery, neuroradiology and virus neuronal tracing
      studies have expanded our knowledge of the circuits underlying the clinical expression of
      several neurologic syndromes. Globus pallidus internus (GPi) Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is
      a validated technique for the treatment of 'isolated dystonia'. The efficiency of this
      therapy in 'complex dystonia', commonly associated with focal brain lesions, is limited and
      heterogeneous. Broadening indications for DBS therapy to complex DDS disorders require
      further improvement of preoperative assessment of motor circuit functional reorganization and
      white matter integrity. The efficacy of neuromodulation in these clinical syndromes is
      determined by the severity of pyramidal involvement, the interactions between
      cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuits and motor network
      reorganization at the cortical level.

      The aim of the study is to identify movement-related functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) activation patterns in a group of dystonic patients in comparison to healthy controls
      (HC). Further analysis will assess the recruitment pattern in different patient subgroups
      defined according to clinical and radiological criteria relevant to GPi DBS eligibility
      (hyperkinetic/ hypokinetic and prepallidal/ postpallidal). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
      will be applied to the assessment of the topographic distribution and severity of white
      matter lesions in the group of dystonic patients in comparison with HC.

      Further knowledge concerning motor network organization and white matter integrity after
      focal brain lesions might contribute to the understanding of this mitigated response to DBS
      and to the refinement of DBS indications and techniques in secondary dystonia

    <description>All the subjects participating in the study will undergo a Functional MRI study with a 'box and block' design comparing brain activity during the execution of a motor task and rest. Resting state fMRI will also be recorded. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software will be used in order to perform spatially extended statistical processes to test the hypothesis whether there is a difference between both groups in functional imaging data. This analysis will provide a statistical map showing the clusters of brain activation where there is a significant difference between the group of dystonic patients and the group of healthy controls</description>

    <description>Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a measure derived of Diffusion tensor imaging that quantifies the degree of directionality of the local tract structure. This parameter is considered to be a marker for white matter tract integrity.
FSL software will be used to analyse Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data
Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) will be used to obtain a voxelwise statistical map comparing fractional anisotropy in the major tracts in the group ot dystonic patients and the group of healthy controls.
Probabilistic tractography will be used to obtain tract-derived DTI parameters in the corticospinal and thalamocortical tracts that will be correlated with clinical scales (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia scale). Several DTI parameters will be analysed: mean fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, parallel and perpendicular diffusivity</description>

    <description>To identify movement-related fMRI activation pattern in different subgroups of dystonic patients classified following clinical (hyperkinetic versus hypokinetic) and radiologic criteria (prepallidal versus postpallidal lesions) Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) software will be used to test the hypothesis whether patients with different clinical phenotypes (hyperkinetic versus hypokinetic) or patients with different radiologic presentation (prepallidal versus postpallidal lesions) show significant differences in the pattern of brain activation related to the execution of a motor task.
This analysis will provide a statistical map showing the clusters of brain activation where there is a significant difference between both groups</description>
