  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Static imaging has been commonly and clinically accepted to assess the severity of medial
      knee osteoarthritis (KOA), especially the radiography. Gait analysis has been adopted to
      evaluate the kinematic characteristics of the knees in patients with KOA. Most of the current
      studies focus on the sagittal plane of the knee, but very few of them focus on the frontal or
      horizontal plane. With the different severity of medial KOA, anatomical structures of the
      knees will change and influence kinematics of the knees, such as osteophytes and deformity.
      At present, there has been no study focusing on the relations between the imaging assessment
      of the severity and quantitative kinematics of medial KOA. The aim of the study is to explore
      the relationship between the imaging assessment based on the Kellgren-Lawrence Scores and in
      vivo 3D knee kinematic characteristics in Chinese patients with medial KOA during walking
      using a new portal gait system.
