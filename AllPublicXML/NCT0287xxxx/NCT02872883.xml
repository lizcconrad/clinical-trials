  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will eventually result in a main randomised controlled trial that
      will look at what management is associated with a higher rate of normal birth and a lower
      rate of chorioamnionitis (maternal infection) when women break their waters but labour does
      not start. Spontaneous rupture of the membranes (when the waters break) at term (37-42 weeks
      gestation) is a physiological event that happens during labour. However, according to Gunn et
      al. (1970) in 8-10 % of the cases the membranes rupture before labour starts. The time
      between the rupture and the onset of labour is called latent phase and time wise is variable.

      Studies have showed no statistically significant differences in terms of neonatal infection
      or chorioamnionitis when the investigators induce labour with prostaglandins compared to when
      labour starts spontaneously (Hannah et al 1996). Seaward et al. (1997) noted a number of
      confounding factors that might relate to the incidence of chorioamnionitis (maternal
      infection), the strongest predictor was having more than 8 vaginal examinations since the
      rupture of membranes and before delivery which was a stronger predictor than the duration of
      the latent phase. It is thought that by reducing the number of internal examinations,
      chorioamnionitis may be reduced, and hence neonatal infection may also be reduced. The main
      RCT will compare clinical outcomes and maternal satisfaction when women consent to be
      randomized to four groups: (1) Active management and routine internal examinations during
      labour, (2) Active management and reduced internal examinations, (3) Expectant management and
      routine internal examinations, (4) Expectant management and reduced internal examinations.

      This application seeks ethics approval for the pilot phase to ensure that a definitive study
      can be undertaken appropriately. It is important to test that all the components work well
      individually and as a whole, to estimate sample size and ultimately to test the integrity of
      the research protocol before embarking on the main trial.
