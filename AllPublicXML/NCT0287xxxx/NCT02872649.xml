  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe heart failure supported by left ventricular assist device (LVAD) require
      adequate long-term anticoagulant therapy. New oral anticoagulants such as the direct thrombin
      inhibitor dabigatran may represent an alternative to Coumarin for long-term anticoagulation.

      In this pilot single-center study, thirty LVAD patients with stable renal function were
      scheduled to receive phenprocoumon or dabigatran for long-term anticoagulation after
      implantation of a HeartWare HVAD system following an open-label balanced parallel group
      design.
