      The objective of this study is to evaluate an educational program for Atrial Fibrillation
      patients under Warfarin treatment regarding to patients' knowledge of Warfarin, related life
      distresses and quality of life.

    <textblock>
      This is a parallel-group randomized controlled study. Four measurements were (a) knowledge of
      Warfarin; (b) life distresses caused by Warfarin treatment; and (c) quality of life as
      primary and secondary endpoint. All participants participated in a face-to-face interview
      during the pretest and at the 6-month follow-up in the outpatient department (OPD). Each
      subject in the experimental group was taught face-to-face individually according to
      investigator's brochure in the OPD by researchers trained in a standardized protocol. The
      control group received a brochure only.

    <description>There were six questions and the contents were consistent with investigator's brochure used in investigator's research setting. When participants answered questions correctly, or illustrated at least two correct examples for each item, participants received one point; otherwise, participants received no point. The range of scores was 0-6. The higher the score, the better the patient's knowledge of Warfarin was.</description>

    <measure>life distress</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>There were six questions. The most commonly cited things patients suffered from while under Warfarin treatment were included. When participants answered &quot;yes&quot;, participants received one point; if participants answered &quot;no&quot;, participants received no point. The range of scores was 0-6. A higher score indicated a worse life distresses.</description>

    <measure>quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators use SF-36 to measure participants' quality of life.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, including vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health,which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

    <description>Patient education related Warfarin: each subject in the experimental group was taught individually according to investigator's brochure in the outpatient department (OPD) by researchers. Three months later, participants received a follow-up phone call in order to clarify any questions related to the brochure. The contents of the brochure consisted of: the purpose of taking Warfarin, side effects, adjustments to daily diet, and precautions (i.e. how to take medication safely, interaction between foods and medicine, prevention and checking of signs and symptoms of bleeding). The control group received the brochure after pretest and routine care only in the OPD. All participants completed posttest at 6-month follow-up.</description>
