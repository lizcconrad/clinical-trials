      The diagnosis of chronic gastro-intestinal ischemia (CGI) remains a clinical challenge
      because this diagnosis is difficult to distinguish by the frequent incidence of chronic
      abdominal pain and asymptomatic stenosis of the mesenteric arteries1. The standard diagnostic
      work up includes medical history, anamnesis and physical examination, radiological imaging
      and a functional test as visible light spectroscopy (VLS)2-4 or tonometry5-7. A
      multidisciplinary team consisting of a gastroenterologist, a vascular surgeon and an
      interventional radiologist, all specialized in CGI, discusses all patients which results in
      an expert based consensus diagnosis. Currently, there is no specific test to diagnose CGI. In
      literature, Magnetic Resonance (MR) techniques are described by which the flow in the
      mesenteric vessels is measured pre- and post-prandial in healthy volunteers and CGI
      patients8-12. The flow in the mesenteric vessels increases post-prandial (hyperemia).
      However, this increase in post-prandial flow compared to pre-prandial appeared less in CGI
      patients compared to the healthy volunteers. In some CGI patients, even a decrease of the
      post-prandial compared to pre-prandial flow was seen. We might be able to distinguish
      patients with CGI from patients without CGI with MR flow measurements with food stimulation.
