  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2004, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) introduced guidelines for the management of
      severe sepsis and septic shock, as well as strategies for bedside implementation. The
      treatment recommendations were organized in two bundles. In an international study, enrolling
      adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to these intensive care units, investigators found
      that while mortality from severe sepsis is high (44.5%), compliance with resuscitation and
      management bundles is generally poor in much of Asia. Investigators need to identify the
      patients at risk for high in-hospital mortality in order to take appropriate steps.

      From their past studies, investigators found that sepsis involved inflammation and
      coagulation. The multiple organ involvement was associated with interaction of novel
      biomarkers such as cytokines. There is limited data regarding comparing and application of
      biomarkers of different characteristic on sepsis treatment. A simultaneous detection of
      multiple cytokines may provide significant prognostic information. For other biomarkers,
      promising observation data have been put forward, but their potential needs to be evaluated
      in large-scale, well-designed prospective intervention studies before clinical use can be
      recommended. Besides many clinical studies on biomarkers were confounded by its lack of
      standard bundle care for severe sepsis patient.

      Here investigators performed a systematic study aimed at evaluating

        1. the individual and combined diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers for predicting mortality;

        2. whether trend change in biomarker level more useful for above prediction;

        3. which biomarker or biomarker combination checked can predict patients at risk of
           evolving with severe organ dysfunctions.

      Variables will be tested for their association with the outcome using Pearson chi-square test
      for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test for numerical data. Comparison the different
      groups will be conducted by using Mann-Whitney U test for numerical data and using Pearson
      chi-square test for categorical data. The time course of biomarker plasma levels will be
      assessed by analysis of variance. Multivariate analysis will be performed using a logistic
      regression model to estimate the odds ratio of organ failure and dying, along with the 95%
      confidence interval (CI). Forward and backward selection procedures will be used to
      iteratively select the variables potentially related to death.

      Discrimination will be assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic
      curve to evaluate how well the model distinguished patients who lived from those who died and
      whether progression of organ dysfunction. A survival analysis will be performed using
      Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. Analyses will be completed and a two-tailed p&lt;0.05
      will be considered significant.

        The study will be conducted at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. All adult patients
        presenting with sepsis or severe sepsis will be enrolled on admission to medical intensive
        units (total 34 beds). Sepsis and severe sepsis are defined as American College of Chest
        Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus criteria for sepsis syndromes.
