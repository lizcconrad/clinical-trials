  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omega 3 (OM3) Tear is a new unit dose emulsion, containing flaxseed/castor oil, which is
      being developed by Allergan. It is desirable to understand the effect that this new emulsion
      has on tear film evaporation and tear lipid profile via interferometry, in patients with
      evaporative dry eye (EDE) and those without (non-EDE). It would also be valuable to evaluate
      the retention time of the lipid components of the new emulsion via tear collection and
      analysis in EDE and non-EDE patients

             signing a record of informed consent;

          -  Over 18 years of age;

          -  Not wearing contact lenses in the past 3 months before enrolling

             Investigator;

          -  Habitual (corrected or uncorrected) visual acuity of 6/9.5 or better in each eye;

          -  At the Screening visit (Day -14), patients must have Ocular Surface Disease Index
             (OSDI) score &gt;18 (0 to 100 scale). At Baseline (Day 1) visits, patients must have OSDI
             score &gt; 12 to continue in the study.

          -  TBUT≤10sec in at least 1 eye at Screening visit and Baseline visit

             Baseline visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Schirmer test (with anesthesia) ≤ 2 mm in either eye at Screening

          -  Patients who are currently using topical ocular medication or have used topical ocular
             medication within 2 weeks of the Screening visit. Patients who are being treated
             bilaterally with a marketed artificial tear for dry eye can be considered, provided
             they discontinue use at the Screening visit;

          -  Any active anterior segment disease excluding blepharitis;

          -  Any systemic disease that may affect ocular health e.g. Graves disease, and
             auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis and systemic
             lupus erythematosus;

          -  History of epilepsy or migraines exacerbated by flashing, strobe-like lights;

          -  History of eye surgery within 6 months prior to enrolment in the study;

          -  Previous corneal refractive surgery
