      This project proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a mobile
      intervention to target smoking-cessation and increase physical activity among low-income
      persons. The intervention is called Smoking Treatment and Exercise Program for Underserved
      Populations (STEP UP).

      This pilot project proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a
      mobile intervention to target smoking-cessation and physical activity among low-income
      persons. The intervention, named Smoking Treatment and Exercise Program for Underserved
      Populations (STEP UP), combines a smartphone-based contingency-management application (app),
      which provides monetary reinforcement for smoking abstinence and physical activity, 5 weeks
      of telephone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to prevent relapse, nicotine
      replacement pharmacotherapy, and text-messaging to support physical-activity goals.
      Participants are given a smartphone, a compact carbon-monoxide (CO) monitor, with which
      recency of smoking can by determined, and a Garmin Vivosmart wristband step-tracker. Twice a
      day at semi-random intervals, participants are prompted by the app to submit a video of
      themselves blowing into the CO monitor. Monetary reinforcement is then immediately provided
      contingent upon a below-threshold CO reading. The app also continuously syncs with the Garmin
      step-tracker, providing supportive messaging and bonus incentivesâ€”namely doubled
      reinforcement for smoking abstinence among participants who meet personalized daily step
      goals. The expected outcome of the project is to provide information to evaluate the efficacy
      of an innovative approach in preparation for a subsequent larger clinical trial that builds
      upon the capabilities of mHealth technology to reduce the prevalence of smoking among low
      income smokers.
