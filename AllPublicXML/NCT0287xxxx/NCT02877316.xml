      Background: Persons with a past episode of self-harm or severe suicidal ideation are at
      elevated risk of self-harm as well as dying by suicide. It is well established that suicidal
      ideation fluctuates over time. Safety plans in paper format are mandatory part of the
      treatment regime in the suicide preventive clinics in Denmark. The aim of the trial is to
      compare the paper version of the safety plan with a new-developed app in reducing suicide
      ideation and other symptoms, as an add-on to the supportive psychotherapy delivered in the
      clinics.

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that participants randomized to MYPLAN will have lower suicide
      ideation as well as improvements on the secondary outcomes than users who have the paper
      version.

      Methods: The trial is designed as a 2-arm observer-blinded parallel group randomized clinical
      superiority trial, where participants will either receive: 1) Experimental intervention: the
      safety plan provided as the app MYPLAN, or 2) Treatment as Usual: the safety plan in the
      original paper format. Both intervention groups will also receive standard psychosocial
      therapeutic care, up to 8-10 sessions of supportive psychotherapy.Based on a power
      calculation a total of 546 participants, 273 in each arm will be included. They will be
      recruited from national suicide preventive clinics. Follow-ups will be conducted at 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 months after date of inclusion.

      Participants, inclusion and exclusion criteria: There is no age restriction on participation
      in the study and all participants will be recruited from the suicide prevention clinics in
      Denmark. These clinics are highly specialized outpatient care centers, offering short-term
      supportive psychotherapy and social counselling for suicidal patients. In order to
      participate in the study, participants must have a smartphone (IPhone or android phone) and
      understand sufficient Danish to use MYPLAN. Persons having a particularly severe alcohol or
      substance abuse disorder, which might inflict with skills of orientation and memorywill not
      be offered participation in the RCT.

      Outcomes Patient reported outcomes (PROM) are collected at baseline and follow-up through
      self-administered tablet/internet-based questionnaires. Primary outcome is suicide ideation.
      Secondary outcomes are:, hopelessness, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and modified
      CSQ-8.

      Statistical analysis: Data analysis will be based on intention-to-treat principle. We will
      examine this using repeated measurement in mixed models. Missing data will be handled with
      multiple imputations.

      The trial will start in November 2016 and patient recruitment is expected to finish November
      2017. Analysis and results are expected in 2018.

      MYPLAN -mobile phone application to manage crisis of persons at risk of suicide:

      a multi-center, superiority randomized clinical trial.

      Andreasson K, Krogh J, Frandsen H, Buus N, Bech. P Nordentoft M, Erlangsen A Background

      In Denmark, there are 8-10,000 people who attempt suicide on a yearly basis1. Suicide
      ideation is a part of a continuum, where initial suicidal ideation might develop into
      concrete plans and actions, depending on the suicidal intent suicidal actions might end as
      suicide attempts or completed suicide2 . Therefore, in order to prevent suicidal behavior and
      suicides, it is important to avoid or reduce suicide ideation; i.e. securing better control
      of painful thoughts and the suicidal behavior. This can be done with a safety plan. The
      safety plan has been developed as a cognitive therapeutic intervention applied empirically in
      some earlier studies 345. The safety plan can be considered as a part of a cognitive behavior
      therapeutic intervention, which reduces the suicidal risk and consists of basic components,
      such as 1) recognizing warning signs of an upcoming suicidal crisis, 2) work with internal
      coping strategies, 3) distraction from suicidal thoughts, by the use of social contacts and
      social settings6. This can be done by removing assess of lethal means, and self-monitoring
      the triggers of the &quot;suicidal mode&quot;7.

      To prevent suicidal behavior, The National Board of Health has established Suicide Prevention
      Clinics nationwide in Denmark. The clinics offering highly specialized short-term supportive
      psychotherapy and social counselling for suicidal patients in an outpatient setting. The
      target group is a subsample of all persons with severe suicide ideation or suicide attempts
      as the clinics focus on persons at risk of suicide who do not have severe underlying
      psychiatric disorders that required psychiatric admission or specialized treatment8. Some
      clinics are specialized in children and adolescents and will offer support patients young as
      10 years of age. The safety plan is an integral part of the treatment and all patient works
      with during the first sessions.

      Hypothesis The hypothesis of this trial is that an app-based safety plan is more effective
      than a paper version of a safety plan in reducing suicide ideations in suicidal patients.

      Purpose

      The purpose of this trial is to investigate if a safety plan delivered as an app compared to
      a safety plan delivered by paper, can reduce suicide ideation after 12 months intervention in
      patients referred to Suicide Prevention Clinics.

      Methods/design

      The trial is designed as a 2-arm, multi-site, parallel group, observer-blinded randomized
      clinical superiority trial. Based on a power calculation, a total of 546 participants, 273 in
      each arm will be included, recruited from national suicide preventive clinics. Both groups
      will receive treatment as usual consisting of short term psychotherapy and social
      counselling: 1) Experimental intervention the safety plan provided as the app MYPLAN, or 2)
      Treatment as Usual (TAU): the safety plan in the original paper format.

      Recruitment and criteria for inclusion and exclusion

      All participants will be recruited through the Suicide Prevention Clinics in Denmark. The
      patients are referred from somatic and psychiatric wards after suicide attempts, general
      practitioners, and can also refer themselves to the suicide preventive clinics. There is no
      age restriction on participation in the study.

      Enrollment and randomization

      At the first visits at the Suicide Prevention Clinic, eligible participants will receive oral
      and information about the study as well as an information pamphlet. They will be offered time
      for reflection and possibility to have renewed appointment at the clinic together with a
      relative, before answering. If the patient fulfils all the inclusions criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria, the patient will be randomized using a computer-generated sequence
      randomization to either 1) Treatment as usual plus app: treatment as usual plus the safety
      plan app, or 2) treatment as usual pus safety plan on paper. The randomization will be
      stratified by gender and previous self-harm (yes/no), and will be facilitated through an
      external, centrally administered internet service. The clinician working the Suicide
      Prevention Clinics, will by accessing the internet obtain information on the patients
      allocation (safety plan either as an app or paper version), immediately after the patients
      has provided informed consent. This procedure will ensure adequate allocation concealment.

      Blinding Due to the nature of the intervention, a blinding of participants and clinicians is
      not possible, but outcome assessment and analyses will be carried out with blinding of
      treatment allocation. All data will be collected through questionnaires (SurveyXact) secured
      on an encrypted server. The analyses will be performed by blinded scientists.

      Interventions Treatment as Usual (TAU): Participants allocated to the treatment at usual will
      receive up to 8-10 sessions of supportive psychotherapy as part of the standard care of the
      suicide preventive clinics. Each of the clinics apply different or combined therapies
      including cognitive, problem-solving, crisis, dialectical behavior, integrated care,
      psychodynamic, systemic, psychoanalytic approaches, and/or social counselling. A uniform
      treatment algorithm is not followed; elements are chosen on the basis of what is deemed the
      most promising strategy in each individual case. As an integral part of the therapy the
      clinical fill in a safety plan with the patient by reviewing what are signs of situations
      where crises occur and what has previously worked as strategies of distraction as well as
      help-seeking. The safety plan is presented to the patient using a comparable manual-based
      instruction. Participants randomized to the paper format will write the safety plan on a
      sheet of paper and bring home the original while the clinical keeps a copy together with the
      medical records of the patient.

      Experimental intervention: Participants allocated to the experimental intervention will
      receive the treatment as usual, and have an introduction to the app-based safety plan MYPLAN.
      Using the instruction manual, the clinician will review previous crisis situations and
      possible strategies.

      See figure 1. CONSORT flow diagram

      Outcomes

      Primary outcome will be measured as the difference in suicide ideation before entering the
      trial and after 12 month participation in the trial. This is measured by Becks suicide
      ideation scale (BSS 21-items). The outcome is considered as a proxy measure for suicide
      attempt and completed suicide.

      Secondary outcomes are: hopelessness (Becks Hopelessness Scale, BHS), depressive symptoms
      (Major depression Inventory, MDI).

      Exploratory outcomes We have chosen some exploratory outcomes such as, quality of life
      measured by WHO Well-being Index, (WHO-5), user satisfaction will be measured by modified
      User satisfaction Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), self-harm (self-reported),
      mortality, admission to psychiatric or somatic emergency wards, and other somatic and
      psychiatric hospital registers data.

      Patient reported outcomes measures (PROM) These are collected at baseline and follow-up
      through self-administered tablet-/ internet-based questionnaires. Follow-ups will be
      conducted at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after date of inclusion. Participants will receive an
      e-mail with a link to an online survey. Respondents can log on to a secure data portal,
      SurveyXact, with their personal trial id-number and answers to questionnaires are collected.

      The register-based outcomes such as mortality, suicide attempt, somatic and usage of somatic
      and mental health care services will be assessed at 12 and 24 months by obtaining data
      extract from above listed registries.

      Statistical analysis

      The primary outcome is the mean change in Becks Suicide Ideation scale at 6 months. We expect
      that participants in the intervention group at 6 months score 2.5 points lower compared to
      participants in the TAU group. Based on previous publication we expect a post-intervention SD
      of 9. Setting the alpha level to 5 percent and the beta level to 10 percent we need to
      include 273 participants for each group to a total of 546 participants.

      Analysis of the primary outcome will be conducted according to intention-to-treat principle:
      all participants will be included in final analysis according to group assignment regardless
      of adherence to treatment. This study has multiple assessment points and for the primary
      analysis we will use repeated measurements in a mixed model with unstructured variance. This
      procedure is able to handle baseline differences and missing data. For participants with
      missing data in two or more data points we will identify potential differences to
      participants with full data and use include these variables as potential confounders in
      secondary analysis.

      All statistical analysis will be conducted in SPSS. All tests will be two-tailed and p values
      below 0.5 will be considered significant and interpreted with respect to hierarchy of
      hypothesis.

      Pilot study/feasibility test

      Prior to study being a pilot study will be carried out in one of the sites. The aim is to
      make the pilot study as similar to the trial as possible. A total of 40 participant will be
      recruited, 20 in each arm. The randomization and other technical and practical procedures
      will be tested. Clinicians will present the safety plan as described above using a
      manual-based instruction. The participants will be followed for 3 months. Data on all scales
      listed as outcomes will be collected; at the time of enrollment by tablet and at end of
      follow-up by email.

      Ethical considerations The trial will be approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in the
      Capital Region of Denmark and the Danish Data Protection agency. The trial is registered
      under Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT. In accordance to with the Consort guidelines, we will
      publish positive, neutral and negatives findings in the trial. The patients will be informed
      about the trial both verbally and written information before signing the written consent.
      They are offered time for consideration and they can have a renew appointment together with a
      spouse, before signing the written consent. It will be stressed that participation are
      voluntary. Participation and the written consent can be withdrawn at any time.

      Organization and economy The trial is led by postdoctoral researcher Kate Andreasson Aamund,
      Psychiatric Centre North Zealand in close collaboration with Danish Research Institute for
      Suicide Prevention (DRIPS), Mental Health Center Copenhagen and the Suicide Prevention
      Clinics. The patient recruitment will be done through the Danish Suicide Prevention Clinics
      in Denmark. The project has received funding from the Danish non-profit foundation
      (TrygFonden).

      Analyses and results are expected in summer 2018
