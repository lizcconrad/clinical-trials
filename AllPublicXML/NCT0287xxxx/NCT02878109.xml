      This study is conducted to evaluate dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to quantify the efficacy of
      trans-arterial chemoembolization by comparing imaging results before and after treatment for
      at least one hepatic tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically presents arterial phase hyperenhancement. For
      intermediate stage disease and the majority of patients not eligible for curative therapies,
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is considered as the first-line palliative treatment
      in eligible patients.

      Despite its efficacy on HCC, TACE presents major challenges such as the lack of quantitative
      biomarkers of treatment response. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) enables
      quantitative assessment of tumor and tissue enhancement, by acquiring MR signal intensity as
      a function of time.

      Objectives: This study is conducted to develop a monitoring system based on quantifiable
      measures during intra-arterial treatments from dynamic MRI, using time-activity curves
      analyzed using a dual-input dual-compartment model.

      Design: This will be a prospective study in HCC patients undergoing TACE (including DC beads)
      according to their clinical standard of care. A 4D-THRIVE sequence will be performed. Single
      intensities before/after gadolinium-based contrast agent enhancement will be used to create
      time-concentration curves, which will be fitted to a simple perfusion model that accounts for
      the dual blood supply of the liver through the hepatic artery and the portal vein. Perfusion
      parameters of arterial hepatic blood flow, portal venous hepatic blood flow, total hepatic
      blood flow and arterial fraction will be extracted from the model and compared between HCC
      and surrounding cirrhotic liver. When deemed necessary, a CBCT can be acquired before
      chemo-embolization in way to see that the appropriate artery is selected for the treatment.
      The CBCT will be used when available to determine the parameters of the blood flow obtained
      with our model.

      Methods: Thirty patients will be selected. A 4D-THRIVE sequence will be acquired within 2
      weeks prior to TACE and between 6 and 8 weeks after TACE. A 4D-FLOW MRI sequence will also be
      included.

      Expected results: The results of this study will provide quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers for
      identification of viable tumor and tumor response. In addition, presence of increased %
      arterial flow and decreased portal venous flow in HCC using DCE-MRI are expected to help to
      assess treatment response.
