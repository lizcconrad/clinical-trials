      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and stimulate the immune response. This
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in 5000 people and seems
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.

      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink
      tumours in animals and has been studied in 1500 people and seems promising but it is not
      clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with durvalumab

      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have
      been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone. While the
      combination has been studied in 250 people, it is not clear if it can offer better results
      than standard treatment.
