  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The existence of a family factor in the genesis of varicose veins is certain, but few studies
      have addressed reliably instead of the genetic factor in clinical and molecular level. The
      investigator initiated an original study to identify one or more genetic abnormalities
      predisposing to varicose disease, based on a combined approach of genetic linkage and of
      exome sequencing. The clinical research phase is an essential prerequisite to the
      identification of genetic mutations; it is to identify large affected families and ensure an
      extremely rigorous and accurate phenotyping of individuals over several generations. A first
      clinical work has identified and / or phenotype 8 families with a genetically informative
      family suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Linkage analysis suggested several
      candidate chromosomal regions without allowing the identification of a gene. This project
      aims to resume and expand the Family clinical investigations and apply the techniques of
      genome analysis points, including exome sequencing on the most informative families to
      identify the genes and mechanisms responsible of this disease and improve the prevention and
      the treatment of varicose veins.

        The initial step of this protocol relies on recruiting large families (&gt; 8 met) for a
        genetic linkage analysis. It consists firstly in identifying patients with varicose veins
        occurring in a family context, and to conduct a comprehensive survey to assess the
        potentially informative family (significant number of individuals with multiple
        generations) and ensure their membership prior to the study. The next step is the fine and
        accurate phenotyping of each of the family members and the collection of a blood sample for
        DNA extraction for molecular genetic analysis (family linkage analysis and sequencing exome
        ).
