      to assess the clinical performance of the St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System in
      patients undergoing an elective thoracic MRI scan.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is a prospective, multicenter, 2-phase, single arm, Asian study.

        -  In the 1st phase patients will be enrolled within 60 days of implant with a St. Jude
           Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System approved for thoracic scan with 1.5 Tesla MRI
           scanning machines.

        -  In the 2nd phase patients will be enrolled within 60 days of implant with a St. Jude
           Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System approved* for thoracic scan with 3.0 Tesla MRI
           scanning machines.

             -  NOTE: The 2nd phase of this study will start only after receiving appropriate
                regulatory approval for MRI labelling at 3.0T and phase 1 enrollment has completed

    <description>Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days of successful St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System implant or within 60 days post most recent lead revision (if applicable) whichever is latter. Enrolled subjects will undergo an elective MRI scan from 60-90 days of implant or most recent lead revision (if applicable) whichever is latter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pectorally implanted with St. Jude Medical™ MR Conditional ICD System
             within 60 days

          2. Subject is willing to undergo an elective MRI scan without sedation NOTE: Antianxiety
             agents (e.g. minor tranquilizers, etc.) may be used as long as the patient can
             communicate with site personnel during the MRI scan

          3. Subject's ventricular bipolar capture threshold is stable &lt; 2.5V @ 0.5ms

          4. Subject's ventricular sensing is measurable (patient has underlying rhythm &gt; 30bpm)
             and the sensing amplitude is &gt; 4mV

          5. Subject is able to provide informed consent for study participation (legal guardian or
             legally authorized representative is NOT acceptable)

          6. Subject is willing and able to comply with the prescribed follow-up tests and
             procedures

          7. Subject is not contraindicated for an MRI scan (per the MRI Screening Form)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is pacemaker dependent

          2. Subject has a non SJM MRI compatible endocardial lead implanted or capped

          3. Subject has another existing active implanted medical device, e.g., neurostimulator,
             infusion pump, etc. that has MR labeling that will not allow the MRI scans per this
             protocol to be completed.

          4. Subject has a high voltage lead revision incidence within 60 days of the enrollment
             visit

          5. Subject has other non-MRI compatible device or material implanted NOTE: MRI compatible
             knee replacements, hip replacements, stents, etc. may be included as long as the
             labeling of these devices allow MRI scans conducted per this protocol NOTE: MRI
             compatible mechanical, prosthetic, and bioprosthetic heart valves may be included as
             long as the labeling of these devices allow for MRI scans conducted per this protocol
             NOTE: Non-removable dental implants may be included

          6. Subject has a lead extender, adaptor, or capped/abandoned lead

          7. Subject is enrolled or intend to participate in a clinical drug and/or device study
             (investigational device, investigational drug, new indication for a device or drug or
             additional testing beyond standard of care procedures), which could confound the
             results of this trial as determined by SJM.

          8. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the duration of the
             subject's participation in the study

          9. Subject has a life expectancy of less than 12 months due to any condition

         10. Subject has exclusion criteria required by local law (e.g., age)
