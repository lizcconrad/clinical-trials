  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bleeding is the most significant cause of maternal death worldwide with more than half of
      those occurring within the first day of delivery. About 10.5% (some estimate as high at
      12-17%) of live births world-wide, or about 14 million births, are complicated by postpartum
      hemorrhage; a woman dies every 4 minutes from postpartum hemorrhage. Uterine atony and
      placenta accreta are the two leading causes of postpartum hysterectomies with up to 64% of
      Cesarean hysterectomies done for abnormally adherent placentation

      No previous studies performed for evaluation of the effect of those procedures on the uterine
      cavity or uterine blood flow. Most of the studies in the literature evaluated the menstrual
      and fertility outcome after conservative measures for intraoperative hemorrhage due to
      placenta previa/accreta were retrospective and depend on the resumption of menses and
      pregnancy rate

    <description>Color Doppler ultrasound will be used to demonstrate the main ascending branches of left and right uterine arteries as they cross over the hypogastric vessels just before they enter the uterus at the uterine-cervical junction. The high pass filter was set at 125 Hz and the uterine artery will be obtained immediately after the crossing of the hypogastric artery. The sample volume will be placed on the artery with an angle of about 0°. After detection of blood flow and visu¬alization of the waveform of the uterine artery, five blood flow indices will be automatically cal¬culated:
The pulsatility index The resistance index The peak systolic velocity ; The end-diastolic velocity The time-averaged maximum</description>
