  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional design investigation focused on the socio-demographic, clinical and
      psychosocial characterization of Portuguese people with haemophilia (PWH). All PWH,
      registered in the Portuguese Hemophilia Association (APH) will be identified in APH
      registries and contacted through mail, in order to be invited to participate in the first
      Portuguese survey on haemophilia. In case of acceptance, patients must sign the Informed
      Consent, fill in the questionnaires and send both back to the investigation team through a
      pre-paid envelope in the national mail system.

      PWH of all ages are invited to participate in this survey. Adults (aged 18 and over) and
      children/youth from 10 to 17 will answer the questionnaires by self report. Parents of small
      children (0 to 9) will fill in the proxy versions. All questionnaires are adapted for the
      specific age groups.

      This study will comply with ethic guidelines and was approved by the Life Sciences and Health
      Ethics Subcommittee (University of Minho) and is registered on the Portuguese authority for
      data collection (CNPD).
