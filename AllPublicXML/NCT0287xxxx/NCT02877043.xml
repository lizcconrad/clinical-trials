    <textblock>
      In 2009, centres that carried out lung resection for cancer were required to obtain
      authorization following the first cancer plan. One of the criteria to obtain authorization
      was the volume of activity: the centre had to carry out at least 30 lung resections per year
      for cancer. Five years later, it would be useful to know the impact of this new organization
      of oncology on the quality of care. To answer this question, the PMSI database is an ideal
      source of an indicator of quality: in-hospital mortality. This observational cohort study
      will be conducted using the national PMSI database with data covering the period from 1st
      January 2005 to 31st December 2013. It will be limited to hospitalization for lung resection.
      The time will be divided into 3 periods: 2005-2007, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013; the period
      2008-2010 includes the implementation of authorizations for cancer surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Any patients who underwent lung resection for bronchial cancer will be included in this
        study. The PMSI (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information) database will be
        searched for all patients with:

          -  A principal diagnosis of ICD10 (international classification of diseases) codes for
             bronchial cancer

          -  And CCAM (Classification Commune des Actes médicaux ) procedure codes for lung
             resection (segmentectomy, lobectomy, pneumonectomy).
