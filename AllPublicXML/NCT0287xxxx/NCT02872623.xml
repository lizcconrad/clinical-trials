  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early diagnosis of tumors of the small intestine is a challenge for clinicians and for
      radiologists. The detection of tumors of the small intestine is a field in which the video
      capsule endoscopy has the lowest performance.

      The entero-CT with enteroclysis is the imaging technique used primarily to explore patients
      with a strong suspicion of small intestine tumors. However the entero-CT with enteroclysis
      has disadvantages : it is irradiating, the nasojejunal tube implies a discomfort to the
      patient and it is a complicated examination in terms of logistics with necessity of specific
      equipment to insert the nasojejunal tube.

      MRI has been proposed as an alternative imaging technique and satisfactory results have been
      reported with the MRI enteroclysis. However, this technique has several disadvantages related
      to nasojejunal tube insertion and the necessity of equipment compatible with the high
      magnetic fields. The enterography-MRI without enteroclysis, whose principle is to distend the
      small intestine by ingestion of large quantities of a liquid, has a major and undisputed role
      in the exploration of Crohn's disease of the small bowel. However, its capacity for
      distension of the small intestine for optimal tumor detection is questioned and its role in
      tumor detection is largely unknown.
