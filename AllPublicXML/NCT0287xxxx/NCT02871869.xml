  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as the most common subtype non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
      has great heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, histological morphology and prognosis.
      R-CHOP Protocol (Rituximab + Vindesine + Cyclophosphamide + Epirubicin + Prednisone) is the
      gold therapeutic criteria for patients with NHL, and it is also used as the first-line
      treatment for patients with DLBCL. After treatment, 50％～60％of patients with DLBCL receive
      complete remission (CR), 30％～40％ recurrent and 10% will never be cured due to initial and
      secondary drug tolerance. This study aimed to explore whether Cinobufacini Tablets had
      synergistic effect in the treatment of DLBCL, and whether its action was in close association
      with the positive expression of Na+/K+-ATPase α3, and to observe the rates of adverse
      reactions induced by Cinobufacini Tablets during treatment.

      Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as the most common subtype non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
      accounts for 30％～40％ of adults with NHL, and has great heterogeneity in clinical
      manifestations, histological morphology and prognosis. R-CHOP Protocol (Rituximab + Vindesine
      + Cyclophosphamide + Epirubicin + Prednisone) is the gold therapeutic criteria for patients
      with NHL, and it is also used as the first-line treatment for patients with DLBCL. After
      treatment, 50％～60％of patients with DLBCL receive complete remission (CR), 30％～40％ recurrent
      and 10% will never be cured due to initial and secondary drug tolerance. The study of Tao Wu
      et al in domestic showed that cinobufacini combined with CHOP protocol had excellent efficacy
      in the treatment of NHL, with response rate reaching up to 91.7%, and the adverse reactions
      were mild and tolerable, whereas the response rate of single CHOP was only 62.5%. In the
      clinical practice of our studies, it was also found that some patients with recurrent DLBCL
      NHL also had shrunken or disappeared tumors and a survival time of more than 2 years after
      single administration of cinobufacini tablets for 3~6 months following the withdrawal of
      chemotherapy. This study aimed to explore whether Cinobufacini Tablets had synergistic effect
      in the treatment of DLBCL, and whether its action was in close association with the positive
      expression of Na+/K+-ATPase α3, and to observe the rates of adverse reactions induced by
      Cinobufacini Tablets during treatment.
