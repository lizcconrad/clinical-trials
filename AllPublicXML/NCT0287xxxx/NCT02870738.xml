  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) have debilitating urinary
      frequency and urgency, and chronic pelvic or bladder pain perceived to be related to the
      bladder. Although many clinicians think that IC/BPS symptoms result from a bladder problem,
      tight pelvic floor muscles can cause similar symptoms and might be responsible for ICBPS
      symptoms instead of the bladder. Inadequate assessment of the problem leads to delays in
      treatment and often years of suffering. This clinical trial will test a bladder directed
      therapy (bladder instillations) compared to a course of pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT)
      to assess the role of the pelvic floor as a major contributor to pelvic pain and voiding
      dysfunction in adult women with non-ulcerative IC/BPS. Early assessment of the pelvic floor
      muscles in patients with IC/BPS symptoms may prevent common delays in proper diagnosis and
      allow for early, more effective treatment.

      This will be a prospective randomized trial of pelvic floor therapy vs. bladder directed
      therapy. The study target population consists of females, aged 18 to 85 years of age with a
      clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS and symptoms of chronic urinary frequency, pelvic
      pain/discomfort, and/or urinary urgency. The approximate number of subjects that will be
      enrolled in the study is 128, 64 women in each treatment group. Women who satisfy all of the
      eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and randomized to receive bladder
      treatments (instillation of medications into the bladder) or pelvic floor physical therapy.

      Outcome measures will include validated questionnaires, voiding diaries, and Global Response
      Assessment (GRA). The investigators also will evaluate changes in pelvic floor muscle tone
      and discomfort pre and post treatment, and their relationship to symptom changes. Finally,
      the investigators will utilize their well-established urine and serum biomarkers evaluations
      pre and post treatment to determine if they correlate with symptom change.
