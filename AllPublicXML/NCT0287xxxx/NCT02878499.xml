  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to undertake a longitudinal investigation of the
      impact of sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances on cognitive and behavioural trajectories
      in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) age 3-10 years old.

      This innovative study will use objective quantifiable measures of sleep and circadian rhythms
      in addition to subjective measures.

      The investigators aim to assess the hypotheses that, in pre-pubertal children with ASD,

        1. sleep disturbances are correlated with circadian rhythm disturbances;

        2. both sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are negatively correlated with cognitive
           performance and positively correlated with behavioural disturbances;

        3. sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, most notably abnormal melatonin secretion,
           impact the cognitive and behavioural development of children with ASD, depending on age
           (prospective longitudinal analyses).
