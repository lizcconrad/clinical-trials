    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation is a non-inferiority, multicenter, blinding evaluation,
      randomized, parallel controlled clinical study enrolling up to 440 subjects. All subjects
      will be randomized 1:1 to receive the BIOTRONIK Orsiro SES or the Abbott Xience Prime™ EES,
      in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SES drug eluting stent in the treatment
      of coronary artery disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical or call follow up visits will take place at 1, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months post
      procedure. At 9 months (+ 30 days) all subjects will undergo a standard quantitative coronary
      angiography (QCA) follow up to assess the in-stent LLL as the main efficacious evaluation.
      Use the major adverse cardiac event (death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis)
      within one year post procedure as the main safety indicators to evaluate the investigational
      product's safety. The clinical and angiographic data sorting, calculation and statistical
      analysis will be conducted by an independent data management center and angiographic core
      laboratory.
