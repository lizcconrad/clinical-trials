  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy is
      non inferior to non invasive ventilation (NIV) in the immediate treatment of patients with
      acute hypercapnic cardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with respiratory failure in the
      emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective multicenter study including ED patients with a suspected diagnosis of acute
      hypercapnic pulmonary edema with respiratory failure who require NIV according to the joint
      recommendations from the French society of anaesthesia and intensive care and the French
      society for intensive care.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to NIV or high flow nasal oxygen therapy, with
      stratification on center and severity of hypercania.

      Assigned Treatment will be administered during at least one session of 1hr and resumed as
      needed based on the patient's signs of respiratory distress and blood gas results Repeat
      evaluation of arterial blood gases, clinical parameters and dyspnea will be performed before
      and after the first and second hour of treatment according to current recommendation from the
      French society of anesthesia and intensive care medicine (SFAR).

    <description>In the optiflow group, oxygen will be administered through a heated humidifier (Airvo 2, Fisher and Paykel healthcare) and applied through large bore binasal prongs. Initial gas flow rate will be set at of 60 l/min and adjusted to 40-50 l/min based on patient's tolerance. FiO2 will be adjusted to maintain an SpO2 ≥ 92%. Initial temperature will be set at 37° and reduced according to patient's tolerance.</description>

    <description>In the NIV group, NIV will be delivered through a face mask connected to a ventilator with pressure support applied in a noninvasive ventilation mode. The Pressure-support level will be adjusted to obtain an expired tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg of predicted body weight and a respiratory rate of 25-30 b/min. PEEP (range 5-10 cm of water) and FiO2 will be adjusted to maintain an SpO2 ≥92% and to patient's comfort.</description>
