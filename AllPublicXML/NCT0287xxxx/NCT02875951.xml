  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, non-interventional, non-controlled multicenter observational study to evaluate
      aspects of pharmaceutical care and the treatment of postmenopausal patients with
      hormone-receptor positive, HER2-receptor negative, advanced breast cancer treated with
      everolimus and exemestane.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate medication adherence in postmenopausal,
      hormone-receptor positive, HER2-receptor negative, advanced breast cancer treated with a
      combination of everolimus and exemestane. Additionally, other aspects of the pharmacotherapy,
      with focus on the patient perspective, will be investigated:

        -  Patient satisfaction with treatment information

        -  Patient satisfaction with treatment

        -  Health-related quality of life

        -  Treatment efficacy

        -  Treatment-related toxicity

        -  Patient follow-up by the oncologic team/general practitioner and or specialized home
           nurses

      This study should reveal information necessary for the development of pharmacotherapeutic
      care concepts that meet the needs of cancer patients treated with an oral anti-cancer drug
      over a long period.
