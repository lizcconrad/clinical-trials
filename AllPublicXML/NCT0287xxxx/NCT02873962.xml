  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating two drugs called Nivolumab and Bevacizumab as a possible
      treatment for relapsed Relapsed Ovarian, Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Cancers are recognized by the immune
      system, and under some circumstances,the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors.
      An antibody is a natural protein made by our immune system that binds other proteins and
      molecules to fight infection and its ill effects.

      Nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active
      against Cancer. Bevacizumab is an antibody that works by stopping the formation of blood
      vessels.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Nivolumab for Relapsed
      Ovarian, Fallopian Tube Or Peritoneal Cancer but it has been approved for other uses.

      Bevacizumab has been FDA approved when used together with chemotherapy for the treatment of
      Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, Or Primary Peritoneal Cancer that has returned within 6 months of a
      chemotherapy that contains a platinum drug.

      The combination of Nivolumab and Bevacizumab has not been approved by the FDA in any setting.

             chemotherapy. Participants with platinum-sensitive disease who have experienced
             relapse within 6 to 12 months after the last dose of platinum-based chemotherapy are
             eligible.

          -  Participants must have received no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens. There is
             no limit to the number of prior hormonal therapies.

             menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral

             sterile must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less
             than 40 mIU/mL to document postmenopausal status.

          -  Nivolumab and bevacizumab may both cause fetal harm or risk to human pregnancy. For
             this reason WOCBP must agree to use appropriate method(s) of contraception for 6
             months after the last dose of study treatment, per FDA recommendations on use of
             contraception following bevacizumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L
             or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of study treatments.

          -  Women must not be breastfeeding

          -  Participants are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and
             inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic
             replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day
             prednisone equivalents, in the absence of active autoimmune disease. A brief course of
             corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of
             non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by
             contact allergen) is permitted.
