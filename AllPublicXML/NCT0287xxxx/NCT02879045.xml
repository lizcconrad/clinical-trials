      Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy of Elasticity Belly® oil and Clarins® Tonic Body
      Treatment Oil on the occurrence and severity of striae gravidarum.

      Design: Parallel randomized controlled clinical trial. Setting: Gynaecology and Obstetrics
      department, Shanghai Changning Maternity and Infant Health Hospital, China Interventions: We
      will enroll about 50 Nulliparous women randomly, who are in their second trimester of
      pregnancy. Volunteer's abdomen skin are divided into two parts through medioventral line,
      half of the abdomen skin will receive the elasticity Belly® oil to prevent striae gravidarum,
      and the other side will use the Clarins® Tonic Body Treatment Oil. Volunteers apply these two
      kinds of oil daily until gestational age of 38—40 weeks. We'll take abdomen pictures before
      and after interventions, and the occurrence of striae on abdominal skin and its severity will
      be evaluated as our primary outcome of the study.
