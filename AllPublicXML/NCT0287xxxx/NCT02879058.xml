  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether use of intraoperative ultrasound during laparoscopic or robotic
      myomectomy impacts quality of life. Half of participants will undergo laparoscopic or robotic
      myomectomy with use of the intraoperative ultrasound and half will undergo traditional
      laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In full acknowledgement of the correlation between complete leiomyoma exeresis and symptom
      relief, the investigators hypothesize that use of contact ultrasonography at the time of
      laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy will enable improved identification and extraction of
      uterine fibroids which will, in turn, lead to a greater improvement in quality of life among
      those women who receive intraoperative ultrasound compared to those who do not. In this
      blinded randomized controlled trial, the investigators will augment traditional laparoscopic
      and robotic myomectomy with intraoperative ultrasound in half the symptomatic patients
      enrolled in the study. The other half will be randomized to undergo laparoscopic or robotic
      myomectomy without use of intra-operative ultrasound. Both groups will complete Uterine
      Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life (UFS- QOL) questionnaires before and after surgery (6
      months post procedure) to determine whether use of laparoscopic contact ultrasonography has a
      positive impact on patients' quality of life.

    <description>In patients randomized to myomectomy with contact ultrasonography, the laparoscopic or robotic ultrasound probe will be advanced through an existing port site into the pelvis after traditional myomectomy has been performed. The face of the ultrasound transducer will be guided over the uterus (including open hysterotomy sites) in systematic strokes, taking special care to note locations of myomas that may have been missed by the preceding excision. Additional hysterotomy sites will be made as necessary in order to remove persistent myomas. Any number of additional ultrasound passes and excisions may be performed in order to achieve the most comprehensive removal of myomas.</description>
