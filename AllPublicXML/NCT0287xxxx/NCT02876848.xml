  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: In women with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine
      therapy (AET) is associated with a significant survival advantage. Nonadherence is a
      particular challenge in older women, even though they stand to benefit the most from AET.
      Therefore, a novel e-health tool (OPTIMUM) that integrates real-time analysis of health
      administrative claims data was developed to provide point-of-care decision support for
      clinicians.

      Objectives: 1) To determine the effectiveness of a patient-specific, real-time e-health
      alerts delivered at point-of-care in reducing rates of AET discontinuation and to understand
      patient-level factors related to AET discontinuation. 2) To assess integration of e-health
      alerts regarding deviations from best practices in administration of AET by cancer care
      teams.

      Methods: A prospective, two group controlled comparison pilot study will be conducted at two
      urban, McGill University-affiliated hospitals, the Royal Victoria Hospital and St. Mary's
      Hospital. A minimum of 43 patients per study arm will be enrolled through site-level
      allocation. Follow-up is 1.5 years. Healthcare professionals at the intervention site will
      have access to the e-health tool which will report to them in real-time: medical events with
      known associations to AET discontinuation, AET adherence monitor, and a discontinuation
      alert.

Note that this action is different than the outcome &quot;arrange for return to clinic with doctor&quot; because this outcome occurs when a nurse directly schedules a patient to see a specific doctor without discussing with a doctor first.</description>

Note that &quot;ignore the alert&quot; is an explicit option that care teams can specify. They will be trained to understand that the &quot;ignore the alert&quot; option represents that the patient has not discontinued AET treatment and that they are of the opinion that the patient is not at risk of discontinuing AET treatment despite reading the alert.</description>

Note that this &quot;no changes&quot; is an explicit option that care teams can specify. They will be trained to understand that the &quot;no changes&quot; option represents that the patient requires other considerations beyond adhering to AET such as is stopping AET for upcoming surgery or no longer is indicated for AET based on disease progression (for e.g., brain metastases).</description>
