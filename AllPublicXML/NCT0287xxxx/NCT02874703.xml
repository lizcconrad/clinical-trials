  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators plan to test two potential mechanisms contributing to diastolic
      dysfunction among asymptomatic persons with HIV who are on cART. The first proposed mechanism
      is that heightened systemic immune activation/inflammation in HIV contributes to myocardial
      inflammation, which in turn promotes myocardial fibrosis. The second mechanism is that
      ectopic fat deposition (increased visceral adiposity) in HIV relates to increased
      intramyocardial lipid content, which in turn contributes to diastolic dysfunction. Both HIV
      positive and HIV-negative participants will undergo cardiac MRI/ MRS imaging studies for
      evaluation of myocardial fibrosis, myocardial inflammation, and intramyocardial lipid
      content. Traditional markers of CVD risk, inflammatory markers/immune, hormonal markers, and
      markers of myocardial stretch/injury will be assessed in relation to cardiac MRI/MRS
      outcomes.
