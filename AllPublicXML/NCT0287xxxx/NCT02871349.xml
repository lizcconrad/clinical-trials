  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how the brain of people with autism is affected by
      Propranolol. Propranolol is not FDA approved for the treatment of autism. Propranolol is FDA
      approved for the treatment of heart conditions such as blood pressure

      This research is being done because there are currently no drug treatment options for
      language impairments and social difficulties often experienced by people with autism.

      The specific aim of this study is to examine the effects of serial doses of propranolol on
      social interaction, and secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and
      global function in high functioning adults and adolescents with autism in a double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also examine whether response to treatment
      can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic functioning, such as skin conductance, heart
      rate variability (HRV), and the pupillary light reflex (PLR), and whether anxiety can predict
      treatment response. The hypothesis is that social functioning and language abilities will
      benefit from serial doses of propranolol, and that those with the greatest degree of
      autonomic dysregulation, or the lowest functional connectivity, will demonstrate the greatest
      benefit from the drug.
