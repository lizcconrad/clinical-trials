  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study aims to evaluate the efficacy of exposure-based
      Internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy for children 8-12 years with Functional
      Abdominal Pain Disorders. The children participate along with their parents, who will also
      receive specific modules with information on how to support their children in the treatment.
      Predictors and mediators for treatment effects will be studied as well as the cost
      effectiveness of the intervention.

    <description>Children and parents will receive 10 weekly modules of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Parents will also receive 10 weekly modules. Main components in the children's modules are exposure for abdominal symptoms, feared stimuli and situations in which the children are afraid of having symptoms. The parental receive information on how they can support their children in the treatment and how to reinforce health y behaviors and decrease attention to pain behaviors. Therapist support is provided through written messages within the secure platform.</description>
