        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC (squamous or
             non-squamous) with positive expression of MAGE-A3 (primary or metastatic lesion).

          2. Phase 1: Have radiographic progression after treatment with at least 1 cycle of
             platinum-doublet chemotherapy and/or at least 1 treatment of PD-1 or PD-L1 antibody
             targeted therapy. Adjuvant therapy will count as regimen if administered within 1 year
             before relapse.

             Phase 2: Have radiographic progression after first line treatment with at least 1
             cycle of platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Adjuvant therapy will count as a regimen if
             administered within 1 year before relapse.

          3. Patients with tumors of non-squamous NSCLC histology that have a known epidermal
             growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation and/or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
             translocation can participate in this study if they have failed the appropriate
             tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (intolerance or documented progression of their NSCLC)
             and have documented progression of their NSCLC on platinum doublet chemotherapy. There
             is no preferred order of treatment with TKI or platinum doublet therapy. If a patient
             is found to have one molecular alteration (either sensitizing EGFR mutation or ALK
             translocation), then testing for the other alteration is not required.

          4. Have measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1 criteria as determined by the site study
             team. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered measurable
             if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.

          5. Have at least one tumor amenable to biopsy. If a patient does not have a safely
             accessible tumor for biopsy, study entry requires permission from the sponsor.

          6. Have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.

          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function:

               1. White blood cell (WBC) count ≥3,000 cells/mm3

               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1,500 cells/mm3

               4. Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/mm3

               5. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) OR direct bilirubin ≤ULN for
                  patients with total bilirubin levels &gt;1.5 x ULN

               6. Aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤2.5 x ULN; ≤5.0 x
                  ULN if patient has liver metastases

               7. Serum chemistries sodium, potassium, and calcium within normal limits (WNL) or
                  Grade 1

               8. Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min for patient with
                  creatinine levels &gt;1.5 institutional ULN according to Cockcroft-Gault formula

               9. Serum phosphate &gt;0.8 mmol/L (Grade 0-1)

              10. International normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 x ULN unless patient is receiving
                  anticoagulant therapy as long as prothrombin time (PT) or partial prothrombin
                  time (PTT) is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants

              11. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 x ULN unless patient is
                  receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range
                  of intended use of anticoagulants

          8. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.
             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy
             test will be required.

          9. Female patients of childbearing potential (refer to Section 9.E.2.c) must be willing
             to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 9.E.2.c, starting on

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the patient.

         10. Male patients of reproductive potential (Section 9.E.2.c) must agree to use an
             adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 9.E.2.c, starting with the
             first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

             Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred
             contraception for the patient.

         11. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.

         12. Be 18 years of age (or legal age of majority in the jurisdiction) on day of signing
             informed consent.

          5. Has had prior chemotherapy, or targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ to Grade 1 or to
