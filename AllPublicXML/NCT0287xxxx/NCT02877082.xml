  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tacrolimus, bortezomib, and anti-thymocyte globulin
      (thymoglobulin) work in preventing low toxicity graft versus host disease (GVHD) in patients
      with blood cancer who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Tacrolimus and
      anti-thymocyte globulin may reduce the risk of the recipient's body rejecting the transplant
      by suppressing the recipient's immune system. Giving bortezomib after the transplant may help
      prevent GVHD by stopping the donor's cells from attacking the recipient. Giving tacrolimus,
      bortezomib, and anti-thymocyte globulin may be a better way to prevent low toxicity GVHD in
      patients with blood cancer undergoing donor stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine a composite end point of alive and severe acute GVHD free at 6 months
      following human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched related or unrelated donor hematopoietic
      peripheral blood transplant in patients with hematologic malignancies who receive the
      immunosuppressive combination tacrolimus, bortezomib, anti-thymocyte globulin (TBT) as GVHD
      prophylaxis.

      II. To determine the safety of this combination in the first six months post-transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cumulative incidence of grade III-IV aGVHD.

      II. To determine incidence and severity of chronic GVHD.

      III. To determine disease relapse or progression overall and disease free survival at one
      year.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tacrolimus intravenously (IV) on day -3 through day 180. Patients may
      receive tacrolimus orally (PO) later at the doctor's discretion. Patients receive
      anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -3, -2, and -1 and bortezomib IV on day 0 and day 3.
      Patients undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months and then
      periodically for up to 2 years.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment. All AEs occurring during this study, whether observed by the physician, nurse, or reported by the patient, will be graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded on protocol-specific case report forms. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any expected or unexpected adverse event (AE, generally equivalent to CTCAE grades 3, 4 or 5) that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening event
In-patient hospitalization (not required as part of the treatment) or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Cancer

        <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical experience or change of an existing condition that occurs during or after treatment. All AEs occurring during this study, whether observed by the physician, nurse, or reported by the patient, will be graded per NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded on protocol-specific case report forms. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any expected or unexpected adverse event (AE, generally equivalent to CTCAE grades 3, 4 or 5) that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening event
In-patient hospitalization (not required as part of the treatment) or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Congenital anomaly/birth defect
Cancer
