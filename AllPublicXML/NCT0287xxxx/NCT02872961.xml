      PURPOSE: This study will evaluate the relationships between small intestinal bacterial
      overgrowth (SIBO), immune activation, inflammation, and symptoms in pediatric abdominal
      pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), i.e., irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), &amp; functional abdominal pain (FAP), to better understand the
      role of SIBO in their pathogenesis. DESIGN &amp; PROCEDURES: Cross-sectional study. Subjects:
      Patients followed at the UT-Houston Pediatric GI clinic, aged 4-17 years, undergoing
      endoscopic evaluation of abdominal pain, meeting Rome III diagnostic criteria for IBS, FD, or
      FAP, without evidence of an organic etiology of abdominal pain upon routine laboratory,
      radiologic, endoscopic, histologic evaluation. Sample Size: At least 30 patients, ≥ 15 with
      SIBO (i.e., positive small bowel aspirate culture and/or glucose breath hydrogen test), and
      ≥15 without SIBO. Sample Materials: Small bowel biopsies and aspirates, serum, breath
      samples, symptom questionnaire responses. Measures: 1) Immune activation &amp; inflammation -
      measured by serum cytokine levels &amp; small intestinal tissue inflammatory cell infiltration &amp;
      cytokine levels. 2) Symptoms - measured by Abdominal Pain Index, Wong-Baker FACES™ Pain
      Rating Scale, Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms - Rome III Version. 3)
      Small bowel microbiota analysis - assessed by 454 pyrosequencing. RISKS &amp; POTENTIAL BENEFITS:
      Aside from the risks associated with routine endoscopy with biopsies, which would occur even
      without study enrollment, the risks associated with serum collection, one extra biopsy
      specimen collection, small bowel aspirate collection, completion of pain scales/
      questionnaires, and the glucose breath hydrogen test for the purposes of the study are
      minimal. POTENTIAL IMPACT: This study should yield valuable information regarding the
      relationships between SIBO, immune activation, inflammation, and symptoms in pediatric IBS,
      FD, and FAP. Potential biomarkers to support the diagnosis of these FGIDs and novel targets
      for therapy, such as immune molecules and previously unrecognized bacterial phylotypes and
      species possibly contributing to disease pathogenesis, may be identified. Also, determining
      the reliability of the glucose breath hydrogen test vs. small bowel aspirate culture in the
      diagnosis of SIBO in this setting may enable the physician to avoid invasive and costly
      procedures in the diagnostic work-up of children with these FGIDs.

    <measure>Abdominal Pain Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To further evaluate symptom severity, on the day of endoscopic evaluation, each subject (or the legal guardian, when appropriate) will be asked to complete the Abdominal Pain Index, which is comprised of five items assessing the frequency, duration, and intensity of abdominal pain episodes the subject has experienced during the previous two weeks. This index was previously validated as a clinical measure of abdominal pain in pediatric patients. Responses to the five pain ratings are standardized, and the Z-scores are averaged to yield an index of abdominal pain.</description>

    <measure>Duodenal fluid microbiota</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Small bowel aspirate specimens of 10 patients from each group (20 total samples) will be randomly selected for further analysis. The tubes will be batched, and the preserved samples will be processed (via microbial DNA extraction, followed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplification via PCR), after which deep pyrosequencing analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes will be performed. Pyrosequencing data is processed using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) pyrosequencing pipeline (http://pyro.cme.msu.edu/). Statistical differences in the diversity and phylogenetic composition of bacteria in the specimens will be assessed by using the online analysis tools at the RDP pyrosequencing pipeline website and by using both the standard and quantitative UniFrac analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum biomarker levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Levels of key circulating gut biomarkers of inflammation will be measured in serum samples; specifically, levels of IL-1-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN-γ,TNF-α, and osteoprotegerin), intestinal barrier function (TIMP-1), and GI motility (BDNF) will be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duodenal tissue inflammatory cell infiltration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mucosal immune cells from duodenal biopsy specimens will be characterized using Giemsa staining for identification of mast cells and antibodies directed against CD4, CD8 (T-cell markers), and CD20 (B-cell marker) using accepted methods for immunohistochemistry. Quantification of immune cells will be performed on both the hematoxylin and eosin (e.g., total immune cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) and immunohistochemically stained sections (e.g., mast cells, T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duodenal tissue toll-like receptor expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Small intestinal toll-like receptor expression will be determined via immunohistochemical staining using established protocols. Levels of the following toll-like receptors will be checked: TLR-2, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-9 as these toll-like receptors recognize bacterial ligands and are elevated in inflammatory conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duodenal tissue cytokine levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The following cytokine levels will be measured in the small intestinal tissue lysate: Human IL-1-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IFN-γ, and TNF-α.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>To further assess the subject's abdominal pain severity, on the day of endoscopic evaluation, each subject (or the legal guardian, when appropriate) will be asked to rate the subject's current pain, average pain over the preceding two weeks, and worst pain experienced during the preceding two weeks using the Wong-Baker FACES™ Pain Rating Scale. This scale has been validated for use in children and consists of faces showing varying degrees of discomfort, along with corresponding descriptions of the pain and numbers to rate pain.</description>
