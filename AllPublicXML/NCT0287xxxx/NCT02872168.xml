  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent in-vitro and in-vivo studies performed by one of the investigators (ESO, ICMPE, UPEC,
      France) have recently allowed to synthetize a new and easy-to-synthesized chemical compound
      of the furosemide (pyridinium furosemide) during furosemide degradation by electro-Fenton or
      bioconversion. The biological properties of pyridinium furosemide are currently under
      investigation. Furosemide is a diuretics currently used in the treatment of patients with
      heart failure. The goal of the investigators is to assay pyridinium furosemide in urine of
      patients treated by furosemide to demonstrate that pyridinium is or not a metabolite of
      furosemide in humans. This study will contribute to assess the fate of pharmaceutical
      residues of furosemide in the environment.
