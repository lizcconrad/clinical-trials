    <textblock>
      The nodal involvement in squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract (VADS) is
      one of the main factors of poor prognosis, justifying the surgical management of neck
      dissection as a reference treatment.

      Under the influence of the American Hayes Martin, it was considered until the 1960s that
      &quot;over the intervention was, the greater the chance of recovery was&quot;. But has since been
      developed by the Argentine Osvaldo Suarez the concept of functional course, which consists of
      resection of lymph node tissue while retaining the main structures (muscles, nerves,
      vessels), as opposed to the recess radical which is reserved for the invasive metastasis.

      In addition to these notions, our job is to evaluate the quality of life of patients with
      SCCHN, N0 clinical and radiological, enjoying a functional neck dissection including IIb
      sector to support the approach which would be to stop the systematic inclusion of this
      territory.
