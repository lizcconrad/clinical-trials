    <textblock>
      A comparison of caries detection rates between conventional intraoral bitewing radiography
      and a stationary intraoral digital tomosynthesis (s-IOT) using a carbon nanotube X-ray source
      array. The secondary objective is to assess participants experience with the s-IOT device.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare caries detection rates between conventional
      intraoral bitewing radiography and a stationary intraoral digital tomosynthesis (s-IOT) using
      a carbon nanotube X-ray source array. Patient experience with the s-IOT device will be assess
      using a short questionnaire.

      Fifty adult patients who have been referred to the Section of Oral and Maxillofacial
      Radiology (OMR) at the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Dentistry (SOD) for
      horizontal bitewing (BW) radiographs or a Full Mouth Series (FMX) with horizontal bitewing
      radiographs will be recruited for the study.

      Participants will receive an experimental s-IOT bitewing radiograph on each side of their
      mouth and a visual exam to look for caries. Experienced observers will assess the presence or
      absence of caries using the two imaging modalities. The results of their analysis will be
      evaluated to determine statistical difference. Participants completed questionnaires will be
      tabulated and the data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.

    <description>This prospective study is to compare the diagnostic performance (accuracy, specificity and sensitivity) of a stationary intraoral tomosynthesis device using a Carbon Nanotube X-ray source array and a conventional intraoral X-ray device in the diagnosis of interproximal caries. receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis will be used to compare the areas under the curve (AUC).</description>

    <measure>Patient comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>eight months</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire using a five point Likert scale was designed to evaluate participants comfort with the experimental device when compared to the standard device used for bitewing radiography. The survey will be distributed immediately after the examination using the experimental device is completed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years and older

          -  Scheduled for horizontal BW or Full (FMX) with horizontal BWs

          -  Patients who have in the right and left maxilla and mandible at least a canine and two
             posterior teeth that are in contact

          -  At least one proximal caries lesion in a surface of a posterior tooth (premolar or
             molar) that is in contact with another tooth. Lesion depth can be incipient (outer
             half enamel), moderate (inner half enamel) or advanced (outer half dentin) as
             determined by conventional BW radiography.

          -  At least one non-carious proximal surface of a posterior tooth (premolar or molar)
             that is in contact with another tooth.

          -  Patients should be able to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Institutionalized subject (prisoners, nursing home, etc.) (identified by medical
             record)

          -  Critically ill or mentally unstable patients (identified by medical record)

          -  Patients with no radiographic caries of the posterior teeth as determined by
             conventional BW radiographs

          -  Patients with only severe caries lesions as determined by conventional BW radiographs
