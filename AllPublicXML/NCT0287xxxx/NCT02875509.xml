    <textblock>
      One hundred patients, aged from 41 to 78 years, underwent open heart surgery in the years
      1998-1999 and were studied by using the Cellstick device for harvesting wound inflammatory
      cells during the first 24 hours after surgery. The results of the differential count were
      computerized by using artificial neural network for obtaining wound inflammatory cell node
      (WICN). The patients were followed up for sixteen years or to the death. WICN values were
      compared with the patients´ survival.
