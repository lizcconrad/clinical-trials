      This project, will combine the data collected from existing and innovative technologies: fMRI
      scans, mapping brain connectivity using EEG in combination with eye-tracking technology (the
      BNA technology developed by ELMINDA), characterizing of cortical layers using magnetic
      resonance (the CoLI technology developed by Tel-Aviv University), and DTI imaging (imaging of
      brain tracks). To do so, Sheba's Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, joined the project and is
      responsible for recruiting patients from the Department of Neurosurgery and Department of
      Rehabilitation and also is responsible for performing the needed tests.

      This research project is the continuation of the NOFAR project, collaboration between ELMINDA
      and Tel-Aviv University, which included a proof of concept of the technology developed in the
      university to characterize cortical layers using magnetic resonance. In light of the
      promising results, the partners have decided to make another leap forward, and test the
      technology amongst specific patient population who suffered a brain trauma (traumatic brain
      injury, TBI).

      Early and proper diagnosis of brain injury is critical, since it can prevent further
      complications to the patient's health. The tests that are currently available are limited in
      their ability to provide a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the injured brain:
      imaging exams such as CT, MRI and PET help identify the location and severity of the injury
      but cannot provide data on the cognitive and functional effects of the injury. On the other
      hand, neuropsychological tests only allow examination of current cognitive functioning, and
      cognitive decline quantification is done according to mathematical models and subjective
      assessments of the patient and his family. Therefore, this area is lacking and it is
      important to find an objective measure that enables quantification of brain injury that will
      be an indication of cognitive decline.

      The current project, will last two years, and will combine the data collected from existing
      and innovative technologies: fMRI scans, mapping brain connectivity using EEG in combination
      with eye-tracking technology (the BNA technology developed by ELMINDA), characterizing of
      cortical layers using magnetic resonance (the CoLI technology developed by Tel-Aviv
      University), and DTI imaging (imaging of brain tracks). To do so, Sheba's Medical Center, Tel
      Hashomer, joined the project and is responsible for recruiting patients from the Department
      of Neurosurgery and Department of Rehabilitation and also is responsible for performing the
      needed tests.

      The product that will be developed at the end of the Magneton project is expected to be a
      unique analysis method that allows examination and monitoring of the affected brain in both a
      functional and anatomically-structural ultra-high resolution.
