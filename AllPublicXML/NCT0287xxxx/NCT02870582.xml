    <textblock>
      The investigators do the clinical trial (patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated
      with donafenib/placebo after failure of standard therapy) to assess efficacy and safety of
      donafenib in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, progressing after all approved
      standard therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomization,multicentre, phase 3 study recruiting 510 patients. Patients
      were eligible to participate when they have histological or cytological documentation of
      adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. They must have received locally and currently approved
      standard therapies and to have disease progression during or within 3 months after the last
      administration of the last standard therapy or to have stopped standard therapy because of
      unacceptable toxic effects. The available standard therapies have to include as many of the
      following as were licensed: a fluoropyrimidine,oxaliplatin,irinotecan.

      All patients receive best supportive care, excluding other investigational antitumour agents
      or antineoplastic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy.

      Patients receive oral donafenib 300mg (CM4307) on days 1-21 of each 4 weeks cycle until
      disease progression,death,or the unacceptable toxic effects.The primary endpoint is overall
      survival.The second endpoint is progression-free survival.
