  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to examine a moderate hypofractionation regimen of proton beam therapy for high
      risk or unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer. The prostate and seminal vesicles are
      treated with 6750 centigray (RBE) in 25 fractions (i.e. 270 centigray/fraction), while the
      regional pelvic nodes receive 4500 centigray (RBE) in 25 fractions (i.e. 180
      centigray/fraction) simultaneously. The overall treatment time is 5 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Proton beam therapy can provide a therapeutic gain by offering at least equivalent (or
      superior) tumor control while reducing the risk of radiation toxicity, in comparison with
      conventional photon-based external beam radiotherapy, given its dose-deposition
      characteristics. Currently the clinical target volume of proton beam for the treatment of
      prostate cancer has been mostly limited to the prostate and the seminal vesicles. There has
      been no study of proton beam therapy to treat both the primary tumor in the prostate and the
      regional pelvic nodes simultaneously using a moderate hypofractionation regimen.

      The study is a prospective, single-arm, clinical trial to evaluate a moderate
      hypofractionation regimen of proton beam therapy for high risk or unfavorable intermediate
      risk prostate cancer. The clinical target volumes of proton beam therapy include both the
      prostate/seminal vesicles and the regional pelvic nodes. The primary objective is to assess
      late grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity. The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate late grade ≥ 2 GI and GU toxicity, acute grade ≥ 3 GI and GU
      toxicity, and disease-free survival including freedom from PSA (prostate specific antigen)
      relapse at 5 years. The study provides an avenue to examine the safety, efficacy, cost
      effectiveness, and convenience of a moderate hypofractionation regimen (5-week course) of
      proton beam therapy.
