      This study is a multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of
      weekly intravenous infusions of 60 mg/kg of the investigational drug in subjects with AATD.
      The trial will be conducted at approximately 5 medical institutions in Japan, aiming to
      enroll a minimum of 3 adult subjects or more. The trial will consist of a screening period
      scheduled within 3 weeks before trial entry, an open-label treatment period for 8 weeks, and
      a PK evaluation period for 1 week. At the Week 9 visit when the PK evaluation period is
      completed, subjects will be asked whether they would like to participate in an extension
      trial (GTI1401-OLE). For subjects not intending to participate in the extension trial, the
      date of follow-up/study completion visit (30 days [4 weeks] after the last dose of the
      investigational drug) will be arranged. Subjects will participate in this trial for
      approximately 14 weeks from the start of the screening period through the completion of the
      trial.

      At the screening visit (scheduled within 3 weeks before trial entry), after providing
      informed consent (agreement based on adequate explanation and understanding of the treatment
      plan), subjects will be evaluated for eligibility for participation during the screening
      period. Subjects considered eligible will enter the 8-week treatment period to receive a
      total of 8 weekly intravenous infusions of 60 mg/kg of Alpha-1 MP. The initial intravenous
      infusion will be given at the Week 1 (baseline) visit. During the treatment period, subjects
      will receive weekly intravenous infusions of Alpha-1 MP at the Weeks 1 (baseline), 2, 3, 4,
      5, 6, 7, and 8 visits. After the last intravenous infusion of Alpha-1 MP at the Week 8 visit,
      subjects will enter the 1-week PK evaluation period. During this PK evaluation period,
      subjects will visit the study center to undergo blood sampling for PK evaluation at the PK1
      visit (the next day of the Week 8 visit), the PK2 visit (2 days after the Week 8 visit), the
      PK5 visit (5 days after the Week 8 visit), and at the Week 9 visit. At 30 days after the last
      dose (Week 8), subjects will visit the study center for follow-up/study completion (Week 12).
      All subjects will undergo blood sampling for the measurement of alpha1-PI trough
      concentrations at the Weeks 1 (baseline), 7, and 8 visits (blood samples will be collected
      before dosing) as well as at the Week 9 visit.

      Blood samples for the evaluation of PK parameters will be collected from Week 8 to Week 9.
      The blood sample collected before the infusion of Alpha-1 MP at the Week 8 visit and the
      blood sample for PK evaluation collected at the Week 9 visit (7 days after the infusion at
      the Week 8 visit) will be also used for the measurement of alpha1-PI trough concentrations
      for Weeks 8 and 9.

      At the Week 9 visit, subjects will be asked whether they would like to participate in the
      extension trial (GTI1401-OLE). Subjects intending to participate in the extension trial will
      be able to continue the treatment with intravenous infusions of 60 mg/kg of Alpha-1 MP for at
      least another year (subjects will be further asked whether they would like to continue the
      treatment at yearly intervals) for the purpose of evaluation of the safety of long-term
      Alpha-1 MP treatment. Subjects not intending to enter the extension trial will visit the
      study center for follow-up/study completion at 30 days (4 weeks) after the last dose of
      Alpha-1 MP (Week 12).
