    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a tetravalent dengue vaccine
      TetraVax-DV TV005 in adults 50 to 70 years of age with no history of previous flavivirus
      infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses (DENV) are widespread in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
      There are four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4); each can cause
      dengue infection. Infection with dengue viruses can range from mild illness to
      life-threatening disease. TetraVax-DV TV005 (also referred to as TV005) is a live attenuated
      recombinant tetravalent dengue virus vaccine developed to protect against all four dengue
      virus serotypes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of
      TV005 in adults 50 to 70 years of age with no history of previous flavivirus infection.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of either TV005 or
      placebo at study entry (Day 0). After receiving the injection, participants will record their
      temperature 3 times a day through Day 16. Additional study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8,
      10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56, 90, and 180. Visits will include a physical examination and blood
      collection.

          -  Adult flavivirus-naive male or non-pregnant females 50 - 70 years of age, inclusive

          -  Good general health as determined by physical examination, laboratory screening, and
             review of medical history

          -  Available for the duration of the study, approximately 26 weeks post-vaccination

          -  Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing the informed consent
             document

          -  Females only: Female subjects of childbearing potential willing to use effective

             intrauterine device, and abstinence (6 months or longer since last sexual encounter).
             All female subjects will be considered having childbearing potential except for those
             with hysterectomy, tubal ligation, tubal coil (at least 3 months prior to
             vaccination), or post-menopausal status documented as at least 1 year since last
             menstrual period.
