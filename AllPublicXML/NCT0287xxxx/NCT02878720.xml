  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggested that both robot-assisted rehabilitation and non-invasive vagus
      nerve stimulation can improve upper limb function in chronic stroke patients. Aim of present
      study is to explore whether the combination of these two approaches might enhance their
      positive effects on motor recovery. Safety and efficacy of this combination will be assessed
      within a proof-of-principle, double-blinded, randomized, sham-controlled trial.
      Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) will be delivered at left ear, in order to
      improve the response to the following robot-assisted therapy. Patients with both ischemic and
      hemorrhagic chronic stroke will be randomized to robot-assisted therapy associated with real
      or sham tVNS, delivered for 10 working days. Change in Fugl-Meyer has been chosen as primary
      outcome, while changes in several quantitative indicators of motor performance extracted by
      the robot as secondary outcomes.

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve will be performed through an electric stimulator and two Ag-AgCl electrodes placed in the left external acoustic meatus at the inner side of the tragus. For sham stimulation, electrodes will be attached to the left ear lobe. tVNS will be delivered as trains lasting 30 s and composed by 600 pulses (intra-train pulse frequency = 20 Hz; pulse duration = 0.3 ms) repeated every 5 min for 60 min. The intensity of stimulation will individually adjusted to a level ranging above the detection threshold and below the pain threshold. In this range, when possible, the investigators will chose an intensity of 8 mA.
Each day, for 10 consecutive working days, each patient will receive a session of robotic therapy following the real or sham tVNS stimulation</description>
