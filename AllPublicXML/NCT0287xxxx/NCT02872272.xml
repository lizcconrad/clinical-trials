  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The loss of skin barrier function after burn causes increased susceptibility to infections,
      which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Topical antibiotics
      are one part of the therapeutic arsenal available to treat these infections. Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the two major colonizing agents found in this
      population of patients.

      The use of dressings impregnated with amikacin is a common practice. Actually, there are no
      available data on local and systemic effects with this antibiotic. The study of tissue and
      plasma pharmacokinetics of amikacin is therefore very important to secure and optimize this
      singular use of amikacin and improve the care of burn patients.

      The objective of the study is to describe the plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics of amikacin
      after dermal administration and impregnated dressing to estimate the pharmacokinetic
      parameters and their variability in a burned population.

      Secondary objectives are to assess on the one hand the relationship between the effectiveness
      of treatment and the concentration of antibiotic at the site of tissue infection, and on the
      other hand to assess the relationship between plasma concentration and the toxicity found of
      this treatment. We would like also to note the efficacy of the antibiotic treatment in terms
      of: need for repeat surgery (new skin graft), healing time and hospital length of stay.

      Blood samples and skin biopsies will be made for each patient to day 3 and day 7 after the
      start of treatment.

      The knowledge about the tissue concentrations obtained and a possible systemic absorption
      will then provide additional safety data and optimize the conditions of use of these
      dressings (dosage, frequency of administration) for effective treatment and safe.
