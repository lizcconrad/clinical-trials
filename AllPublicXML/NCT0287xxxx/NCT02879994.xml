  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab works in treating patients with epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer that have not received prior
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy and has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may block growth in different ways by targeting certain
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine efficacy (objective response rate [ORR]) of front-line pembrolizumab for
      metastatic EGFR mutation positive programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)+ (&gt; 1% by
      immunohistochemistry [IHC]) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety (adverse event tabulation and grading) of front-line pembrolizumab for
      metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (&gt; 1% by IHC) NSCLC.

      II. Determine efficacy (progression free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) of front-line
      pembrolizumab for metastatic EGFR mutation positive PD-L1+ (&gt;1% by IHC) NSCLC.

      III. Determine ORR, PFS and OS of subsequent EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in
      patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutation after pembrolizumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Analyze tumor tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up at 3 and 6 months, and
      then every 9 weeks thereafter.

             or using an investigational device within 30 days of the first dose of trial
             treatment; the 30 day window should be applied to the last dose of an antineoplastic
             investigational agent or last use of an investigational device with antineoplastic
             intent

          -  Is receiving systemic steroid therapy within three days prior to the first dose of
             trial treatment or receiving any other form of immunosuppressive medication

          -  Has received prior systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, antineoplastic biological therapy
             (e.g., cetuximab), major surgery within 3 weeks of the first dose of trial treatment;

             potentially curative therapy with no evidence of that disease recurrence for 3 years
             since initiation of that therapy; Note: the time requirement for no evidence of
             disease for 3 years does not apply to the NSCLC tumor for which a subject is enrolled
             in this trial; the time requirement also does not apply to subjects who underwent

          -  Has interstitial lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral or
             intravenous glucocorticoids to assist with management; lymphangitic spread of the
             NSCLC is not exclusionary

          -  Has received or will receive a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first

          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial

          -  Is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including &quot;recreational
             use&quot;) of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance
             abuse (including alcohol)

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
