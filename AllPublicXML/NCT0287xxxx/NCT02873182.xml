    <textblock>
      A safety and feasibility study of free-run and stimulated corporal electromyography (EMG) to
      assess autonomic neural function during spinal and/or pelvic surgery in women and men.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety and efficacy trial to assess autonomic neural function monitoring during
      spinal and/or pelvic surgery.

      During standard intraoperative neuromonitoring, additional smooth muscle free-running and
      stimulated EMG will be recorded from corporal tissues (corpus spongiosum) of male and female
      genitalia from individual patients. Throughout the duration of the spinal surgery, the
      neurophysiologist will continuously monitor autonomic function. Smooth muscle free-running
      (continuous) and stimulated EMG will be recorded.

      EMG data and additional demographics and clinical data (e.g. operative time, adverse events)
      will be collected for each patient. The success rates of 1) credible and safe EMG recording
      and 2) positive EMG responses to each stimulation method will be calculated.

    <description>Two intracorporal electrode needles will be inserted beneath the skin of the genitalia. After insertion, the electrodes will be secured and connected by leads to two standard neurophysiological devices for differential amplification, display, and storage. Smooth muscle free-running (continuous) and stimulated EMG will be recorded.</description>
