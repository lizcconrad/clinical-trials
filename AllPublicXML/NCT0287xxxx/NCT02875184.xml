      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional, observational single arm study.

      Two-hundred patients will be recruited in the Netherlands over a one year period. In all
      cases, the decision to treat the patient with apremilast will be made prior to the decision
      to enter the subject into this study. Treatment will be according to routine clinical
      practice and based on recommendations as per the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) of
      apremilast (Otezla®). Each patient will be followed up for a maximum of 24 months.
