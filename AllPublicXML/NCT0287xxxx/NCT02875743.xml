    <textblock>
      Invasive fungal disease (IFD) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients
      undergoing intensive chemotherapy or transplantation.

      This current study aims to assess the impact of prophylactically using the broad-spectrum
      anti-fungal agent posaconazole on the incidence of IFD in high risk patients with aplastic
      anaemia and those undergoing intensive chemotherapy, for example for acute myeloid leukaemia,
      and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
