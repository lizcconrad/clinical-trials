      A prospective, multi-center, randomized, subject and outcome evaluator blind , parallel-group
      study evaluating the effect of pharmacogenetic-guided versus standard of care treatment for
      subjects diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A substantial number of patients taking anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications suffer
      from either a lack of benefit from drug therapy or severe side effects. Clinical features
      often fail to predict the drug response and tolerability of a patient to a prescription
      medication. Genetics can help guide therapeutic decisions for patients exhibiting
      neuropsychiatric disorders and potentially improve patient outcomes by maximizing drug
      efficacy and minimizing the risk of adverse events. Genetics and drug interactions can alter
      both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a multitude of drug compounds and in turn
      influence both the safety and efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens.

      This study is designed to evaluate the clinical impact of pharmacogenetic (PGx)-directed
      treatment. Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection using the IDgenetix Neuropsychiatric Test
      Panel can enhance patient response and tolerability by facilitating the selection of the most
      appropriate medication at the most effective dose in the shortest possible time.

      In this prospective, multi-center, randomized, subject and outcome evaluator blind,
      parallel-group study patients presenting to the clinical site with evidence of depression
      and/or anxiety as determined by a qualified clinician will be invited to participate. Study
      participants will be randomized to one of two groups with respect to the IDgenetix
      Neuropsychiatric Test Panel result: group with testing results revealed to the medical
      provider prior to treatment selection (Experimental Group) or group without testing results
      prior to treatment selection (Control Group). Participant outcomes will be measured at
      baseline and throughout the 3-month duration of the study.
