  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to compare the effects of intra-dialytic low-frequency electrical
      muscle stimulation and intra-dialytic cycling, with usual care haemodialysis without exercise
      training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      End stage renal disease is associated with reduced functional capacity. Dynamic exercise
      training i.e. cycling, performed between dialysis sessions or during dialysis
      (intra-dialytic) can be effective in improving functional capacity and quality of life.
      However, many patients are unable to engage in intra-dialytic cycling due to limiting
      comorbidities. Other exercise modalities should be considered. Low-frequency electrical
      muscle stimulation of the quadriceps is well tolerated and may improve functional capacity in
      clinical populations.

      The trial is a longitudinal, randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomly
      allocated to 10 weeks of 1) intra-dialytic low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation, 2)
      intra-dialytic cycling, or 3) usual care haemodialysis without exercise training. Outcomes
      will be assessed at baseline and 10 weeks by assessors blinded to group allocation.

    <description>Performed twice weekly whilst seated on a standard dialysis chair. Delivered by adhesive electrodes in a neoprene garment, applied bilaterally to the quadriceps and hamstrings. Cardiovascular stimulus via rapid, rhythmical, sub-tetanic contractions. Short bursts of four pulses repeatedly delivered by stimulator at a frequency of 4Hz. Current amplitude adjustable from 40 - 200 mA with inbuilt controller. Conducted for one hour at the maximum tolerable intensity. Five minute warm-up and cool down at a lower frequency (3 Hz).</description>

    <description>Semi-recumbent cycling performed twice weekly whilst seated on a standard dialysis chair. Performed for up to one hour per session, initially at a workload (Watts) equivalent to that achieved at 40-60% VO2 reserve during cardiopulmonary exercise test. Exercise intensity regulated using a combination of heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (12-14). Workload adjusted weekly and controlled with a combination of pedal resistance and cadence to provide a personalised exercise prescription. Five minute warm-up and cool down each session.</description>
