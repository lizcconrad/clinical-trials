    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be centrally randomized to either Arm A (resection of the splenic vein
      after isolation from the pancreatic parenchyma) or Arm B (co-resection of the vein together
      with the pancreas).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In distal pancreatectomy, it is customary to ligate and divide the splenic vein after
      isolating it from the pancreatic parenchyma. This is considered essential to prevent
      disruption of the stump of the splenic vein and the consequent intra-abdominal haemorrhage in
      the event of pancreatic fistula. This procedure can be technically demanding, especially when
      the vein is firmly embedded in the pancreatic parenchyma. The objective of this trial is to
      confirm the non-inferiority of resection of the splenic vein embedded in the pancreatic
      parenchyma compared with the conventional technique of isolating the splenic vein before
      resection during distal pancreatectomy using a mechanical stapler.
