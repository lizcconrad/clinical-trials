  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes of laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy are well known, but data on intra-operative
      adverse events is scant. A multicenter pool-analysis of prospectively collected database on
      1384 patients with internal/external rectal prolapse toke place. Overall 72 (5%) patients
      experienced complications, 41 discovered and managed intraoperatively, 22 postoperative
      complications, and 9 required readmission. Despite accepted lower rate of morbidity, these
      results come from four well equipped European centers by four surgeons practiced at least 200
      LVMR.

      Multicenter pooled-analysis of LVMR for internal/external rectal prolapse. All events
      occurred and discovered intra-operatively or passed undiagnosed and appeared within 30-days
      postoperatively (same admission/readmission) will included, with classification according to
      the Clavien-Dindo classification.
