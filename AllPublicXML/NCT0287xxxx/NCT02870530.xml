      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of of gastric bypass without gastric
      division as a treatment for morbid obesity
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      in this study the investigators aim to test a new technique for gastric bypass as a treatment
      for morbid obesity which is division-less gastric bypass in comparison to mini-gastric
      bypass. in this study 50 patients with morbid obesity will included in the study , randomly
      will divided into 2 group each, group will include 25 patients. group 1 will operated with
      division-less gastric bypass, while group 2 will operated by min-gastric by pass.

    <description>in division-less gastric bypass, the investigators will do the gastric bypass without division of the stomach into 2 part (pouch part and the rest of the stomach that still connected to the duodenum) but the pouch which will anatomised with the small intestine is excluded from within, in comparison to standard mini-gastric bypass so that we try to decrease the cost of stapler and its complication</description>
