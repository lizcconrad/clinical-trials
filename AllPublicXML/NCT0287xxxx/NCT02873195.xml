    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well atezolizumab and capecitabine with or without
      bevacizumab work in treating patients with colorectal cancer that is not responding to
      treatment and has spread to other places. Monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab and
      bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving atezolizumab with capecitabine and bevacizumab may be a better way in
      treating colorectal cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of capecitabine/bevacizumab + atezolizumab, as compared with
      capecitabine/bevacizumab + placebo in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as
      measured by progression-free survival (defined as the time of randomization to the first
      occurrence of progression based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1,
      clinical progression, or death from any cause on study as determined by the investigator).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy of capecitabine/bevacizumab + atezolizumab, as compared with
      capecitabine/bevacizumab + placebo in refractory mCRC as measured by objective response rate
      (defined as partial response plus complete response) as determined by the investigator using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 and immune-related response criteria
      (irRC).

      II. To estimate the efficacy of capecitabine/bevacizumab + atezolizumab as compared with
      capecitabine/bevacizumab + placebo in refractory mCRC as measured by overall survival
      (defined as death from any cause from the time of randomization until study completion).

      III. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab
      and capecitabine in refractory mCRC as measured by the serious adverse events and adverse
      events &gt;= grade 3 according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
      Adverse Events version 4.0.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore any correlation between tissue and blood based biomarkers and clinical
      outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized 2:1 to Arm I:Arm II.

      ARM I (ATEZOLIZUMAB, BEVACIZUMAB, CAPECITABINE): Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously
      (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, and capecitabine
      orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (PLACEBO, BEVACIZUMAB, CAPECITABINE): Patients receive placebo IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1, bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, and capecitabine PO BID on days 1-14.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months
      until progressive disease, then every 6 months thereafter.

    <description>Log rank test will be used to conduct the primary test of hypothesis, superiority PFS for atezolizumab versus placebo. The log rank test will be stratified by the trial stratification factors Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) (0; 1) and RAS status ( wild type [wt]; mutation [mut]). The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate PFS within treatment arms. The 95% confidence interval estimates of PFS at 3 months will also be constructed based on the Kaplan-Meier estimate using Greenwood?s formula. The Cox model will be used to study the potential impact of baseline demographics and tumor characteristics on PFS.</description>
