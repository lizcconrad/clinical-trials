    <textblock>
      The objective of this feasibility study is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using
      an investigational extracorporeal system and catheter to filter hemorrhagic cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) post subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) treatment, and reintroduce the CSF via the
      same catheter.
