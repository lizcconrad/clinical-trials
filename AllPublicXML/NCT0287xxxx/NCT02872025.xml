  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the change in the immune microenvironment of high risk
      ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after short term exposure to pembrolizumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will include 3 dose cohorts using a 3+3 cohort dose escalation design (see figure
      1) followed by a 4th cohort at the maximum tolerated dose. Unless a dose limiting toxicity
      (DLT), defined any grade 3 or 4 toxicity, is observed requiring expansion of a cohort or a
      subject withdraws, 3 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort in the dose escalation phase.
      Subjects, upon diagnosis with high risk DCIS, will be offered 2 doses of pembrolizumab
      injected intralesionally (IL) 3 weeks apart (+/- 1 week) with surgery 3 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)
      after the 2nd dose. The subject will then undergo the surgical treatment as determined by the
      surgeon and the subject (partial mastectomy or mastectomy). The primary objective of this
      phase of the study will be safety and feasibility of intralesional injection of
      pembrolizumab. The maximum tolerated dose will be used in the expansion phase. The expansion
      cohort will have a target enrollment of 30 subjects randomized to either the control group or
      the treatment group. 10 subjects will be randomized to the control group and 20 subjects will
      be randomized to the treatment group. The control group will proceed to surgery alone
      following the diagnosis of high risk DCIS. The treatment group will receive 2 doses of
      intralesional pembrolizumab 3 weeks apart (+/- 1 week) prior to surgery. All subjects in the
      expansion cohort will also undergo a baseline MRI at diagnosis and undergo a 2nd MRI prior to
      surgery. Baseline and pre-surgical MRI images will be evaluated for changes in tumor volume.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
