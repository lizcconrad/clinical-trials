    <description>The program was designed to dispel exaggerated thoughts surrounding the danger of the experience of anxiety symptoms, specifically focusing on fears regarding feelings of cognitive dyscontrol. The psychoeducation portion contains video animation and audio narration throughout, as well as some interactive features . Participants are provided with corrective information about the experience of anxiety-related sensations, with a particular focus on dispelling myths commonly held by individuals with high anxiety sensitivity cognitive concerns . Participants are taught that anxiety-related sensations are not dangerous and that they may have developed a conditioned fear to these symptoms of arousal.</description>
