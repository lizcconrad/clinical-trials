    <textblock>
      Prospective single centre study aiming at validating a conditional imaging strategy for
      diagnosis of suspected kidney stone.

      Consecutive Emergency department patients referred to the medical imaging department for
      exploration of a suspected acute uncomplicated renal colic will undergo the following
      interventions : systematic plain abdominal Xray, systematic ultrasonography and systematic
      unenhanced CT (with a reduced dose scan), in addition to clinical examination and assessment
      of body mass index and the Sex, Timing, Origin, Nausea, Erythrocytes (STONE) clinical
      prediction score for symptomatic stone.

      Patients will be followed up at 1 month to record the need for urologic intervention and its
      type.

      The performances of different conditional imaging strategy for the diagnosis of suspected
      renal colic will be assessed retrospectively. The conditional strategies tested will be based
      on the patient's stone score and BMI and targeted use of combined plain X-ray and
      ultrasonography and/or unenhanced CT.

      The reference diagnosis for renal colic will be made according to the finding of a ureteral
      stone or indirect signs of urolithiasis at unenhanced CT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plain abdominal Xray, Ultrasonography and unenhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis will be
      performed at the time of admission to the imaging department, within 2 days from ED visit and
      within a 1 hour delay from each other.

      Ultrasonography will be interpretated in combination to plain abdominal Xray, and
      independently from unenhanced CT, by two experienced radiologists blinded to the results of
      each other.

    <description>All patients included will undergo ultrasonography in addition to unenhanced CT of pelvis and abdomen and plain X-ray of the abdomen.
Imaging examination will be performed according to current guidelines.
Ultrasonography study and colour doppler will include the kidney, ureterovesical joint and ureters. Unenhanced CT will be performed using a dedicated low-dose protocol.</description>
