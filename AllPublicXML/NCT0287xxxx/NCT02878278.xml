      1. To compare the therapeutic effects, safety and the corresponding pharmacokinetics and
           pharmacodynamics between two different method of drug administration: 10mg, daily and
           30mg/d, twice every week, and find out the more effect way of Chidamide administration.

        2. To examine whether Chidamide could activate EB virus, and whether the above two
           different ways of administration are different in EB virus activation.

      Currently, Chidamide is taken twice a week, this comes from cell experiment and phase I
      clinical trial, which showed that the de-acetylation effect of Chidamide could last for 72
      hours after administration. However, daily administration of Chidamide may create a more
      steady Chidamide concentration, thus improve the de-acetylation effect of Chidamide, so it's
      necessary to compare the two different ways of administration.

      Current study showed that Romidepsin, a HDACI, could activate EBV during the treatment of
      NKTCL, whether Chidamide, as a novel HDACI, could activate EBV is still not clear, so this
      problem is worth to be accessed.
