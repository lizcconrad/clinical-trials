      This study aims to compare the impacts of two versions of a continuing education activity
      targeted at COPD case managers on educational outcomes: 1) participation; 2) satisfaction; 3)
      learning; 4) competence; 5) performance; 6) patient health outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study has a quasi-experimental design. The study is based on the Expanded Outcomes
      Framework for Planning and Assessing Continung Medical Education by Moore (2009). One groupe
      of participants will attend the former version of the continuing education activity, and the
      other group will attend its new version.

      Data will be collected at T0 (before the activity, which will be held at T1); at T2
      (immediately after the activity); at T3 (1-month post-activity); at T4 (2-month
      post-activity); at T5 (4-month post-activity); at T6 (10-month post-activity).

      Participation will be assessed at T0. Satisfaction will be assessed at T2. Learning will be
      assessed at T0 and T3. Competence will be assessed at T2. Performance will be assessed at T4.
      Patient health outcomes will be assessed at T5 and T6.
