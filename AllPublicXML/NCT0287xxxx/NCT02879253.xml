    <textblock>
      This study is part of the french research program ANR NEMRO &quot;MICROROBOTIC NASAL ENDOSCOPY BY
      OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY: IMPACT OF SMELL DEFICIENCY ON NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES.&quot;
      Recent studies have shown a strong correlation between the decrease in olfactory faculties of
      patients and the presence of neurodegenerative diseases.

      This possible relationship has created a need to inspect in detail the area of the nasal
      cavity that houses the olfactory function.

      Thus, the purpose of NEMRO project is developing a robot to explore olfactory slots of
      patients, with a view to extract images through non invasive imaging probe, and hoping to
      identify early signs of degeneration the olfactory tissue. The robot developed will thus be
      able to navigate in the nasal cavity of patients, and to break into the olfactory slots,
      which will host the imaging phase.

      The purpose of this study is therefore to collect data on the usual path of instruments
      (endoscope, for example) in this area, and future potential pathway of the robot. This
      collection made from Computed Tomography (CT) scans will define the clinical geometry of the
      target area and provide precisely the dimensional constraints needed to build the NEMRO robot
      .

        CT scans of men and women &gt; 18 years will be observed. Age selected corresponds to a period
        where the nasal cavity is completely formed, with no more structural and morphological
        changes due to the growth of the individual in the development phase; regarding sex study
        subjects, an equal distribution between men and women is required wherever possible.

        Will be excluded images suggesting a pathology that could interfere with the target
        parameters of the study in the area, according to the opinion of the maxillofacial surgeon
        in charge of the collection (sinusitis, cancer, previous surgery ...).
