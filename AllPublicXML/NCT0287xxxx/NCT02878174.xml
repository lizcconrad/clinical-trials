  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two approaches such as ultrasound (US)-guided and prelocation techniques are possible when
      the internal jugular vein cannulation is attempted with US. This study is a clinical trial
      that compares the success rates of both techniques and shows the non-inferiority of the
      prelocation technique. However, during prelocation technique, rotated screen of the US is
      used instead of original screen. The angle of rotation is determined by the degree of
      rotation of US probe where an accelerometer is attached.

      The investigator's own developed screen-rotating program is used. An accelerometer is
      attached on the front surface of the ultrasound (US) probe. The angle of rotation of the
      probe is delivered to the laptop and becomes the information to adjust the rotating angle of
      screen. Immediately after induction of general anesthesia, the patient's head is turned
      slightly, and the table is tilted at 10 degrees. In the US group, the investigators obtain a
      sonographic view and try a cannulation of the internal jugular vein (IJV). In the prelocation
      group, a skin marker is made on the anticipated skin puncture site where a perpendicular line
      that passes over the center of the IJV meets the skin on the rotated US screen. It is
      recorded &quot;success&quot; when the internal jugular vein is successfully punctured without
      complications. It is recorded &quot;failure&quot; if the internal jugular vein is not punctured during
      repeated needle passes. The number of tries and tile to success are recorded. The success and
      complication rates between two groups are compared.
