  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children and young people are recommended to undertake at least 60 minutes of moderate to
      vigorous intensity physical activity each day. However recent findings have indicated that
      only 51% of children aged 7 years were meeting these guidelines. Previous research has also
      highlighted girls are significantly less active than. Furthermore, children living in
      Northern Ireland are least likely to meet the guidelines, with only 43.4% of children here
      reaching the recommended â‰¥ 60 minutes a day. The development of interventions which can
      successfully increase levels of physical activity in adolescent girls in Northern Ireland is
      of key importance. The aim of this intervention is to investigate whether or not girls (aged
      11-13 years) can increase their daily levels of physical activity over a 12 week period by
      taking part in a school-based brisk walking intervention. The impact of participating in a
      school-based brisk walking intervention on a range of other outcome measures will also be
      investigated. A total sample of 200 adolescent females will be recruited onto the study, with
      recruitment of participants taking place at the school level. Following written consent from
      parents/guardians and assent from participants, participants will be randomised at the school
      level to either participate in the walking intervention or to act as controls. Objective
      physical activity will be assessed at 3 time points using an Actigraph accelerometer. At
      baseline, post-intervention (12 weeks) and follow up (4 months post-intervention)
      participants will also undergo measurements of height, weight, waist and hip circumference,
      bloody pressure, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Participants will also complete
      questionnaires assessing levels of physical activity and a number of psychosocial variables
      at each time point. Following completion of follow up measurements, a sub-sample of
      participants (n=45) will be invited to take part in focus groups to evaluate their
      experiences of the intervention.
