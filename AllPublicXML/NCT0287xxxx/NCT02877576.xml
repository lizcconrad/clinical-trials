  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate specific capacities of face detection of individual neurons by
      comparison with their capacity of object detection in medial temporal lobe and ventral
      temporal cortex in epileptic patients.

      Secondary purpose is to evaluate specific capacities of detection of known faces of
      individual neurons by comparison with their capacity of detection of unknown faces in medial
      temporal lobe and ventral temporal cortex in epileptic patients.

      In this interventional study, patients explored with mixed intracerebral electrodes (micro
      and macro-contacts) will be presented sets of images (objects, unknown faces, famous faces).
      Spikes and Multi-Unit-Activity will be recorded and analyzed and compared between conditions.

    <description>5 macro electrodes with micro electrodes are implanted in internal temporal structures (amygdala, anterior and posterior hippocampus, rhinal cortex, posterior para-hippocampal gyrus).
Each electrode has 8 microcontacts, each recording the activity of 0 to 3 neurons (activity of 0 to 120 neurons/patient).</description>

    <description>Visualization of images of 60 unknown faces and 60 objects that are not faces (object, house, scene, animal, plant, word, letter…). Each image is showed for 500 ms and separated from following image by black screen of 1500 ms. In order to keep patient attention on image, patient will be asked to push a button at color change of fixation cross in the centre of image.</description>

    <description>Visualization of images of celebrities (persons known by patient), showed randomly. Each image is showed for 500 ms and separated from following image by black screen of 1500 ms. In order to keep patient attention on image, patient will be asked to push a button at color change of fixation cross in the centre of image.
Several celebrities are showed, with for each the presentation of 60 images different from that celebrity. 1 to 3 celebrities are showed (60 to 180 total images).</description>
