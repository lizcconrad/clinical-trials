  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis was to check whether baseline anti-E1E2 antibodies were correlated with the
      on-treatment viral kinetics and could predict virological outcome in treatment-experienced
      HCV-infected cirrhotic patients receiving protease inhibitor-based triple therapy.

    <measure>Proportion of patients with positive anti-E1E2 antibody level at treatment initiation</measure>

    <description>Anti-E1E2 antibody levels were determined as previously described (Ndongo et al. Hepatology 2010;52:1531-42) using optical densities obtained after dilution of patients' serum samples at 1/250 and 1/500. Samples with anti-E1E2 levels above 950 (OD value× 1000) were considered positive.</description>
