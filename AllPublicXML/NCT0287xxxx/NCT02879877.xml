             Informed Consent Form

          -  Subjects in the age between 18 and 55 years old with normal weight as determined by a
             body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m^2, with a body weight of at least 50 kg
             for male subjects or 45 kg for female subjects

          -  Subject has clinical laboratory test results within the reference ranges of the
             testing laboratory or outside the reference range of the laboratory but considered as
             not clinically significant by the Investigator

          -  Subjects has blood pressure (BP) and pulse within normal range in a supine position
             after 5 minutes rest

          -  Subject's electrocardiogram (ECG) is considered normal or abnormal but clinically non
             significant

             the study. Subject has any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical
             examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, or ECG, which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may place the subject at risk because of participation in the study.

          -  Tests positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 or-2 antibodies, Hepatitis B
             Virus (HBV) surface antigen, or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody at Screening

             creams on a regular basis

          -  Subject has used NSAID or NSAID-containing medications within 7 days of randomization

          -  Subject has used skin emollients within 7 days of randomization on the area of the
             skin from buttocks

          -  Subject has tattoos, nevi, or other skin abnormalities such as keloids (or history of
             keloids, folliculitis, or acne vulgaris) that may, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             interfere with study assessments.

          -  Subject has been participating in recreational sun-bathing, or use of sun-bed, on the
             area of the skin from buttocks within 7 days of Screening

          -  Subject has active neoplastic disease or history of neoplastic disease within 5 years
             of the Screening Visit

          -  Subject has a history of moderate to severe allergic reaction to medication(s)
             including biologics (for subjects in Cohort 11 only).
