    <textblock>
      This research aims to investigate the feasibility for the treatment of OnPulse(TM) for the
      treatment of faecal incontinence (FI) (including mixed faecal and urinary incontinence) in
      older people living at home or in a Care Home. It will determine patient acceptability,
      tolerability and usability of the T-2 gekoTM device for FI by assessing:

        1. device user factors: acceptability of use, ease of device placement, ease of device
           interface control and understanding of device instructions;

        2. tolerability of device: skin tolerability.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reviewing the views of older people with faecal incontinence and their formal and informal carers on using the CE marked gekoTM tibial nerve stimulator device in their place of usual residence with regards to ease of use of the device and tolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Using semi-structured interview style with a topic guide pre and post treatment with gekoTM device- researching the views of the patients using their own words to describe what they felt using geko device. Interviews will be digitally recorded and professionally transcribed through verbatim. Data will be anonymised and analysed using a pragmatic thematic analysis (1). NVivo will be used to support the analysis.</description>

    <description>digital photos will be takes pre and post treatment with geko TM device. The digital photos will be viewed in random order from each participant by a second researcher blinded as to before or after status, and rated for signs of skin reaction using the categories: none, mild, moderate and severe.</description>
