      A prospective observational study using an interrupted time-series design to evaluate the
      effect of pre-hospital notification on trauma patients arriving at a trauma centre by
      ambulance, in India
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal prospective cohort study of injured patients being transported by
      ambulance to the major trauma centre study sites. In the pre-intervention phase, prospective
      data on patients will be collected on pre-hospital assessment, notification, in-hospital
      assessment, management and outcomes and recorded in a new tailored multi-hospital trauma
      registry. All injured patients arriving by ambulance and allocated to a red or yellow
      priority category will be eligible for inclusion. The intervention will be a pre-hospital
      notification application in the form of an Android program that will be used by ambulance
      clinicians to notify emergency departments of selected hospitals of an impending arrival of a
      patient. The application will use a simple algorithm based on trauma triage principles
      developed by the Australia-India Trauma System Collaboration (AITSC). The proportion of
      severely injured patients arriving to hospital after notification will be the primary outcome
      measure with a target of 70%. Secondary outcomes evaluated will be availability of a trauma
      cubicle, presence of a trauma team on patient arrival, time to first chest x-ray and
      in-hospital mortality.

    <description>Prior to arrival at emergency department. Pre-hospital notification will be the primary outcome, defined as a phone call or message to a treating hospital clinician regarding an injured patient enroute to hospital. For the purpose of this research project, a patient will satisfy primary outcome criteria if pre-hospital notification with any information has occurred. This variable will be collected and analysed as a binary variable.</description>

    <measure>Trauma Call out</measure>

    <description>Trauma leader is present when the patient enters the emergency department for treatment. The presence of a trauma team leader at the time of patient arrival will be collected as a binary variable. This is the person whose role is to co-ordinate the trauma resuscitation</description>

        The study will be conducted in four major trauma centres in India. The Jai Prakash Narayan
        Apex Trauma Center, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi admits
        approximately 4000 injured patients per year. Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital is a
        1,500-bed hospital situated in the National Capital Region of Delhi, India, with a trauma
        census of approx. 1500 per year. The Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General (LTMG) Hospital is a
        Level I trauma centre, which caters to the megapolis of Mumbai and receives about 1000
        injured patients per year. The Sheth Vadilal Sarabhai General (VS) Hospital caters to areas
        in and around Ahmedabad with an average annual admission secondary to trauma of about
        1200/year.
