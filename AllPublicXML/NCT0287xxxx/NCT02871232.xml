  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To conduct surveillance for abuse, misuse, overdose, addiction, and death and to evaluate if
      the REMS meets its surveillance goals, and if it does not, to modify it appropriately based
      on the metrics. Briefly, therefore, the overall surveillance objective is to evaluate for
      trends before and after the shared REMS is implemented to collectively assess for changes in
      abuse, misuse, overdose, addiction, and death for different risk groups and settings.

        The Poison Center Program obtains data from the general population of the US, Treatment
        Center Programs obtain data from those entering treatment for opioid addiction, and the
        College Survey Program surveys self-identified students attending a 2- or 4- year college,
