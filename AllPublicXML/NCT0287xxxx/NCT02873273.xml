  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a longer duration, controlled, sustained
      release dexamethasone delivery system would be more effective in helping patients with
      osteoarthritis reduce their pain, remain functional, and delay their need for knee
      replacement.

      The objectives of the study are to assess the dexamethasone delivery system for:

        -  Safety and tolerability

        -  Efficacy

      Formal statistical analysis to compare treatment groups will not be performed due to the
      small number of participants in this pilot study. Summary statistics will be assessed using
      the short form of the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS JR) surveys and
      questionnaires to assess pain intensity, pain medication consumption and wound assessment.
