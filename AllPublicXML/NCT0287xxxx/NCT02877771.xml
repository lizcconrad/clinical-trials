  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess the functionality of an integrated predictive low glucose
      suspend system designed to minimize the incidence and duration of hypoglycemia by suspending
      insulin delivery if hypoglycemia is projected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to test the functionality of a predictive low glucose suspend
      system under supervised conditions where basal insulin rates are manually increased until a
      system generated suspension occurs. The study will collect data that will be used for
      planning a pivotal study, and the study data are intended to be used to support a Premarket
      Approval (PMA) application.
