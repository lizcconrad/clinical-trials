  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding panitumumab to the combination
      of carboplatin and paclitaxel can help to control IBC when given before other standard
      chemotherapy and surgery. The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Panitumumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer with disease progression.
      Paclitaxel, carboplatin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide are FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of breast cancer. The addition of panitumumab to the combination
      of carboplatin and paclitaxel is investigational and currently being used for research
      purposes only. The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 72 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. You will have an equal (50/50) chance of being
      assigned to either group, and you and the study staff will know what you are receiving:

        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive panitumumab, carboplatin, and paclitaxel,
           followed by doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.

        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel, followed by
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Every study cycle will be 21 days.

      You will receive paclitaxel by vein over about 1-3 hours on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4.

      You will receive carboplatin by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1-4.

      If you are in Group A, you will also receive panitumumab by vein. You will first receive it
      over about 1 hour on Day 1 of a 1-week &quot;pre-cycle.&quot; You will then receive it over about 30
      minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycles 1-4, before you receive paclitaxel.

      You will then receive standard of care doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide by vein over about 90
      minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 5-8.

      This schedule may be changed if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Study Visits:

      For both Groups A and B:

        -  Every day that you receive the study drugs, and then at any time before surgery and
           after the last dose of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, blood (about 1Â½ to 3
           tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Before each cycle , and then at any time before surgery and after the last dose of
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, you will have a physical exam including a breast and
           lymph node exam.

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, then 1 time before you begin receiving doxorubicin and
           cyclophosphamide, and then 1 time before surgery, the study doctor will take pictures of
           both of your breasts.

        -  Before receiving any treatment, on Day 1 of Cycle 1, then 1 time before you begin
           receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, and then 1 time before surgery , blood
           (about 5 tablespoons) will be drawn for cytokine testing.

        -  One (1) time before you begin receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide , you will have
           a mammogram of the involved breast and an ultrasound of the involved breast and lymph
           nodes. You may have a breast MRI if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      If you are in Group A, you will have a breast core biopsy before Day 1 of Cycle 1 for
      biomarker testing.

      This schedule may be changed if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      Surgery:

      After you have finished receiving doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, you will have standard of
      care surgery. You will be given a separate consent form to read and sign.

      During surgery, breast tissue samples will be collected to identify tumors for routine
      testing and for biomarker testing.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 8 cycles. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up period.

      Follow-Up:

      About 1 month after surgery, you will be asked about your health and any side effects you may
      have had. You may be asked during a routine clinic visit or you may be called by a member of
      the study staff. If you are called, each call should last about 2 minutes.

      One (1) time every year for at least 5 years after you stop taking the study drugs, you will
      be contacted and asked about how you are doing. If you are called, each call should last
      about 2 minutes. This may also be done in a regular clinic visit.
