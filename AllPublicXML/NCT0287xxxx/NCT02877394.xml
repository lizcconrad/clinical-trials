  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a very common problem. Western style toilets that are nearly universal in the
      United States require the person to sit on the toilet. However, results from uncontrolled
      studies suggests that a squatting posture (as prevalent in many foreign countries) may be
      better at facilitating evacuation compared to a Western style commode. One uncontrolled,
      unpublished study suggests that a footstool improved bowel symptoms in nearly 98% of 153
      constipated participants. Hence, the investigators propose to evaluate the benefits of a
      footstool on symptoms and anorectal functions in constipated patients. Hypothesis: the
      regular squatting assist device (7 inches) but not a sham device (2 inches tall) will improve
      symptoms of constipation.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Able to communicate adequately with the investigator and to comply with the
             requirements for the entire study

          -  Meet Rome III criteria for functional constipation as assessed by questionnaires in
             period 1, i.e., report at least 2 of the following symptoms for last 3 months or more
             with symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis: a) &lt;3 SBMs/week b) hard or
             lumpy stools ≥ 25% of time c) straining ≥ 25% of time d) sense of incomplete
             evacuation ≥ 25% of time e) feeling of anorectal blockage ≥ 25% of time or f) manual
             maneuvers to facilitate defecation ≥ 25% of time. Patients who meet Rome III criteria
             for irritable bowel syndrome will also be eligible provided they also meet above
             criteria.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Current use of opioid analgesics. Patients on opioids will be allowed to participate
             if they have discontinued them for at least 3 days (72 hrs.) before date of screening
             and are willing to stay off them for the duration of the study.

          -  Current use of anticholinergics (e.g. nortriptyline, amitriptyline, hyoscyamine).
             Patients who use low dose tricyclic antidepressants (nortriptyline upto 50 mg/day or
             amitriptyline upto 25 mg/day ) will be eligible provided they do not increase the dose
             during the study period. Patients on higher doses or on other anticholinergics are
             eligible to participate if they can discontinue their medication at least 3 days (72
             hrs) before the date of screening and are willing to stay off them till the study is
             complete.

          -  Current use of laxatives (MiraLax, Ex-lax, senna, herbal supplements), linaclotide,
             lubiprostone, and prucalopride to treat constipation- patients using these medications
             will be eligible to participate if they can discontinue the medication at least 3 days
             (72 hrs.) before the date of screening and are willing to stay off them till the study
             is complete.
