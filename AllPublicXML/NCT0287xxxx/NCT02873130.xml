  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Voice disorders in teachers have a significant impact on communication, quality of life, and
      economic costs to the healthcare system. We need to advance the prevention of voice disorders
      in teachers by testing an online telepractice model with synchronous (in real-time) and
      asynchronous (stored and accessed later) methods. The current study will investigate the
      effectiveness of the theoretically-driven Global Voice Prevention Model (GVPM) delivered by
      two methods; 1) online telepractice (synchronous and asynchronous) and 2) traditional,
      in-person for vocally healthy physical education and vocal music student teachers.
      Effectiveness of the model will be assessed by voice-related measures captured daily on a
      smartphone app during student teaching, matching the asynchronous aspects of the telepractice
      model and representing the effects of vocal loading from teaching.
