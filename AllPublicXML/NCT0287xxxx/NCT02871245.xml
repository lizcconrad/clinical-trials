      Patients accepted laparoscopic radical operation for carcinoma of colon and upper middle
      section of the rectum will be as the research object. Cancer patients are diagnosed based on
      pathology or cell biology. The trial is randomized, parallel and open. They are randomized
      into 2 groups: both groups receive surgery. The experimental group receives conventional
      treatment combine with electroacupuncture Zusanli point .etc finish operation and the
      contrast receives the same conventional treatment with experimental group. Clinical
      evaluation includes gastrointestinal tract recovery of function, pain relief, life quality
      improvement. Blood biochemistry tests mainly include gastrin(GAS), stress related hormone,
      peroxidatic reaction and the ratio of immune cells.
