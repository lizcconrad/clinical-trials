  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness is both a natural resource of individuals present in all individuals in varying
      degrees characteristic ability of attention to the experience that unfolds moment by moment
      without judgment and a practice based on meditation, mindfulness exercises, which aims to
      enhance two central skills of mindfulness that are the presence and acceptanc. In the context
      of recurrent depression, the practice of mindfulness meditation in the frame of MBCT is
      recognized as effective in psychological suffering and relapse. The mechanisms implied in
      MBCT efficacy are emotional but especially cognitive. Among the cognitive mechanisms,
      reduction of rumination is a major factor in the action of MBCT, especially for patients with
      less than three depressive relapses.

      This exploratory research focuses on the impact of mindfulness functioning (mindfulness
      resource level at baseline) on the benefits of MBCT for patients with recurrent depressive
      disorder.

      The objective is to assess whether the level of mindfulness resource of patients with
      recurrent depression is a factor contributing to the positive effect of a MBCT applied in
      add-on to conventional care.

      This objective will be measured by comparing the clinical improvement of patients secondary
      to MBCT according to the initial categorization of the mindfulness resource.

      Clinical improvement will be more important for patients characterized by a lower initial
      level of mindfulness resource.
