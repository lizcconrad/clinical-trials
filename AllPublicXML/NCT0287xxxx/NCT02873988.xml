  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Airway epithelium integrity is essential to maintain its role of mechanical and functional
      barrier. Recurrent epithelial injuries require a complex mechanism of repair to restore its
      integrity. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an abnormal airway epithelial
      repair may participate in airway remodelling. The objective was to determine if airway
      epithelial wound repair of airway epithelium is abnormal in COPD.

      Patients scheduled for lung resection were prospectively recruited. Demographic, clinical
      data and pulmonary function tests results were recorded. Emphysema was visually scored and
      histological remodelling features were noted. Primary bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) were
      extracted and cultured for wound closure assay. The investigators determined the mean speed
      of wound closure (MSWC) and cell proliferation index, matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-9
      and cytokines levels in supernatants of BEC 18 hours after cell wounding. In a subset of
      patients, bronchiolar epithelial cells were also cultured for wound closure assay for MSWC
      analyze.
