    <textblock>
      Investigate whether concomitant treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can alter
      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LFG316 to an extent which would necessitate dose
      adaptation for LFG316 in pre-sensitized end-stage renal disease patients awaiting kidney
      transplantation

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult men or women 18-70 years of age suffering from end-stage renal disease and who
             are on chronic dialysis therapy.

          2. Candidates for kidney transplantation who are pre-sensitized and will be undergoing
             desensitization therapy.

          3. Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

          4. Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

          5. Recipients who are ABO compatible with donor allograft.

          6. Patients awaiting kidney allograft from a living or deceased donor. For patients
             awaiting transplant from a living donor, kidney transplantation must only occur after
             28 days post-LFG316 infusion.

          7. History of vaccination with meningococcus and pneumococcus between 2 weeks and 36
             months prior to dosing. Documentation is required. If patients have not been
             vaccinated, they must be vaccinated at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. The choice of
             vaccine(s) should take into account the serotypes prevalent in the geographic areas in
             which study patients will be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients requiring or undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

          2. Patients with a known contraindication to treatment with blood products.

          3. Patients with a known pro-thrombotic disorder and/or history of thrombosis or
             hyper-coagulable state, excluding hemodialysis venous access clotting.

          4. Patients who have positive PCR results for hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, and/or
             history of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
             blot) test result.

          5. Patients at risk for tuberculosis (TB)

          6. Patients with any severe, progressive or uncontrolled acute or chronic medical
             condition not related to end-stage renal disease (such as uncontrolled infectious
             disease or sepsis), clinical laboratory abnormalities at screening or baseline that in
             the investigator's opinion would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study, or known active presence of malignancies.

          7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.

          8. Women of child-bearing potential, unless highly effective methods of contraception are
             used during dosing and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316, or sexually active
             males unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while taking investigational drug
             and for 50 days after the last dose of LFG316.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
