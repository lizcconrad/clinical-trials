  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      subjects aged 12 years and older with CF who are homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation.
      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of LUM/IVA on manifestations of CF affected by
      exercise tolerance &amp; training.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Homozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CF defined as a sweat chloride value ≥60 mmol/L by quantitative
             pilocarpine iontophoresis

          -  Stable CF disease as judged by the investigator.

          -  FEV1 at least 40% and not greater than 90% of predicted.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any comorbidity that might confound the results of the study, interfere
             with the use of CPET as an assessment, or pose an additional risk in administering
             study drug to the subject.

          -  Any previous exposure to LUM or IVA

          -  History of cardiac arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, or
             other clinically significant cardiac condition, or medical condition requiring chronic
             use of a beta blocker, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or other cardiac
             medication known to affect exercise tolerance.

          -  History of solid organ or hematological transplantation.

          -  For subjects under 18 years of age at Screening, except those who have had bilateral
             lens removal, selected findings on a screening ophthalmologic examination will be
             exclusionary

          -  Using or expected to require any concomitant medication that is prohibited in this
             study

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse, as deemed by the investigator, in the past year,
             including but not limited to cannabis, cocaine, and opiates.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study within 30 days before the Screening
             Visit.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females; males with a female partner who is pregnant or nursing.

          -  Colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status
