    <textblock>
      IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a recently identified rare disease characterized by
      inflammatory lesions with polyclonal lymphoplasmocytic infiltrate, with IgG4+ plasma cells
      predominance, and fibrosis in involved tissues. Despite a preferential involvement of
      exocrine organs, virtually all tissues can be affected by the disease. Corticosteroids are
      usually effective in this indication, but with poor tolerance and a high risk of relapse
      after decrease or withdrawal of this treatment. In this context, identification of new
      therapeutic targets is a major concern for these patients. Physiopathology of IgG4-RD remains
      actually unknown. In previous studies, it has been shown that T follicular Helper (Tfh) cells
      are expanded in the blood of these patients. Tfh cells have an important role in the
      formation of germinal centers (GCs), and ectopic GCs have been found in tissues of patients
      with IgG4-RD. Tfh cells have a major role in proliferation and differentiation of B cell
      compartment. In this context, this population could have an important contribution in the
      pathophysiology of IgG4-RD and could represent a therapeutic target in this disease.

      TIFOLH4 study intend to analyze tissue Tfh cells in patients with IgG4-RD at diagnosis. This
      study is an exploratory prospective multicentric study. Thirty patients with a suspected
      diagnosis of IgG4-RD, because of 1 or more suggestive organ involved, will be included in the
      study. A 50 mL blood sample and a biopsy, obtained in the same time of the diagnostic biopsy
      sample, will be obtained in this study. The results obtained in patients with a confirmed
      diagnosis of IgG4-RD (&quot; IgG4-RD group &quot;) will be compared to results of patients with another
      diagnosis (&quot; control group &quot;). Main objective of the study is to show by confocal microscopy
      an expansion of the number of Tfh cells (CD3+CD4+PD1+ cells) in tissue of IgG4-RD patients
      compared to controls. Secondary objectives include : tissue analysis of Tfh subsets (Tfh1,
      Tfh2 and Tfh17) ; tissue analysis of B regulatory cells, T regulatory cells, and T helper
      cells (Th1, Th2, Th17); correlation between tissue and circulating biomarkers; tissue
      proteomic analysis; and functional analysis of circulating Tfh cells after sorting of these
      cells and co-culture tests with autologous naive B cells. All these results will be compared
      between the &quot; IgG4-RD group &quot; and the &quot; control group &quot;. This study should clarify the role
      of these Tfh populations in IgG4-RD, identify diagnostic tissue and blood biomarkers, and
      identify therapeutic targets in these patients.
