  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States and is a major
      contributor to suicide, a leading cause of premature death. The majority of individuals with
      depression do not receive adequate pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic treatment due to
      difficulty accessing services or stopping treatment due to side effects, non-response, or the
      stigma associated with attending mental health clinic visits. Mobile health information
      technology services, such as text messaging, have the potential to provide effective
      self-management support for depression to nearly every adult in the US with depression.
      Guided self-help via text messaging has been shown to be effective for improving a range of
      health behaviors as well as symptoms of depression. However, previously studied depression
      text messaging services have not utilized the breadth of psychotherapeutic techniques shown
      to be effective for depression nor have they attempted to tailor the psychotherapeutic
      content to the individual in order to improve acceptability and outcomes. Advanced artificial
      intelligence methods (e.g., reinforcement learning) offers the capability to weed out
      ineffective messages and to target messages to individuals in order to substantially improve
      program effectiveness. This pilot study is the first step in towards developing an
      artificially intelligent text message service for depression.

      The specific aims of the study are to: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and
      enrolling participants from the general population of US adults and delivering a
      text-messaging intervention for depression, 2) determine whether there are differences in the
      perceived helpfulness of messages derived from different psychotherapeutic treatment
      modalities, and whether these differences are moderated by participant characteristics (e.g.,
      age, gender, depression symptom severity), 3) determine whether messages derived from
      different psychotherapeutic treatment modalities or their perceived helpfulness are
      associated with changes in depression symptoms, and whether these relationships are moderated
      by participant characteristics.

    <description>Each week, enrolled participants will receive daily text messages from one of three randomly assigned psychotherapeutic modalities—cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and techniques based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)—for a total of 12 weeks. The messages were developed, reviewed, and refined by a multidisciplinary team of experienced therapists, including social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists.</description>
