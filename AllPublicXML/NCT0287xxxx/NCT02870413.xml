      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to generate data on the
      impact of direct-to-consumer &quot;telelactation&quot; (virtual breastfeeding support) services.
      Postpartum mothers age 18 and older who have initiated breastfeeding will be recruited at a
      critical access hospital without access to IBCLCs in rural Pennsylvania and randomized into
      two study arms: 1) outpatient telelactation services via video calls on personal devices or
      2) usual care. Data on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, as well as perceptions and
      satisfaction with breastfeeding, will be captured via surveys and in-depth interviews and
      compared across groups.

    <textblock>
      Increasing breastfeeding rates is an ongoing public health priority because of the health and
      economic benefits for infants, mothers, and communities. Professional lactation support,
      specifically by International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs), increases
      breastfeeding duration and exclusivity. Rural and underserved mothers have lower
      breastfeeding rates, and limited access to professional lactation support may contribute to
      this disparity. As such, the Surgeon General identifies increasing access to IBCLCs as a
      policy priority. Virtual &quot;telelactation&quot; consults that use two-way video have the potential
      to increase access to IBCLC services in rural settings that lack them. Several companies have
      begun to offer telelactation through a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, where patients
      initiate video calls with providers using their personal devices including mobile phones,
      tablets, and laptops. While four studies with small samples explored the use of antiquated
      videoconferencing technology (i.e., that required dedicated equipment) for lactation support,
      no research has studied DTC telelactation or linked telelactation with breastfeeding
      outcomes. To address this evidence gap, the investigators will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to generate data on the impact of DTC telelactation services.
      Postpartum mothers age 18 and older who have initiated breastfeeding will be recruited at a
      critical access hospital without access to IBCLCs in rural Pennsylvania and randomized into
      two study arms: 1) outpatient telelactation services via video calls on personal devices or
      2) usual care. Data on breastfeeding duration and exclusivity, as well as perceptions and
      satisfaction with breastfeeding, will be captured via surveys and in-depth interviews and
      compared across groups. This study will be the first experimental evaluation of telelactation
      and the first ever evaluation of DTC telelactation services. The results will inform policy
      debates about reimbursement and regulation of DTC telehealth services and the strengths and
      limitations of this model of healthcare delivery as applied to breastfeeding. It also has the
      potential to promote breastfeeding, one of the most widely recommended health behaviors among
      underserved families, and improve children's health in rural settings.

        Inclusion Criteria for mothers:

          1. â‰¥ 18 years;

          2. Initiated breastfeeding while in the hospital and intend to breastfeed post-discharge

          3. Fluent in English

        Inclusion criteria for infants:

          1. Infants must be term or near term (&gt;35 weeks gestational age)

          2. Not require a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prisoners, incarcerated individuals, detainees, parolees, probationers will be
             excluded because there may external circumstances outside of their control that may
             prevent continuous breastfeeding.

          2. Mothers and infants will be excluded if they have maternal, fetal, or neonatal
             conditions or complications with the potential to physiologically compromise
             breastfeeding or milk supply (e.g., infant cardiac defects, post-partum infant
             ventilator dependence), and or contraindications to breastfeeding as specified by the
             American Academy of Pediatrics (e.g., HIV+ status).
