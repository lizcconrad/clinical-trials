    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is treatment with drugs and other treatments
      that may help to make a patient better or may improve their quality of life. This treatment
      is known as &quot;best supportive care&quot; (BSC). Although patients with best supportive care can
      feel better for some months, the cancer usually continues to grow.

      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and reactivate the immune response. This
      may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone.

      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink
      tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not
      clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with durvalumab.

      Combinations of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have
      been shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone and while
      the combination has been studied in a few people, it is not clear if it can offer better
      results than standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically or pathologically confirmed advanced (metastatic or locally
             advanced) colorectal cancer that is unresectable.

          -  Received a prior thymidylate synthase inhibitor (e.g. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
             capecitabine, raltitrexed, UFT) for metastatic disease or as adjuvant therapy. A
             thymidylate synthase inhibitor may have been given in combination with oxaliplatin or
             irinotecan.

          -  Received and failed an irinotecan -containing regimen (i.e. single-agent or in
             combination) for treatment of metastatic disease, OR relapsed within 6 months of
             completion of an irinotecan-containing adjuvant therapy, OR have documented
             unsuitability for an irinotecan-containing regimen.
