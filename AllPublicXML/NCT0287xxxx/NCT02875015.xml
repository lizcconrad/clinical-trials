  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain, the quality of their recovery and the opioid consumption following a
      midurethral sling placement are being compared between 2 groups. One group will have the
      hydro-dissection performed with a diluted liposomal bupivacaine solution. The other group
      will have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted bupivacaine HCL and Lidocaine
      solution.

      This is a prospective, comparative, randomized study. Women with pure stress urinary
      incontinence or mixed urinary incontinence with a predominant stress component who had chosen
      to proceed with a midurethral sling will be randomized to two groups. The study group will
      have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted liposomal bupivacaine solution. The
      comparison group would have the hydro-dissection performed with a diluted bupivacaine HCL and
      Lidocaine solution. The postoperative pain will be compared between groups using a visual
      analog scale. The quality of recovery will be compared between the groups using the quality
      of recovery short form. Postoperative opioid consumption will be compared between the two
      groups.
