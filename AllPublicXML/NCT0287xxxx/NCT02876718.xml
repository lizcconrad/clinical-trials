      The main objective of the study is to assess preferences of Non Valvular Atrial Fibrillation
      (NVAF) patients towards different options of an anticoagulation treatment.

      Patient preferences for anticoagulant treatment attributes (convenience attributes only),
      based on a Discrete Choice Experiment(DCE) interview will be elicited and the impact of
      switching from Vitamin K Antagonist(VKA) to Xarelto® on Atrial Fibrilation(AF) patient
      treatment satisfaction will be documented, measured by score differences of the Anti-Clot
      Treatment Scale (ACTS) score in patients switching from VKA to Rivaroxaban.
