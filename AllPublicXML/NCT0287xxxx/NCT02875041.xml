  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility and exploratory pilot study of adjuvant transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) to physical therapy (PT) for locomotion and balance rehabilitation in
      Parkinson's disease patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcomes will be feasibility of pairing 10 PT training sessions for PB&amp;G with
      rTMS therapy immediately following PT treatment session. Secondary outcomes will be
      exploratory, documenting differential clinical effects of two 'active' rTMS compared to
      'sham' rTMS, to investigate ability to improve motor and functional recovery outcomes.
      Outcome measures will be a combination of assessments regularly conducted during PT treatment
      sessions validated in people with PD (these will doubly serve as our study measures) and
      several PD oriented outcomes.

    <measure>Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>(Mini-BESTest): This is a clinical balance assessment tool that asses dynamic balance through 14 items. It requires 10-15 minutes to be administered. Physical therapists at Rusk use this scale during their normal evaluative sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Five times sit to stand (5XSST)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of functional lower limb muscle strength and may be useful in quantifying functional change of transitional movements. Physical therapists use this scale during their normal evaluative sessions. We will use those data collected for our outcome purposes. It requires &lt; 5 minutes to be administered. It is highly recommended and validated in PD by Parkinson's task force PD EDGE.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go (TUG):</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Assess walking speed in meters per second over a short duration. Time is measured as subject walks a set distance. Physical therapists use this scale during their normal evaluative sessions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a Parkinson's rating scale which includes evaluations of mentation, behavior, mood, and activities of daily life as well as a clinician scored evaluation to assess motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I</measure>
    <time_frame>15 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>CGI was designed to provide a brief stand-alone assessment of the clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after initiating a study medication. Its use has expanded to assess prior to and after any intervention. It takes less than a minute to administer by an experienced rater and it is a great tool to track clinical progress across time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's disease questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report questionnaire that assess PD-specific health related quality over the last month. It assessed how often patients experience difficulties across 8 quality of life dimensions and asses impact of PD on specific dimensions of functioning and well-being. It has become the most frequently used disease-specific measure of health status. It takes 10-20 minutes to be administered.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire will ask questions about symptoms of gait freezing (not being able to move). The NFOG-Q is a reliable tool to detect and evaluate the impact and severity of FOG in PD.</description>
