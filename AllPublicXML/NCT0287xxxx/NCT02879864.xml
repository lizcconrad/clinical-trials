  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a symptom most commonly associated with the diagnosis of cancer. Fatigue often
      appears before the diagnosis of cancer, is increasing during treatment with chemotherapy and
      persists for years after treatment in more than 35% of patients. Fatigue is the earliest and
      most important symptom described by cancer patients. Its prevalence in cancer chemotherapy
      patients is between 70 and 100%. Fatigue is more common to cancer patients and to the general
      population or other types of patients. Typically described as a lack of energy associated
      with mental disorders, fatigue related to cancer can be extremely debilitating. The causes
      are many, mainly including the cancer itself, side effects due to treatment, sleeplessness
      due to pain, anxiety or depression. The cancer-related fatigue has a negative and significant
      direct impact on all aspects of the patient's quality of life, especially the physical,
      social and behavioral. Despite the availability of certain treatments and the advanced
      biomedical research, fatigue remains an inevitable consequence of cancer and its treatment.

      The therapeutic use of natural light in medicine dates back to the late nineteenth century.
      Its remarkable effect on the stimulation of the immune system and fight against infections
      caused the development of the first therapy techniques (also called luxth√©rapie) awarded in
      1903 by the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology. Light plays a fundamental role in the
      regulation of circadian rhythms and homeostatic. The mechanism of action passes through a
      path &quot;non-visual&quot; involving melanopsin ganglion cells located in the retina. Activation of
      the pineal gland (epiphysis) by melanopsin cells allows transduce information &quot;shadow and
      light&quot; in melatonin synthesis from serotonin. Today, the effectiveness of the therapy is well
      established for treating fatigue-related disorders such as chronic fatigue, seasonal
      depression or seasonal or non-certain sleep disorders and in which the melatonin metabolism
      is disturbed. Light therapy, by its mechanism of action, allows reprogramming &quot;of the
      biological clock and improved synchronization of circadian rhythms.

      Hypotheses

      Some studies have shown an inverse relationship between cancer-related fatigue and the time
      of exposure to natural light for cancer patients. This association suggests the existence of
      a vicious circle of side effects of chemotherapy (physical fatigue and moral), itself causing
      a decrease in outdoor activity and therefore a reduction of the light exposure time natural.
      This results in a strengthening of the initial patient's state of fatigue. In an interesting
      way, vitamin D synthesized in large part due to light plays a cancer protective role],
      especially in the prevention and treatment of pancreatic cancer for example. Furthermore and
      paradoxical way, the disruption of circadian rhythms is correlated to the development and
      tumor progression in vitro, in vivo tumor growth and incidence of cancer in humans.

      Notoriously, the direct effect of light therapy on cancer-related fatigue has been little
      discussed in the literature. Data obtained from a small sample of patients indicate that
      light therapy improves quality of life by reducing fatigue in patients with breast cancer
      during chemotherapy. To date, There are no data on the effects of light therapy on
      cancer-related fatigue in general, patients treated with chemotherapy.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the role of light therapy on cancer-related
      fatigue in patients during the 6 months following initiation of first-line chemotherapy.

      Primary objective

      To assess the effects of daily therapy on fatigue of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic cancer treated with chemotherapy.

      secondary objective

      Evaluate the impact of daily light therapy on quality of life, pain, anxiety and depression,
      tolerance of chemotherapy and medico-economic benefits.
