  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased tarsal platform show (TPS) and decreased brow fat span (BFS) are associated with
      favorable results in women undergoing cosmetic blepharoplasty. The authors evaluate the
      efficacy of a technique (brassiere sutures) to increase TPS and decrease the BFS.

      This is a prospective, randomized, comparative, case series study of 100 eyelids (50
      consecutive women patients) treated with cosmetic upper blepharoplasty by a single surgeon.
      Patients were randomized to receive traditional upper blepharoplasty with a single running
      suture skin closure versus orbicularis oculi muscle fixation to periosteum (brassiere
      sutures) prior to skin closure. Patient age, follow-up length, complications and treatment
      were analyzed. The mean of TPS, BFS and TPS/BFS ratio was measured before and after surgery
      at 3 anatomic landmarks.

      56 eyelids (28 patients) were treated with traditional single suture blepharoplasty and 44
      eyelids (22 patients) had brassiere sutures. After surgery, the mean change in TPS was 2.10
      mm with brassiere sutures compared to 2.04 mm without (p &lt;.001). The mean change in BFS was
      3.33 mm with brassiere sutures compared to 3.19 mm without (p &lt;.001), The mean change in
      TPS:BFS ratio at all 3 anatomic landmarks was statistically significant in both groups but
      the change was statistically greater with the use of brassiere sutures (p &lt;.001).

      Brassiere sutures during upper blepharoplasty were associated with a postoperative increase
      in TPS decrease in BFS, and increase in TPS/BFS.

    <description>The skin incisions were marked using a skin marking pen. Preseptal orbicularis skin and muscle were removed using a size-15 scalpel blade and scissors. Hemostasis was achieved with conservative electrocuatery. The skin was closed with a running 6-0 nylon suture.</description>

    <description>Prior to skin closure as above, three 6-0 polyglactin sutures are passed along the lateral fourth of the orbital rim. The sutures attach the inferior orbicularis oculi edge to the arcus marginalis of lateral ROOF. Sutures are placed until there is a visible &quot;plumping&quot; of the sub-brow tissues.</description>
