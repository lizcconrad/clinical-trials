    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial will examine whether a 12 month monitored exercise intervention
      improves brain health in cognitively normal older adults. This trial will also address
      several important unanswered questions: (1) Are the recommended public health guidelines of
      150 minutes/week of exercise sufficient for improving cognitive performance? (2) Does
      exercise influence brain structure and/or function? (3) Is there a dose-response effect of
      exercise on the above variables such that greater amounts of exercise brings about greater
      benefits in cognitive and brain health? (4) What are the mechanisms by which exercise
      influences brain health? and (5) What factors attenuate or magnify the effects of exercise on
      brain and cognitive health and contribute to the individual variability in intervention
      outcomes?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a 12-month, multi-site, randomized dose-response exercise
      trial (i.e., brisk walking) in 639 cognitively normal adults between 65-80 years of age.
      Participants will be randomized to a (a) moderate intensity aerobic exercise condition at the
      public health recommended dose of 150 minutes/week (N=213), (b) a moderate intensity exercise
      condition at 225 minutes/week (N=213), or (c) a light intensity stretching-and-toning control
      condition for 150 minutes per week (N=213). Participants will meet 3 days/week for site-based
      exercise and do home-based activity on two more days of the week for 12 months. A
      comprehensive state-of-the-science battery of cognitive, MRI, amyloid imaging, physiological
      biomarkers, cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and quality of life measures will
      be assessed at baseline and after completion of the intervention.

      Specific Aims include:

        1. Cognitive Enhancement: Using a comprehensive neuropsychological battery and the NIH
           Toolbox, the investigators will test (a) whether a 12-month moderate intensity exercise
           intervention improves cognitive performance in older adults and (b) whether the
           improvements occur in a dose-dependent manner. Hypothesis: PA will enhance cognitive
           performance non-uniformly with the greatest effects occurring for executive and
           declarative memory functions. The investigators also predict that these improvements
           will follow a dose-dependent trajectory with 225 minutes/week of PA demonstrating
           greater improvements than 150 minutes/week of PA.

        2. Brain Augmentation: The investigators will test (a) whether a 12-month PA intervention
           augments MRI markers of brain health and (b) whether changes happen in a dose-dependent
           manner. Hypothesis: PA will most profoundly influence the volume, microstructural white
           matter integrity, cerebral blood flow, and connectivity of regions supporting
           declarative memory (e.g., hippocampus) and executive function (e.g., prefrontal cortex;
           PFC). Further, the investigators predict that 225 minutes/week will result in greater
           effects than 150 minutes/week. The investigators predict that these changes in brain
           outcomes will mediate the cognitive improvements in Aim 1.

        3. Biomediators: The investigators will test the hypothesis that cardiometabolic,
           inflammatory, and neurotrophic changes mediate improvements in brain and cognition.
           Hypothesis: (1) decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, (2) decreases in central
           adiposity, arterial stiffness, and insulin resistance, and (3) increases in
           brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels will statistically mediate changes in
           cognitive performance (Aim 1) and brain health (Aim 2), and that the strength of this
           mediating relationship might vary as a function of certain apriori moderating variables
           of interest

        4. Moderators: To examine subgroups (i.e., individual differences) that attenuate or
           magnify the effect of the intervention on cognitive, brain, and physiological systems to
           better understand the factors that predict 'responders' versus 'non-responders' to the
           intervention. The investigators will examine three categories of variables: (1)
           demographic (e.g., age) (2) genetic (e.g., APOE), and (3) baseline Aβ burden.
           Hypothesis: The favorable effects of PA on brain and cognition will be greatest for
           older individuals with greater Aβ burden, and in those with a genetic susceptibility for
           accelerated cognitive decline.

        5. Exploratory Aims: The investigators will explore (a) whether baseline brain health
           metrics predict adherence and compliance to 12-months of PA, and (b) the utility of
           multi-modal brain imaging analytical approaches to more comprehensively understand the
           effects of PA on the aging brain.

    <ipd_description>The data from this study will be made available to outside investigators under a data-sharing agreement. The data will be available to outside investigators after publication of the primary aims and at completion of quality control assessments and data organization. The investigators expect that the data from this study will result in significant interest from internal and external investigators for secondary data analysis and ancillary project proposals, so the investigators will create an oversight committee made up of Principal and Co-Investigators for monitoring, approving, and disseminating the data along with monitoring data analysis plans and development of manuscripts. This is important for eliminating redundant analyses, results, or manuscripts.</ipd_description>
