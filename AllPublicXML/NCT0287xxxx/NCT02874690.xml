      The overall goal of this research is to use neurophysiological measures to profile strengths
      and deficits for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder co-morbidity in Autism Spectrum
      Disorder to clarify diagnosis and to predict treatment response.

    <measure>Change in Short Interval IntraCortical Inhibition (SICI) using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose; Approximately 90 minutes post-dose of methylphenidate</time_frame>
    <description>SICI is a TMS measure of the efficiency of inhibitory interneurons in the primary motor cortex.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder
             (ASD) not otherwise specified (NOS) based on a semi-structured review of Diagnostic
             and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) criteria and mental status examination as well as a a
             complete systematic patient interview utilizing the Autism Diagnostic Observation
             Schedule (ADOS)

          -  Males and females ages 8-21 years.

          -  Subjects must not be taking any psychotropic drugs affecting glutamate
             neurotransmission (riluzole, memantine, acamprosate, topiramate, amantadine, among
             others) which may interfere with TMS recording. If patient is on a home
             psychostimulants medication this will be held on the day of testing. Subjects may not
             be taking more than two psychotropic drugs. Dosing of all concomitant psychotropic
             drugs targeting core social and/or communication impairment must be stable for four
             weeks prior to randomization. Dosing of all concomitant psychotropic drugs targeting
             other features associated with ASD (insomnia, inattention, hyperactivity, anxiety,
             irritability among others) must be stable for two weeks (with the exception of four
             weeks for fluoxetine) prior to randomization.

          -  Stable seizure disorder (no seizures in 6 months prior to enrollment; on same
             anticonvulsant dose &gt; 60 days or )

          -  Able to participate in neurophysiological testing including Electroencephalogram (EEG)
             and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) portions of the experiment based on
             patient comfort and examiner judgement

          -  Legal guardian has provided written informed consent and the subject has provided
             written informed assent. Expectation that a majority of subjects will be able to
             assent but the potential for the younger children and/or those that are cognitively
             impaired will not be able to assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects exhibiting significant disruptive, aggressive, self-injurious, or sexually
             inappropriate behavior will not be eligible for enrollment

          -  Presence of current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5 (DSM-V) psychiatric disorders
             that may require alternative pharmacotherapy or different treatment including
             psychotic disorders, major affective disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic
             disorder, or substance related disorders.

          -  Presence of any medical condition that would make treatment with methylphenidate (MPH)
             less safe. Subjects with significant cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease will be
             excluded due to concerns about pharmacokinetic alterations or adverse effects. Because
             of the unknown effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on the developing human fetus, females
             of childbearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test and required to use a
             suitable form of birth control during the study. A positive pregnancy test result
             excludes the subject.

          -  Presence of any other condition that would make the participants unable to comply with
             the requirements of the study for any reason.

          -  Prohibited Concomitant Medications: Methylphenidate is primarily excreted by the
             kidneys and has few known pharmacokinetic drug interactions. The following medications
             are not allowed due to the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction: monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors or atomoxetine.
