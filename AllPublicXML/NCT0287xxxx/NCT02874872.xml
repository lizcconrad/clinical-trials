  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OASIS Collaborative is an organizational intervention aimed at reducing unnecessary
      antibiotic use in skilled nursing facilities. The first target of intervention is the tasks
      carried out by nursing staff after a change in condition and after an antibiotic prescription
      is initiated. The second target are the management staff who provide feedback to staff. The
      third target are the administrators who identify and overcome organizational barriers to
      implementation.

      In this study, we will implement two tools that are intended to minimize unnecessary
      antibiotic use in skilled nursing facilities. The first tool helps skilled nursing facility
      staff assess risk and communicate with prescribers when residents experience a change in
      health status that may result in the use of antibiotics. The second tool is used after an
      antibiotic is prescribed; the tool streamlines reassessment of the patient, and provides
      prescribers the opportunity to consider stopping unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions,
      narrowing the spectrum of antibiotic therapy, or shortening the duration of antibiotic
      therapy.

    <description>The nursing homes in this arm will receive facilitated implementation of two tools aimed at minimizing unnecessary antibiotic use. Facilitated implementation includes coaching of the nursing home staff on use of the tools. In addition, nursing home management will be coached on how to monitor implementation fidelity, antibiotic utilization, and consequences to over- and under-utilization of antibiotics as feedback on the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, nursing home management will receive coaching on how to develop and implement a sustain plan for the OASIS intervention.</description>
