  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, multi-center, three arm parallel group, comparative trial to assess
      pritelivir ointment safety and efficacy, ie, proportion of subjects with non-ulcerative
      lesions, in adult subjects with recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) in comparison with placebo or
      Zovirax® Cream. The start of treatment with trial medication will be initiated by the subject
      within one hour of noticing the first sign or symptom (eg, prodrome) of a recurrence of
      herpes labialis. Trial medication will be applied to the affected area 5 times daily for 4
      days.

      After self-initiation of treatment with trial medication subjects will be assessed daily by
      the Investigator until complete healing for a maximum of 13 days.

      Subjects will document application of trial medication and the status of their lesion in a
      diary. There will also be blood sampling, ECG measurement and physical examination performed
      at the investigational site.

             Herpes labialis (rHL) episodes and should have developed ulcerative lesions that have
             progressed through vesicle, ulcer, and crust stages in at least 50% of the episodes;

          -  Willingness not to use any topical application (such as cosmetics, lip balm,
             sunscreens etc…) other than the trial medication in the area of lesion development
             from start of prodromal symptoms to complete healing;

          -  Clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory indices at screening which in the
             opinion of the investigator might have an impact on the safety and evaluability of the
             subject.

          -  Known chronic infections which in the opinion of the investigator might have an impact
