      Introduction:

      Addition of some probiotics appears to reduce the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea
      (AAD). Effects of probiotics are strain specific, thus the efficacy and safety of each
      probiotic strain should be established separately. We aim to assess the effect of
      Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 administration for the prevention of diarrhea and AAD in
      children.

      Methods and analysis:

      A total of 250 children younger than 18 years treated with antibiotics will be enrolled into
      a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which they will additionally receive L
      reuteri DSM 17938 at a dose 2 x 10^8 colony-forming units or an identically appearing
      placebo, orally, twice daily, for the entire duration of antibiotic treatment. The primary
      outcome measures will be the frequency of diarrhea and AAD. Diarrhea will be defined
      according to one of 3 definitions: (a) ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 48
      hours during antibiotic treatment; (b) ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 24
      hours during antibiotic treatment; (c) ≥2 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 24
      hours during antibiotic treatment. AAD will be diagnosed in cases of diarrhea, defined
      clinically as above, caused by C. difficile or for otherwise unexplained diarrhea (i.e.
      negative laboratory stool tests for infectious agents).

    <description>Three different definitions of diarrhea will be used, as the definitions of diarrhea/AAD in published studies vary. These will include diarrhea defined as: (a) ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 48 hours during antibiotic treatment; (b) ≥3 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 24 hours during antibiotic treatment, and (c) ≥2 loose or watery stools per day for a minimum of 24 hours during antibiotic treatment. AAD will be diagnosed in cases of diarrhea, defined clinically as above, caused by C. difficile or for otherwise unexplained diarrhea (i.e., negative laboratory stool tests for infectious agents). In all cases, loose or watery stools will correspond to scores of 5 to 7 on the BSF scale or A-consistency on the AISS.</description>
