  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At each site (OHSU &amp; UM), 180 socially isolated adults 80+ years old will be recruited
      through Meals on Wheels People. Participants will be randomized to either the Video Chat
      Group or the Control Group. Those in the Video Chat Group will receive a computer for the
      duration of the study, which they will use to video chat with study staff for 30 minutes/day
      4x/week for 6 months, and then they will video chat 2x/week for another 6 months. Those
      assigned to the Control Group will have brief telephone check-ins with study staff once per
      week. In-home testing will occur at Baseline, 6 months and 12 months. All participants at
      OHSU will have their medication compliance tracked using electronic medication monitoring
      devices (MedTracker) and 50% of participants at both OHSU and UM will have MRIs at Baseline
      and 6 months, if they are able to safely receive MRIs. All participants at both sites will
      contribute saliva for genetic testing, and all video chat sessions will be recorded for
      speech and language analysis.
