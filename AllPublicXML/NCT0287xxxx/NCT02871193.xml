  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The procedures of thoracotomy are among the most painful operations. In addition to
      post-thoracotomy pain, the outcomes of surgery are affected adversely by postoperative
      discomfort. Therefore, post-thoracotomy pain control can improve the satisfaction of patient
      and prevent postoperative complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or respiratory
      failure. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) used to be widely considered as a standard
      technique for providing analgesia after a thoracotomy. However, TEA carries side-effects such
      as incomplete or failed block, epidural hematoma, abscess, hypotension, respiratory
      depression, or bradycardia, etc. Recently, thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is an
      alternative technique for TEA that may offer a comparable analgesic effect and a better side
      -effect profile for post-thoracotomy analgesia. When local anesthetic agents are used as
      single injection, they can provide analgesia for limited period. Various adjuvants have been
      tried in the past in order to enhance the duration and quality of postoperative analgesia.
      Previous studies with perineural dexamethasone demonstrated that it enhanced the duration of
      local anesthetic block. The mechanism of its action is blocking the nociceptive impulse
      transmission along the myelinated C fibers. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices have
      been shown to provide superior analgesia and greater patient satisfaction compared with
      intermittent administration. System of wire-less PCA provides remote monitoring, information
      management and PCA devices with high precision. The purpose of this research is to determine
      whether dexamethasone might prolong the duration of analgesia and improve the short-time
      outcomes when administered for TPVB along with local anesthetic agents in elective
      thoracotomy.
