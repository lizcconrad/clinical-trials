      Study CC-90011-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion,
      First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90011 in subjects with relapsed and/or refractory
      solid tumors (including neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC)) and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs).
      The dose escalation part (Part A) of the study will explore escalating oral doses of CC-90011
      to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-90011.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parts A and B will consist of 3 periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up. Screening Period
      The Screening Period starts 28 days (± 3 days) prior to first dose of CC-90011. The informed
      consent document (ICD) must be signed and dated by the subject and the administering staff
      prior to the start of any other study procedures. All screening tests and procedures must be
      completed within the 28 days (±3 days) prior to the first dose of CC-90011.

      Treatment Period During the Treatment Period, CC-90011 will initially be administered orally
      in each 4-week (28 day) Cycle.

      Follow-up Period In the Follow-up Period, subjects will be followed for 28 days (± 3 days)
      after the last dose of CC-90011 for safety.

      After the Safety Follow-up visit, all subjects will be followed every subsequent 3 months (±
      2 weeks) for survival follow-up for up until 2 years or until death, lost to follow-up, or
      the End of Trial, whichever occurs first.
