      The purpose of this research study is to address the challenge of medication management for
      older patients undergoing treatment for cancer. The sponsor of this protocol is the
      Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center who is providing funding for this research
      study.

      The goals of the proposed study are: (1) to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of
      delivering PRIME (Pharmacist Reconciliation to Improve Medication Management in the Elderly)
      to older patients with breast, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers; and (2) to estimate the
      effect size (i.e. the magnitude of the difference between groups) of PRIME for improving
      medication management (e.g. accurate medication list, less polypharmacy, fewer potentially
      inappropriate medications) and achieving up-to-date vaccinations.
