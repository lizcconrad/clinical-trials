  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During childbirth, the recommendations have evolved to a restriction of episiotomy. This
      reduction results in an increase of superficial vaginal and perineal tears. These lesions are
      usually routinely sutured which often causes the onset of discomfort and pain in the
      immediate postpartum period. Gordon showed, in 1998, improved comfort and pain when the skin
      was not sutured perineal tears during the second degree. Others have compared different
      techniques in the same indications (separated points running suture, biological adhesive)
      without demonstrated impact. These studies were not interested in isolated perineal tears or
      first degree or the application of a simple manual compression with or without a suture
      according to the result of hemostasis.

      Our objective is to evaluate the possibility of not suture the perineum of the first degree.
      The use of suture only result of bleeding not yielding to manual compression.

      Our approach is guided by the principles of &quot;primum non nocere&quot; and discerning about the
      dogmatic systematization.
