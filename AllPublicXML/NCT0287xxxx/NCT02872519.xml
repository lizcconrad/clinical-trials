  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET) imaging utilizing 18F-FSPG
      [(S)-4-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid], a glutamic acid derivative, to image patients
      with ovarian cancer before undergoing surgery or transplant. Diagnostic procedures, such as
      18F-FSPG PET, may help find and diagnose ovarian cancer and find out how far the disease has
      spread.

    <description>All imaging data (SUV) will be correlated to definitive, ex vivo diagnostic pathology and immunoreactivity (xC-, CD44), which will be carried out for every patient with resected tissue. and, when IHC scoring will be in terms of strength of immunostaining (scored on an ordinal scale of 0 3). This treatment of lesion-based sensitivity and specificity has not been previously described in the ovarian cancer literature.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a presumed diagnosis of advanced stage epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or
             peritoneal.

             a. Pelvic mass and/or omental caking with Ca-125:CEA ratio 25:1.

          -  Adequate organ function:

               1. PCV &gt; 30 (with or without transfusion)

               2. WBC: 3000 - 10,000 The lower level of normal for total WBCs is 4,000, but the NCI
                  considers levels of 3,000- 4,000 as mild suppression for drug trials,
                  specifically not requiring treatment.

          -  ave undergone or agree to undergo standard of care imaging for ovarian cancer with CT

               1. Any disease in the thoracic cavity &gt; 1 cm.

               5. Pleural effusion &gt; 50% volume of the chest cavity on chest x-ray.

               6. Omental extension to the stomach, spleen, or lesser sac.

               7. Extension to the pelvic sidewall (this criteria may also be assessed on physical
