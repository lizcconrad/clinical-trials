  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apatinib has been approved as a second-line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Several
      phase III clinical studies of non small cell lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer and
      other tumors also showed apatinib has less toxic side effects and better patient tolerance.
      However, the clinical application of apatinib in small cell lung cancer is still lack of
      evidence-based medicine. Etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for
      small-cell lung cancer. The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, prospective study is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of apatinib as the maintenance therapy for extensive
      stage small cell lung cancer after combined with etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy.
