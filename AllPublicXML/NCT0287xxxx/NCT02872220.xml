    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this tudy was to evaluate the potential of photoallergy of of sun
      care products Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 50 Y65 110, SPF 50 Y51 002, and SPF 15 V27 104
      application compared to that of a negative control (0.9% sodium chloride, NaCl) and followed
      by irradiation with UV A and UVB.

      The secondary objective aims for evaluation of the safety of SPF 50 Y65 110, SPF 50 Y51 002,
      and SPF 15 V27 104 combined with ultraviolet (UV) A/B irradiation by monitoring adverse
      events (AEs) throughout the study.
