      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation
      (TENS) is effective on improvement of cognitive disorders in Multiple sclerosis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in the world. One of
      the complications of MS, is cognitive disorder.

      In some studies on rats, stimulation of somatosensory neurons has improved the hippocampus
      activity by increasing the amount of acetylcholine. Hippocampus has a major role in cognition
      and behavior.

      TENS is a non-invasive method in which the electrical pulses are sent to the body trough skin
      by electrodes. This device can stimulate the somatosensory neurons by electrical impulses. In
      several studies, the effect of TENS has been proved on short term memory and verbal fluency
      in patients with mild stages of Alzheimer disease. Also it has been effective on some aspects
      of cognition on old people suffering from forgetfulness.
