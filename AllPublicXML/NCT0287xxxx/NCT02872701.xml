    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, single dose, open-label, exploratory study in suspected lung
      cancer patients scheduled to undergo endoscopic or thoracic surgery per CT/positron emission
      tomography imaging based on standard of care. This study aims to assess the efficacy of OTL38
      and Near Infrared Imaging (NIR) at identifying pulmonary nodules within the operating
      theater, and to assess the safety and tolerability of single intravenous doses of OTL38.

      This is a phase 2, multi-center, single dose, open-label, exploratory study in suspected lung
      cancer patients scheduled to undergo endoscopic or thoracic surgery per CT/positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging based on standard of care.

      Two to three hours prior to surgery, patients will be infused with OTL38. After the patient
      is intubated and surgical site incised, the surgeon will locate and document all nodules
      identifiable by white light, manual palpation, and Near-Infrared Imaging (NIR). This will be
      documented and recorded. Surgery will be completed per surgeon's standard of care, afterwards
      the area will be reviewed under standard and infrared light. All samples will be sent for
      pathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) evaluation.
