  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several factors make the use of celecoxib in human SMA patients appealing including: 1)
      low-dosing required for potential therapeutic effect (the corresponding dose in humans is
      much lower than that commonly used in adults and children with; 2) favourable side effect
      profile of this drug (particularly at the dosing required); 3) the fact that celecoxib
      crosses the blood brain barrier and 4) demonstration of efficacy in a genetically and
      pathophysiologically faithful animal mode. The investigators therefore believe that celecoxib
      is a promising disease modifying therapy for SMA.

      This is a pilot, open-label, dose-response study in patients with SMA type II or III. All
      patients will be treated at each dose of once daily celecoxib (40, 80 and 160 mcg/kg) for a
      period of two weeks, for a total of 6 weeks (42 days) of treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmed genetic diagnosis consistent with SMA that can include: SMN1 gene deletions,
             rearrangements and/or mutations

          2. Sufficient clinical information enabling the patient to be classified as either SMA
             type II or III. (Patients with SMA type II are defined as having achieved the motor
             milestone of sitting independently for &gt; 30 seconds but not having been able to stand
             or walk unsupported. Patients with SMA type III are defined as having achieved the
             motor milestone of standing or walking independently).

          3. Confirmed genetic test result indicating number of SMN2 gene copies

          4. Age &gt; 2.0 years old at screening
