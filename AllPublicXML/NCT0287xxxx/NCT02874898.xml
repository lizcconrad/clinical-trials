  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines how marijuana use affects processes related to recovery from chronic
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Half the participants will be individuals with chronic
      PTSD and heavy marijuana use and half will be individuals with chronic PTSD and no marijuana
      use. This study will assess how individuals with PTSD with heavy or no marijuana use perform
      on a discriminative conditioning and extinction paradigm designed to measure fear extinction
      learning, and how they respond to a brief daily imaginal exposure treatment in regards to
      PTSD symptom reduction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 36 patients with chronic PTSD and heavy marijuana use (heavy) and 36 patients
      with chronic PTSD and no marijuana use (no use) will be recruited to examine the effects of
      marijuana use on behavioral (emotional experiencing), physiological (skin conductance,
      acoustic startle) and biological (cortisol, blood pressure) responding on a well-established
      discriminative conditioning and extinction paradigm. To examine real world therapeutic
      implications, we will also examine how individuals with PTSD and heavy or no marijuana use
      differentially respond to a brief (6 session, 50 min) daily imaginal exposure (IE) treatment.
      Throughout treatment, we will monitor level of cannabis metabolites in urine samples of
      marijuana users to correlate effects to outcomes and preliminarily explore how varying levels
      of cannabis metabolites affect extinction processes. Independent evaluators will assess
      patients at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks following study entry.
