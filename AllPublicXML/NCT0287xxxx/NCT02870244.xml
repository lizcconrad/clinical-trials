    <textblock>
      Phase I clinical trial to determine the Phase II dose of autologous TIL 1383I TCR gene
      modified T Cells using a retrovirus. This is a novel National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded
      investigator initiated therapy for patients with advanced melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study designed to find the highest dose of TIL 1383I TCR
      transduced T cells that can safely be given. Three cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with
      increasing doses of TIL 1383I TCR transduced T cells. Patients will be monitored clinically
      and immunologically for a year after infusion. Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 7.5 X
      10^6/kg TIL 1383I TCR transduced T cells. Subjects in Cohort 2 will receive 2.5 x 10^7/kg TIL
      1383I TCR transduced T cells. Subjects in Cohort 3 will receive 7.5 x 10^7/kg TIL 1383I TCR
      transduced T cells.

    <description>Three patients will be treated at the first &amp; each subsequent dose level. Patients will be observed for 30 days post T cell infusion. If there was one DLT in the first 3 patients, an additional 3 patients will be treated at that level. If no additional DLTs are observed (for a total of 1 DLT in 6 patients) then the dose will be escalated. If two patients in the first 3 patients at a dose level experience a DLT, the dose will be de-escalated to the previous level &amp; an additional 3 patients will be enrolled at that level if 6 have not yet been treated at that level. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose at which 0 or 1 patient in six has experienced a DLT. If 2 or 3 patients in the first 3 patients experience a DLT at the first dose level, the study will terminate.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive a single infusion of autologous bulk TIL 13831 TCR transduced T cells supported with low dose IL-2. Autologous bulk TIL 13831 TCR transduced T cells means the infusion will consist of a polyclonal mixture of CD4 + and CD8+ T Cells expressing the TIL 13831 TCR.
Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive 7.5 x 10^6/kg TIL 1383I TCR transduced T cells.
