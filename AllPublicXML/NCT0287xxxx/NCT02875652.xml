      Quantification and follow-up during 3 years of circulating tumoral DNA in patients with
      choroidal melanoma

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, open-labelled, monocentric trial. The aim is to observe, in
      patient with choroidal melanoma (any stage of the disease), the prevalence of the circulating
      tumor DNA at the diagnostic and its evolution during 3 years.

      The patient will have a blood sample at the following times :

        -  T0: before treatment of the primary tumor.

        -  T1: 1 months after the end of the local treatment.

        -  T2: at 7 months.

        -  Tn: every 6 months up to 3 years.
