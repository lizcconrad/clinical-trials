    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of blinatumomab when given with
      nivolumab alone or nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with poor-risk CD19+
      precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia that has come back after a period of improvement or has
      not responded to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as blinatumomab, nivolumab and
      ipilimumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the blinatumomab given in combination with
      nivolumab alone, or in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab in subjects with
      poor-risk, relapsed or refractory CD19+ pre-B cell ALL or CD19+ mixed phenotype acute
      leukemia (MPAL).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of blinatumomab plus
      nivolumab, and blinatumomab plus both nivolumab and ipilimumab and to further confirm the
      safety of the combination therapy in subjects with poor-risk, relapsed or refractory CD19+
      pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or CD19+ mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-leukemia activity of blinatumomab and nivolumab, and
      blinatumomab plus both nivolumab and ipilimumab, including the effects on minimal residual
      disease (MRD).

      II. To assess preliminary anti-leukemia activity in an expansion cohort of patients with
      poor-risk, relapsed or refractory CD19+ precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia, or CD19+ mixed
      phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine changes in absolute lymphocyte count and distribution of T cell subsets (CD4+,
      CD8+, regulatory T cells [Tregs], effector T cells [Teffs]) and their differentiation status,
      natural killer (NK) cells, and B cells before and post-blinatumomab, and immune checkpoint
      inhibitor(s) therapy in both peripheral blood and the bone marrow microenvironment.

      II. To explore changes in T cell co-signaling receptors expression in defined T cell
      subpopulations and their canonic transcription factor expression in both peripheral blood and
      bone marrow before and post-blinatumomab, and immune checkpoint inhibitor(s) therapy.

      III. To examine changes in expression of co-signaling molecules on leukemia blasts
      (CD10+/CD19+/CD34+) before and after treatment with blinatumomab and checkpoint inhibitors.

      IV. To examine the serum levels of cytokines before and after treatment with blinatumomab and
      checkpoint inhibitors, including the levels of sCTLA-4.

      V. To perform immune profiling of T cell repertoire and characterize T cell transcriptional
      signature before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of blinatumomab.

      Patients receive blinatumomab intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 42 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also receive nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 11 and then every 2 weeks
      for up to year. Some patients also receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 11 and then
      every 6 weeks for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

             infection; symptomatic congestive heart failure; unstable angina pectoris; cardiac
             arrhythmia; or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements; patients with infection under treatment and controlled with
             antibiotics are eligible

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab; these potential risks may also
             apply to blinatumomab

          -  History of any chronic hepatitis including alcoholic, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
             (NASH), drug related, autoimmune, chronic viral positive tests for hepatitis B virus
             surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of
             hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), or a positive hepatitis C (HCV) viral load;
             these patients are excluded

          -  Subjects with active autoimmune disease, a history of known or suspected autoimmune
             disease or a history of a syndrome requiring systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily
             of prednisone equivalent) except for the treatment of malignancy with the exception
             of:

               -  Isolated vitiligo

               -  Resolved childhood atopy

               -  History of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer without associated
                  symptoms or history of symptoms of an autoimmune disorder

               -  Controlled thyroid disorders

               -  Type I diabetes mellitus

               -  Psoriasis, Sjogren's syndrome, and arthropathies not requiring systemic treatment

               -  Autoimmune diseases: these include but are not limited to patients with a history
                  of immune related neurologic disease, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune
                  (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-barre syndrome, myasthenia gravis; systemic
                  autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue
                  diseases, scleroderma, autoimmune vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
                  Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis; and patients with a history of toxic
                  epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome
                  should be excluded

          -  Patients should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration; inhaled or
             topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents
             are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease; patients are permitted to
             use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids
             (with minimal systemic absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic
             corticosteroids are permitted, even if &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief
             course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for
             treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
             caused by contact allergen), or as pre-phase treatment for cytoreduction; patients
             will receive steroids with blinatumomab to reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS) as
             specified in the protocol

          -  Patients who have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal
             abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are
             known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need
             for additional treatment before coming on study

          -  Patients who have a history of clinically relevant CNS pathology such as epilepsy,
             seizure, paresis, aphasia, stroke, severe brain injuries, dementia, Parkinson's
             disease, cerebellar disease, psychosis, or other significant CNS abnormalities; a
             history of treated CNS leukemia will be allowed if recent CNS studies confirm the
             absence of active CNS disease at the time of study entry (screening)

          -  Patients with a known concurrent malignancy that is progressing or requires active
             treatment; exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix

          -  Subjects with interstitial lung disease that is symptomatic or may interfere with the
             detection or management of suspected drug-related pulmonary toxicity
