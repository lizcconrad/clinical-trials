      This small study will look at the safety and estimate the strength of effect (effect size) of
      a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) and
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in ten pairs of people, one
      with and one without PTSD. The pairs can be spouses or romantic partners, siblings or other
      relatives or close friends. The study will measure PTSD symptoms, as well as symptoms of
      depression, sleep quality and relationship satisfaction and functioning before and after a
      one-month course of CBCT that includes two MDMA+CBCT visits. CBCT psychotherapy is designed
      to treat PTSD and relationship problems in pairs in a close relationship, and MDMA-assisted
      psychotherapy uses the experimental drug MDMA to enhance and strengthen psychotherapy. There
      is evidence that each of these treatments, on its own, can help people with PTSD. The study
      will also measure personality and how each member of a pair thinks about and behaves in
      relationships and expresses emotions before and after having MDMA+CBCT. Pairs will have two
      day-long sessions scheduled two weeks apart. During the first MDMA+CBCT session, both members
      of the pair will receive 75 mg MDMA with the option of receiving a second dose of 37.5
      approximately an hour and a half later. During the second session of MDMA+CBCT, subjects may
      receive either 100 or 75 mg, with the decision concerning dose made by the researchers after
      discussion with the subjects. An optional dose half the size of the initial dose will be
      offered approximately an hour and a half later. Following informed consent and screening
      there will be one enrollment visit over videoconference. Before the first MDMA+CBCT session,
      there will be an introductory session including 3 segments of CBCT psychotherapy on the day
      before the first MDMA session. The introductory session and the CBCT sessions will be done in
      person at the study site. During each MDMA+CBCT sessions, two therapists will work with with
      the pair. Blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature will be measured periodically
      during each MDMA+CBCT session. The pair will stay at the study site overnight with a night
      attendant on duty, and they will have an integrative psychotherapy session on the morning
      after the MDMA+CBCT session. Each member of the pair will be contacted by the researchers for
      a week after each MDMA+CBCT session. The pair will have CBCT and integrative sessions over
      videoconferencing twice a week for two weeks following the on-site integrative session. One
      month after the second MDMA+CBCT session, both participants will have an evaluation and
      testing visit over videoconference and will complete measures of PTSD symptoms, sleep
      quality, perceived growth related to experiencing a trauma, symptoms of depression, and how
      people think and feel about emotions and their relationships. The member of the pair with
      PTSD will also undergo an interview measure of PTSD symptoms. The pair will complete measures
      and questionnaires three and six months after the second MDMA+CBCT session. The study is open
      label, meaning the researchers and subjects will be aware of the doses of MDMA used in the
      study. The study will test and compare changes in symptoms and relationship issues before and
      after the course of psychotherapy.

    <textblock>
      PTSD is a debilitating psychiatric disorder arising after a traumatic life event. The
      condition is a public health issue. There are recognized psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic
      treatments for PTSD, but a wider array of treatments is needed. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
      (MDMA) has shown promise in Phase 2 research studies as a psychotherapeutic adjunct for
      people with PTSD. In the context of psychotherapy, MDMA has been noted to reduce defenses and
      fear of emotional injury while enhancing communication and capacity for introspection.
      Cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy (CBCT) for PTSD is a three-phase, 15-session,
      manualized treatment engaging an individual with PTSD and a &quot;concerned significant other&quot; in
      addressing PTSD symptoms, and relationship issues together. During the course of CBCT, pairs
      are provided with information about PTSD and the therapy rationale, address relationship
      issues and a key PTSD symptom and consider the meaning of the traumatic event. MDMA-assisted
      psychotherapy is a manualized treatment developed to use the effects of MDMA to enhance and
      strengthen the therapeutic process, and it includes preparatory and integrative sessions that
      occur prior to and after up to three sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

      This study will combine methods described in the Treatment Manual for conducting
      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with methods from the CBCT for PTSD manual. A combined treatment
      of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and CBCT may be especially useful for treating PTSD because
      MDMA can attenuate the fear arising in response to perceived threat to one's emotional
      integrity and decrease defensiveness without blocking access to memories or preventing a deep
      and genuine experience of emotion. Elimination of these conditioned fear responses can lead
      to more open and comfortable communication about past traumatic events and greater access to
      information about them. Participants are expected to be able to experience and express fear,
      anger, and grief, and to be able to engage in the CBCT sessions with less likelihood of
      feeling overwhelmed by these emotions. As a result, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with CBCT may
      enable the participants to develop a wider behavioral and emotional repertoire with which to
      communicate with each other and respond to anxiogenic stimuli.

      This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study in 10 dyads (pairs) that include a participant who has
      been diagnosed with PTSD for at least 6 months (PTSD+ participant) and a concerned
      significant other participant (i.e., intimate or non-intimate person) who does not have a
      current diagnosis of PTSD (CSO participant). The overall objective of this study is to
      explore the safety and estimate the effect size of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in conjunction
      with CBCT (MDMA+CBCT) on PTSD symptoms in participants with PTSD and, to examine relationship
      functioning in both participants. Dyads in this study will be enrolled in a course of CBCT
      that will also include two sessions of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Eligible and enrolled
      participants will undergo a 1-month course of psychotherapy as a dyad that includes CBCT for
      PTSD integrated with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

      Prior to the first session with MDMA and CBCT, participants will undergo an introductory
      psychotherapy session via telemedicine (videoconference) followed by a five-hour CBCT visit
      at the study site. After each MDMA+CBCT session, the pair will have integrative sessions that
      include an on-site integrative session on the day following MDMA+CBCT and further integrative
      and CBCT sessions conducted via videoconference.

      During the first experimental (MDMA+CBCT) session, both members of the pair will receive 75
      mg MDMA with the option of receiving a second dose of 37.5 approximately an hour and a half
      later. During the second session, subjects may receive either 100 or 75 mg, with the decision
      concerning dose made by the researchers. An optional dose half the size of the initial dose
      may be offered approximately an hour and a half later. The doses used in this study have been
      investigated by researchers conducting trials in healthy human volunteers and people with
      PTSD. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature) will be periodically
      measured during the session, and the pair will complete simple measures of state
      interpersonal closeness and degree of distress. They will have an overnight stay at the study
      site, followed by the first post-session integrative session on the day after the
      experimental session. The researchers will contact the PTSD+ and CSO daily for a week after
      each MDMA+CBCT session, with contact possible through telephone or teleconference line.
      Integrative sessions will occur over teleconference (telemedicine) line. Integrative
      psychotherapy held over videoconference falls after the on-site integrative session.

      Thirteen days after the first experimental session, the dyad meet with the investigators at
      the study site to complete measures of PTSD symptoms, symptoms of other conditions, emotion
      perception and regulation, sleep quality, facets of interpersonal relationships and
      psychological function. The course of combined CBCT and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy will
      continue until approximately two and a half weeks after the second MDMA+CBCT session, when
      the primary endpoint assessment will occur. The dyad will be assessed at the three month and
      six month follow up visits.

      Dyads will participate in an introductory session, CBCT sessions, two day-long MDMA+CBCT
      sessions, and five integrative sessions after each MDMA+ CBCT session. PTSD symptoms, growth
      from trauma experience, sleep quality, symptoms of depression, other psychological symptoms
      or difficulties, emotion regulation, emotion perception, relationship factors, and facets of
      life function will be measured two weeks after the first MDMA-assisted session and five
      weeks, three months and six months after the second and final MDMA-assisted session.
      Assessment five weeks after the second experimental (MDMA-assisted) session will be the study
      primary endpoint. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale - 5 (CAPS-5) will be the primary
      outcome measure, with drops in CAPS-5 Global Severity score expected from baseline to primary
      endpoint. There will be follow up assessments three and six months after the second MDMA+CBCT
      session. Safety data collected will include vital signs during each MDMA+CBCT session,
      suicidal ideation and behavior assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
      (C-SSRS). Adverse events will be collected throughout the course of the study.
