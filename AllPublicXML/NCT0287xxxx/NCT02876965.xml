      This study evaluates the effect to a muscle stretching program combined with physical
      exercise versus a physical exercise program in patients with fibromyalgia.

    <textblock>
      Although classically this pathology was characterized by having an unknown etiology, current
      research suggests that the disease shows several abnormalities in the central pain
      processing.

      Central sensitization is defined as changes in neuroplasticity of central nervous system as a
      result of persistent and intense sensory information nociceptive generated by peripheral and
      transmitted to the neurons in the dorsal horn of the cord through the nerves of the
      peripheral nervous system tissues, through a constant activity of C fibers and A-beta fibers.

      In recent years the theory that pain is responsible for other symptoms, is changing, and it
      is theorized that the quality of sleep directly influences in the symptoms.

      The treatment of fibromyalgia is based on trying to reduce pain and associated symptoms
      described above in order to improve the quality of life of these patients. Almost all
      revisions studying the effects of physical activity in fibromyalgia agree that it is
      effective in reducing the overall impact on the disease and its symptoms.

      Muscle strength training aim to improve the strength, endurance and muscle power. There are
      few conclusive studies on the benefits of stretching and flexibility exercises on the impact
      of fibromyalgia.
