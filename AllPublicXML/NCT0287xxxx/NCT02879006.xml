  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is testing the use E-B-FAHF-2 Chinese herbal therapy in combination
      with multi-food oral immunotherapy (OIT) and Xolair速 (Omalizumab) to help children and adults
      who are allergic to foods be able to safely tolerate food allergens. Specifically in this
      protocol, the food allergens are milk, egg, peanut, almond, cashew, hazelnut, walnut, sesame,
      and/or wheat. Omalizumab is considered an investigational drug for the treatment of food
      allergies in children and adults. Investigational means it has not been approved by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the U.S. The researchers hope to learn whether the
      addition of Chinese herbal therapy (E-B-FAHF-2) can improve the outcome of sustained
      unresponsiveness (which is the ability to consume a food allergen and pass an oral food
      challenge after being off treatment for 3 months) as compared to placebo (i.e. subjects with
      OIT/Omalizumab + herbal vs. OIT/Omalizumab + placebo), and will help adults and children be
      able to safely ingest the foods they are allergic to.

      Prior studies have shown that this Chinese herbal formulation is safe and well-tolerated in
      food allergic individuals. While oral immunotherapy (OIT) can lead to desensitization, it
      remains uncertain whether this treatment can lead to lasting protection. Therefore, this
      study aims to use the Chinese herbal formula in combination with OIT to determine whether
      sustained protection can be achieved. All subjects will receive multi-allergen OIT, along
      with a 4 month course of omalizumab to provide added safety for the initial dose escalation
      and build up phases. Subjects will be randomized to receive active Chinese herbal formula or
      placebo. Subjects will be treated with OIT for 2 years and then food challenges will be
      performed to assess for desensitization. For those who achieve desensitization, all
      treatments will be discontinued and food challenges will be performed 3 months later to
      assess for sustained unresponsiveness.
