  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot longitudinal mixed-methods study of pregnant women (n=20) who participate in
      CPC+Y at the VCU Health System Nelson Clinic or the Virginia Department of Health Richmond
      Health District's prenatal clinic (RHD) during their pregnancies. This pilot project will
      provide the necessary preliminary data to fuel an appropriately powered randomized controlled
      trial to evaluate the effects of CPC+Y in controlling weight gain, enhancing stress
      resilience, and improving maternal-child outcomes among overweight/obese diverse women.
      Because increasing physical activity has been found to have important mental health effects
      and maternal-child outcomes, it stands to reason that this innovative intervention has the
      potential to impact the way prenatal care is delivered in high risk populations.
