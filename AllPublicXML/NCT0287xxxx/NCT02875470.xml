      This study compares the efficacy of diamond burs and Gracey curettes in non-surgical
      periodontal treatment of chronic periodontitis by clinical, microbiological, biochemical
      parameters and scanning electron microscopic investigations on root surfaces. Two quadrants
      of each of the 12 patients were treated with diamond burs whereas other 2 quadrants were
      treated with Gracey curettes. Also 21 hopeless teeth received root planing either with
      diamond burs or curettes or no treatment at all and were then extracted for microscopic
      evaluations.

      Gracey curettes are the most widely used instruments for root planing and regarded as the
      gold standard, but their usage is technic sensitive and time consuming for the clinician and
      efficacy reduces in deep pockets, root irregularities, and furcations. Alternative sonic,
      ultrasonic and rotary instruments have been investigated for potential benefits in improving
      mechanical access. Sonic and ultrasonic instruments are used for scaling, but they cannot
      provide smooth root surfaces.

      Intensiv Perio Set is a rotating diamond bur system developed for odontoplasty, scaling and
      root planing. It is used only in right angle hand piece, at rotation speeds of 6000 rpm, with
      reduced pressure application. These burs have two different head types for morphologically
      different areas; flame or tapered, three different grains; 75, 40, or 15 μm, with either a
      short or long neck for each unit. Burs with 75 μm grain are used only in odontoplasty,
      whereas, 40 and 15 μm burs are used for scaling and root planing.
