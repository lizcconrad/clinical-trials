      Community Health Workers (CHWs) using patient stories to support hypertension management is a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate the implementation of a CHW-delivered culturally
      appropriate storytelling intervention for english and spanish-speaking patients diagnosed
      with hypertension who receive care at community health center settings.

      Community Health Workers (CHWs) using patient stories to support hypertension (HTN)
      management is a CHW-delivered culturally appropriate storytelling intervention for patients
      diagnosed with HTN. We will develop and test interactive videos presenting stories of
      patients who have successfully made changes enhancing blood pressure control; and integrate
      this new tool with a CHW approach to management of hypertension. This two site, two-armed
      randomized controlled trial aims to recruit 252 english and spanish speaking patients with
      uncontrolled HTN. All participants are randomized to receive five visits (two in-person and 3
      telephone calls) with CHWs either immediately (intervention condition (I)) or 6 months after
      enrollment (delayed intervention (DI)). Intervention participants receive the intervention
      immediately and DI participants receive print materials at enrollment and are telephoned 4-6
      months after enrollment to schedule an in-person visit at the health enter to begin receiving
      the intervention protocol.

    <description>Patients will receive five visits with a CHW during a 6 month period (two in-person and three by telephone). At the first visit, patients will meet the CHW who is trained in motivational interviewing techniques to deliver coaching to work on behavioral changes and introduce a 60 minute Digital Video Disc of five patient stories of individuals who have managed to control their hypertension.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive print materials at time of consent and randomization. Four to six months after randomization, DI patients will receive an invitation to schedule an in-person visit at the health center to begin receiving the intervention protocol.</description>

    <description>During an in-person visit, patients receive a pamphlet in english and spanish and a storytelling Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) (developed for this project from interviews with hypertensive patients), supplemented by motivational interviewing delivered by the CHW. The CHW explores the patient's motivation to change associated with hypertension and counsels on risk factor control (tobacco, diet, physical activity). Patients receive a followup telephone call from the CHW in 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months to support any changes or goals discussed at first visit. Six months after first intervention visit, patients are invited to schedule an in-person visit with the CHW at the health center to discuss goals and provide support for change.</description>
