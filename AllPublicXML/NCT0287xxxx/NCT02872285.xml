      The objective of this Phase 2 trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of LYC-30937-EC
      in patients with moderate plaque-type psoriasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
      The cohorts will be stratified 2:1, with one of the cohorts being placebo. The active cohort
      will receive LYC-30937-EC 25 mg once daily, which demonstrated safety and tolerability in
      Phase I trials.

      The study is designed for patients with previously diagnosed moderate chronic plaque-type
      psoriasis and consists of the following:

        -  Screening period (initials assessment and eligibility scoring)

        -  Day 1: confirm eligibility, baseline efficacy assessments (PASI, IGA), randomize and
           initiate dosing

        -  Week 2: safety assessments including vital signs, body temperature, physical exam,
           clinical labs will be performed

        -  Week 4: efficacy (PASI, IGA) and safety assessments including vital signs, body
           temperature, physical exam, and clinical labs will be performed

        -  Week 8: efficacy (PASI, IGA) and safety assessments including vital signs, body
           temperature, physical exam, and clinical labs will be performed

        -  Week 12: final efficacy assessments (PASI, IGA), safety assessments including vital
           signs, body temperature, physical exam, ECG, and clinical labs will be performed

        -  Week 14: final safety assessments including vital signs, body temperature, and clinical
           labs
