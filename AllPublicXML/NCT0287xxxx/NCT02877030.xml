      Testing the effectiveness of an exercise protocol engines sensory performed through a virtual
      reality platform in individuals infected with HTLV-1

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crossover randomized clinical trial to be conducted with people having a previous diagnosis
      of HTLV-1, they can remain in standing position without assistance. They will be excluded
      from those presenting amputation of the lower limbs, pregnancy, psychiatric disorders,
      rheumatic or orthopedic diseases, other neurological disorders associated and those that are
      experiencing difficulty in understanding the assessment tools used. They will also be
      recruited to a comparative group, healthy individuals, matched for sex, age and education
      level. It will be performed three assessments, before randomization, after 10 weeks and after
      20 weeks, which will be evaluated in balance, functional mobility, gait and posture. The
      participants infected with HTLV-1, will be divided into two groups by random distribution, a
      group will begin the treatment protocol with video game immediately after the first
      evaluation and the other after ten weeks, with the crossing of the groups . Concealment of
      allocation will be guaranteed to the examiners who will have no contact with the
      physiotherapist who will apply the exercise protocol and the team member responsible for
      drawing. Patients will also be instructed to maintain confidentiality of the entry in the
      exercise program to other patients and examiners.

    <description>The protocol sensorimotor exercises consist of a virtual game that attaches to the Nintendo Wii and using arrows that are thrown from above, players must perform weight-shifting movements in the Nintendo platform to the target be directed to the trajectory the arrows. The goal is to catch as many arrows.</description>
