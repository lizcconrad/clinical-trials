      Phase I/IIA, open label, non-randomised, single site trial in patients with primary breast
      cancer.

      This is a phase I / IIa study recruiting patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer.
      Patients who have chosen mastectomy or wide local excision as their surgical option will be
      included. Patients will have a pre therapy MRI followed by photodynamic therapy. PDT involves
      intravenously injecting the photosensitizer Verteporfin (Visudyne) drug. This drug makes the
      tumour sensitive to light. A non-thermal light will then be shone in the tumour which brings
      about tissue necrosis (destruction). Although the drug dose will remain the same, the light
      dose will be escalated depending on patient response in accordance to a predefined algorithm
      (see section) to achieve a zone of necrosis of 12mm or a plateau of necrosis with incremental
      increase in light dose. An MRI will be performed immediately prior to the scheduled surgery.
      Pre and post PDT MRI changes will be correlated with the histological findings on the excised
      breast specimen. Should the minimum light dose for 12mm necrosis be established recruitment
      will continue until 12 patients have received this dose. These 12 patients will provide
      sample data on the size of tumour and area of necrosis detected by MRI and histology to
      enable sample size (power) calculations for future studies of PDT in primary breast cancer.
      This is a dose escalation study involving a minimum of twelve and a maximum of forty
      patients.

    <description>A single intravenous injection of Verteporfin (0.4mg/kg) will be administered, at least 60minutes and up to 90 minutes before laser activation. A 690nm red laser light will be delivered with a diffuser laser fibre inserted through the skin into the breast tissue, with light dose escalation after every three patients. All patients will have fixed dose of the photosensitizer but variable light dose.</description>

    <description>Verteporfin (which is marketed under the brand name Visudyne) is the photosensitizer. Verteporfin is a benzoporphyrin derivative which is clinically active when formulated with liposomes. By itself the clinically recommended dose of Verteporfin is not cytotoxic. It produces cytotoxic agents only when activated by light in the presence of oxygen. When energy absorbed by the porphyrin is transferred to oxygen, highly reactive short lived singlet oxygen is generated. Singlet oxygen causes damage to biological structures, leading to local vascular occlusion, cell damage and cell death.</description>
