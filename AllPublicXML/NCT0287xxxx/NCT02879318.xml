    <textblock>
      Durvalumab is a new type of drug for many types of cancer. Laboratory tests show that it
      works by allowing the immune system to detect cancer and reactivate the immune response. This
      may halp to slow down the growth of cancer or may cause cancer cells to die. Durvalumab has
      been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems
      promising but it is not clear if it can offer better results than standard treatments alone.

      Tremelimumab is a new type of drug for various types of cancers. It works in a similar way to
      durvalumab and may improve the effect of durvalumab. This may also help slow the growth of
      the cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die. Tremelimumab has been shown to shrink
      tumours in animals and has been studied in a few people and seems promising but it is not
      clear if it can offer better results than standard treatment alone when used with durvalumab.

      Combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab have also been studied and when combined have been
      shown to increase tumour shrinkage in animals compared to either drug alone and while the
      combination has been studied in a few people, it is not clear if it can offer better results
      than standard treatment.

             representative formalin fixed paraffin block of tumour tissue of adequate amount and
             quality in order that the specific correlative marker assays proscribed in the
             protocol may be conducted.

          -  Patient must consent to provision of samples of blood, serum and plasma in order that
             the specific correlative marker assays proscribed may be conducted.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 with a life expectancy of at

             occur through the course of the trial. This implies there must be reasonable
             geographical limits placed on patients being considered for this trial. Sites are
             encouraged to contact CCTG (or their respective Cooperative Group for sites outside
             Canada) for any questions regarding the interpretation of this criterion.
