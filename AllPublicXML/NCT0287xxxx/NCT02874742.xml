  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the addition of daratumumab to
      lenalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (RVd) will increase the proportion of participants
      achieving stringent complete response (sCR), as defined by the International Myeloma Working
      Group (IMWG) criteria, by the time of completion of post autologous stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT) consolidation treatment, compared with RVd alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Considered by the investigator to be eligible for high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) and
             autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) according to the institution's criteria
             based on age, medical history, cardiac and pulmonary status, overall health and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed or treated for malignancy other than multiple myeloma, except: a) Malignancy

             equal to (&gt;= )3 years before randomization; b) Adequately treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer, lentigo maligna or in situ malignancies (including but not limited to,
             cervical, breast) with no evidence of disease

          -  Exhibiting clinical signs of or has a known history of meningeal or central nervous
             system involvement by multiple myeloma

          -  Known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a forced expiratory volume in 1
             second (FEV1) less than (&lt;)50 percent (%) of predicted normal

          -  Known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years or currently has
             uncontrolled asthma of any classification

          -  Known to be seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus, known to have hepatitis B
             surface antigen positivity, or known to have a history of hepatitis C. Participants
             who completed treatment for hepatitis C at least 6 months prior to screening and have
             no detectable circulating hepatitis C virus (HCV) at screening, may participate in the
             study. Such participants will be required to undergo regular assessment for HCV
             reactivation during their participation in the study. Participants who test positive
             for HCV at any time during these assessments will be withdrawn from the study
