  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of minimal invasive surgical
      resection through simultaneously integrated dose escalation given concurrently with
      chemotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell cervical cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy is the standard of care for locally advanced
      cervical cancer. While there are several acceptable means to boost the disease in the low
      pelvis (i.e. brachytherapy, IMRT, or external beam), there is limited research into minimal
      invasive surgical resection after maximal downstage. This protocol is designed to determine
      the dose escalation of both chemo and radiation for treating tumor bearing regions within the
      abdomen and pelvis, using an two drug chemotherapy in first cycle of mitomycin/cisplatin or
      taxol/cisplatin along with simultaneously integrated boost technique to Biological target
      area defined by PET scan. This dose escalation is to downstage disease for minimal invasive
      surgical resection.

    <description>To Maximal downstage locally advanced squamous cell cervical cancer before minimal invasive surgical resection. The SIDE study is to use both RT dose escalation to the biological target defined by PET and Chemo dose escalation composited with two drugs to achieve maximal reduction of tumor burden, providing feasibility of minimal invasive surgical resection.</description>

    <intervention_name>Simultaneous boost along with chemo</intervention_name>
    <description>Prior studies have utilized a sequential boost to deliver a total dose of 55 - 60 Gy to the pelvic sidewall (covering the lower pelvic lymph nodes), including 8-10 Gy that is usually delivered with brachytherapy (1-3), the studies often use single drug. This study treatment plan will use dose intensify in both chemotherapy and radiation. The chemotherapy have two drugs regimens of mitomycin with cisplatin or taxol with cisplatin along of radiation dose escalate, the RT dose escalation to biological GTV defined by PET scan to dose of 57.50 Gy in 25 fx while the elective volumes are held constant at 45 Gy.</description>
