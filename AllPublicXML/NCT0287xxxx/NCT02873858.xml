  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a frequent problem in persons older than 65 years: the prevalence of
      malnutrition can reach 25 to 29% in persons living at home who require help, figures vary
      between 19 and 38% for those living in institutions, and finally, the prevalence of
      malnutrition in hospitalized elderly patients can reach 30 to 90%. A few studies have
      attempted to explain modifications in attitudes, behaviour, the frequency of meals or
      nutritional status in the elderly by a fall in chemosensory sensitivity The aim of this
      project is to test the hypothesis that perhaps it is not as much the capacity to perceive a
      smell or a taste that affects eating behaviour in the elderly as their ability to distinguish
      between smells or tastes on the one hand (perceptual processing), and their ability to
      correctly interpret a chemosensory signal on the other (cognitive processing).
