  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will target patients who have received a histopathological diagnosis of prostate
      cancer and who are undergoing treatment in various forms, including active PSA surveillance,
      surgical treatment, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. The study will survey
      information about the patient at time of diagnosis, clinical staging, details of initial
      treatment, status of disease progression, and prognosis at the end point of the study. The
      purpose of the study is to clarify distribution of staging, the actual status of treatment
      choices and treatment outcomes.

      The A-CaP will collect information in a linkable anonymized format from all medical
      institutions in Asian countries participating in the study and will engage in data analysis.
      J-CaP which has previous experience of engaging in a similar study in 2010 wll be a sponsor
      for A-CaP study, the aggregated results of which have been reported. The registration period
      for this study will be three years followed by 7 years of follow-up study, and research will
      be implemented across a wider range of Asian countries, with new institutions participating
      for the purposes of this study. As this study will be an observational study the acquisition
      of data will be relatively simple, and as the content of the study will be almost identical
      to the study conducted by J-CaP in 2010, a system for research implementation is already
      established at J-CaP.

    <description>The following items are examined for primary outcome measure.
Patient background which is represented by month and year of birth; height and weight; ethnicity and family history; medical history; and name of condition/disease for which currently receiving treatment at hospital.
Information pertaining to prostate cancer which is represented by PSA value at time of prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason score.
Prognosis information which is survival or death at end point of the Study.</description>

    <measure>Patient QOL measured by SF-36 during treatment by comparison with A-Cap data and data in the United States and Australia</measure>
    <time_frame>three years</time_frame>
    <description>The short form 36 (SF-36) is used for an evaluation indicator of patient QOL. SF-36 includes the following eight elements.
Physical functioning
Role functioning Physical
Bodily pain
General health
Vitality
Social functioning
Role functioning emotional
Mental health
More detailed questions are prepared under the above each eight element, which a score is produced for a quantitative outcome of the patients QOL.</description>
