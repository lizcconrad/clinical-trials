    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy and safety of high dose vitamin D therapy
      among HSCT patients in a tiered, step-wise manner (step one/two) in order to define treatment
      doses capable of providing vitamin D sufficiency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is common in childhood and has been associated with increased incidence
      of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and decreased survival in patients undergoing
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Recently, quality improvement efforts to
      correct serum vitamin D levels among inpatients at CCHMC who have already received HSCT and
      who were vitamin D deficient suggest that current recommended doses of vitamin D are
      inadequate to treat vitamin D deficiency. Possible hindrances to vitamin D treatment in the
      HSCT population include malabsorption related to gut GVHD, mucositis, increased requirement
      for calcium and/or vitamin D, kidney disease, liver disease, and infection. Single, high dose
      vitamin D treatment (stoss-therapy) has been utilized effectively to treat rickets and other
      chronic illnesses such as cystic fibrosis in children. The investigators hypothesize that
      stoss-therapy provided orally prior to transplantation will result in rapid and sustained
      correction of vitamin D deficiency in children who require HSCT. The investigators propose to
      test the efficacy and safety of high dose vitamin D therapy among HSCT patients in a tiered,
      step-wise manner (step one/two) in order to define treatment doses capable of providing
      vitamin D sufficiency.
