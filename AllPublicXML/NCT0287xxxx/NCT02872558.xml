      This study will evaluate the efficacy of shared decision making in treatment of Acute Otitis
      Media in the Emergency Department setting.

  <detailed_description>

      The Investigators long-term goal is to promote evidence-based, patient-centered evaluation in
      the acute care setting to more closely tailor antibiotic use to disease risk for Acute Otitis
      Media (AOM) in children.

      The Investigator will conduct a single-center cluster randomized control trial comparing the
      efficacy, safety and patient-centered outcomes of the shared decision-making decision aid
      'Acute Otitis Media Choice' to usual care among children diagnosed with acute otitis media in
      the ED for whom antibiotics are being considered to engage parents in shared decision-making.

    <description>For patients whose clinician is randomized to the decision aid arm:
The study coordinator will provide the decision aid for the parent/clinician dyad.
The study coordinator will provide a color-printed copy of the decision aid to the clinician prior to the clinician having the antibiotics discussion with the parents.
The study coordinator will offer to provide the treating clinician a concise refresher of the content included in the decision aid in the context of the trial.
The clinician will then, using the decision aid as a tool to facilitate discussion regarding the natural course of AOM, pain control, antibiotics exposure and deeper infections.
The clinician will then engage the parents in a shared decision regarding the use of immediate antibiotics versus a wait and watch prescription that is consistent with both the parent's values and preferences and the clinician's level of comfort.</description>
