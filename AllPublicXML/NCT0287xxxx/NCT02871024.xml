  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toraymyxin is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge containing Polymyxin B-immobilized
      fiber column designed to reduce blood endotoxin levels in sepsis. Meta-analysis of randomized
      trials showed that polymyxin B hemoperfusion significantly reduced the mortality of severe
      sepsis; however, the evidence was mainly contributed by the studies of abdominal sepsis. The
      data about using polymyxin B hemoperfusion to treat non-abdominal sepsis remain very limited.
      Investigators designed a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of polymyxin B hemoperfusion
      on treating non-abdominal severe sepsis. The study hypothesis is that removal of endotoxin by
      polymyxin B hemoperfusion in patients with pneumonia or urinary tract infection (UTI)-related
      severe sepsis will attenuate sepsis associated microcirculation failure and result in early
      reversal of shock and less extent of end-organ damage.
