  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main assumption is that the dolutegravir can get virologic suppression to suboptimal
      adherence levels (between 80 and 95%, and after treatment interruptions) where other
      molecules are not capable, due to their pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pardonnance).

      While the investigators goal is not to compare molecules (study with one arm) in terms of
      forgiveness, the results of this cohort in terms of forgiveness could be compared to other
      cohorts available.
