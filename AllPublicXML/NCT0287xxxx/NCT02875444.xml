  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, monitoring its growth and evaluation of its risk
      of rupture are based on the measure of its maximum diameter. The abdominal aortic aneurysm's
      treatment to prevent its rupture is recommended from a threshold of 50-55 mm in men and of
      45-50 mm in women.

      The importance of this measure for patient management justify a specific and homogeneous
      protocol of measure. However, the diversity of methods of measuring the maximum diameter with
      scanner and ultrasound was shown.

      The impact of various angio-CT based measures of maximum AAA diameter, and the impact of
      reproducibility limits on the decision to operate have never been investigated.

      The aims of the study were :

      Analyze the consequences on clinical decisions of this wide choice of methodologies for
      measurement of abdominal aortic aneurysm maximum diameter when using angio-CT; Identify the
      method of measurement that yields the best agreement for patient management.
