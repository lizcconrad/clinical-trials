  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores whether offering follow-up counseling and referral over the phone after
      using a home-based HIV test increases rates of ever and repeat testing, compared with
      home-based testing with no follow-up (HBST alone) or mailing reminders for clinic-based
      testing.

    <description>These participants will download a study-specific smartphone app (&quot;eTEST&quot;), and receive home-based HIV test kits in the mail every 3 months. These kits will have been fit with sensors that enable remote detection of when the kit was opened. Qualified HIV test counselors (QHTC) will then follow up with these participants within 24 hours of receiving notification that the test has been opened to conduct routine counseling, offer referrals for other services, and connect those with reactive results with follow-up care.</description>
