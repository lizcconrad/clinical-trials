             self-report.

          3. A clinical diagnosis of IPF and characteristic chest HRCT scan (determined by panel of
             pulmonary radiologists) OR biopsy showing usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

             (weight in kg) / (height in meters)2 .

          5. Subjects participating in an exercise program must be willing to maintain their
             current activity level for the duration of the study period.

          6. Patients on stable therapy with nintedanib (Ofev) or pirfenidone (Esbriet) over the
             past 3 months.ORPatients not taking nintedanib (Ofev) or pirfenidone (Esbriet) may be
             enrolled if they have previously not tolerated one of those medications or if those
             medications have not yet been prescribed or used by the patient.

          7. Giving signed informed consent.

          8. No plans to travel over the next 6 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. More than two moderate/severe IPF exacerbations within the past year Exacerbation is
             defined as worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms: dyspnea, sputum
             volume, sputum purulence OR worsening of any one major symptom together with at least
             one of the following additional symptoms: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or

             A moderate exacerbation is defined as an event that is associated with a new
             prescription for antibiotics and/or oral steroids. A severe exacerbation is defined as
             an event that is associated with hospitalization or emergency room visit.

             catheterization.

          6. Myocardial infarction, angina, hospitalization for cardiac aetiology, stroke or
             transient ischemic attack in the past 6 months.

             provided in the Study Reference Manual (SRM). Note: Subjects receiving dialysis are
             excluded from this study.

             ALT &gt;2xULN and bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if
             bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

         11. Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

         12. QTcB or QTcF &gt; 450 msec or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block based
             on a single ECG.

         13. Subjects with a history of malignancy that is not in complete remission for at least 2
             years or 1 year for non-melanoma skin carcinoma.

         14. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to participation in the current study:
             30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

         15. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 5 years prior to randomization.

         16. Use of Coumadin or other anti-platelet or anti-coagulant medication. The use of
