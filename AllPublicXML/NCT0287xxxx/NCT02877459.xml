    <textblock>
      The AeriSeal-STAGE trial will be a prospective, multicenter study that intends to evaluate
      the safety of a modified staged treatment algorithm with an escalation of dose using the
      AeriSeal System in the treatment of subjects with severe emphysema in a controlled trial
      design setting as compared to published data from prior studies. The trial is anticipated to
      enroll fifteen (15) study subjects with homogeneous, or upper lobe predominant heterogeneous
      emphysema, in three (3) centers in Europe.
