    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a biobank, which collects, stores, and distributes
      samples of human tissues, blood, and related health information to qualified scientists, in
      order to help doctors and researchers better understand why Castleman Disease occurs and
      develop ways to better treat and prevent it.

      The CDCN proposes to establish a biobank and associated clinical data for Castleman disease.
      Tissue and fluid (blood and saliva) samples will be collected both prospectively and
      retrospectively. Blood or saliva samples may also be collected from relatives of Castleman
      patients. Because of the scarcity of these samples, it will be necessary to make efforts to
      access all available cases. Many cases will occur at hospitals that do not have an existing
      relationship with the CDCN and may not have experience with tissue procurement; however, this
      is the only way to obtain the vast majority of samples. Samples may be used immediately,
      banked for future use, or further processed into DNA, cell lines, tissue microarrays, etc.

      The samples will be stored at Precision for Medicine, a biorepository company that
      specializes in collection, processing, storage and distribution of biospecimens. Only
      researchers (US or international) who have applied to the CDCN and have been approved by the
      Biobank Advisory Board will be eligible to access biospecimens and/or data. The Biobank
      Advisory Board will be comprised of clinicians and scientists with experience in clinical and
      investigational practices in Castleman Disease.
