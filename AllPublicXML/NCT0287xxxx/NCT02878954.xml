    <textblock>
      This research project aims to investigate the gender-based difference in patients with
      peripheral artery disease. To attend this, this study has two specific objectives:

      Objective 1: To identify gender-specific barriers towards exercise and physical activity in
      patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).

      Objective 2: To evaluate gender-specific differences in functional capacity and
      cardiovascular function and regulation in patients with PAD at rest, during and following a
      single session of maximal exercise.

    <measure>Barriers towards exercise assessed by questionnaires in patients with peripheral artery disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional study. This outcome will be measured through study completion, an average of 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>After completion of the 6-minute walking test, patients will be asked to fill in the following questionnaires: walking impairment questionnaire, walking estimated-limitation calculated by history (WELCH), San Diego Claudication Questionnaire, SF-36 and two questionnaires for personal and environmental barriers to physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gender-specific differences in walk capacity in patients with peripheral artery disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional study. This outcome will be measured through study completion, an average of 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The measurements of this outcome will be performed in a second visit day, separated by at least 48h from visit 1 (outcome 1).
Patients will perform a maximal exercise test to determine claudication onset distance (m) defined as the distance walked until the patients first reported pain in the leg during the treadmill test and total walk distance (m) defined as the total distance that the patient was able to walk during the test.</description>

    <measure>Gender-specific differences in functional capacity in patients with peripheral artery disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional study. This outcome will be measured through study completion, an average of 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Walking economy defined as VO2 measured during the first stage of the treadmill test and functional capacity defined as VO2 peak obtained during the test will be obtained.</description>

    <measure>Gender-specific differences in autonomic modulation at rest and after a maximal exercise test</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional study. This outcome will be measured through study completion, an average of 18 months.</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomic modulation: assessed by spectral analysis of heart rate and systolic blood pressure variabilities. Heart rate (electrocardiogram) and beat-by-beat blood pressure (finometer) will be recorded for 10 min at a sample frequency of 500Hz/channel.</description>

    <measure>Gender-specific differences in vascular function in patients with peripheral artery disease at rest and after a maximal exercise test</measure>
