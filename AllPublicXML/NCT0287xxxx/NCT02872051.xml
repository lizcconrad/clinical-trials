      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of 1) a stepped mental health care
      intervention and 2) an integrated mental health care and vocational rehabilitation
      intervention for people on sick leave because of depression and anxiety in Denmark

      Background:

      Depression and anxiety are important contributors to the global burden of disease and causes
      negative effects on both the individual and society. Depression and anxiety are very likely
      to influence the individual's workability and up to 40 % of the people on sick leave in
      Denmark have common mental disorders like depression and anxiety. There is no clear evidence
      that mental health care alone will provide sufficient support for vocational recovery for
      this target group. Integrated vocational and health care services have shown good effects on
      return to work in other Scandinavian countries.

      Objective:

      The purpose of the Danish IBBIS study is to examine the efficacy of 1) a stepped mental
      health care intervention and 2) an integrated mental health care and vocational
      rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of depression and anxiety in
      Denmark.

      Method:

      This three-arm, randomized, controlled trial is set up to investigate the effectiveness of
      the stepped mental health care model and the integrated mental health care and vocational
      rehabilitation intervention for people on sick leave because of depression and anxiety in
      Denmark. 603 patients are recruited from Danish job centers in four municipalities. The
      primary outcome is return to work at 12 months.

      Results/discussion:

      This study will contribute with new knowledge on vocational recovery and integrated
      vocational and health care interventions in a Scandinavian context.
