      The purpose of this study is to evaluate surgical stress and immune function after robotic
      versus laparoscopic colectomy.

    <textblock>
      The short-term advantages of minimally invasive colon resection have been well established in
      several randomized trials. A major factor in the development of morbidity is the surgical
      stress response with subsequent increased demand on the patient's reserves and immune
      competence. Although the advantage in term of stress response of laparoscopic surgery over
      open surgery has been widely reported, little is known about the role of robotic surgery.

      Robotic approaches have seen significant growth in the last 5 years. Taking advantage of
      three-dimensional visualization, improved articulation, and multiple operating arms provides
      theoretical advantages in colorectal cancer surgery. In an attempt to evaluate the surgical
      stress response and immune function after robotic colorectal surgery a comparative study has
      been designed. Two surgical procedures were evaluated: Robotic colorectal resection
      (Experimental group) and Laparoscopic colorectal resection (Control group).
