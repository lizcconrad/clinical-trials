  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the secretion of gut hormones, in particular glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),
      after ingestion of glucose and fructose as separate monosaccharides or combined in the
      disaccharides sucrose and isomaltulose and the effect of acarbose in gastric bypass operated
      subjects and BMI-matched controls.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disaccharides such as sucrose or isomaltulose (also called palatinose) require digestion into
      monosaccharides (both are digested to glucose and fructose) by enzymes located in the brush
      border of the small intestine to be absorbed. The study will investigate the influence of
      carbohydrate digestion on gut hormone secretion.
