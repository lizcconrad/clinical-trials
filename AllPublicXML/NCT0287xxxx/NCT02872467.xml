  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effects of nasal oxytocin administration on
      maternal behaviors that may be influenced by cocaine use during pregnancy. 32 mothers with
      prenatal use of cocaine during the current pregnancy will be studied at 3-6 months
      postpartum, when they will complete 3 study visits, a 2-week double-blind trial of twice
      daily nasal spray (oxytocin or placebo) and 4 telephone interviews. All information collected
      is confidential.

      Participation for mothers when they are 3-6 months postpartum includes:

        -  Visit 1: Questionnaires and interviews about participants' health, pregnancy, moods,
           psychological history and drug use during pregnancy and postpartum.

        -  Visit 2: Pregnancy &amp; drug tests (results are confidential), blood samples and vital
           signs, video-taped mother-infant interaction, speech task, instruction re: using nasal
           spray (oxytocin or placebo) &amp; self-administration of first nasal spray dose, followed by
           90 minutes of monitoring.

        -  At-home nasal spray: Twice daily (before breakfast and supper) nasal spray
           self-administration for 14 days.

        -  Visit 3: Pregnancy &amp; drug tests (results are confidential), blood samples and vital
           signs, video-taped mother-infant interaction, speech task, interviews and questionnaires
           about mothers' experience with the nasal spray, and changes in mood or physical
           discomfort during the 2-weeks when taking the nasal spray.

        -  3 telephone interviews while subjects are taking nasal spray, and 1 post-trail telephone
           follow-up.
