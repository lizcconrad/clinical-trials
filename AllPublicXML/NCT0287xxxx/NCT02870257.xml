  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy subjects with shoulder impingement syndrome associated with scapular dyskinesis will
      be recruited and randomized into two groups of treatment. The group &quot;a&quot; will receive a
      strenghtening protocol with progressive overload during 20 sessions and group &quot;b&quot; will
      receive the same protocol with minimal load, without change during the 20 sessions. The
      primary outcomes measures will be pain, function, quality of life, global impression of
      recovery. The change will be measure from baseline at 10 weeks (after 20 sessions), 3 and 6
      months (follow-up). The secundary outcomes will be disability, quality of life measure by
      other instruments, shoulder muscle strength and scapular 3d kinematic variables. For these
      data, change will be measure from baseline at 10 weeks (after 20 sessions).
