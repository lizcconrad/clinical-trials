    <time_frame>1 and 3 months after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>It was surveyed using a self-designed questionnaire based on evidence. The questionnaire includes 6 items that address taking medicine on time, quality low-protein diet intake, going to sleep at a regular time, moderate exercise, emotion regulation, regular follow-up. Item responses are on a 4-point scale (0 = never to 3 = always). Data were collected by face-to-face interviews with trained transition nurses. Change is being assessed</description>
