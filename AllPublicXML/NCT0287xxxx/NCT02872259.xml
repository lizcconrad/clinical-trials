    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of BGB324 given together with
      standard treatment, pembrolizumab or dabrafenib and trametinib, compared to standard
      treatment alone,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated randomized randomized clinical phase 1b/2 clinical trial
      comparing safety and efficacy of the Axl inhibitor BGB324 in combination with pembrolizumab
      or dabrafenib+trametinib with that of pembrolizumab or dabrafenib+trametinib alone. Patients
      with non-resectable stage III or stage IV melanoma will be stratified based on BRAF mutation
      and tumor load to start dabrafenib+trametinib (BRAF mutation and high tumor load) or
      pembrolizumab (BRAF wild type or BRAF mutation and low tumor load) in first line. The
      patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive BGB324 in combination with pembrolizumab or
      dabrafenib+trametinib or to receive pembrolizumab or dabrafenib+trametinib alone. A 3+3 dose
      escalation will be performed for the combination of BGB324 and dabrafenib+trametinib. There
      is a major focus on predictive markers of treatment response evaluated in blood samples and
      biopsies.
