  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose escalation trial to evaluate the safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy
      (SBRT) delivered in 3 fractions for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC)
      who have received induction chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study, with an expansion cohort, of up to 34 patients to identify the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a 3-fraction regimen of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
      for locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients who have not developed distant progression
      following induction chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) as per
      standard of care. After completion of induction chemotherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy
      SBRT will be administered in 3 fractions, every other day, on an outpatient basis. Dose
      escalation will start with dose level 1 (9 Gy x 3 fractions) and increase by 1 Gy per
      fraction at each dose level, dose level 2 will be 10 Gy x 3 fractions and dose level 3 will
      be 11 Gy x 3 fractions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) patients who have not developed distant progression after induction chemotherapies per standard of care</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will be accomplished by the standard 3+3 dose escalation design. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are defined by ≥ Grade 3 treatment-related GI toxicity within 3 months of SBRT. These include: (1) Bowel (includes bowel perforation, obstruction, or hemorrhage) and (2) Stomach (bleeding ulcer, perforation) as determined by imaging or endoscopic evaluation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients with local control after induction chemotherapy and SBRT.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Local control (LC) will be measured from completion of SBRT to the time of identification of any local progression by imaging or surgical exploration. The pattern of patients experiencing local, distant or local with distant failure will be estimated using competing risks method.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the normal small intestine after SBRT for LAPC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after SBRT</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure changes in the perfusion/permeability related parameters of peripancreatic small intestine before, during and after SBRT for patients using pCT and correlating these changes with the development of gastrointestinal toxicity such as duodenal ulcers, strictures, or enteritis. Patients will undergo baseline, post-first-fraction SBRT and post-treatment CT scans.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in vascular and cellular diffusion and perfusion/permeability resulting from SBRT for all patients enrolled in the study</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks after SBRT</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure changes in diffusion and perfusion/permeability by using perfusion CT derived parameters that can predict treatment response and to assess any correlation between these perfusion CT derived parameters and local control and progression-free survival</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL) of all patients</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after SBRT</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of the QOL study is to document the patient's experience of treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer by examining global QOL, physical symptoms, physical functioning and emotional well-being at baseline, during treatment, and after treatment. QOL measures including EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the Pancreatic Cancer subscale (EORTC-PAN26) will be assessed 14 days prior to SBRT (Time 0), 10-12 weeks after SBRT (Time 1), and 6 months after SBRT (Time 2). The primary QOL endpoints include the EORTC global QOL, physical symptoms, physical functioning and emotional well-being.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of patients with progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival (PFS) will be measured from completion of SBRT to the time of tumor progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival of all patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival (OS) will be measured from completion of SBRT until death due to any cause. OS will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier.</description>
