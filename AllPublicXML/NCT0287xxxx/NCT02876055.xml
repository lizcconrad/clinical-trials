  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is considered to be a major surgical procedure resulting in
      severe postoperative pain, especially in the first 48 hours after surgery. The use of
      interscalene brachial plexus nerve block remains the cornerstone for analgesia following
      shoulder surgery; however, with the advent of local infiltration analgesia (LIA), there has
      been increasing interest in its use for total joint arthroplasty.

      Since the benefits of local infiltration analgesia within a comprehensive multi-modal
      analgesia clinical pathway have yet to be established for total shoulder arthroplasty, the
      Investigators plan to assess and compare analgesia outcomes between three intervention
      groups: single shot interscalene brachial plexus block (SISB), continuous interscalene
      brachial plexus block (CISB), and local infiltration analgesia (LIA).

    <description>The primary aim is to investigate the hypothesis that within our current total joint regional anesthesia pathway, utilizing multimodal analgesia and regional anesthesia techniques, continuous interscalene nerve block provides superior analgesic benefit via the Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS) compared to single injection interscalene blockade and local infiltration analgesia on POD 1 for primary total shoulder arthroplasty.</description>

    <description>An interscalene nerve block and delivery of a catheter will be performed under continuous live ultrasound guidance, obtaining visualization of the roots or trunks of the brachial plexus in between the anterior and middle scalene muscles.
Initial loading bolus includes 15 to 20 mL of Bupivacaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 Epinephrine. After surgery, the continuous interscalene nerve block catheter will be loaded in the PACU with bupivacaine 0.2% 10 milliliters (mL), and then an infusion will be initiated of bupivacaine 0.2% at 8 to 10 mL per hour.</description>

    <description>The LIA group will utilize weight based dosing of Ropivacaine as part of a &quot;cocktail&quot; solution containing ropivacaine, epinephrine, ketorolac, and normal saline 0.9%. Patients will receive a total volume of 120 mL injected strategically in the periarticular structures by the surgeon. This is a one-time injection. This will occur after implantation of the final prostheses, but prior to closure of the fascia.</description>
