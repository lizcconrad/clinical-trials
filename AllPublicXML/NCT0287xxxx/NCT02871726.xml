  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The commonly used diagnostic procedure for prostate cancer, a transrectal ultrasound
      (TRUS)-guided biopsy, has significant limitations. Freehand biopsy cores are often spatially
      clustered, rather than uniformly distributed, and do not accurately follow the recommended,
      sextant template. In addition, a freehand TRUS-guided biopsy does not allow precise mapping
      of the biopsy cores within the prostate. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to re-biopsy or
      target the exact cancer foci. As a result, most TRUS-guided prostate biopsies today are
      poorly targeted and their spatial mapping remains subjective.

      This proposed feasibility and safety study of 5 patients attempts to improve TRUS-guided
      prostate biopsy by utilizing a novel robotic TRUS manipulator (TRUS Robot). A successful TRUS
      Robot guidance will provide crucial spatial information of the biopsy cores for improved
      prostate cancer detection, treatment, and monitoring. This proposed study is a proof of
      concept for a future protocol.

    <description>The PI will contact each participant approximately one week after their biopsy to ask if they have experienced any adverse events due to the study device. If all 5 participants complete the procedure and fail to report any adverse events, the device will be considered safe for use during biopsy.</description>

    <description>The amount of time to complete the study-related portion of the biopsy will be noted. If the study-study portion of the biopsy is able to be completed in less than 30 minutes for each of the 5 participants, then the device will be considered feasible for use during biopsy.</description>
