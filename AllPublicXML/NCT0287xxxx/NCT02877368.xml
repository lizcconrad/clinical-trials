  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) has shifted since the
      arrival of targeted therapies. Imatinib is an active multikinase inhibitor that mainly
      targets C-kit tyrosine-kinase receptors and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor.
      Imatinib use has been validated for adjuvant and palliative therapy settings. Imatinib is
      generally well-tolerated and known to improve performance status but up to 16% grades 3-4
      toxicities, leading to at least 40% withdrawals, have been reported.

      Recently, in oncology, sarcopenia was shown to be a predictor of severe toxicity patients
      included in phase 1 trials, suggesting that it should be considered an inclusion criterion
      for such studies. Sarcopenic patients had low performance status, shorter survival, more
      chemotherapy toxicities and post-operative infections, and longer post-operative
      hospitalization times. In addition, exposure to tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib or
      sunitinib) has been associated with dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in patients with renal cell
      or hepatocellular carcinomas.

      Computed tomography (CT) scans acquired during routine care have been validated as an
      accurate and robust imaging technique to evaluate sarcopenia in cancer patients.

      Aims of the study were:

        -  to assess the influence of imatinib on sarcopenia patients with advanced or high-risk
           resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)

        -  to compare imatinib-induced toxicities between patients with advanced or high-risk
           resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) with pre-treatment sarcopenia and
           patients with advanced or high-risk resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST)
           without pre-treatment sarcopenia
