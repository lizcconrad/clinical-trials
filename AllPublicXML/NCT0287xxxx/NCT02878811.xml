  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will consecutively recruit 5000 patients hospitalized for heart failure
      (HF) from 50 hospitals across China and follow them up for one year, describe treatment
      patterns during hospitalization and the follow-ups, examine patients recovery trajectory
      after HF, and identify targets for care quality improvement.

      This study will consecutively enroll patients with HF as the primary reason for
      hospitalization in 50 hospitals scattered all over China. Participants will be interviewed at
      baseline (i.e., during the index hospitalization for HF), and at 1, 6, and 12 months
      following hospital discharge. During the follow‐up period, participants will be instructed to
      return to the hospital for interviews by site investigators. Telephone follow-ups will be
      conducted only when in‐person interviews are not feasible.

      At baseline, participants will be interviewed to collect detailed information about on
      demographics, socioeconomic status, cardiovascular risk factors, clinical characteristics,
      treatments, in-hospital outcomes, general and disease-specific quality of life, function and
      mental status; during the follow-ups, the investigators will collect information about
      clinical outcomes events, long-term treatments, function, quality of life, symptoms, and
      medical care during the recovery period.

      The investigators will collect blood and urine samples during index hospitalization and the
      follow-ups.

      This study will examine a series of factors that may affect patients' recovery after HF.
      Practical guidelines, quality evaluative system, and risk model will be established based on
      the findings, to improve patient outcomes in the future.
