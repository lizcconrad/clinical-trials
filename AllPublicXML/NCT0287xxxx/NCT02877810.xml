  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of an existing tele-emergency care
      network on quality of care, appropriateness of care utilization, patient safety (medication
      errors), and cost effectiveness compared to telephone consultations from a healthcare system
      prospective.

      The investigators will use a novel cluster randomized unbalanced crossover trial design. When
      a new site is enrolled, the first approximately 6 months of the project will be a &quot;ramp-up&quot;
      period during which the protocol will be re-reviewed during a site visit to the participating
      EDs and random block assignments will be generated and delivered. The last 6 months will be
      reserved for data analysis, study closeout, and manuscript preparation. An intervening 2-year
      period will be divided into 4 six-month calendar time periods for carrying out the protocol
      and data collection. For each 6-month period, each ED will have a randomized treatment
      assignment for pediatric emergency and critical care consultations (&quot;M&quot; for telemedicine and
      &quot;P&quot; for telephone.) Participating EDs (the unit of randomization) will be stratified into two
      strata by size of ED and geographical location. EDs will then be randomized within-strata to
      one of the four unbalanced (3:1) crossover treatment assignment sequences, each consisting of
      a 6-month period: PMMM, MPMM, MMPM, or MMMP. During these assigned periods, the type of
      consultation being assigned will be strongly encouraged, but deviating from protocol (i.e.,
      using telephone consultation when randomized to telemedicine, or the vice-versa) will be
      allowed as needed by the physicians. Data will be collected and abstracted through
      retrospective chart review.

    <measure>Quality of Care Implicit Review Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that children receiving care in EDs during periods of telemedicine use will receive higher quality of care than similar children who receive care during periods of telephone use. A previously validated 5-item implicit review instrument that measures 4 aspects of process of care in the ED, along with a fifth item assessing the overall quality of care provided to the patient will be used. The sum of the 5 item-specific scores will be aggregated from each reviewer to obtain a summary quality score for each medical record.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Risk of Admission (PRISA II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that children receiving care in EDs during randomized periods of telemedicine use will be admitted more appropriately than similar children who receive care during periods randomized to telephone use. To compare the cohort of seriously ill children treated during the telephone and telemedicine time blocks, observed to expected (O/E) ratios will be calculated using an intention-to-treat framework.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Emergency Assessment Tool (Re-PEAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that children receiving care in EDs during randomized periods of telemedicine use will be transferred more appropriately than similar children who receive care during periods randomized to telephone use. The investigators will compare O/E ratios.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication Error Rate Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesize that children receiving care in EDs during periods of telemedicine use will experience fewer physician-related medication errors than similar children who receive care during periods of telephone use. A previously published instrument developed specifically to evaluate medication errors among children receiving care in the ED will be used.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Economic Efficiency Cost-Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 3</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators hypothesized that care provided to children in EDs during randomized periods of telemedicine use will be economically more efficient than care provided during randomized periods of telephone. Cost analysis will estimate return-on-investment indicating the cost saving amount per $1 investment in telemedicine compared to care without telemedicine.</description>
