  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 20 hypercapnic COPD patients will perform two constant workrate endurance
      cycle tests. One test will be while using non-invasive Ventilation (NIV) support, one without
      in a randomized cross-over design. The aim is to measure, whether NIV is able to change
      peripheral and respiratory muscle oxygenation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients will perform one incremental work rate test to obtain peak work rate.
      On the following days two constant work rate cycle endurance tests (CWRT) will be performed
      at 60% of Peak work rate using a randomised cross-over design. Between the two CWRTs there
      will be one hour of recovery time in between.

      One of the CWRTs will be performed with the support of non-invasive Ventilation (NIV), the
      other one without. Respiratory and cardiovascular parameters will be observed through
      transcutaneous measurement of CO2 (Sentec device) and near-infrared spectroscopy devices.

      The purpose of this study is, to examine whether the use of NIV not only decreases patients
      dyspnoea, but also has positive effects on the patients cardiovascular System, exercise
      capacity and muscle oxygenation. The investigators will examine the tissue oxygen saturation
      in the 7th intercostal space (reflecting a respiratory muscle) and on the M. vastus lateralis
      of the leg during both CWRTs. With the Support of NIV, it is expected to see a change in the
      oxygenation towards a better perfusion of the leg muscle, due to a facilitation of the work
      of breathing. This may result in a later onset of leg fatigue and an increased exercise
      capacity of the patients. To have an equivalent workload all parameters will be compared
      during isotime.

      To conclude, aim of this study is to record the interplay of Oxygenation and Perfusion
      between the Intercostal muscles and the peripheral leg muscle during exercise. The
      investigators hypothesize, that the use of NIV may change the oxygenation in favour of the
      leg muscle through relieving the respiratory muscles.
