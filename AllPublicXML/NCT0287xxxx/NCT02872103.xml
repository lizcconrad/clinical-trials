  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, single dose, double-blind, placebo controlled phase III
      study of the efficacy and safety of once-per-cycle of F-627 in women with stage II-IV breast
      cancer who are receiving myelotoxic TA chemotherapy treatment (Taxotere (docetaxel) +
      Adriamycin(doxorubicin)). F-627 is designed to treat neutropenia, an abnormally low number of
      neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. Neutropenia is often seen in cancer
      patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of single fixed
      dose of F-627 in breast cancer patients experiencing myelotoxic chemotherapy in comparison to
      placebo. F-627 or placebo is to be administered subcutaneously 24 hours after chemotherapy in
      each 21-day cycle of chemotherapy treatment (up to 4 cycles). Patients randomized to placebo
      arm will receive F-627 except in cycle 1. The primary endpoint will be the duration of grade
      4 (severe) neutropenia - the number of days in which the patient has had an absolute
      neutrophil count (ANC &lt; 0.5 x 10^9/L) observed in chemotherapy cycle 1.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized to F-627 or Placebo at 2:1 ratio. About 24 hours after chemotherapy, subjects will either receive 20mg fixed dose F-627 or Placebo. The subject's absolute neutrophil count (ANC) will be monitored each day post chemotherapy administration until the ANC level exceeds 2.0x10^9/L, then the value will be monitored every three days until the next chemotherapy cycle is entered. The duration of grade 4 neutropenia (ANC &lt;0.5x10^9/L) in this cycle is the primary efficacy endpoint.</description>
