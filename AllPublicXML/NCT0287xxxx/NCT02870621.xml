      The perirenal fat may alter renal function by secreting fibrotic inflammatory agents when
      accumulates during obesity. Nephrectomy for renal tumor is a model that would provide tissue
      samples to test this hypothesis. Renal tumor could itself be responsible for inflammation and
      fibrosis in its environment. This study aims to measure the influence of the tumor on his
      kidney Environment and fat and define molecular markers not influenced by renal tumor. The
      main objective is to compare the inflammation of the perirenal fat taken in two locations in
      the same patient, in contact and 4 cm from the outer edge of the tumor, each patient as his
      own control. The secondary objective is to compare the degree of interstitial fibrosis of the
      renal cortex in the same sampling methods.
