  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to see whether participation in the Edmond J. Safra Interdisciplinary Home
      Visit Program for Advanced Parkinson's (HVP) increases the rate of age-appropriate
      vaccinations in people with advanced Parkinson's Disease (PD) and related disorders. This
      study will evaluate the impact of the HVP on the rate of common illnesses such as flu and
      pneumonia in patients with advanced PD and related disorders over the course of one year.

      As there is currently no data available on the baseline rate of vaccinations in either
      homebound or less disabled PD populations, investigators will seek to establish the baseline
      rate of vaccinations, barriers to getting vaccinated, and baseline healthcare utilization in
      these populations by piloting (Phase 1) and then implementing (Phase 2) a survey via
      telephone interviews. Investigators will then test feasibility of offering influenza and
      pneumococcal vaccinations, as appropriate, to the homebound individuals in our HVP cohort
      (Phase 3), and will compare their pre- and post-intervention rates of both outpatient and
      acute healthcare utilization and self-reported illness.
