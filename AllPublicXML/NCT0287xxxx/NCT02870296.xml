  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study goal is to improve the quality of care transitions for patients with new
      episodes of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

      Primary Outcomes: To measure differences in the quality of care transition, as measured by
      the Care Transition Measure (CTM)-15 in the investigators target population of patients with
      incident VTE randomized to either a multicomponent, anticoagulation medical home intervention
      or usual care.

      Secondary Major Outcomes: To measure the difference in recurrent VTE, major hemorrhage,
      all-cause re-admissions, and mortality between the investigators intervention and comparison
      groups at 30 and 90 days in the investigators target population.

      Secondary Other Outcomes: To measure patient knowledge, health-related quality of life, and
      time in the therapeutic range (TTR) for patients on warfarin in the investigators target
      population.
