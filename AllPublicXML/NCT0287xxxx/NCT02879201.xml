  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a comparison trial between SLED and CRRT in critically ill
      patients to evaluate the outcome for all cause mortality at 30 day . The secondary outcome
      were recovery of renal function, complications during therapy and duration of
      hospitalization.

      The investigators performed a single center experience accumulated over 12 months since
      February 2009 with a continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) and hybrid technique
      named sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED). The primary end point was death from any
      cause by day 30. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients were eligible for inclusion when serum
      creatinine was &gt; 2 mg/dL, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) was initiated. The selected
      patients were treated with CVVHDF or SLED.

    <description>SLED is a kind of hemodialysis technique performed using Fresenius 4008B dialysis machine with FDX 120 GW (NIKKISO Japan) dialyzer. SLED sessions were 6-8 hour duration, three times per week (except Sunday), In case of severe volume overload, the session could be increased to meet clinical situation. Blood flow was maintained between 150-200 mL/hr and the dialysate flow of 300 mL/hr. Both the groups use unfractionated heparin as anticoagulant to prevent clotting of the extracorporeal circuit .the target partial thromboplastin time( PTT) was not more than twice the control level.</description>

    <description>CRRT is a kind of therapy involved continuos dialysis throughout 24 hours by using Edward Delivery system (Edward Life Science) as continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) mode using Aquamax HF 12 dialyzer. Blood flow rate was kept from 100-200 mL/hr and target effluent rates of 20 mL/hr . The substitution fluid was infused at a rate of 1,000 ml/hr with ultrafiltration rate at 100-300 mL/hr.Intervention here is the different mode of dialysis</description>
