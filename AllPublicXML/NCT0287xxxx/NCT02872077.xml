      This study will assess the efficacy of needle auricular acupuncture (AA) in neonatal
      abstinence syndrome (NAS) infants who require pharmacologic therapy at the Tampa General
      Hospital NICU. The investigators will evaluate efficacy of needle AA as an adjunct treatment
      for NAS by means of total methadone dose exposure, peak withdrawal scores, and overall length
      of stay.

      This is the first study to evaluate efficacy of needle AA as an adjunct treatment for NAS by
      means of total methadone dose exposure, peak withdrawal scores, and overall length of stay.

    <textblock>
      Enrolled infants will be randomized to a control group and an acupuncture group.

      The control group will receive nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management as per our
      current standard of care.

      The acupuncture group will additionally receive AA. Once the infant is enrolled, he/she will
      be randomized to the AA group or the control group. Both groups of randomized infants will be
      taken daily to a designated treatment room. Infants in the control group will not receive
      acupuncture, and will only receive observation in the treatment room and will have review of
      their EMR.

      If in the AA group, the investigator will evaluate the infant using an ear point locator to
      determine active sites prior to each needle placement. Acupuncture infants will have needles
      placed in any active sites found in one ear (up to 5 needles). Acupuncture sites will be
      alternated daily between right and left ear.

      Acupuncture will be discontinued on the same day as methadone is discontinued, or if infant
      is cleared to be discharged home on methadone, acupuncture is discontinued when infant
      reaches the discharge dose of methadone.

      Data for both groups will be collected on the day of enrollment, every three days during
      study participation, and at hospital discharge.
