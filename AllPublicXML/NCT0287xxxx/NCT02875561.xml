  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the incidence of vulva dysplasia
      recurrence within 12 months of treatment with Carbon Dioxide (CO2) laser ablation or
      ultrasonic aspiration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN) is increasing among women and there still
      lacks a standard of care for optimal treatment. Current treatment options aim to treat the
      symptoms associated with VIN and result in a high recurrence rate. Due to the high
      reoccurrence rate and the nature of the current treatments, a more effective treatment option
      is warranted. An effective treatment that targets only the diseased areas could potentially
      decrease recurrence rates. Additionally, a more conservative treatment modality could
      contribute to reduced risks of scarring, discomfort, and psychosocial and sexual distraught.
      The researchers hypothesize that treatment for VIN with ultrasonic aspiration will have a 60%
      reduction in recurrence rates over 12 months as compared to CO2 laser aspiration.

      This study will employ a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. This is a phase III study
      to determine the effectiveness of a more targeted treatment therapy for VIN (comparing
      ultrasonic aspiration versus CO2 laser ablation). Potential participants will be identified
      through the gynecological clinical practices following diagnosis of high grade VIN and will
      be randomized (1:1) to one of the treatment therapies. Randomization will be stratified for
      multi-focal disease and Human Papillomavirus (HPV) status. Both the Sonopet Ultrasonic
      Aspirator and the CO2 laser ablation devices are FDA approved devices for the treatment of
      vulvar dysplasia.
