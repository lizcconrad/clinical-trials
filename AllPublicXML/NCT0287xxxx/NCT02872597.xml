    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I study to investigate the addition of inhaled Ipratropium bromide to
      standard therapy in the treatment of severe asthma attacks in children admitted to the
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Half of the subjects will receive inhaled Ipratropium, and
      half will receive an inhaled placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Status asthmaticus is an acute exacerbation of asthma that often requires treatment in a
      pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Standard therapies for status asthmaticus include
      corticosteroids and bronchodilators, typically albuterol. Ipratropium bromide is also a
      bronchodilator, but has a different mechanism of action than albuterol. The addition of
      Ipraropium to children in the Emergency Room with severe asthma exacerbations improves
      outcomes, so many PICU doctors treat patients with status asthmaticus with Ipratropium.
      However, two studies of children hospitalized in the general wards of the hospital (not the
      PICU) show that the addition of Ipratropium to standard care does not effect clinical
      outcomes. This study is a first step towards determining in Ipratropium is helpful in PICU
      patients (like it is in ER patients) or if it not helpful (like it is in general ward
      patients).

    <description>In our PICU, status asthmaticus patients are initially treated with continuous nebulization of albuterol. Per a standard assessment/scoring system, the patients are re-assessed each hour. When the patient's symptoms have sufficiently improved, the albuterol is weaned to 2.5mg given every 1hr (&quot;q1hr albuterol&quot;) and, subsequently, to 2.5mg given every 2 hours (&quot;q2hr Albuterol&quot;). This outcome will measure the interval between the initiation of continuous albuterol and the second dose of q2hr Albuterol.</description>
