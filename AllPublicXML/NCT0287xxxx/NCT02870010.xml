  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoembolization is a recognized treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)

        -  classical chemoembolization consists in injecting an emulsion of an anticancer agent in
           Lipiodol® via the hepatic artery

        -  doxorubicin, an anthracycline, is the most frequently used drug in lipiodol
           chemoembolization (LCE)

        -  however, less than half of HCC respond favourably to classical lipiodol
           chemoembolization (LCE) with doxorubicin/Lipiodol®

      In this trial, we propose to introduce in clinical practice a strategy based on idarubicin to
      achieve a more effective antitumor effect for the following reasons, recently pointed out by
      our team:

        -  idarubicin is an anthracycline that penetrates tumour cells more quickly and is more
           cytotoxic than doxorubicin on hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines

        -  idarubicin is injected in a solution of embolization microspheres of a diameter of
           (300-500µm), which all the progressive and controlled release of the anticancer drug,
           whereas the doxorubicin/Lipiodol® emulsion is unstable
