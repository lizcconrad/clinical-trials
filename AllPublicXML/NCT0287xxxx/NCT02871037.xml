  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is the first clinical trial proposed with PF-05221304. It is designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) following administration of
      single and repeated doses of PF-05221304 to healthy adult subjects. The study may also
      evaluate effect of food on PK of PF-05221304.

    <time_frame>Screening up to 28 days after last dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment by adverse event monitoring, 12 lead ECGs, telemetry, vital signs and clinical safety laboratory measurements.
Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a subject who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Subjects with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>
