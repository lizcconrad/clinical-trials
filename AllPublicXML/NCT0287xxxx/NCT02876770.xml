    <textblock>
      The present study aimed to evaluate the possible effect of nocturnal melatonin ingestion upon
      short-term performances, on the following morning. Twelve soccer players from a Tunisian
      squad (22.9 ±1.3 years, 1.80±0.05 m, and 72.0±8.8 kg) were volunteered to perform three
      testing sessions, with one test session per day. During each session, MEL (5mg) , MEL (8mg)
      or placebo were ingested, in a randomized order, before nocturnal sleep. The next morning
      (08:00h), participants performed the following psycho-cognitive and physical tests: Hooper's
      index, reaction time, vigilance, handgrip strength , squat jump , modified agility test ,
      Wingate anaerobic test (peak power , mean power and fatigue index ). Rating of perceived
      exertion was recorded immediately after the WanT, and blood lactate measures were taken after
      3min of recovery. Blood glucose was measured before and 3 min after the Wingate test.

    <description>Our protocol was composed of three experimental sessions. During each testing session, participants were requested to attend the laboratory at 20:00h where they ingested a standardized light meal. Melatonin (5 mg or 8 mg) or placebo were ingested in capsule in the evening at 21:00h in a double-blind randomized design</description>
