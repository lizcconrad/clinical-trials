      The primary specific aim is to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare rates
      of delayed hemorrhage after DEP detection of arterial blood flow and focal treatment in
      PPIU's (treatment arm) with standard treatment using medical guidelines alone (controls) for
      prevention of delayed bleeding in high risk patients (on anti-coagulants or anti-platelet
      drugs or with large ulcers) after snare resection of benign colon polyps.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe delayed post-polypectomy induced ulcer (PPIU) bleeding has become a much more common
      problem with the increased numbers of colonoscopies being performed and with more patients
      taking anti-coagulants or anti-platelet drugs. Current medical guidelines may reduce bleeding
      during polypectomy, but are not effective for prevention of delayed bleeding. Empiric closure
      of PPIU's with clips is not effective because ulcers &gt; 15 mm cannot be closed, does not treat
      the underlying artery in the ulcer base, and when the clips often fall off within 7 the
      underlying artery is exposed. As preliminary results, the investigators studied delayed PPIU
      bleeds and their prevention, used a Doppler endoscopic probe (DEP) to localize arteries in
      PPIU's, reported the prevalence which rises significantly as ulcer size increases, and
      successfully obliterated blood flow with focal treatment. These studies form the basis for
      this new RCT. The primary specific aim is to perform a RCT to compare rates of delayed
      hemorrhage after DEP detection of arterial blood flow and focal treatment in PPIU's
      (treatment arm) with standard treatment using medical guidelines alone (controls) for
      prevention of delayed bleeding in high risk patients (on anti-coagulants or anti-platelet
      drugs or with large ulcers) after snare resection of benign colon polyps. Secondary specific
      aims are to evaluate the natural history and risk factors for delayed PPIU bleeding using
      univariate and multivariable analyses. This is a RCT performed by the CURE Hemostasis
      Research Group for high risk patients - those with PPIU's 15 mm in size or greater but not on
      drugs associated with bleeding; or patients who require anti-coagulants or anti-platelet
      drugs for treatment of co-morbid conditions and have PPIU's 10 mm or larger. Outpatients,
      scheduled for screening or surveillance colonoscopies, who give written informed consent and
      meet entry criteria will be randomized to control/no DEP (medical treatment without PPIU
      closure) or DEP (as a guide to arterial blood flow detection and focal obliteration of it
      with hemoclips and/or low power multipolar electrocautery [MPEC] probe). Patients will be
      prospectively followed at 7, 14, and 30 days for bleeding, complications, or unscheduled
      visits for healthcare after polypectomies.

    <description>We will compare the proportion of participants with PPIU bleeding by 30 days follow up in Doppler endoscopic probe (DEP) versus standard treatment. The p value for testing this hypothesis will be computed using Fisher's exact test. The corresponding 95% confidence bounds for the true difference will also be reported.</description>

    <description>We will compare the proportion of participants hospitalized for PPIU bleeds or other complications at 30 days, the number of participants in DEP group and standard group overall. Fisher's exact test will be used to compare the proportion hospitalized for PPIU bleeding by 30 days in DEP versus standard.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The total number of hospitalized days.</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcome measure will be assessed at 30 days after participants are enrolled.</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine if number of hospitalized days follows a count distribution such as the Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution or if the log total hospital days follows a normal or other parametric distribution. We will therefore use the appropriate count model, t test or non parametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum) to compare the number of days hospitalized distribution in DEP versus standard as well as report the corresponding descriptive statistics (n, range, quartiles, median, mean, SD, frequencies) and histogram.</description>

    <description>For Standard treatment group, the Doppler probe will not be used, nor will hemoclip closure of post-polypectomy ulcers be attempted. Standard published guidelines will be followed for management of blood thinners (anti-coagulants) and/or aspirin like drugs (anti-platelet drugs) before and after the colonoscopic polypectomies. This is the standard of care at the investigators' medical centers and part of written instructions that are given to the participants and their referring physicians during the scheduling process and prior to their preparation for screening or surveillance outpatient colonoscopies.</description>

    <description>A colon length catheter (probe) will be used to check the non-bleeding post-polypectomy ulcer with shallow and medium depth Doppler probe settings (&lt; 4 mm deep) for arterial blood flow. If arterial flow is found, treatment through the colonoscope (either hemoclipping or multipolar electrocoagulation probe) will be used to stop the arterial flow. This will be confirmed by rechecking with Doppler probe after endoscopic treatment. Tatoos (Spot method) will be placed on two sides of the ulcer so treated.</description>
