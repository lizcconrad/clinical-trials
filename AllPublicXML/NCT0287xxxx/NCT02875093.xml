        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. AML diagnosed by morphologic (with &gt;20% blasts in blood or bone marrow) and
             histochemical and/or cell surface marker criteria.

          2. Patients with AML must fall into one of the following:

               1. Patients with AML (i.e., &gt; 20% bone marrow blasts) who are deemed unfit* for
                  intensive chemotherapy with refractory or relapsed disease. The patients must
                  have been refractory to at least one cycle of cytarabine containing regimens or
                  at least two cycles of azacitidine or similar hypomethylating agents.

               2. Patients with untreated AML (i.e., &gt; 20% bone marrow blasts) with intermediate
                  risk karyotype (MRC risk group) who are deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy.

               3. Patients with untreated AML with adverse risk karyotype (MRC risk group) who are
                  deemed unfit for intensive chemotherapy and who are intolerant of azacitidine (or
                  other hypomethylating agents) or who are unable to access azacitidine or other
                  hypomethylating agents.

                    -  Patients unfit for conventional intensive chemotherapy are defined as having
                       at least one of the following based on the conceptual criteria of Ferrara
                       (2013):

                         1. Advanced age (over 75 years).

                         2. Cardiac impairment with ejection fraction ≤ 50% or heart failure (NYHA
                            class 2) or ischemic heart disease with stable angina.

                         3. Pulmonary impairment: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
                            stage 1-2 (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] &gt; 49%) or
                            other comparable respiratory disease with forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt;
                            50%.

                         4. Hepatic comorbidity with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis

                         5. Chronic kidney disease stage 3 but with creatinine clearance &gt; 30
                            mls/min

                         6. Any other comorbidity that the physician judges to be incompatible with
                            intensive chemotherapy.

          3. Age &gt; 17 years.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          5. Bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy for testing for ASS1-deficiency. This must be a
             fresh sample obtained after any prior chemotherapy and before enrollment in this
             study. ASS1-deficiency is not required for study entry, but the fresh bone marrow
             sample must be processed either before or within 1 week of first study dose (see
             Section 10 for more details).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for study participation if he/she meets any of the exclusion
        criteria:

          1. Patients with uncontrolled infections requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic/antiviral
             therapy are not eligible for entry onto the study; patients on prophylactic
             antibiotics or antivirals are acceptable.

          2. Pregnancy or lactation.

          3. Expected non-compliance.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III
             or IV), unstable angina, ventricular cardiac arrhythmia (other than ventricular
             ectopy), severe pulmonary comorbidity: COPD grade 3-4 (FEV1 &lt;50%) or other comparable
             documented pulmonary disease with FVC &lt;50%, or dyspnea at rest or requiring oxygen at
             home, cognitive impairment: current mental illness requiring psychiatric
             hospitalization, institutionalization or intensive outpatient management, or
             uncontrolled current cognitive status (as confirmed by the specialist; dependence on a
             caregiver is permitted as long as this is well controlled), severe hepatic
             comorbidity: liver Child-Pugh grade B-C cirrhosis or acute viral hepatitis, social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements or DIC causing
             coagulopathy not correctable with factor replacement.

          5. Subjects who have had any anti-leukemia treatment prior to entering the study and have
             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or≤ Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible
             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs &gt; Grade 1 that are not considered a
             safety risk by the Sponsor and Investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both.
