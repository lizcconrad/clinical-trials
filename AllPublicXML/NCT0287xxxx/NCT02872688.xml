  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a GanedenBC30, a probiotic bacteria
      (Bacillus coagulans strain GBI-30, 6086), on the gut microbiome in healthy adults. Subjects
      will complete a 2-week run-in period prior to receiving GanedenBC30. The study is open-label
      and subjects will act as their own controls as the microbiome is unique to individuals.
      During the run-in period, subjects will collect two stool samples and complete daily bowel
      habit diaries in order to understand usual habits and profile the microbiome for each
      subject. 30 subjects will take part in this research study conducted at Nutrasource
      Diagnostics Inc. Subjects will take GanedenBC30 for four weeks. Stool samples will be
      collected at the end of the study and daily bowel habit diaries maintained for the duration
      of the study.
