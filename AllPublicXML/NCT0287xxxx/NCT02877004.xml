    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to gather preliminary information on the effectiveness of Low
      Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) in helping people reduce their weight gain in the central body
      region.

      This will be an open label clinical trial with all study participants receiving LLLT.
      Preliminary data will be collected on the efficacy of LLLT based on varying frequency of
      treatments. The focus of this study on 60 overweight adults with a BMI of 25 to 29.9, and
      assess changes in weight and waist circumference at end of treatment for group 1 (week 4) and
      group 2 (week 6) and group 3 (week 12). Participants will be randomized to receive LLLT
      treatments either 3 times a week; 2 times a week; or once a week.
