      This is a multi-center, open-label study to evaluate the long-term safety of weekly IV
      infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP in adult subjects with AATD in Japan who have completed
      Study GTI1401. Study GTI1401 is being conducted to evaluate the safety and PK of Alpha-1 MP
      in subjects with AATD in Japan. In the current study, GTI1401-OLE, subjects will be
      administered 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP by weekly IV infusion for approximately 1 year (can be
      renewed annually with the consent of the subjects unless the sponsor informs of
      discontinuation of this OLE trial) to assess the long-term safety of Alpha-1 MP in subjects
      with AATD. This study will be conducted at up to 5 centers in Japan.

      At the Week 9 Visit of Study GTI1401, after giving consent, on the same day, subjects will be
      assessed for eligibility at Screening/Extention (Ext) Week 1 Visit for this extension study,
      Study GTI1401-OLE. If eligible, subjects will be administered weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg
      Alpha-1 MP for approximately 1 year or longer. The Week 9 Visit of GTI1401 will be the End of
      Study Visit for the subjects who are enrolled in Study GTI1401-OLE.

      Subjects in Study GTI1401-OLE will have the option to remain in Study GTI1401-OLE and
      continue to receive weekly IV infusions of 60 mg/kg Alpha-1 MP for another year or longer. If
      subjects plan to conclude their participation in the study (GTI1401-OLE) early (before Ext.
      Week 52), they will be asked to complete the End of Study Follow-Up Assessments, which will
      be scheduled 4 weeks after the last infusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who complete participation in Study GTI1401 (i.e., have completed the study
             through the Week 9 Visit).

          -  Subjects who will and are able to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with newly diagnosed severe concomitant disease including, but not limited

             study or male subjects who have a partner who is of child-bearing potential and is
