  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study represents an important step to validate the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound
      (CEU) as a clinical research tool that can be used as a biologic readout of new therapies for
      Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD), and as a clinically-reasonable method for assessing impact
      of revascularization. The primary aim is to establish that CEU limb perfusion imaging can be
      used to accurately assess therapeutic improvements in tissue perfusion that are linked to
      symptom improvement.

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be performed in patients with known history of PAD that are scheduled to
      undergo either surgical or percutaneous revascularization. Limb rest-stress CEU perfusion
      imaging will be performed before and 3-4 weeks after revascularization. Quantitative
      measurements of pre-revascularization perfusion, post-revascularization perfusion, and change
      in perfusion will be compared to symptom status (Rutherford classification and PAD [Criqui]
      questionnaire) at each study point, and to data on time to onset of claudication on an
      upright treadmill exercise study (Gardiner protocol). Results of angiography will be scored
      and allow determination of the relationship between angiographic severity of disease and
      exercise perfusion.
