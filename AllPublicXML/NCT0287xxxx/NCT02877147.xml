    <textblock>
      The Summer Electronic Benefit for Children (SEBTC) demonstration provided food assistance to
      households with school-aged children during the summer through electronic benefit transfer
      (EBT) procedures used by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special
      Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs. The evaluation
      design included two components: an impact study and an implementation study. The evaluation
      assessed the impact of SEBTC on children's food security and nutritional status, household
      food expenditures and purchasing behaviors, parental perceptions, and participation in
      nutrition assistance programs. The implementation study analyzed SEBTC use patterns using
      administrative data, and described demonstration implementation and costs.

    <textblock>
      The SEBTC evaluation took place in the summers of 2011 through 2014. Ten grantees implemented
      the demonstration in a total of 16 sites; the number of participating sites and/or the
      evaluation components differed by year. In 2011, 5 grantees with five sites participated and
      the evaluation included implementation and cost analysis, EBT analysis, and an impact study.
      In 2012, 10 grantees implemented SEBTC in 14 sites and the evaluation included the same study
      components. In 2013, four grantees with six sites participated and the study components
      included EBT analysis and an impact study (no implementation or cost data collection).
      Finally, in 2014, three grantees participated in three sites and only implementation data
      were collected. Information on human subjects was collected for the evaluation's impact
      evaluation.
