      Objective: To compare outcomes of retinal detachment repair following pneumatic retinopexy
      (PnR) versus pars plana vitrectomy in terms of anatomical success, functional success and
      patient quality of life in patients with extended criteria.

      Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial will be conducted with 178 patients
      presenting at St. Michael's Hospital with primary retinal detachment (RD). Inclusion criteria
      include: a single or multiple retinal tears in detached retina between 7 and 5 o'clock being
      of any size and any distance apart from each other, including giant retinal tears with
      inferior aspect above 5 and 7 o'clock, RD with no identifiable tear but where suspected tear
      is between 7 and 5 o'clock, retinoschisis with RD if tears are located between 7 and 5
      o'clock, mild proliferative vitreoretinopathy, none or mild vitreous hemorrhage. Patients
      will be excluded if there is a small retinal tear or multiple tears less than 30o apart
      between 8 and 4 o'clock in detached retina, retinal tear in detached retina between 5 and 7
      o'clock, &lt;18 years old, inability to read English, mental incapacity, previous history of RD,
      scleral buckle or vitrectomy in index eye, inability to maintain appropriate head posture at
      post-operative period and inability to visualize peripheral retinal due to media opacity.
      Patients will be randomly allocated into two groups: PnR + cryotherapy/laser or vitrectomy +
      cryotherapy/laser and the intervention will take place within 24 hours and 72 hours for
      attached and detached macula status, respectively. Patients will undergo a complete
      ophthalmological examination, including visual acuity and fundus assessment at baseline and
      at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Visual acuity will also be measured at 1, 7 and 30 days
      after surgery. Global health related quality of life will be evaluated with the SF-36v2
      questionnaire at baseline, 1 month, 1 and 2 years after intervention, while the VFG25
      questionnaire will be applied at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery to measure vision
      related quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Single retinal tear or group of tears (any distance apart) in detached retina located
             between 7 and 5 o'clock.

          -  Retinal detachment with no identifiable tear but where suspected tear is located
             between 7-5 o'clock based on Lincoff rules

          -  Any size of retinal tear, including giant retinal tears, if the inferior aspect of it
             is above 5 and 7 o'clock

          -  Retinoschisis with retinal detachment if tears are located between 7 and 5 o'clock

          -  There may be mild proliferative vitreoretinopathy (unless there is a visible traction
             on the break)

          -  None or mild vitreous hemorrhage. Note: vitreous hemorrhage will be considered mild if
             it does not impair an adequate examination of the retinal periphery.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, PnR is likely to achieve anatomical re-attachment
             of the retina

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Group of tears &lt;30o apart in detached retina if all located within 8-4 o'clock

          -  Single retinal tear smaller than 1 o'clock in detached retina between 8-4 o'clock

          -  Retinal tears below the 5 and 7 o'clock meridian in detached retina (note that
             additional tears in attached retina are acceptable)

          -  Inability to read English language

          -  Age &lt;18 years

          -  Mental incapacity

          -  Previous vitrectomy or scleral buckle (index eye)

          -  Previous retinal detachment (index eye)

          -  Inability to maintain the strict post-operative posturing requirements of pneumatic
             retinopexy

          -  Inability to carry out detailed examination of the peripheral retina due to media
             opacity NOTE: Lens/posterior hyaloid status does not affect eligibility.
