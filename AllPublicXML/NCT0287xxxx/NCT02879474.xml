      State of the question Over the past decade, the incidence of melanoma (MM) has steadily
      increased in France and in most developed countries. This increased incidence was concerned
      mainly MM thin while the incidence of MM thick that represent the true &quot;killers&quot;, and
      mortality from MM remained stable or increased slightly over the same period. These
      epidemiological data and observations from everyday medical practice dermatologists suggest
      the existence of different growth patterns within MM. Indeed, some MM progressing slowly
      sometimes for decades before diagnosis but are thin at the time of resection. Conversely,
      others MM grow very quickly, resulting in thick tumors despite a diagnosis and resection
      sometimes very early. These fast growing MM (FGMM) probably contribute significantly to the
      relative mortality in MM, as improved screening failed to influence to this day.

      Our team has already demonstrated that the growth kinetics of the MM was a prognostic factor
      of tumor aggressiveness regardless of the thickness of the tumor. Using the same method to
      calculate the growth rate, an Australian team recently studied the growth rate in a
      population of patients suffering from MM. In this population 1/3 of MM had a growth of more
      than 0.5 mm per month. Clinical aspects and FGMM of these risk factors were individuals
      (injuries symmetrical achromic and regular occurrence among about older and low-nevi). The
      European and Australian people are very different in particular regarding the prevention
      policy, these results can not be extrapolated to the French population.The main objective is
      to identify risk factors for FGMM in French propulation
