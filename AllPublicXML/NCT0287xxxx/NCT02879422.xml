  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes (TD2) is the leading cause of new cases of preventable blindness in these
      countries (and the gold-standard treatment, laser photocoagulation has proven to be effective
      in preventing vision loss at the end stage of eye disease due to proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy (PDR) that occurs in 3 to 6 % of the cases.Therefore, the ongoing search for
      predictive factors of sight threatening stages of diabetic retinopathy has become more
      important.

      Previous studies that have examined candidate predictive factors for diabetic eye disease
      have mostly focused on systemic risk factors leading to PDR. Among various clinical
      parameters, increased HbA1c % levels, uncontrolled blood pressure, diabetes duration,
      neuropathy and elevated triglycerides have been associated with PDR.

      Some genetic factors may also account for the development of PDR and are prospectively
      considered in this study .

    <textblock>
      In a previous study (2011), investigators demonstrated a statistically significant relation
      between the Endothelial Lipase(EL) c.584C&gt;T polymorphism and the occurrence of diabetic
      retinopathy in 396 french patients with diabetes type 2 (DT2) with a longitudinal follow-up.

      Secondly (2014) in a subgroup of 287 DT2 patients, investigators showed the impact of the EL
      rare T allele was consistent with a recessive mode of inheritance, with homozygotes for the
      rare allele differing from the carriers of the major allele. Importantly, the homozygotes for
      the rare T allele were more likely to present with advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy
      (severe non proliferative and proliferative disease) and particularly with proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (PDR).

      Based on this model investigators decided to conduct a case-control prospective study
      comparing 155 french patients with DT2 with PDR (cases) and 155 french patients with DT2
      without PDR (controls) on the basis of two genetic parameters: EL c.584C&gt;T polymorphism that
      investigators previously studied and the C(-106)T aldose reductase polymorphism widely
      studied in diabetic retinopathy.
