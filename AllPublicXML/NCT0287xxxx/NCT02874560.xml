  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a population of patients suffering from schizophrenia being treated for an episode of
      clinical destabilization and followed for a period of twelve months, the main objective is to
      evaluate the proportion of patients achieving functional remission and its relationship to
      clinical remission.

      Prospective, national, noninterventional study. One year follow up with three evaluation
      dates (D0, D180 and D360). The participation of a subject in this study will in no way impact
      the regular care of the subject or any benefits they are otherwise entitled to. All treatment
      decisions will be made at the discretion of the participating physician, in accordance with
      his clinical practice and with approved local prescribing information. Only data available
      from clinical practice will be collected. Evaluation methods: patient history and clinical
      examination, clinical global impression (CGI): Improvement in CGI, social performance
      evaluation [functional remission of general schizophrenia (FROGS scale)], clinical remission
      evaluation: 8 items of the Positive and negative syndrome (PANSS) Scale, psychosocial
      remission evaluation (PSP scale), current insight evaluation: insight scale for psychosis,
      subjective well being under neuroleptic treatment (SWN scale), health condition [Euro quality
      of life - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)]Í¾ Judgment Criteria: functional remission is defined as an
      overall score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 57 on the FROGS scale, functional response is
      defined as improvement of &gt;= 7 points on the FROGS scale. Safety evaluation: no tolerance
      analysis will be performed, adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) with J&amp;J
      products will be collected and transmitted according to J&amp;J timelines/process.

    <description>Defined by the absence of a score greater than (&gt;) 3 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 8 item scale at two consecutive evaluations (D0 and D180 or D180 and D360). The PANSS 8 items allows to evaluate the clinical remission, defined by a score less than or equal to (=&lt;) 3 on each eight items during a six month minimum period. Each of the 8 PANSS items must be scored from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely). More the score is high, more the severity rate of the symptom is high.</description>
