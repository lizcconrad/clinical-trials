      Objectives:

        -  To establish the rate of circulating tumor cells (CTC) positivity in patients with
           locally-advanced rectal cancer (LARC), relative to other stages;

        -  To assess changes in detected CTCs associated with neoadjuvant therapy in patients with
           LARC;

        -  To correlate CTC counts with neoadjuvant treatment response as an indicator of disease
           risk.

      Healthy Participants:

      If you have not been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be
      drawn 1 time. This blood will be used as a control (normal) to look for differences in cells
      in the blood of patients with colorectal cancer.

      Once your blood is collected, your participation on this study will be over.

      This study is for research purposes only. Test results will not be placed in your medical
      record, and you will not be informed of the outcome of any test results.

      This is an investigational study. There will be no cost to you for the blood draws in this
      study.

      Up to 520 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Rectal Cancer Participants:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have blood drawn to test for CTCs.

      Rectal Cancer Participants:

      If you are a participant who has been diagnosed with rectal (rectosigmoid) cancer, blood
      (about 2 tablespoons) may be drawn 1 time before you start treatment.

      Additional Blood Draws for Rectal Cancer Patients ONLY:

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) may also be drawn for CTC and other testing at the following time
      points:

        -  Just before tumor surgery

        -  1-8 weeks after your surgery, or before you begin chemotherapy

        -  1-12 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy

        -  1 year after your surgery (+/- 12 weeks) OR 1 year after completion of treatment if you
           are not having surgery

        -  2 years after your surgery (+/- 12 weeks) OR 2 years after completion of treatment if
           you are not having surgery

        -  If the disease gets worse during treatment OR If the disease comes back within 6 years
           after treatment OR at end of 6 years follow-up

      If there is a problem with your sample during testing AND you are still in one of the same
      timepoints listed above, you may be asked to provide extra blood (about 2 tablespoons) to
      complete the study testing. Whenever possible, this blood draw will be done as part of a
      routine blood draw, but you may need to come to the clinic for this.

      If you choose to receive follow-up care away from MD Anderson, you will be asked to allow
      study staff to contact you by phone or email. You will be asked about the status of the
      disease and you will be given instructions on how to provide blood samples for the time
      points above.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 520 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson or
      its regional care centers.
