  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a widely prevalent and morbid disease for which
      the current standard treatment is supportive care and avoidance of complications with
      lung-protective ventilation. Lower-tidal volume ventilation has been largely accepted as a
      means of lung protective ventilation, but the mechanism for its effectiveness is not yet
      clear, and debate remains as to how best to choose positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).
      Reduction in driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) has been suggested as a possible
      means to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. This protocol aims to identify the range of
      safe paired-settings of PEEP and tidal volume, with selection guided by driving pressure and
      the stress index, a tool to recognize potential lung hyperinflation during mechanical
      ventilation.

    <intervention_name>Recruitment Maneuver with PEEP and Tidal Volume Optimization</intervention_name>
    <description>A staircase recruitment maneuver will be performed on pressure control ventilation followed by a decremental PEEP trial. During the decremental PEEP trial inspiratory tidal volumes will be varied at each step between 3 ml/kg and 10 ml/kg predicted body weight while recording the continuous pressure and flow tracings from the mechanical ventilator. With each PEEP and tidal volume combination, end expiratory and end-inspiratory plateau pressure and stress index will be assessed. At the completion of the decremental PEEP trial, the patient will be returned to ARDSnet-recommended ventilator settings.</description>
