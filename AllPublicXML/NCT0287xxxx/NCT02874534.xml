  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel transdiagnostic treatment for
      anhedonia, called Behavioral Activation Treatment for Anhedonia (BATA), using ultra-high
      field functional neuroimaging. There is a critical need for a validated treatment that
      specifically targets anhedonia, and this project will evaluate the effects of this new
      treatment on anhedonia and will establish how this treatment impacts brain systems that
      mediate reward processing, clinical symptoms of anhedonia, functional outcomes, and
      behavioral indices of reward processing. This work will also identify brain targets by which
      future novel anhedonia treatment may be evaluated.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 15 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), a well-validated 14-item questionnaire will be used to assess hedonic capacity. The sum of the 14 items scores ranges from 0 to 56. A higher score represents more anhedonic symptoms.</description>

    <description>Treatment will consist of 15 weekly 45-minute sessions. Session 1 provides orientation and psychoeducation on anhedonia, and activity monitoring is introduced. Sessions 2-3 include structured values assessments of 10 life areas to enhance motivation for sustained behavior change and to clarify goals. Following goals clarification, an activity hierarchy is developed, establishing a set of idiographic behavioral targets across life areas prioritized by ease of implementation to scaffold task engagement during the course of treatment.</description>

    <description>BATA will be compared to mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT), chosen because its mechanisms of action are hypothesized to impact different brain mechanisms than BATA. Mindfulness is nonjudgmentally bringing awareness and acceptance to one's present-moment experience. MBCT will be administered in an individual format. The MBCT protocol will be modeled on the session outlines presented in Wahbeh et al., 2014. Treatment will be compromised of 15 weekly 45-minute sessions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18-50 years old and treatment seeking;

          2. SHAPS scores â‰¥ 20, corresponding to clinically significant anhedonia;

          3. Clinician's Global Impression Scale-Severity score (CGI-S) &gt; 3 to assure a clinically
             impaired sample;

          4. Seeking treatment for anhedonia (i.e., referred from an outpatient clinic or responded
             to an advertisement for anhedonia treatment; endorses desire for treatment during
             screening).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those for whom medication management is the primary gold-standard treatment, including
             those with bipolar disorder/mania, schizophrenia spectrum, and other psychotic
             disorders;

          2. Prior treatment with behavioral activation therapy for depression or mindfulness-based
             treatments (those with exposure to other forms of psychotherapy, e.g., supportive
             therapy, will be eligible);

          3. Those who may have difficulty understanding the cognitive components of BATA,
             including those with intellectual disability, neurocognitive disorders, and
             dissociative disorders;

          4. Feeding and eating disorders which may have confounding effects on the fMRI signal;

          5. Substance Use Disorders given confounding effects of substances of abuse on the fMRI
             signal;

          6. Suicidal intent and plan;

          7. Psychotropic medication use in the past 4 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine) and/or
             current psychotherapy. Participants must be medication-free at study entry; study
             personnel will not supervise medication taper for the purpose of the study, but those
             who taper under the supervision of their regular provider will be eligible;

             scans;

          9. Positive urinalysis screen for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, methadone, amphetamines,
             and benzodiazepines (conducted on-site via Biosite Triage Meter Plus) at study entry.

         10. No neurological conditions (e.g., history of stroke, seizure, or TBI);

         11. Contraindications for fMRI imaging: Metal in the body, dental work that is not
             fillings or gold, any tattoos, any metal in the body, any metal injury - especially
