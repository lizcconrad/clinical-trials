  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heat-shock proteins (HSP) have been very highly conserved throughout the evolution of species
      and are characterized by their chaperone function, thanks to their ability to prevent
      aggregation and to promote the renaturation/break down of damaged proteins. Among other
      targets, they also chaperone JAK2, a key step that is deregulated in signalling in
      myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS) because of the JAK2V617F mutation. These HSP also have a
      potent cytoprotective action through their multiples inhibiting effects on apoptotic
      processes.

      Little is known about levels of HSP expression, in particular for HSP70 and HSP27, in MPS
      cells.

      However, in vitro studies of different cell models have shown the interest of HSP90
      inhibitors in slowing cell proliferation in MPS. These results have been confirmed in animal
      models with results in terms of blood counts and overall survival. In addition, it seems that
      the V617F mutated form of JAK2 is more sensitive than the wild-type to HSP90 inhibitors.
      Finally, inhibitors of HSP90 remain efficacious with regard to the inhibition of cell growth,
      even in cases of resistance to JAK2 inhibitors. Nonetheless, HSP90 inhibitors are known to
      stimulate the expression of other HSP, notably HSP27 and HSP70, which are, through their
      properties, tumorigenic and could lead to an escape phenomenon. Thus the combined use of
      several HSP inhibitors could be beneficial, and eventually present synergistic effects on the
      inhibition of tumour processes.
