      Title: Embolization of Gastric Arterial Supply for Weight Loss

      Sample size:

      10 patients

      Study Population: Morbidly obese patients who were seen by the bariatric surgery program at
      Toronto Western Hospital but are either not interested or not eligible for surgery.

      Study Design:

      Single center, randomized, prospective, non-blinded pilot study.

      Study Duration:

      12 months (November 2015 - December 2015).

      Agent:

      150-250 micron polyvinyl alcohol particles

      Primary objective:

      To further evaluate the safety of embolization of the left gastric and gastroepiploic
      arteries. To determine if either or both will result in significant weight loss and decrease
      in waist circumference among obese patients.

      Primary objective measure:

      The number of adverse events in a 1 year period will be recorded. The weight change from
      baseline will be recorded.
