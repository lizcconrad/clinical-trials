      To study objective is to evaluate the impact of use of The MetaNeb® System in clearance of
      atelectasis, as demonstrated by improvement in chest x-rays. This is a a non-randomized open
      label study, with all subjects receiving treatment with The MetaNeb® System. Subjects who
      qualify for enrollment in the study will receive therapy with The MetaNeb® System following
      the labeled instructions for the device. Details of the treatment including duration and
      frequency will be defined in treatment procedures.

      Study Population:

      Post-surgical (thoracic, cardiac or abdominal surgery) non-mechanically ventilated patients
      with significant atelectasis as documented by chest x-ray results.

      Duration of treatment:

      Duration of treatment with The MetaNeb® System will be a minimum of 48 hours, or until the
      subject is discharged from the hospital (if discharge is earlier). Enrolled subjects will
      remain in the study through Day 4 or until the subject is discharged from the hospital,
      whichever occurs sooner.
