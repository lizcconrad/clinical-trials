  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will first have a blood pressure reading recorded on both arms using a non-invasive
      blood pressure monitoring (NIBP) cuff in the preoperative area. Then blood pressure will be
      recorded using the ClearSight monitor on each hand over a one-minute period. If mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) as assessed by either the noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitoring cuff or
      the ClearSight system differs by more than 10% from arm to arm, the subject will be excluded
      from the study.

      Before induction of anesthesia, the subject will be randomized to either:

      ClearSight group + usual clinical care: Information from ClearSight monitor will be available
      to the clinicians. According to ASA guidelines, usual blood pressure monitoring includes
      non-invasive blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes during a surgical case.

      Non-ClearSight group (blinded) + usual clinical care: Information from ClearSight monitor
      will not be available to the clinicians.

      Both patient groups will have continuous ClearSight monitoring and non-invasive blood
      pressure monitoring every 5 minutes. The difference will be in the intervention group data
      from the monitor will be available to the clinicians in the operating room, but in the
      control group data from the ClearSight monitor will not be available (blinded) to the
      clinicians. Regardless of the study group assignment, second-by-second ClearSight monitor
      continuous blood pressure data will be recorded for each study patient and will be used for
      analysis.

      The morning of post-operative day 3 the subject will be given the QoR-15 questionnaire and
      will complete POMS morbidity surveys.
