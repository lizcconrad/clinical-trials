      The Aim of the study is to compare the clinical performance of p-LMA, i-gel and LTS-D in
      terms of the efficacy and safety in anaesthetized patient on Mechanical ventilation
      undergoing elective surgical procedure.

      The study aims to draw a comparison between ProSeal LMA, i-gel and LTS-D supraglottic airway
      devices in terms of the efficacy and safety in anaesthetised patient on Mechanical
      ventilation undergoing elective surgical procedure.

      Methodology: A prospective randomized control study conducted on 150 patients undergoing
      elective surgical procedure under general anaesthesia at Dr Sushila Tiwari Hospital and
      Government medical college, Haldwani.

      Following detailed pre-anaesthetic check-up, informed written consent was taken from patient
      fulfilling the required criteria. Patients were randomly allocated into 3 groups namely Group
      I (i-gel, n=50), Group P (p-LMA, n=50) and Group L (LTS-D, n=50) by online generated
      randomization.

      Standard general anaesthesia protocol was followed and once adequate depth was achieved i-gel
      or p-LMA or LTS-D appropriate for weight or / and height was selected and inserted. An
      effective airway was confirmed and device was fixed from maxilla to maxilla.

      The three groups were compared with respect to number of Insertion attempts, ease of
      insertion of device, time taken for placement of device, airway sealing pressure, ease and
      number of attempts of gastric tube placement and complications noted if any.
