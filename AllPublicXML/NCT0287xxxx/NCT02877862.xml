  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This innovative project seeks to harness mobile phone technology as a means to take
      preventive health care to a new level among ovarian cancer survivors. Using the Fogg
      Behavioral Model, developed from the concept of persuasive technology, this study proposes to
      develop the Mobile Application for Genetic Information on Cancer (mAGIC) intervention to
      motivate ovarian cancer survivors to undergo genetic counseling. The overall study objective
      is to develop and assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a theory-based intervention
      aimed to encourage ovarian cancer survivors to receive genetic counseling

      This project seeks to harness mobile phone technology as a means to take preventive health
      care to a new level among ovarian cancer survivors. Using the Fogg Behavioral Model31 (FBM),
      developed from the concept of persuasive technology, this study proposes to develop the
      Mobile Application for Genetic Information on Cancer (mAGIC) week-long intervention to
      motivate ovarian cancer survivors to undergo genetic counseling.
