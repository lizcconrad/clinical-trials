  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drepanocytose disease is the first genetic disease in the world. It results in the synthesis
      of an abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), which in its deoxygenated form, polymerizes and leads to
      structural changes of red blood cells (RBC) which then take the shape of a sickle, become
      more fragile, more rigid and less deformable. The fragility of GR sickle causes their mass
      destruction, leading to chronic anemia (i.e. low levels of GR in the blood) associated with
      low tissue oxygenation. More rigid and less deformable, sickle GR tend to hang in the
      microvessels, leading to vaso-occlusive crises (CVO) particularly painful, can cause the
      failure of certain organs (spleen, kidneys, brain, lung, heart, liver , bone ...) and to
      life-threatening patients. Preliminary studies conducted on patients with drepanocytose
      disease (HbSS) have demonstrated changes of muscle tissue indicating a possible failure in
      the supply and use of oxygen. To date, the translation of this metabolic remodeling in the
      muscle work is not known.

      This project's main objective is to evaluate muscle function in drepanocytose attempted
      patients. We hypothesized that muscle remodeling associated with sickle cell disease have a
      functional impact on strength and muscle metabolism. The main objective is to characterize
      the maximal voluntary plantar flexor muscles. The criteria for these targets will be based on
      the comparison between healthy subjects, carriers of the sickle cell trait (HbAS) and sickle
      cell patients (HbSS) oxygen saturation.

      The strictly non-invasive approach proposed in this project will study the functional
      parameters of the muscle of sickle cell disease and the possible link with the clinical
      manifestations of the disease, including vaso-occlusive crisis, in which tissue oxygenation
      and pH plays a major role.
