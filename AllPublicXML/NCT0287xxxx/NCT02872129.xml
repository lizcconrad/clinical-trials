  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 12-year follow-up of 166 women with fibromyalgia (FM) or chronic widespread pain (CWP) in
      western Sweden.

      The 166 women participated in a Randomised Controlled Trial called GAU in 2004-2005, aiming
      to investigate the effect of pool exercise and patient education.

      The primary aim of the present study is to examine the change of symptoms after 11-12 years
      in 166 women with FM or CWP and also investigate predictors of change of symptoms and work
      ability.

      The 166 women will be asked to participate in the present follow-up study. The follow-up
      examination comprises a standardised interview of symptoms and demographic variables, a
      battery of self-administered questionnaires and tests of physical function.

      A 12-year follow-up of 166 women with fibromyalgia (FM) or chronic widespread pain (CWP).

      The 166 women participated in a Randomised Controlled Trial called GAU 2004-2005 in three
      cities in western Sweden; Göteborg, Alingsås and Uddevalla. The RCT aimed to investigate the
      effect of pool exercise and patient education.

      The primary aim of the present study is to examine the change of symptoms after 11-12 years
      in 166 women with FM or CWP and also investigate predictors of change of symptoms and work
      ability.

      The 166 women will be contacted by mail and telephone, and asked to participate in the
      present follow-up study.

      The follow-up examination comprises a standardised interview of symptoms and demographic

        Inclusion Criteria of the present study GAU-U:

          -  All 166 patients who participated in the study GAU in 2004/2005. (The inclusion
             criteria of GAU was women with FM or CWP, 18-60 years old. Patients with widespread
             pain; pain in the right and left side of the body, above and below the waist, as well
             as axial pain, for at least three months were classified as chronic widespread pain
             (CWP). Patients who fulfilled the criteria for CWP and who also had pain at palpation
             of at least 11 of 18 pre-defined tender points were classified as fibromyalgia (FM).
