      The primary objectives of the study are:

        -  To determine the absolute bioavailability of SK-1404

        -  To assess the mass balance recovery after a single oral (PO) dose of carbon-14
           (14C)-SK-1404

        -  To provide plasma, urine and faecal samples for metabolite profiling and structural
           identification

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  To determine the routes and rates of elimination of [14C]-SK-1404

        -  To identify the chemical structure of each metabolite with an exposure (AUC) of more
           than 10% of circulating total radioactivity

        -  To explore the intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetics (PK) of [14C]-SK-1404

        -  To further explore the PO PK of SK-1404

        -  To provide additional safety and tolerability information for SK-1404

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, 2-part, open-label, non-randomised, sequential, single dose study in
      healthy male subjects. It is planned to enrol a single cohort of 6 healthy male subjects who
      will participate in Parts 1 and Part 2 of the study.

      In Part 1, each subject will receive a single PO dose of SK-1404 followed by an IV
      microtracer dose of [14C]-SK-1404.

      In Part 2, each subject will receive a single PO dose of [14C]-SK-1404.
