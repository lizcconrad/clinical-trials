    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an integrated treatment, Behavioral
      Activation + Cognitive Processing Therapy (BA + CPT), to CPT alone among active-duty service
      members with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid major depressive disorder
      (MDD). Participants will complete assessor-administered and self-report measures at pre- and
      post-treatment assessments, as well as a 3-month follow-up. Additionally, participants will
      complete self-report measures of PTSD and MDD symptoms at each therapy session.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the psychological condition most commonly comorbid with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD and MDD comorbidity is associated with greater
      symptom severity, lower levels of functioning, greater disability, and increased suicide
      potential relative to PTSD or MDD alone. Unfortunately, no psychological treatment
      intervention specifically addresses this comorbidity. Individuals with comorbid PTSD and MDD
      often receive evidence-based treatments for PTSD, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT);
      although such treatments typically reduce both PTSD and depression symptoms, few studies have
      specifically examined these outcomes in individuals with PTSD and comorbid MDD. The primary
      goal of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether greater improvement in
      depression symptoms can be achieved by augmenting CPT with behavioral activation (BA), a
      standard depression treatment, for active-duty service members with PTSD and comorbid MDD.
      Participants will be evaluated at three assessment time-points (pre-treatment,
      post-treatment, and three-month follow-up), as well as complete self-report measures of PTSD
      and MDD symptoms at each therapy session.
