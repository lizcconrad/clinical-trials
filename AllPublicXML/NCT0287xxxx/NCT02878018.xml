    <textblock>
      Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis(HSPN) is one of the most common secondary
      glomerulonephritis in children. A large, prospective, multicenter cohort study is being
      conducted in three institutions. Eligible Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis children will be
      classified as the experimental group (n=300) and the control group (n=300) based on the
      interventions they receive. Patients taking Chinese herbal formula will be in the
      experimental group, and those taking Western medicine will be in the control group. The
      entire study will last 60 weeks, including a 12-week observation period and a followup at 12
      months.

      Background: Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis involves the renal impairment of
      Henoch-Schönlein purpura and can easily relapse into life-threatening late nephropathy in
      severe cases. Although there is a lack of validated evidence for its effectiveness,
      traditional Chinese medicine is the most commonly used method in China to treat
      Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis. We report the protocol of a prospective cohort trial
      using traditional Chinese medicine to investigate the effectiveness, safety and advantages
      for children with Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis.

      Methods/Design: A large, prospective, multicenter cohort study is being conducted in three
      institutions. Eligible Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis children will be classified as the
      experimental group (n=300) and the control group (n=300) based on the interventions they
      receive. Patients taking Chinese herbal formula will be in the experimental group, and those
      taking Western medicine will be in the control group. The entire study will last 60 weeks,
      including a 12-week observation period and a followup at 12 months. Seven visits will be
      scheduled for each participant with visits in week 0, week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, week 10
      and week 12. The primary outcomes include the remission rate and the recurrence rate. The
      secondary outcomes include the urine erythrocyte effectiveness, the urine protein
      effectiveness, the hormone usage rate, the immunosuppressant usage rate, and the incidence
      rate of renal failure. Safety outcomes and any adverse reactions will be recorded during the
      study.

      Discussion: This study will determine whether the Chinese herbal formula is helpful for
      treating Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis in children. The findings will provide a basis
      for further confirmatory studies.
