  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will seek to evaluate the prevalence and the progression of vascular
      calcification in a cohort of maintenance hemodialysis patients in Asian population. It will
      also evaluate the efficacy of vitamin K 2 supplementation in reducing the progression of
      vascular calcification in this group of patients.

      This will be a single-center randomized, prospective and open-label interventional clinical
      trial of end stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis.Primary outcome will be absolute
      difference in coronary artery calcium (CAC) score at 18-month between control and
      intervention arms. Secondary outcomes will be to compare absolute difference in aortic valve
      calcification, percentage of patients with regression of coronary artery calcification of at
      least 10%, absolute difference in aortic and systemic arterial stiffness, mortality from any
      cause and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over the same period.

    <description>Vitamin K comes in various isoforms and we have elected to use the K2 isoform - menaquinone-7. We have chosen a dose of 360mcg 3x/week as previous studies using menaquinone-7 demonstrated an increasing dose efficacy relationship up to this strength. Vitamin K2 is manufactured by Nattopharma</description>
