    <description>Participants performed a aerobic training. Ninety-six subjects practice a regular aerobic exercise program on a treadmill was applied 3 times a week for 12 weeks,each session lasting 30 minutes, ranging between 70-80 % of maximum heart rate intensity and the evaluations are done monthly through a maximum progressive exercise protocol. Phototherapy, active or placebo, were applied in 9 different points of quadriceps,6 points in the posterior thigh and two points in the gastrocnemius muscle, depending the group randomized, before and after each training session.</description>
