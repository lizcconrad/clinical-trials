  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, phase 2, prospective, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate disease
      progression, forced vital capacity, and the safety and tolerability of plasma exchange (PE)
      using Albutein® 5% in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of PE with Albutein® 5% in subjects with ALS. The planned enrollment is 10
      subjects who have a definite, possible, or probable diagnosis of ALS, according to the
      revised El Escorial criteria. Enrolled subjects will be treated with PE using Albutein 5% as
      a replacement solution during an Intensive Treatment Phase (2 PEs per week over 3 weeks)
      followed by a Maintenance Treatment Phase (weekly PE for 21 weeks) for a total treatment
      duration of 6 months. A 6-month follow up will begin after the last PE.

          -  Difficult or problematic peripheral vein access and inability to implant a central
             catheter which would make continuous PE not feasible as per the visit protocol

               5. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors which may increase the
                  risk of allergic reactions, unless a preventive change in hypotensive treatment
                  occurs prior to enrollment

          -  History of anaphylaxis or severe systemic response to any plasma-derived albumin

          -  Presence of heart disease that contraindicates PE treatment, including ischemic
             cardiopathy and congestive heart failure

          -  Presence of prior behavioral disorders requiring pharmacological intervention with
             less than 3 months of stable treatment

          -  Mentally challenged subject who cannot give independent informed consent
