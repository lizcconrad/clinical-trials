  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to explore the variability of uterine, breast and bone outcome markers
      as surrogates to assess the adequacy of exogenous oestrogen replacement in individuals with
      hypogonadism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will invite individuals with hypogonadism who require pubertal induction to
      participate in the study. The participants will receive conventional routine oestrogen
      replacement in the form of transdermal patch. The participants will be reviewed every 2
      months for a total of 8 months to document uterine, breast and bone assessment. This will be
      completed using a variety of tools. After 4 months, the participants will receive an
      incremental increase in oestrogen dose.
