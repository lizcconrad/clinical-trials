    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare function of the peritoneal dialysis catheter in two
      groups of patients with and without prophylactic omentopexy that was performed during
      laparoscopic insertion of peritoneal catheters.

      Peritoneal dialysis is a know and accepted treatment in patients with end stage renal
      diseases. The is a safe, easy and cheap treatment modality in these patients. After
      introduction and development of laparoscopic procedures for insertion of peritoneal dialysis
      catheters, some prophylactic surgical techniques have been proposed as measures to reduce
      catheter malfunction. Omentopexy is among these techniques. The purpose of this study is to
      compare function of the peritoneal dialysis catheter (including inflow and outflow failure)
      in two groups of patients with and without prophylactic omentopexy that was performed during
      laparoscopic insertion of peritoneal catheters.
