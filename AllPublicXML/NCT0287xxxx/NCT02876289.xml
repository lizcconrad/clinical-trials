    <textblock>
      Perampanel is a non-competitive antagonist of the AMPA (
      2-amino-3-(5-méthyl-3-hydroxy-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)) propanoïc acid receptors which was approved
      by the European Medicines Agency as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures in
      patients 12 years and older, in 2012. The aim of this study is to evaluate effectiveness and
      safety of perampanel as add-on treatment in patients with refractory epilepsy.

      The investigators retrospectively collected and analyzed the data of patients with refractory
      epilepsy who had been treated with perampanel between May of 2014 and April of 2015. In
      total, one hundred and ten patients were included (mean age 41 [SD = 15.2]). The mean
      duration of epilepsy was 25 years (SD = 14.4). The mean perampanel dose was 5.7 mg/d (SD =
      2.3). The retention rate was 77% at 6 months and 61% at 12 months. After 6 months, the
      responder rate was 35.5%. Eight patients (7.3%) became seizure free. Adverse effects were
      reported in 60 patients (54.5%). Most common side effects were behaviour disturbance (22.7%),
      dizziness (15.5%), asthenia (11.8), somnolence (10%) and ataxia (9.1).
