    <textblock>
      ECMO (extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation) is a blood oxygenation technical and purification
      of carbon dioxide by means of an extracorporeal circulation using a pump (identical to those
      used in cardiac surgery) and a membrane permitting gas exchange. This technique is used for
      almost 40 years in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but benefited from many
      technology improvements over the past 10 years.

      The circuit is now fully pre-heparin, not imposing obtaining activated partial thromboplastin
      time (aPTT) high. Centrifugal pumps limit the risk of intravascular hemolysis. The
      multi-perforated drainage cannula in place in femoral vein or jugular no longer need to
      maintain hypervolaemia to ensure sufficient flow.

      The membrane ensuring gas exchange is now polymethylpentene. This hollow fiber system ensures
      the gas exchange.

      In light of recent technical improvements, manufacturers indicate that the membranes can be
      used for 3 weeks. However, after a few days of use, fibrinoplaquettaires microthrombi form at
      the ECMO circuit, up from cannulas up to the oxygenator, decreasing membrane efficiency and
      imposing more early changes of the circuit. This hypercoagulable state was revealed through
      the study of classical plasma markers of coagulation. There is not so far from reliable
      predictive marker of thrombus formation, indicating a need to change the circuit.

      The production of microparticles (MPs) is a characteristic of cells subjected to an
      activation or apoptosis. MPs are membrane Smaller fragments released into the extracellular
      milieu after rupture of the asymmetry of the distribution of membrane phospholipids and
      characterized by the presence of phosphatidylserine (PhtdSer) on their surface, as well as
      various antigens expressed by their cells of origin. The PhtdSer is a pro-coagulating surface
      on which are going to assemble the enzymes responsible for the formation of thrombin and
      increases proportionally the TF activity ultimately leading to fibrin polymerization in the
      vessels.

      The vesiculation phenomenon exists in healthy subjects. In human pathology, many examples
      emphasize the fundamental role of MP in clotting or thrombosis. The PM generating fault is
      associated with bleeding disorders (Scott syndrome, dysv√©siculation syndrome). Conversely,
      high circulating levels of MP are found in many thrombotic diseases (myocardial infarction,
      diabetes, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, preeclampsia ...). Platelet and intense
      monocyte endothelial activation, observed in sepsis and severe trauma, is accompanied by the
      generation of procoagulant MP carriers of tissue factor (TF). These MP diffuse into the
      vascular compartment pathogenic potential may exacerbate inflammatory and thrombotic
      responses and play a leading role in triggering the DIC.

      More recently, various studies have shown that the microparticles are not only activation
      markers or injury, but also cellular elements having a true pathogenic role. Because they
      contain or express on their surface various biological effector (adhesion molecules, tissue
      factor, inflammatory mediators or apoptogenic, growth factor ...) the microparticles are able
      to interact with their environment and modulate cellular very different way the properties of
      target cells. And platelet or leukocyte microparticles could actively participate in the
      thrombotic process by increasing adhesion of monocytes and endothelial cells, or by inducing
      endothelial procoagulant response.
