  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PhysioFlow® (PF®) is a new cardiac output (CO) monitoring method by impedance cardiography
      (IC), never studied in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aim of the study was to
      compare CO and cardiac index (CI) measurements (IC) by trans-thoracic Doppler
      echocardiography (TTE) (COTTE and CITTE) and PF® (COIC and CIIC) in PICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this monocentric prospective study in PICU of the CHRU of Lille, simultaneous sets of
      three measurements were realized by TTE and PF® in 43 patients.

      In the study, the patient will receive a measure of CF by impedancemetry chest. This
      electrode will be glued on the torso and the neck of the child. We will collect information
      obtained through IT, to compare the results obtained by the ETT, carried out under the
      support of the child. The study will last 15 minutes maximum. No blood sampling will be
      conducted for the purpose of the study, apart from the exams necessary to its support and its
      treatment. At no time, the results of the impedance will affect support. The study will use
      only the data contained in the medical file of the child and would involve no additional
      intervention (no examination, no further treatment). The use of these data will then be
      anonymous. After anonymization, information recorded will computer processing of the data
      collected.

      Concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman analysis with log-transformed data
      were used to compare CO, CI, stroke volume (SV) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR)
      measurements.
