  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chinese Medicine syndrome differentiation has been a prevalent therapy in China for thousands
      of years. It is based on patients' symptoms, pulse, tongue and coating on the tongue.
      Therefore, the syndrome of patients and corresponding Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may
      vary.

      This multicenter prospective cohort studies the efficiency and safety of TCM compared with
      antidepressants. A total number of 4600 cases with primary depression are expected to be
      collected and divided into 3 cohorts based on the patients' requirement and choices. Patients
      in one group will receive TCM, and patients in the other two groups will respectively receive
      antidepressants only and integrated treatment of TCM and antidepressants. This study has 2
      phases: treating period and the follow-up.

      The main purpose of this long-term study is to evaluate the efficiency of TCM compared with
      antidepressants in reducing relapse and suicide rate, changing lifestyle, improving patient
      compliance as well as the safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter prospective cohort uses a modern technique. With its help participants can
      assess themselves at any time and doctors can supervise patients in case of some adverse
      events or intervene when patients commit suicide.

      The main purpose of this study is to observe the differences between cohorts. However, the
      intra-group differences are also needed to be evaluated, as the therapies of different
      participants are various. Therefore, the number of participants treated with each therapy and
      the time of recovery need to be counted and analyzed. This is a long-term and natural study
      that participants lost, drug withdrawal and changes in participants'choices of the therapy
      cannot be avoided. So the reason and number of the previous conditions need to be observed.
      The safety of TCM and antidepressants is also a considerable outcome which will be evaluated
      by laboratory examination, Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) and the number of
      participants with adverse events.

      Some of the outcomes are measured by questionnaires which can be divided into two parts. One
      is self-rated assessments including Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-reporting
      Inventory (SCL-90). The other one is evaluated by doctors, such as Hamilton Depression Rating
      Scale of 24 items (HAMD), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Social
      Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS), Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)and Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome score.
