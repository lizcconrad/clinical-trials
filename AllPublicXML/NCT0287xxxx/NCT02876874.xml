      Rheumatoid Arthritis patients and health participants will be recruited in our research. Then
      the classification of American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism
      (ACR/EULAR) 2009 will be used to identify rheumatoid arthritis patients. The measurement of
      disease activity are Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) combined with the synovitis, bone
      edema and bone erosion of hand and wrist detected by magnetic resonance (MR) and Doppler
      ultrasound (DUS).The morphology of lymph node in popliteal/epitrochlear are scanned by
      3-dimensional MR and DUS. The drainage of hand/foot superficial lymphatic vessels are
      detected in sight of near infrared ray (NIR) with the applying of Indocyanine Green (ICG)
      subcutaneously. We'll conduct correlation analysis to reveal the relationship between the
      activity of Rheumatoid Arthritis and lymph nodes morphology and lymphatic vessels drainage.
