  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate the effect of a lifestyle intervention program
      (adoption of exclusive breastfeeding, healthy diet and regular physical activity) on
      minimizing postpartum weight retention among women with recent GDM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) are characterized by increased risk for
      subsequent type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). These women are also
      characterized by higher body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference compared to women
      without prior GDM. Failure to lose the weight gained during pregnancy can lead to increased
      BMI for subsequent pregnancies. As such, the childbearing-age period has been described as a
      potential period of weight gain and represents a critical window for the development of
      obesity, T2D and CVD. Therefore, strategies aiming at preventing postpartum weight retention
      (WR) and early cardiometabolic alterations in women with a history of GDM are of paramount
      importance. Principal investigator have shown that a low diet quality score was associated
      with greater adiposity and lower insulin sensitivity in women with prior GDM. Furthermore,
      less than 10% of women with prior GDM met the recommendations for breastfeeding, nutrition,
      and physical activity. Investigators have shown that attitude and perceived behavioral
      control were significant predictors of the intention to adopt healthy eating. For those who
      did engage in healthy behaviors, lower prevalence of cardiometabolic alterations was
      observed, providing supportive evidence that the adoption of healthy behaviors may be key to
      prevent the progression to an altered cardiometabolic profile.

    <description>At 2-mo postpartum, women will start the 1-yr lifestyle intervention that will consist of 7 face-to-face individual sessions of 1-hr (at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 mo postpartum and a follow-up at 18 mo). Metabolic and anthropometric measurements will be assessed at 2,6,12 and 18 mo postpartum. In addition, 7 individual sessions of 30 min between face-to-face sessions will be carried out on the phone.
Benefits of exclusive breastfeeding, healthy eating and physical activity will be portrayed at each visit .</description>

    <description>Women in the control group will come to the testing unit at 2, 6, 12 and 18 mo postpartum for metabolic and anthropometric measurements and at 3, 4, 5, 9 mo for weight measurements only.

    <description>Women who are still breastfeeding at the first postpartum visit will be encouraged to pursue. References to local breastfeeding supporting groups will be done, if needed. The intervention will be conducted in order to reach recommendations for food servings and nutrient needs. Particular attention will be paid to increase fruits, vegetables, fish and whole grains intake, and decrease added sugars and high fat meat/dairy products. Women will be strongly encouraged to be active at least 150 min/week. They will be provided with targeted strategies for exercising, types of exercises and tips for including physical activity into the daily routine as well as fun exercises for the whole family.</description>
