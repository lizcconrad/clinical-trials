    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of music, played prior to a surgical
      procedure, on stress levels during induction of anesthesia. Hypothesis: playing &quot;calming&quot;
      music, pre-selected by the investigator and the patient, beginning just prior to induction
      and terminating after induction will positively reduce the patient's heart rate, blood
      pressure, and respiratory rate during this period. For this study, noise-cancelling
      headphones with the ability to play music via an iPod will be utilized.

    <textblock>
      Reduced stress and relaxation positively contribute to patient healing after surgery (1).
      Reduction of stress associated with surgery is even more important in children, for whom a
      traumatic experience can have even more damaging and long-lasting effects (2). One
      stress-reduction technique of current interest is music. In global studies outside of the
      surgical realm, music has been shown to reduce heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate,
      and stress hormone levels as well as alleviate anxiety (3).

      Evidence has also been found that listening to music pre-operatively in both adult and
      pediatric cases can reduce patients' stress and anxiety levels before surgery (3,7) Of the
      studies that have addressed the benefits of pre-operative music, however, none have assessed
      the impact of pre-operative music on stress levels during induction. In addition, almost all
      prior studies of the benefits of perioperative music have assessed the effect of only one
      style of music on each patient group. This set-up is beneficial in eliminating variables
      within the study design, but it fails to consider the individuality of each patient and what
      he/she might find to be relaxing. This study aims to assess the effect of music (selected by
      the pediatric patient from one of several pre-compiled playlists) played pre-operatively and
      during induction on patient stress levels.

    <description>Relaxing music, will be played through noise-cancelling headphones during induction of anesthesia. All of the songs used in this study will have &lt;60 BPM, be instrumental rather than lyrical, and utilize predictable chord progressions. Music will be divided into several themed playlists which will be focused on the type of instruments involved including guitar, steel drum, and piano. The patient will listen to the music through noise-cancelling headphones beginning fifteen minutes prior to induction and ending one minute after intubation.</description>
