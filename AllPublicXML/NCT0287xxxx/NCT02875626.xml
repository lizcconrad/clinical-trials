      This is a single-center prospective study evaluating the diagnostic performance and safety of
      Infracyanine in women with early breast cancer whose the research of sentinel node(s)
      combines isotopes and Infracyanine.

      Visits:

      Screening:

      Complete physical and gynecological examination by surgical oncologist Informed and signed
      consent form. The intervention will be planned within one month.

      Intervention:

      In the beginning of the intervention, a periareolar injection of the Infracyanine will be
      carried out (Infracyanine®, 2ml to 2.5mg/ml whether 3.2nM).

      The search or sentinel node will be made using a infrared camera for transcutaneous
      visualization Secondly, data lymphoscintigraphy may be communicated to the surgeon. The nodes
      are identified as SN fluorescent nodes and / or radioactive nodes.

        -  All radioactive nodes and / or fluorescent will be deleted

        -  Reports of anatomy fluorescent SN and / or hot

      Next visit:

      The patient will be reviewed in consultation in the months following the itervention for a
      clinical examination, the collection of adverse events.
