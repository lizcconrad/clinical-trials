  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is to assess the safety &amp; efficacy of the Combination of Pembrolizumab and
      Lenalidomide in the management of patients with Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an emerging clinical data to confirm that Programmed death-1 (PD-1)blockade is safe
      and viable in lymphoma.

      The investigators hypothesize that the novel immune platform of pembrolizumab and
      lenalidomide, will be safe and well tolerated in patients with Relapsed Refractory (RR)
      Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and that this combination will result in
      a complete response (CR) rate of 50% in patients with RR HL.

         15. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         16. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

             HCV Ribonucleic acid (RNA) [qualitative] is detected), or other active viral
             hepatitis. Patients with treated and resolved hepatitis B or C are eligible. Patients
