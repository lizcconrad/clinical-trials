  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel study in IBS patients. A
      total of 60 adult patients diagnosed with IBS-C, -D or -A/M according to Rome IV criteria
      will be included. The participants will be randomized into one of three groups consuming
      either HMO (two groups) or placebo (one group).

      The primary objective of the study is to establish the effect of HMOs on the faecal
      microbiota in IBS patients. Secondary objectives are to assess the effect on gastrointestinal
      symptoms, mucosal immunity, gut barrier function, quality of life, and anxiety and
      depression.
