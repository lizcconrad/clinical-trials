        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants in good general health

          -  Score of 2=Moderate (coarse and uneven visual skin texture) or 3=Severe (coarse visual
             skin texture, crosshatched fine lines) on both cheeks using the 5-Point Allergan Skin
             Roughness Scale (ASRS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone tissue augmentation with dermal fillers including HA, calcium
             hydroxylapatite, autologous fat, mesotherapy, or other cosmetic procedures (eg.
             face-lift, laser, photomodulation, intense pulsed light, radiofrequency, dermabrasion,
             chemical peel, or other ablative procedures) in the face or neck within the past 12
             months

          -  Has received any crosslinked HA filler in any anatomic area within the past 12 months

          -  Has undergone treatment with botulinum toxins in the face or neck within the past 6
             months

          -  Has ever received semi-permanent fillers or permanent facial implants (eg.
             poly-L-lactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, silicone, expanded

          -  Has a history of anaphylactic shock

          -  Has been previously diagnosed with streptococcal disease (eg. recurrent sore throat,
             acute rheumatic fever)

          -  Has current cutaneous inflammatory or infectious processes (eg. acne, herpes),
