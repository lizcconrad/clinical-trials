    <textblock>
      In the IMA101-101 study, patients with relapsed and/or refractory solid cancers will be
      treated with autologous CD8+ T-cell products (IMA101) specific for novel targets from the
      ACTolog warehouse that have been identified by the XPRESIDENT target discovery platform.

      ACTolog is an actively personalized immunotherapy approach in cancer treatment. The ACTolog
      clinical trial IMA101-101 is a first-in-human trial for the ACTolog concept for patients with
      advanced stage solid cancers.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety of giving IMA101 to
      patients with advanced cancer. IMA101 is made with T cells (a type of immune cell) that are
      grown in the laboratory. Researchers also want to learn if IMA101 can help to control the
      disease.

      First, patients will enter the screening process.

      Screening part 1: Patients may enter the screening procedure when presenting with
      recurrent/progressing and/or refractory solid cancers when one line of established therapy
      remains. ACTolog treatment will be applied, if no established treatment is available or
      treatment is no longer warranted or refused by the patient. During the screening procedures,
      an HLA test and other medical exams will be done. Only HLA-A*02:01 positive patients can
      benefit from ACTolog's IMA101 treatment.

      Screening part 2: If the patient is HLA-A*02:01 positive and all other initial eligibility
      criteria are met, a tumor biopsy will then be performed and tested by an investigational
      diagnostic assay called IMA_Detect. The collected tumor material will be tested for the
      expression of biomarker targets. At least one of the biomarkers must be positive because
      expression of these biomarkers indicates the presence of the target structures on the tumor
      cells against which the study drug will be directed.

      If the tumor has none of the specific biomarkers tested by IMA_Detect, the patient will not
      be eligible for the treatment portion of the study. No further study tests will be done. Only
      if the patient's tumor has one or more specific biomarkers, and is deemed eligible, may the
      patient enter the manufacturing phase.

      Patients who were biomarker negative in other Immatics' trials, but tested positive for at
      least one ACTolog biomarker by IMA_Detect may enter screening in order to avoid a new tumor
      biopsy and repeated biomarker testing.

      Manufacturing Phase: During production of the patient's T-cell product, the patient will
      receive anti-cancer therapy. The leukapheresis product will be made into one to four ACTolog
      products and frozen until infusion.

      Treatment Phase: If the last established therapy option is no longer warranted or refused by
      the patient, IMA101 T-cell product will be administered to the patient intravenously after a
      lymphodepleting pre-conditioning with chemotherapy (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide).

      Low-dose IL-2 will be self-administered after IMA101 T-cells for 14 days.

      Patients will be monitored closely throughout the study.
