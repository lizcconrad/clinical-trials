    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the effect of monthly intravitreal injections of 0.5
      mg ranibizumab and 2.0 mg aflibercept on systemic VEGF levels in patients with visual
      impairment due to DME over a 24 week period. In addition, the study will also assess the
      effect on systemic VEGF-A levels when patients are switched from aflibercept to ranibizumab.

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate ocular and systemic safety in all the three treatment groups. Only treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized.
AEs will be summarized by presenting for each treatment group the number and percentage of patients having any AE, having an eye-related AEs, having an AE in each primary system organ class and having each individual AEs based on the preferred term. All other information collected (e.g., severity or relationship to study treatment) will be tabulated and listed as appropriate. Summary tables will also be presented for the subset of AEs suspected to be treatment related.</description>
