    <textblock>
      Randomized control trial to evaluate uni-manual and bimanual upper limb function as well as
      compare outcomes of varied cast wear in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP)
      following a hybrid camp model of modified constraint induced movement therapy (mCIMT) and
      hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT).
