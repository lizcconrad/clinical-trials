  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine diagnostic performances of flat panel dual energy arthrography
      and arthro-tomosynthesis in identification of loosening of painful hip prosthesis, taking as
      reference the results of surgery performed 6 months after arthrography.

      Secondary purposes are:

        -  To describe the level of concordance of each technique with the indication for surgery

        -  To study inter-technique concordance with kappa coefficient

        -  To study the relationship between density differential between 2 acquisitions and grey
           level on subtraction, i.e. subtraction quality according to metal

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroplasty has become one of the most performed orthopedic procedures. Actual average
      lifetime of total hip prosthesis is approximately 15 years. Some complications are
      inevitable. Total hip prosthesis imaging, performed to search for a complication or wear, is
      difficult and depends on many techniques. Subtracted arthrography is a good technique but its
      access is limited because it needs an angiography room.

      In this study patients undergo standard arthrography, dual energy arthrography,
      arthro-tomosynthesis and arthro-tomography.

    <description>Gold standard is presence or absence of prosthesis loosening revealed with surgery performed after 6 months from arthrography.
Data of patients undergone surgery and not are collected and analyzed. Any clinical or imagery sign of loosening in non-operated patient, will be classified as loosening. A surgery decision for suspicion of loosening will be considered loosening.</description>
