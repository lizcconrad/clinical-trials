      This study will evaluate the comparative effectiveness of behavioral economic financial
      incentives and environmental strategies, separately and together, in achieving initial weight
      loss and maintenance of weight loss, in obese employee populations. Our study contributes to
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's efforts to combat obesity but in particular
      to the Centers for Disease Control's winnable battles (physical activity and obesity); the
      National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's strategic priorities
      around well-being, health equity, and evaluation and dissemination of environmental and
      systems-wide solutions to address public health problems; and the National Center for Chronic
      Disease Prevention and Health Promotion's domain around healthier work-site initiatives, the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's efforts to improve nutrition and physical
      activity to prevent obesity, and reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. This study is a
      4-arm randomized controlled trial in which 344 employees of the City of Philadelphia,
      Independence Blue Cross, and South Eastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority with initial
      Body Mass Index of 30 will be randomized to receive one of the following: 1) Daily lottery
      type incentives tied to achievement of weight loss goals (incentive arm); 2) individually
      tailored environmental strategies around food intake and physical activity (environmental
      arm); 3) a combination of incentives and environmental strategies (combined arm); or 4)
      standard employee wellness benefits and weigh-ins every 6 months (control arm). Phase I of
      the study (first 6 months) will focus on weight loss; Phase II (months 7-18) will focus on
      continued weight loss or maintenance for those who choose to maintain weight loss as opposed
      to continuing to try to lose weight; Phase III (months 19-24) will provide a period of
      post-intervention follow-up to measure sustainability of effects.

      Analysis Plan Statistical Considerations Descriptive analyses We will produce data summaries
      regularly using frequencies for categorical variables and means, medians, and ranges for
      continuous variables. We will assess data quality and examine distributional assumptions with
      graphical methods. To evaluate balance among groups achieved by randomization, we will
      compare baseline values of all variables across the 4 arms using appropriate tests.

      General procedures All primary analyses will be on an intent-to-treat basis including each
      participant in the group to which s/he was randomized, regardless of adherence to the
      assigned strategy. Given the high rates of missing data typical of weight loss studies,
      handling of missing data is an important issue. Primary analyses will use multiple imputation
      for the missing in-person weight outcome at 18 months, using the randomization strata, study
      arm and other baseline variables as predictors in the imputation model. Sensitivity analyses
      will be performed with imputation models that also use post-baseline data, such as the
      at-home weight data, the frequency of weighing in at home, and recent weight loss trend
      before drop out, as well as an analysis that assumes that any participants for whom follow-up
      weight loss data are unavailable have had their weight return to baseline (weight at
      beginning of Pre Phase). Within each arm, this last assumption is likely to be conservative
      but this may not be the case in inter-arm comparisons, depending on the dropout rates in the
      different arms and true follow-up weights of the dropouts. Thus, a key secondary analysis
      will consider the effect of differential dropout among the treatment arms. Finally, we will
      also consider a per-protocol type analysis, which examines the difference in the intervention
      arms in the complete case data.

      Efficacy Analyses All hypotheses will be tested using two-sided, 0.05-level tests unless
      otherwise specified (notably the Holm testing approach will be used for the five primary
      hypotheses in Specific Aims 1-4). The primary analyses will be an unadjusted intent-to-treat
      analyses, using a t-test for differences in weight change from baseline to 18 months, as
      measured by the in-person weight, between each intervention group and the control group, and
      the combined compared to each single intervention, applying the Holm p-value correction for
      multiple comparisons testing procedure. If weight change appears to be non-normally
      distributed in the blinded data, we will find an appropriate transformation or use the
      non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Missing data will be handled as described above.

      Weight change between baseline and 18 months, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), will be
      estimated for comparison with adjusted analyses. We will estimate regression models adjusted
      for the stratification variables (sex, employer, initial BMI) and other participant
      characteristics factors including race, income, and education. We will evaluate the evidence
      of confounding using change in estimate criterion. We will fit exploratory models of the
      repeated weight measurements that incorporate time as a polynomial function or using
      visit-specific indicator variables to determine the most parsimonious model that adequately
      describes the observed patterns. Models will be built separately for the in-person and at
      home weight data. We will investigate random-effects models that allow for baseline
      individual variability as well as variability in the changes in weights over time; an example
      is the following: E(weightij) = 0 +1Timej + 2Groupi+ 3Xi + b0i + b1i Timej, where i indicates
      subject, j indicates assessment times, the parameters are fixed effects linking time, a
      treatment group vector, and a vector of other demographic or clinical covariates Xi to the
      outcomes, and b0i and b1i are random intercept and slope effects. Tests for significance of
      random effects will use likelihood ratio tests for nested models; we will compare models with
      different random effects structures using the maximized log-likelihoods and the Akaike
      Information Criterion (AIC). We will apply standard diagnostic techniques to assess model
      adequacy. We will use treatment by time interactions to assess whether the rate of change in
      weight differs by intervention arm. We hypothesize that incentives may be more effective
      among lower income individuals and will evaluate this using interaction terms of income with
      treatment group. We will explore differential effects by race and education and baseline
      levels of intrinsic motivation and stages of change. We will also consider other potential
      mediators, such as the home food and activity environment. To assess the sensitivity of
      treatment effect estimates to missing data, we will fit hierarchical or mixed effects models
      with and without accounting for informative missing data.

      For Specific Aim 5, we will assess the costs of each of the intervention arms from both the
      employer and social perspective and compare the cost differences between each arm relative to
      the effectiveness measured by incremental weight loss achieved. The principal incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios between intervention and control arms will be from the employer's
      perspective and we will compare costs during the intervention from baseline to 18 months per
      unit change in weight. Secondary analyses will 1) evaluate this same ratio but use either 6
      months post- intervention data (24 month visit) or 12 months of intervention data (12 month
      visit) and 2) evaluate these 2 ratios using a limited social perspective. Cost models will
      use a generalized linear model with a log link and gamma family. Missing data strategies will
      parallel those described above. We will assess sampling uncertainty for the comparison of
      costs and effects by calculating parametric 95% CIs for the cost per kg lost and
      acceptability curves. Standard errors and correlation of the difference in cost and effect
      will be derived using a bootstrap procedure.

      11.2 Power and Sample Size Considerations We have designed the study with adequate power to
      detect differences in weight loss over an 18-month period. Our intervention should achieve
      its maximal impact in maintaining initial weight loss at the end of Phase II (month 18), when
      the incentive payments cease. To maintain the experiment-wide Type I error and guard against
      false conclusions of effectiveness, we will use the Holm multiple comparisons adjustment for
      test the 5 primary comparisons in Specific Aims 1-4 . If the interventions are as effective
      as hypothesized, the proposed sample size maintains greater than 90% power to show
      significance for each of the three intervention arms compared to control and greater than 80%
      power to show significance for the combined intervention group compared to each of the two
      interventions alone.

      We plan to recruit approximately one third of the 328 participants required for the start of
      Phase I from each of our participating employers (IBC, SEPTA, and City of Philadelphia).
      Given the large number of potentially eligible employees, we can, if needed, easily increase
      the proportion of participants from any of these employers to meet recruitment targets. The
      328 participants will be randomized to our 3 intervention groups and the control group using
      a 1:1 ratio for the intervention arms. We have built in a margin of 20% for potential
      attrition before the 18-month assessment, resulting in 260 participants (65 per arm) who are
      available for analysis at the end of Phase II. This will provide us with greater than 90%
      power to detect a difference in weight change between baseline and the 18-month weigh-in of 5
      kg between each single intervention group and the control group (primary outcomes for
      Specific Aims 1-3) and 87% power to detect a 3 kg difference between the combined group and
      either the incentive or environmental strategies groups (Specific Aim 4). Namely, we will
      have greater than 85% power for the 5 primary comparisons of interest for an expected weight
      change between months 0-18 of -8 kg, -5 kg and 0 kg in the combined, intervention and control
      groups, respectively (a net difference between single intervention and control groups of 5
      kg, combined intervention and control groups of 8 kg, and 3kg between the single
      interventions and combined group) and assuming a standard deviation (S.D.) of weight loss of
      5 kg. We will also have greater than 80% power to detect a difference of 4.6 kg in weight
      change between single intervention and control groups and 7.3 kg between the combined and
      control groups (primary outcomes for Specific Aims 1-3), while maintaining approximately 80%
      power for a 2.7 kg difference between the combined and each single intervention (Specific Aim
      4).

      For our secondary outcomes (Specific Aim 5), we wish to compare the cost differences between
      each arm relative to the effectiveness measured by incremental weight loss achieved. We will
      calculate a point estimate of cost per kg of weight loss based on estimated inter-arm
      differences in weight loss and the incremental cost of the interventions, as described in
      C.3.d.ii.c. For weight loss at 18 months, given an expected incremental cost of $810
      (incentives) and incremental weight loss of 5 kg, 328 participants provide 80% power to
      detect a cost per kg lost of $430 and greater than 90% power to detect a cost per kg lost of
      $575. This study is primarily a test of the efficacy of these interventions. Due to resource
      constraints and because we do not yet know about intervention effectiveness, we did not power
      this study based on cost effectiveness analyses. Estimated detectable costs per kg are a
      function of wide confidence intervals due to sample size.

      11.3 Measurement of effect: The goal of this analysis will be to assess relative weight loss
      in the intervention arms relative to control. For the principal cost-effectiveness analysis,
      measurement of incremental weight loss will be based on differences in weight between
      baseline and the 18 month visit; in secondary analyses it will be based on weight differences
      between baseline and 24 months and baseline and 12 months
