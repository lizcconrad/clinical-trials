  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actually, there are several laximeters for measuring anterior tibial translational in case of
      anterior cruciate ligament rupture. The most commonly used are telos, KT-1000, GnrB and
      Rolimeter. Results of these instrumented tests, which expressed in differential (millimeters
      values), have a bad correlation between them and so are not comparable in current literature.
      The aim of this study was to compare results of these tests and establish a ratio (pathologic
      knee laxity/ healthy knee laxity) to reduce differences between each instrumented test.
