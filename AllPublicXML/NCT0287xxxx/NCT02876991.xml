  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate if sodium fluoride PET in patients having already undergone a
      choline PET negative for bone extension (non-metastatic status) modifies the status of
      patients concerning the existence or not of bone metastases.

      Secondary purposes are:

        -  To evaluate if detection of bone metastasis by sodium fluoride PET, not detected by
           choline PET, leads to change of treatment

        -  To evaluate inter-technique concordance (choline vs sodium fluoride PET) of results
           (metastatic status and number of lesions)

        -  To evaluate the inter-judge concordance of interpretation of sodium fluoride PET

        -  To study the discordance of metastatic status of 2 techniques.

    <description>Sodium fluoride Pet is realized maximum after 4 weeks from choline PET (inclusion).
Injection of 4MBq 18F-FNa/kg of body weight is followed after 60 min (± 5 min) by acquisition of images on Biograph 6 PET/CT scanner (SIEMENS).
Data from sodium fluoride PET are interpreted independently and blind from other data by 3 medical doctors (2 at hospital of Nancy and 1 at hospital of Strasbourg) (for inter-judge reproducibility); a second interpretation of data is consensually realized by 2 of 3 readers, limited to discordant analyses (metastatic status or not, and/or number of lesions); results from this second interpretation are final results.</description>
