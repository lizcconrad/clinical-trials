  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare the administration of 2 cycles of paclitaxel and cisplatin (DP)
      versus 4 cycles of CEF as adjuvant chemotherapy for the patients with locally advanced breast
      cancer and who were pathological partial response to DP as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Those
      who had pathological complete response to DP will be randomized to have 2 cycles of DP or
      have no further chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had pathological complete response
      (pCR) or partial response to DP will enrolled in this trial. Those who had pCR will randmized
      to have two cycles of DP as adjuvant chemotherapy or have no further chemotherapy. Those
      patients who had PR will be randomized to have two cycles of DP or four cycles of CEF. All
      the patients with hormonal receptor positive or Her2 overexpress tumors are allowed to accept
      endocrine therapy or anti-Her2 target therapy.
