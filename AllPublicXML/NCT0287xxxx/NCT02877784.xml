  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare myopathic disease that results in
      progressive degeneration of the oral and pharyngeal muscular, resulting in severe dysphagia
      and dysarthria. OPMD is considered a rare disease; therefore, limited research is available
      on the natural progression of the disease or the utility of biomarkers to identify swallowing
      impairment. The aim of this study is:

        1. To identify accurate, reliable and non-invasive clinical markers of swallowing
           impairment

        2. To determine the discriminate ability of these markers to identify impairments in
           swallow safety and swallowing efficiency.

      Participants will be recruited from the Neurology clinic at the University of Florida. The
      single evaluation will occur in the PIs research laboratory at the University of Florida,
      Gainesville, Florida.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinematic Swallowing Measurements will be used to analyze a normal movement of swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Kinematic swallowing measurements is an objective analysis of videofluoroscopy. This involves capturing and manipulating digital images with computer technology to make exact timing measures of bolus flow and movement of structures, as well as spatial measurements of distance and area against reference points.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The IOPI will be used to measure Lingual strength and endurance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument device will measure the peak performance of lingual strength a via the action of a bulb placed on the hard palate. To assess maximum anterior isometric pressure, the bulb will be placed on the roof of the mouth and the participant will raise his or her tongue to apply pressure to this bulb and then quickly release the tongue back into a neutral position. This repetitive tongue movement will be performed three times and values will be recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The nebulizer with cough protocol will be used to measure reflexive cough</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Reflexive cough will be assessed using an oral pneumotachograph, differential pressure transducer, and have a side port with a one-way inspiratory valve for nebulizer connection. The nebulizer will deliver three randomized blocks of 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 μM capsaicin.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R includes 12 questions. Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. Individual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst and 48=best.</description>

    <description>SWAL-QOL is a standardized psychometric scale measuring swallow-related QOL and containing 44-items relating to swallowing specific quality of life measured across 10 domains. Individual domain scores and a total SWAL-QOL score will be derived. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 representing no impairment (the most favorable state)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake as confirmed by Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>FOIS is a validated 7-point scale indexing an individual's ability to intake food on a day-to-day basis.
TUBE DEPENDENT (levels 1-3) No oral intake Tube dependent with minimal/inconsistent oral intake Tube supplements with consistent oral intake TOTAL ORAL INTAKE (levels 4-7) Total oral intake of a single consistency Total oral intake of multiple consistencies requiring special preparation Total oral intake with no special preparation, but must avoid specific foods or liquid items Total oral intake with no restrictions</description>

    <measure>Participant perception of swallowing related symptoms as confirmed by The Eating Assessment Tool 10 (EAT-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EAT-10 is a 10-item validated self-administered dysphagia severity symptom survey. Score is 0 - 40 with 0 being the best possible score and 40 the worst possible score.</description>

    <measure>Participant perception of communication abilities as confirmed by Communication Effectiveness Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of self-rated communication abilities across a variety of settings as perceived by the patients and/or their caregivers will be measured using the 8-point Communication Effectiveness Survey (CES)</description>

In addition, the patient will complete the following surveys: Swallowing Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (SWAL-QOL), Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), The Center for Neurologic Studies Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS), and the Communicative Effectiveness Survey (CES).</description>
