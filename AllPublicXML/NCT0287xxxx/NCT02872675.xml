  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the role of prebiotic supplementation in adults with and
      without Asthma/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (A/EIB). All participants will be asked
      to consume a prebiotic supplement, and a placebo, each for a total duration of four weeks,
      separated by a two-week wash out period. The investigators hypothesise that improvements in
      pulmonary function observed in adults with Asthma following prebiotic supplementation. We
      hypothesise that improvements in pulmonary function will be attributed, at least in part, to
      gut microbiota mediated improvements in human immune function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will investigate the effects of prebiotic supplementation on airway
      inflammation/bronchoconstriction in adults diagnosed with Asthma/Exercise-Induced
      Bronchoconstriction (A/EIB). Previous research conducted in adults diagnosed with A/EIB has
      reported significant improvements in pulmonary function following three weeks of prebiotic
      supplementation. The significant improvements in pulmonary function were attributed to an
      attenuation of various markers of airway inflammation, potentially regulated by gut
      microbiota mediated improvements in systemic immune function.

      Prebiotics are a type of non-digestible carbohydrate/dietary fibre that can only be digested
      by certain beneficial bacteria. During the fermentation of prebiotics, beneficial bacteria
      produce energy/metabolites that can be used to support a variety of human immune functions,
      such as reducing the level of airway inflammation that occurs following exposure to relevant
      triggers (e.g. exercise).

      Imbalances and/or deficiencies in gut bacterial composition/metabolic activity have been
      identified in children/adults diagnosed asthma. However, the potential mechanisms behind
      prebiotic mediated improvements in the severity of asthma have yet to be investigated.

      Participants with and without A/EIB will be allocated two separate nutritional supplements
      following a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. During the first phase of the
      nutritional intervention, participants will consume the first supplement (either prebiotic or
      placebo), for a total duration of four weeks. A two-week wash out period will then be
      completed before the remaining nutritional supplement is administered for an equal duration.

      Analyses of key human/bacterial metabolite concentrations will be carried out alongside
      assessments of immune and pulmonary function, and intestinal permeability at baseline, and
      throughout all phases of the nutritional intervention. Current understandings of the role of
      the gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of A/EIB will be expanded through the investigation of
      novel pathophysiological mechanisms, helping to inform future therapeutic prospects for
      asthma.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be administered a prebiotic (galactooligosaccharide; HOST-DM059), and a taste/appearance matched placebo (Maltodextrin) in a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design.
The nutritional intervention will be completed over a twelve week period, consisting of two, four-week supplementation phases separated by a four-week wash out period. Participants will be randomly allocated one of the nutritional supplements during phase one (labelled as either 'L', or 'X'), and asked to consume one powdered sachet every morning (3.6g). Participants will then complete a four week wash out period, before being assigned the remaining nutritional supplement during phase two. Sachets can be reconstituted in tea/coffee/fruit juice, or sprinkled over cereal etc.</intervention_model_description>

Upon trial completion (e.g. the final visit of the final participant), the chief investigator will contact HOST Therabiomics to obtain information on the supplement blinding protocol. Should any participants, care providers, investigators, or outcome assessors become aware of the blinding protocol during the trial they will be informed not to disclose this information to any other relevant personnel. Participants who become aware of the blinding protocol during participation would be withdrawn from the trial.</masking_description>

    <description>HOST-DM059 is the only Second Generation Prebiotic, manufactured by Clasado Biosciences/HOST Therabiomics. HOST-DM059 consists of a specific type of carbohydrate/dietary fibre (GOS), and an enzyme extracted from species of Bifidobacteria (e.g. The β-Galacotosidase Enzyme, &amp; Bifidobacterium Bifidum). The enzyme from which HOST-DM059 is developed provides a highly selective source of energy for certain species of Bifidobacteria. HOST-DM059 encourages the growth and development of Bifidobacteria. Certain species of Bifidobacteria have been demonstrated to exert prominent immunomodulatory effects in terms of regulating systemic inflammation.</description>
