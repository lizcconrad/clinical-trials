  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the distinct challenges faced by emerging adults with HIV is the transition of their
      care from their long-term pediatric HIV provider to treatment within an adult HIV program.
      The consequences of an unsuccessful transition can range from difficult to catastrophic. The
      Adolescent to Adult Patient-centered HIV Transition (ADAPT) Study is a randomized trial of
      innovative interventions targeting gaps in care that are major drivers of loss in the ART
      continuum of care cascade among adolescents and increasing missed opportunities to engage
      adolescents into care. The specific aims of ADAPT are: 1. To inform strategies for transition
      services in resource-limited settings; 2. To examine the developmental, clinical, and other
      factors that predict a successful transition; and, 3. To gain fundamental insight on
      implementation barriers among African adolescents through the application of the ego-network
      defined social support that will inform targets for structured intervention. ADAPT will be
      conducted in central, southern, and northern Nigeria at selected PEPFAR sites supported by
      the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria. To address Aim 1 the investigators will conduct six
      focus groups including: Adolescent patients, parents and health care providers. To address
      aim 2, the investigators will conduct a cluster randomized clinical trial. The two
      interventions are based on prior evidence-informed engagement strategies: 1) educational
      interventions and 2) interventions that use a peer transition advocate who prepares the
      adolescent and their parents for transition. The investigators will enroll 300 patients (150
      patients in each arm). The sites will be randomized to an intervention. The primary outcome
      will be successful transition, keeping two follow-up appointments within a nine months period
      following transition. Secondary outcomes, as recommended by focus group participants will
      also be measured. To examine the potential role of social network components and
      characteristics of both egos and alters on primary outcomes, a Generalized Estimating
      Equation (GEE) approach will be used to explore the associations between primary outcomes and
      factors at the ego, alter, and network levels. The finding from this study will guide
      institution of best practices for transitioning adolescents in Nigeria and other countries
      lower and middle income countries with similar challenges and potential for high impact.

    <description>The PTAs will be present during patient clinic appointments to mentor and support participants in the development of independent health care behaviors. They will engage patients in role-plays to simulate appointments in adult practices. The PTAs will accompany patients during the transition process to the adult providers, to inform, support, and facilitate their successful transition to adult care. PTA duties, performed in the clinic and in the community, will include psychosocial support; facilitation of disclosure; adherence counseling, monitoring, and support; screening of patients for significant signs of illness and referral for care; and tracking and defaulter tracing of patients. PTA will support counseling and testing services for adolescents within the facilities. For those perinatally-infected, important care and support services include disclosure and stigma issues.</description>

    <ipd_description>The data collected under this proposed study will be securely stored at the IHV-Nigeria Central Data Management Center. The final dataset will include demographic and behavioral data, clinical data from treatment and follow up and laboratory data. The samples and data will be available for international collaborators to share after a time decided by the study implementation committee which allows sufficient time for the investigators on the study to address specific study questions. Requests for data will be reviewed by the ethics committee. The investigators will make the data and associated documentation available to users only under a data‐sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
