      My Care My Call (MCMC) is an innovative, peer-led telephone intervention designed to empower
      adults with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) in the self-management of their primary health
      care needs to prevent secondary conditions. In a randomized controlled trial, participants
      assigned to the MCMC intervention receive tapered calls from a Peer Health Coach (PHC) for
      six months. PHCs are experienced, empathetic peer mentors living with SCI who act as
      supporters, role models, and advisors, providing goal-setting support, motivation, education,
      and resource referral to participants. Participants complete surveys at baseline, 2, 4, and
      6-months, as well as qualitative exit phone interviews.

      It is hypothesized that MCMC will: 1) Increase participants' self-advocacy in health care
      interactions as reflected in increases in three domains of self-advocacy: assertiveness,
      illness education, and potential for mindful non-adherence, 2) Increase participants'
      self-efficacy for health care navigation, preference for involvement in, and satisfaction
      with their primary care physician (PCP), and 3) Increase health related quality of life and
      medical social support compared with those receiving usual care. Additional secondary
      hypotheses state that the MCMC intervention will increase access to primary care and use of
      preventive screening services compared with those receiving usual care.
