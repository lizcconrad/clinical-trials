      The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a tailored smoking cessation intervention
      targeted type 2 diabetic patients who smoke (DM intervention). The objectives are:

        1. to study the effectiveness of the DM intervention in achieving (a) smoking cessation,
           (b) smoking reduction, and (c) progress to a higher stage of readiness to quit;

        2. the changes in levels of HbA1c between (a) the intervention group and the controls, and
           (b) quitters and continuing smokers;

        3. the predictive factors for the success of the outcomes above.

      Preventing multiple high-risk behaviors is an important focus in diabetes treatment. The
      investigators found that cigarette smoking is a leading avoidable cause of death which kills
      about 6,000 people annually, accounting for one of every five deaths in Hong Kong. The
      smoking prevalence among males with diabetes (27.0%) is slightly higher than that of the
      general male population (24.5%) in 2006. Smoking has long been known to worsen the prognosis
      of diabetic patients in increasing the risks of macro- and micro-vascular complications and
      there is also evidence that smoking increases insulin resistance, worsens diabetes control
      [5] and may even induce the disease. Smoking cessation should be a natural choice for smoking
      diabetic patients as it can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality.

      Smoking is an addictive behavior and quitting is very difficult with high chance of relapse.
      Only a small percentage of smokers can quit without professional help. The stage-matched
      smoking cessation intervention is a commonly used approach. Current diabetic treatments are
      mostly focused on glucose-oriented care strategies, and specialized smoking cessation
      counseling and support are rarely incorporated in routine practice of diabetes care. This may
      be due to the already tight schedule of diabetic treatments and health care providers often
      find it difficult to provide additional smoking cessation intervention to their patients.
      Furthermore, smokers who have diabetes are more likely to be in the pre-contemplation stage
      for quitting and they seem to have less interest in their health. Many smokers who are not
      prepared to quit may reject smoking cessation intervention, hence approaches that
      highlighting the relevance and salience of health information by making it personally
      relevant (tailored) and addressing the specific characteristics of diabetic patients
      (targeted) to promote cessation are needed. The investigators propose a stage-matched smoking
      cessation intervention by increasing the relevance of health information with respect to
      readiness to change of the individual and addressing the relationship between smoking and
      diabetic complications and HbA1c level to increase the relevance to all diabetic patients. It
      is hypothesized that diabetic patients would be more likely to make change in smoking
      behavior, if health risks of diabetic complications and a likelihood of an increase in HbA1c
      level were addressed simultaneously.

      The study will consist of 2 phases, Phase I is a qualitative study with focus group
      interviews and Phase II is a randomized controlled trial. In Phase I, current smoking and
      ex-smoking patients with diabetes will be recruited in the DM clinics of nine hospitals by
      purposive sampling for focus group interviews. Smoking diabetic patients will be recruited
      for modifying and piloting of the survey instruments to be used in Phase II. In Phase II,
      research assistants will determine the eligibility of patients in the clinics with the
      following inclusion criteria: (1) smokes at least 2 cigarettes daily in the past 30 days, (2)
      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months such that their diabetic conditions and
      treatments should be stable, (3) age 18 or above, and (4) can communicate in Cantonese; and
      the exclusion criteria: (1) too sick to receive intervention, (2) poor cognitive state
      (People with poor cognitive state refers to those with poor cognitive function and unable to
      communicate logically), (3) mental illness, (4) is undergoing other smoking cessation
      program, and (5) with unstable diabetic (i.e. those with poor diabetes condition that needed
      hospitalization) or other medical conditions deemed to be not suitable by the doctor in
      charge. After obtained written informed consent on-site, the subjects will be randomly
      allocated either to the tailored and targeted smoking cessation intervention (DM) group, or
      the control group.

      Randomization will be done within each clinic. For each clinic, our trained counselors will
      contact the consented subjects and administer the baseline questionnaire. The subject will
      then be randomly allocated either into the intervention group or the control group. Based on
      a block randomization design, the investigators shall generate a list of computer-based
      random number using SAS® software for each hospital to allocate consented patients into
      intervention or control group. Instead of distributing the random number list to the
      counsellors directly, counsellors have to open a serially-numbered sealed-opaque envelop to
      ensure allocation concealment. Counsellors will guide patients to complete the baseline
      questionnaire before they open the sealed envelope and assign patients into the intervention
      or control group. The envelope will contain an instruction sheet that specifies one of the
      two groups. All the participants will complete the measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide
      (CO) level at the site.

      Analysis Data The qualitative data will be analyzed by using NVivo software for coding. The
      quantitative data will be analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Science. The
      baseline characteristics of the two groups will be compared by Chi-square test. The
      effectiveness in helping smoking patients to quit of the DM intervention to the Control group
      will be evaluated by comparing the percentages of participants with the outcomes in each
      group using chi-square tests on an intention-to-treat analysis. Independent t-tests will be
      used to compare the changes in HbA1c levels of the intervention group to the control.
      Multiple regression and multiple logistic regressions will be used to calculate the adjusted
      odds ratios for quitting: stage of readiness and reduction in cigarette consumption; and
      change in other health-related lifestyle practices; between the intervention and the control
      groups as well as between quitters and non-quitters. For stopping rule, futility test will be
      performed. It indicates the cessation of the clinical trial as soon as it becomes clear that
      a negative outcome (Control better than intervention) or equivalence between treatments is
      very likely.

    <description>Subjects will receive a patient-centered motivational intervention with two components: (1) the stage-matched smoking cessation intervention and (2) the relationship between smoking and diabetic complications. All subjects will receive a self-help cessation manual with DM components and take the exhaled carbon monoxide test. The total counseling process will take about 20 minutes. Three consecutive (3-, 6- and 12-month) follow ups will be conducted. Also, the counselor will further the progress of their action plan and barriers encountered in the behavioral change process as well as engage them in the process, enhance their self-efficacy, and identify individual barriers and facilitators.</description>
