  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This is a randomized, double-blind trial.
      Subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a day for
      a total of 12 weeks, another group (n = 20) with the same dose of placebo, and the other
      group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement. We assess whether Natureheme-iron can promote
      iron absorption and antioxidant effects, and compare the effects with commercial iron
      supplement. When this study is completed, it will increase the value of Natureheme-iron, and
      can improve health of Taiwanese.

      FAO / WHO noted that iron deficiency is still an important nutritional problem. Iron
      deficiency problem has always been in Taiwan. This study intends to use the products,
      Natureheme-iron, using blood of pig to concentration, separation and extracted, and then got
      natural and clean Natureheme-iron. Natureheme-iron is not just a good iron supplement, while
      also providing an excellent source of natural protein. This is a randomized, double-blind
      trial, subjects separate to 3 groups, one group (n = 20) take two Natureheme-iron capsules a
      day for a total of 12 weeks (1000mg Fe / capsule), another group (n = 20) with the same dose
      of placebo, and the other group (n = 20) is a commercial iron supplement (100mg Fe). We
      assess whether Natureheme-iron can promote iron absorption and antioxidant effects, and
      compare the effects with commercial iron supplement. When this study is completed, it will
      increase the value of Natureheme-iron, and can improve health of Taiwanese.

    <description>An 12 week double-blinded randomized parallel study with 4 week follow-up period was performed in mild anemia subjects. Consenting eligible subjects were receive 2 capsules per day containing either 1000 mg Fe of similar appearance for 12 weeks. The subjects were required to visit at baseline, every 6 weeks during the intervention period (6 weeks), and at follow-up 4 weeks after treatment had ended. During each study visit, fasting blood samples were collected and anthropometric measurements were performed. Compliance was evaluated using a food diary and monitored with biweekly telephone calls.</description>
