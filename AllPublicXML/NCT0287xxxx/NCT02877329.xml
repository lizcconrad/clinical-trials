      for persons with hearing loss and comorbid psychological distress

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hearing loss is the most common sensory disability in the world. Hearing loss is an auditory
      disability which affects not only speech recognition, but also the ability to recognize,
      locate and identify sounds in one's environment. Today there are a variety of studies
      investigating the relationship between hearing loss and mental health. For example, there are
      studies showing that hearing loss can lead to depression, somatization, social isolation,
      worrying or anxiety, loneliness, smaller social networks, lower self-efficacy, sensitivity to
      stress, burnout, and impaired sleep quality and quality of life in comparison with people
      with normal hearing. Initial results from other studies indicate that acceptance may be of
      importance, as it in turn can lead to increased help-seeking.To avoid prolonged stress and a
      healthy self-efficacy could contribute to greater well-being of people with hearing loss.
      This is the first study to use ACT to improve psychological health in people with hearing
      loss through the process of psychological flexibility. The treatment is eight weeks long and
      internet delivered through self-help texts with weekly therapist support.
