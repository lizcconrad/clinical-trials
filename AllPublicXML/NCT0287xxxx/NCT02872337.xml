    <time_frame>Through Study Completion, an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>This included a review of the hospital database for hospital discharge time. At this institution PT discharge is defined as the ability to (1) independently transfer, (2) independently ambulate approximately 150 feet and (3) independently negotiate stairs (4) independent with home exercise program and activities of daily living.
All of this data was recorded from hospital records</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>from two weeks prior to surgery until 6 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction was measured by a series of patient administered questionnaires at various stages of the study. All satisfaction questions, with the exception of the utilization of the microsites [Yes/No], were asked via a visual analogue scale to disagree or agree with given statements [0-5, where 0 was strongly disagree, 3 was neutral and 5 was strongly agree]. Patients unable to complete any forms at the time of the appointment completed the form over the phone with a co-investigator.</description>
