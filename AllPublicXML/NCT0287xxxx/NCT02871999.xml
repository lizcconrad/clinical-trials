      Clinical trial on acupuncture adjuvant treatment in the pain after the surgery of
      gastrointestinal carcinoma. Gastrointestinal cancer patients are diagnosed by pathology or
      cell biology. Patients are randomized into 2 groups: The control group receive normal
      treatment only, the experimental group receive acupuncture therapy besides normal treatment.
      Clinical evaluation is based on the observation of the pain degree and life quality
      improvement. Blood biochemistry tests mainly include Prostaglandin
      E2(PGE2),5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), histamine(HIS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
      dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), adrenaline, nor-adrenaline, tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF)-Î±, cell flow cytometry on Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg cytokines as well as serum
      cortisol, estradiol (female), progesterone (female), testosterone (male) etc.
