    <textblock>
      The nasotracheal intubation is preferred for oral surgery; it provides an easier view of the
      surgical field. However, nasotracheal tubes are produced by foreign countries. Tubes are
      often not fitted in anatomy of Korean people because of small nostril. When the size of the
      tube is chosen by nostril size, the length of nasotracheal tube is not appropriate to the
      glottis. The aim of this study is to evaluate on the proper size of the nasotracheal tube and
      depth in nasotracheal intubation in Korean. Forty patients (20 males and 20 females) who are
      scheduled for nasal intubation for general anesthesia will be enrolled. The primary outcome
      is the proportion of patients who are in inappropriate insertion of nasotracheal tube; the
      proximal end of tube's cuff is less than 2 cm below vocal cord. The size of nostril, length
      from the nare to the carina and vocal cord are measured.
