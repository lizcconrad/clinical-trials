  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SCI Virtual Coach study has developed an on-screen, human-like character that will
      provide support, education and coaching to adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) to aid in the
      prevention of serious secondary conditions like pressure ulcers. In a randomized controlled
      trial, participants assigned to &quot;the Coach&quot; intervention will have a touch-screen computer
      placed in their homes and be asked to interact with the Coach on a daily basis for 2 months.
      Participants will be asked to complete surveys at baseline and 2 months.

      The SCI Virtual Coach study aims to measure how accessible and usable participants feel the
      Coach is, as well as participants' adherence to the Coach's instructions. It will also gauge
      how effective the Coach is in changing self-care knowledge, health care behaviors,
      self-efficacy for self-care, and perception of social support in participants.
