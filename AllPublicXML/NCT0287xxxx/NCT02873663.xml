      The investigators will test the validity of biomarkers for the detection of heavy alcohol use
      in patients with and without liver disease.

      The investigators will test the validity of carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT)(using
      capillary zone electrophoresis) in blood and ethyl glucuronide (EtG)(using Liquid
      Chromatography-MS-MS) in hair in patients with heavy alcohol use, moderate alcohol use and
      patients who do not drink alcohol.

    <measure>level of disialotransferrin in blood (expressed as percentage di-sialotransferrin) and ethyl glucuronide (expressed in pg/mg) in hair</measure>
    <time_frame>single determination at inclusion (both on the same day, when patient is seen at the outpatient clinic or when admitted to the hospital) without follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Blood and hair will be collected at one single time-point (procedure of blood and hair sampling takes 30 min) to measure serum CDT and hair ethylglucuronide levels (markers of alcohol use in the prior time period) when the patient presents itself at the hospital, without further follow-up.</description>

    <description>Blood and hair will be collected at one single time-point (procedure of blood and hair sampling takes 30 min) to measure serum CDT and hair ethylglucuronide levels (markers of alcohol use in the prior time period) when the patient presents itself at the hospital, without further follow-up. Liver and kidney parameters are analyzed in the blood in the context of standard care.</description>
