      This is a phase 2 dose-finding study evaluating initially the efficacy and safety of
      alprostadil liposomes for injection in the treatment of atherosclerotic occlusive disease of
      the lower extremities at different dose strengths.The total duration of subject participation
      will be approximately 5 weeks,consisting of a 2-week run-in period,3-week treatment and
      safety follow-up period.

      Subjects will sign the informed consent form(ICF) at a screening visit and will be assigned a
      subject identifier.Subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria and who have
      successfully completed all protocol procedures at screening will enter the 2-week
      run-in.Following the 2-week run-in period,eligible subjects will be randomized(1:1:1:1) to
      one of the following double-blind treatment groups:

      Group A : Alprostadil Liposomes for Injection at low dose:20ug,once a day(QD); Group B :
      Alprostadil Liposomes for Injection at medium dose:40ug,QD Group C : Alprostadil Liposomes
      for Injection at high dose:60ug,QD Group D(Positive Control Group) : Alprostadil
      Injection:10ug,QD All treatments will be delivered by intravenously guttae.A subject will be
      consider to have completed the study when they have completed all phase of the study
      including run-in,randomization,the randomized treatment and efficacy and safety follow-up
      phase.
