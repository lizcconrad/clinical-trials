  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether amnion membrane grafts are more effective
      than another tissue engineered skin substitute, when used to treat diabetic foot ulcers
      (DFUs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects at least 9% of the population, or approximately 29 million people in the
      United States. Lower extremity ulcers are a serious complication for people with diabetes.
      Diabetic foot-related problems are the most frequent cause of hospitalization within this
      group and it is estimated that the total cost for treatment ranges from $10,000 to nearly
      $60,000 depending on ulcer severity and clinical outcomes. While many diabetic foot ulcers
      are superficial and can heal with conservative treatment, many are more severe and
      recalcitrant to standard of care (SOC). About a quarter of individuals with diabetes will
      develop a chronic non-healing ulcer over their lifetime and nearly 60 of every 10,000
      individuals with diabetes will undergo a lower extremity amputation. Holzer and associates
      conducted a retrospective analysis of the costs for lower extremity ulcers in patients with
      diabetes and concluded that, given the high costs associated with treating these ulcers, the
      development of better treatment strategies is warranted. One such development in the
      treatment of chronic wounds is the use of amniotic membrane grafts. These materials have been
      used successfully for many years in the treatment of orthopedic, plastic/reconstructive, and
      urological applications. Initial studies have demonstrated the great success of amnionic
      membrane graft in the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers and it is believed that these
      grafts may be superior to older, more common skin substitutes.
