    <textblock>
      The REP 301 treatment protocol involved the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B /
      hepatitis D co-infection with two agents: REP 2139-Ca and pegylated interferon (peg-IFN). In
      this protocol, similar reduction/clearance of serum HBsAg and improved response to
      immunotherapy were observed in addition to clearance of serum HDV RNA. The REP 301 protocol
      was designed to include a 24 week follow-up period after treatment, however given the strong
      antiviral response against HBV and HDV infection in these patients, it is now important to
      extend the follow-up period in these patients to monitor over a longer period after treatment
      the safety and efficacy combined REP 2139-Ca / peg-IFN treatment in patients in the REP 301
      protocol.

      The REP 301-LTF is a long-term follow-up, non-blinded study of patients from the REP 301
      protocol. In this study, all eligible patients from the REP 301 protocol will have their
      followup evaluation extended for an additional 3 years, consisting of 6 visits scheduled
      every 6 months following the last follow-up visit scheduled in the REP 301 protocol. During
      each visit a physical examination and documentation of any symptoms, experiences will be
      conducted as well as blood tests for safety and virology as described below. This study will
      examine the long term safety effects in patients who have completed of treatment exposure in
      the REP 301 trial (REP 2139-Ca therapy for 30 weeks and PEG-IFN taken for 48 weeks with a 15
      week overlap in combination) and the duration of suppression of serum HBV and HDV viremia
      observed in the REP 301 protocol. This requires that subjects have completed antiviral
      treatment in the REP 301 protocol and are not immediately transitioned to further antiviral
      treatment unless necessary. The total duration of this study for each subject is 3 years.
