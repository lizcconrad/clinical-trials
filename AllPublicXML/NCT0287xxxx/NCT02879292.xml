    <textblock>
      Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal
      medical emergencies that occur during the first 2 months of life.

      Anesthetic induction and airway management of infants with HPS can be challenging because of
      the accumulation of significant volumes of gastric content, predisposing these patients to
      pulmonary aspiration during the induction of general anesthesia Despite the correction of
      systemic metabolic alkalosis, cerebrospinal fluid can remain alkalotic, and in this context
      hyperventilation and opioids may increase the risks of post-operative central apnea. All of
      the above anesthetics risks urged some anesthetists to alternatively use spinal anesthesia
      (SA) in infants undergoing pyloromyotomy.

      This anesthetic technique proved to be both safe and efficient in infants undergoing
      pyloromyotomy, in addition to decreasing the mentioned risks associated with the other
      techniques.

      This retrospective study will review the files of all infants with HPS, who were treated by
      open pyloromyotomy under SA in the Bnai Zion Medical Center between the years 2006 to 2015.
      It is designed to evaluate the postoperative full enteral feeding time, pain management and
      the incidence of post-operative apnea, the incidence of substantial vomiting episodes and
      other spinal anesthesia complications as secondary outcomes in infants undergoing
      pyloromyotomy under spinal anesthesia.
