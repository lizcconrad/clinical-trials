  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this protocol is to adapt and pilot test an existing lifestyle modification
      intervention for weight loss for women with overweight or obesity who have had a recent false
      positive mammography screen. The purpose of this pilot trial is to establish feasibility of
      Connect Online to Engage Change Tool (CONECT) to promote weight loss through increased
      physical activity and diet change.
