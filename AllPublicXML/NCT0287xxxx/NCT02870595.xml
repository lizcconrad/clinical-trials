      The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive 1% lidocaine injections for digit
      blocks of the finger will experience less pain when the injection is accompanied by the use
      of a micro-vibratory stimulator (MVS) compared with patients who receive injections without
      the MVS.

      Research Question/Hypothesis

      The investigators hypothesize that patients who receive 1% lidocaine injections for digit
      blocks of the finger will experience less pain when the injection is accompanied by the use
      of a micro-vibratory stimulator (MVS) compared with patients who receive injections without
      the MVS.

      Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the pain rating scale from an exposure
      group (digit block injection with the aid MVS) and the control group (traditional injection).

    <description>Informed consent will be obtained from patients undergoing finger local anesthesia digit blocks. Subjects will be randomly assigned (using GraphPAD Randomization Software Tool) to receive the first of their two digit block injections with either the traditional technique (control) or while using the DVICS/ Microvibratory Stimulator. All injections will utilize a 27-gauge needle. The subjects will be given a standard dose of 2mls of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine delivered over 30 seconds. Injections will be timed and performed by a single clinician to avoid large variations in technique and expertise.</description>

    <description>In the sham comparator, the device will be placed on the skin, but not turned on. Digit block anesthesia will progress in usual fashion as with active comparator, except without the vibratory device engaged.</description>
