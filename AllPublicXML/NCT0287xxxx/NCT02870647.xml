  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, international, non-randomized, multicentre, clinical investigation (phase IV).
      The aim of the study is to investigate the correlation between HF, severe SBD, and AF in
      CRT-P patients at 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to estimate the change in severity of Sleep Breathing Disorders
      (SBD) in patients with or without reverse remodeling, in de-novo or upgrade implants, after 6
      month follow-up.

      The main secondary objective is to assess the prevalence, type and evolution of the SBD,
      co-morbidities and major adverse cardiac events in each subgroup of HF patients (based on the
      etiology), up to 12 months follow-up period.

      Predictors of the clinical outcomes will be investigated.
