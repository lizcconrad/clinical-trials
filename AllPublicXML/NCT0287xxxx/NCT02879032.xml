  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise treadmill test (ETT) is frequently done, inexpensive, relatively safe investigation
      for diagnosis of ischemic heart disease and prediction of exercise capacity. Ischemic heart
      disease is increasing by leaps and bounds all over the world even in the developing countries
      like Bangladesh. The incidence rate of coronary artery disease (CAD) is not limited to male
      gender as previously seen. As a cause of industrialization and increased life expectancy,
      incidence of ischemic heart disease in females is escalating now in Bangladesh also. Though
      ETT is a well accepted investigation to diagnose CAD, it has a high false positive and false
      negative result if ST segment response alone is calculated for interpretation of the test.
      Duke Treadmill Test and Simple Treadmill Test are valid and well known scores which can
      predict coronary artery disease burden more efficiently than ST segment response alone.
      Computer generated Cleveland clinic score is another valid treadmill score which has a
      complex algorithm but effective way to predict 3 year and 5 year survivability. These three
      scores are well tested on western population but to our best knowledge there is little or no
      information regarding their predictability of CAD in Bangladesh. It's well known that ETT has
      a high false positive result in female population, so applying the scores may render ETT more
      efficient and abrogate unwanted risk of undergoing coronary angiography to diagnose CAD in
      females. In this study the investigator will try to find out the accuracy of commonly applied
      treadmill scores and ST segment response to diagnose CAD as well as accuracy of computer
      generated Cleveland Clinic Score will be tested. Total 110 people including male and female
      will be included according to inclusion and exclusion criteria and informed written consent
      will be taken. The patients who have undergone ETT and coronary angiogram with in six months
      for confirmation and identification of coronary artery disease in accordance with the
      recommendation of ACC guideline for CAG will be selected . All available data will be
      analyzed using SPSS. The accuracy of different scores will be calculated and compared with
      each other. According to currently available data from studies in western population the
      treadmill scores will have good predictability and will be efficient to abolish high false
      positive result in female population in Bangladesh.

    <description>Using angiographic evidence of CAD as the reference, area under the curve (AUC) of receive operator characteristic (ROC) plots will be determined for the ST response alone and for each treadmill score. The AUC for each treadmill score will be compared with the AUC of the ST response alone and the AUCs of the other treadmill scores. A significant difference is defined as a z-score &gt;1.96, with z-score = (AUC1 - AUC2) / (SE12 + SE22)-2. The predictive accuracies of the DTS, the Simple Treadmill Score and Cleveland Clinic Score to stratify patients into high or low likelihood for CAD will be calculated and compare. Test of agreement will be calculated using Kappa statistics. Statistically significant difference between predictive accuracies is defined as a p value &lt;0.05 using the two-tailed Fischer's exact test. Statistical analysis will be performed with the SPSS.</description>
