  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, safety, tolerability and
      efficacy trial of SAN007 (5% East Indian sandalwood oil in a cream formulation) treatment
      regimen when administered daily for up to 28 days to patients at least 18 years of age, with
      atopic dermatitis.

      Subjects will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent/ascent and photographic
      consent process has been completed. Subjects with a total body surface area (BSA) of ≥2% and
      ≤ 15% atopic dermatitis involvement, in the treatable areas, and who meet all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled.

      Once subject eligibility is confirmed and the screening procedures completed, the subject
      will start the Treatment Period of the study. All enrolled subjects will receive either 5%
      SAN007 cream or placebo cream (randomized in a 2:1 ratio) OR 10% SAN007 cream or placebo
      cream (randomized in a 2:1 ratio) with the first dose applied at Visit 1 Baseline. Subjects
      will be instructed on how to apply the study medication twice daily for 28 days. Subjects
      will return to the clinic on Study Days 7,14 and 28 for study-related assessments. Subjects
      will receive a telephone contact from the site, on Study Days 21 and 35.

      Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs) with respect to severity,
      duration, and relationship to study drug.

      In addition, cutaneous tolerability will be evaluated at each visit. Tolerability evaluation
      will be based on subjects reporting discomfort during or immediately following application of
      SAN007. This will also be recorded as an AE. The study exclusion areas are not to be included
      in this evaluation.

      Efficacy will be assessed at each study visit through the completion of the IGA, EASI and BSA
      calculation.

      During the active treatment period, subjects will return to the study site according to the
      study schedule for interim assessments and recording of concomitant medication and adverse
      events (AEs).
