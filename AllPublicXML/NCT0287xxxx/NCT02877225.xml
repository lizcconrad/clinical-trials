    <time_frame>Predose up to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 to the time of the last measurable (non-below quantification limit [non-BQL]) concentration, calculated by linear-linear trapezoidal summation.</description>

    <time_frame>Predose up to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC (0-infinity) is the area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to infinite time, calculated as the sum of AUC (0-last) and C (0-last)/lambda(z); wherein AUC (0-last) is area under the plasma concentration time curve from time zero to last quantifiable time, C(last) is the last observed quantifiable concentration, and lambda (z) is elimination rate constant.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Terminal Elimination Halflife (t1/2term)</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose up to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The elimination halflife (t1/2) is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by 1 half to its original concentration. It is associated with the terminal slope of the semi logarithmic drug concentration time curve and calculated as 0.693/apparent terminal elimination rate constant (λz).</description>
