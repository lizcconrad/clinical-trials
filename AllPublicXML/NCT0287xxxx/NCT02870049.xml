      The purpose of this study is to determine whether inreach and outreach strategies will be
      superior to usual care, and combination of both will be superior to either strategy alone.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening saves lives, but screening rates are low among underserved
      populations, particularly Latinos. The screening rate in the predominantly Latino population
      served by San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)), is
      just 31%, similar to that reported for Latinos nationally, but lower than the overall
      national average of 65%. Previous research has demonstrated that inreach interventions at
      point of medical care such as patient navigation after screening referral, and outreach
      outside of usual medical care (such as with mailed invitations) can increase screening rates
      among underserved populations. However, since these have undergone limited evaluation among
      low income predominantly Spanish-speaking Latinos, it is unclear which approach is best, and
      whether implementing both approaches would be synergistic for optimizing screening rates. We
      hypothesize that two culturally and linguistically tailored interventions: a) an inreach
      strategy (IR, consisting of community health worker-delivered in clinic education regarding
      CRC screening and other components), and b) an outreach strategy (OS, consisting of mailed
      invitations to complete screening with an enclosed fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and
      telephone reminders) can substantially increase screening, and further, that the two
      interventions together will be substantially better than either alone. To test these
      hypotheses, we propose a randomized trial comparing usual care, IR, OS, and IR+OS for CRC
      screening.
