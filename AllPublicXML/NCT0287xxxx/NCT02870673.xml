  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the common disease of peripheral
      neuropathy and usually happened to female, mid-age population, overweight persons, and those
      who overused their hands for work or production. Some research claimed this might be
      correlated to anatomical characteristics such as the longer anteroposterior diameter or
      smaller cross section area of the wrist. Preliminary symptoms often start with sensory domain
      (pain, tingling, paresthesia and especially night awakening due to symptoms mentioned above)
      and then progress to motor domain (thenar muscle atrophy and clumsiness) if left untreated.

      Depending on the severity, patient's willingness and convenience, there are many options for
      CTS. For those whose symptoms are mild to moderate, conservative therapies are usually the
      first choice, including physiotherapies, local injection and night splints. Local steroid is
      proven to be effective to relieve the symptoms of CTS shortly up to 3 months. However, the
      effects will decline gradually and repetitive injections is suggestive. The patients with
      severe symptoms which comprise thenar muscle atrophy will be advised to receive decompression
      surgery.the surgery can alleviate the illness with high success rate up to 70%.
      Unfortunately, there are still patients who will relapse or undergo side effects, for
      example, finger weakness.

      In recent years, acupuncture researches focused on CTS intervention have been outgrowing and
      promising. Whereas, there are still lack of evidence which stands for the therapeutic effects
      comparing with local steroid injection. This limits the built-up of suspect mechanism of
      acupuncture intervention for CTS.

      This is a preliminary, randomized and single-blinded study which started since 2016 and last
      for a year. The investigators utilize ultrasound to guide the depth of needle penetration
      which prevents unnecessarily tissues injury such as artery or dry needle injury. This
      procedure also guarantees the needles lie directly on the upper surface of the median nerve.
      One group will receive electrical stimulation and another won't. The investigators use
      electromyography, cross-section area of median nerve, visual analog scale, Boston Carpal
      Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire, six-item scale, The disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand
      score and Jamar grip dynamometer as outcome measurements. The results gathered from two
      experimental groups will be compared with the data from the control group whose participants
      only receiving local steroid injection once in the first week. The participants are all above
      18 years old and complain of illness for a least 3 months without any surgery or local
      injection for a least 1 year. The investigators set up strict exclusive criteria and sample
      size estimation is 70.

    <description>In this group, the participants receive acupuncture treatment and only 2 minutes electrical stimulation.
Each needle insertion depth and position are confirmed by the ultrasound. The procedure makes sure that needle pin is directly placed on the median nerve and prevent nerve penetration. Then the electrical stimulator is connected to the needles as cathode and anode and is turned on to the intensity which can induce thenar muscle contraction or reach the upper limit of the participant. After 2 minutes, the stimulator will turn off spontaneously and the participant will not be informed.
The whole course will cost 20 minutes after needles are pulled out. Every participant is asked to receive 1 treatment per week in the consecutive 3 months(total 12 times).</description>
