    <textblock>
      Our and others experience suggest that in some cases delaying oocyte pick up (OPU) for more
      than 39 hours after hCG injection may be of benefit.

      We plan to apply this to 20 women in whom less than 20% of oocytes were found suitable for
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The delay will be for up to an interval of 47 hours from
      hCG to OPU.

      In IVF one encounters some women in whom a low percentage of oocytes are found in the
      metaphase II stage upon their retrieval. Following some incidents, in our experience as well
      as others', where women injected hCG too early but oocytes were still retrieved with high
      proportion of maturity, we decided to delay OPU intentionally in women who had low percentage
      oocyte maturity in previous cycles.
