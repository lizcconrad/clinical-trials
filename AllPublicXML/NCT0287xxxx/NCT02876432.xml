  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates inflammation via catecholamines,
      recent advances in electroacupuncture allow activating critical neuronal networks with the
      release of catecholamines the aim of this research was to evaluate de effect of
      electroacupuncture in the activation of sympathetic nervous system and the control of low
      back pain in athletes

    <description>The acupuncture points selected were ST36, BL25, GB30, BL40, GB34 the needles were inserted into acupoints and the depth of needle insertion depended of the acupoints selected to achieve Deqi sensation, which is characterized as a numb, heavy, sore and/or distending sensation.
Electrical stimulation was delivered at 4 Hz. The stimulator (ITO EST-160) was then switched on, and the intensity was gradually increased to reach a strong but comfortable level the sensation of EA which is characterized for numbness, tingling and a light muscle cramp. For 15 minutes</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In sham electroacupuncture (Sham) the investigators use 1.0 cm outside point of the real electroacupuncture, the depth of needle insertion was superficial to avoid Deqi sensation, the cables wasn't connected to the electro stimulator and was then switched on for 15 minutes. The participants were threaded separately to avoid sharing experiences about the electroacupuncture sessions</description>
