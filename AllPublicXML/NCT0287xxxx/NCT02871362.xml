    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit and tolerability of IQP-AS-118 on the
      systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and to explore the effects on parameters of lipid
      metabolism in subjects with elevated BP and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
      levels in a pilot study.
