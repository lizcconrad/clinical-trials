      The researchers aim to record the incidence, treatment and long term follow up of fertility
      preserving cancer treatment. Both the oncological and fertility outcome are recorded.

      Study population: All patients with a cancer for whom a fertility preserving cancer treatment
      is applied. The results of the study population are compared to young women undergoing
      standard cancer treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the second leading cause of death during the reproductive years. The long term
      survival improves for most cancers, reaching 80% for pediatric cancer and more than 70% for
      cancers in adults between 20 and 49 years of age. Early detection and improvements in cancer
      treatment contribute to these figures. As a result, quality of life of which preservation of
      fertility is one aspect, becomes more important. Fertility may however be influenced by
      surgery and by the gonadotoxic effects of chemo and/or radiotherapy. Therefore, fertility
      sparing treatments are offered to young patients in order to maintain the wish to conceive
      after cancer treatment. This however is associated with deviation of standard treatment and
      many different strategies are applied among different centers. In addition, there is a lack
      of studies investigating the oncological safety of these fertility sparing treatment
      protocols. The results of this study will enable us to better inform clinicians and patients
      on the efficacy of fertility sparing cancer treatment.

      Objective:

      To record the incidence, treatment and long term follow up of fertility preserving cancer
      treatment. Both the oncological and fertility outcome are recorded.

      Study design: International multicentre prospective observational trial

      Study population: All patients with a cancer for whom a fertility preserving cancer treatment
      is applied. The results of the study population are compared to young women undergoing
      standard cancer treatment.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Registration of cancer diagnosis, treatment and outcome. Both the oncologic and fertility
      outcome is registered.

      All patients receive fertility sparing cancer treatment on their specific request.
