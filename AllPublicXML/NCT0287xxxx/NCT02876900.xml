      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, in-patient, safety, and
      efficacy study to evaluate HP-3070 for the treatment of schizophrenia.

      This study is designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of HP-3070 compared with placebo
      transdermal patch in subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia, who are in an acute exacerbation
      and to assess the impacts of covariates on asenapine exposure as delivered in a patch
      formulation, using a population-based approach.
