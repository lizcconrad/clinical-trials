  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this investigational research study is to determine how safe and
      tolerable the study drug, MEDI4736 (Durvalumab), is in patients with myelofibrosis (MF). The
      study drug belongs to a group of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have shown
      promise in other forms of cancer, such as melanoma and lung cancer. One of the effects that
      this drug has is to activate the patient's own natural immune system. The purpose of this
      study is to examine the safety and tolerability of the study drug, to study how effective it
      is at treating patients with myelofibrosis, and to explore how certain markers in the
      patient's blood and/or bone marrow may be affected by the study drug.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) therapy in
      patients with myelofibrosis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Changes in MF symptom burden. II. Changes in spleen size. III. Blood and/or bone marrow
      samples.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rate of lymphocyte subset response to anti-PDL1 therapy, as measured by
      the percent increase in cluster of differentiation (CD)4+CD25+PD-L1+ T-lymphocytes and
      CD4+CD62L+CD127+ T lymphocytes in post-treatment peripheral blood samples.

      II. To characterize changes in the cytokine profile in response to anti-PDL1 therapy.

      III. To measure soluble PDL1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in post-treatment
      blood and/or bone marrow samples and programmed cell death-1 (PD1)/PDL1 by
      immunohistochemistry on bone marrow samples and correlate with treatment response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease (SD), no new inter-current illness, and
      no unacceptable toxicity, may continue treatment beyond 3 courses.

      Patients will be followed every 3 months for up to two years starting from Day 1.
