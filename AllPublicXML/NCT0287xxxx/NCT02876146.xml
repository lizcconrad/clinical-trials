    <textblock>
      Study design to define improved management of patients with hepatic alveolar echinococcosis
      treated with albendazole and especially make appropriate and timely decision of treatment
      withdrawal .

      Based on exploratory analysis of existing and newly developed biological and imaging exams,
      for diagnosis and follow-up, and study of the relationship of these markers to the viability
      of the parasite and/or the activity of the parasitic lesions The study included two series of
      patients: operated on (curative hepatectomy) // non-operated on
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Close follow-up of the patients, based on WHO guidelines (Brunetti, Acta tropica 2010),
      including albendazole bloods levels determination.

      Clinical exam, sampling and storing (biobank) of blood specimens at inclusion, M1, M3, M6,
      M9, M12, M18, M24, M30, M36, M44, M48.

      Additional sampling for operated on patients : M15 and M21.

      Imaging each year (US, CT, PET-CT &amp; RMI).

      Preservation of operative specimens samples at -80°C: samples taken at different location
      (center and periphery of the lesions) and in distant non-infected liver, for further studies
      of the immune response, RNA detection, and albendazole dosages.

    <description>Follow-up of standardized clinical, biological, and imaging characteristics (according to the WHO-expert consensus). Albendazole treatment, 400 mg x 2/d (or mebendazole if adverse effects)
Standardized earlier withdrawal of benzimidazole :
Patients with non operable hepatic AE lesion : Withdrawal of benzimidazole treatment for patients without metastasis or neighbouring lesions (PxN0M0) after at least 4 years when viability markers became negative (PET-CT, serological markers)
Curative hepatectomy : Earlier withdrawal of benzimidazole treatment for patients without metastasis or neighbouring lesions (PxN0M0) after one year (WHO guidelines : 2 years), if viability markers became negative. Close prospective follow-up after withdrawal (PET-CT, serological markers)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  hepatic alveolar echinococcosis

          -  without antiparasitic treatment or with antiparasitic treatment and hepatectomy
             programmed

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with exclusively extra-hepatic form of alveolar echinococcosis

          -  Women without effective contraception (Contraindication to benzimidazoles)

          -  The immunosuppressed patients or receiving an immunosuppressive treatment will not be
             the object of a stop of the post-operative treatment by albendazole on 1 year after
             the intervention of radical resection; they can be included in the study but will
             receive the albendazole during 2 years; this exclusion applies to the patients treated
             by liver transplant.
