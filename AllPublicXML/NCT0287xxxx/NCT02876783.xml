      Observe and describe the relationships between impairments and function, systematically
      characterize recovery patterns and examine short and long term rehabilitation outcomes. This
      project is purely observational, descriptive and non-experimental. N=273

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project involves an interdisciplinary stroke database of demographic variables and
      clinical measures collected during routine acute care, inpatient rehabilitation admission and
      discharge as well as follow up questionnaires at 6 month and 12 months to examine stroke
      recovery.

      Our aim is to observe and describe the relationships between impairments and function,
      systematically characterize recovery patterns and examine short and long term rehabilitation
      outcomes.

      This project is purely observational, descriptive and non experimental. No rehabilitation
      interventions or treatment procedures are being introduced, modified or studied.

Story B is read two times to the subject, with any recalled information provided after each reading. The neuropsychologist records the information recalled by the subject. After 30 minutes of other testing, the subject is asked to provide any information recalled from Story A and then Story B, and the assessor records this information. Fifteen yes/no recognition memory questions are then asked about each story and the recognition memory scores are recorded.</description>

The subject views the stimulus page for 10 seconds (which displays six geometric figures) and is asked to draw as many of the figures as possible in the response booklet. A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. A Recognition Trial, in which the subject is asked to identify which of 12 figures were included among the original geometric figures, is administered.</description>

The most challenging tasks are presented first. If the first one or two tasks in a subscale are performed well, subsequent tasks in the subscale are marked as correct, and the assessor begins the next subscale.</description>
