  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 15 Study Sites will participate over total 24 months. Study population will
      consist of adults age 22 or over, reporting overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms for at least 3
      months.

      Primary Study Objectives:

        1. To assess efficacy of the StimRouter stimulation in improving OAB symptoms of urgency
           and frequency as measured by Patient Voiding Diary when targeting the posterior tibial
           nerve

        2. To assess safety of the StimRouter therapy for the indication of OAB

      Secondary Study Objective:

      To evaluate efficacy of the StimRouter therapy in addressing urinary urge incontinence as
      measured by the Patient Voiding Diary

      Study Design is prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded

      Primary Endpoint:

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between the investigational and control
      groups in proportion of responders, where Responder is defined as having ≥50% improvement in
      average voiding frequency above the normal value of 8 (those returning to normal voiding
      based on 7-day average voids/leak episodes &lt; 9, will be categorized as achieving half or more
      reduction) AND having ≥50% improvement in average number of moderate to severe urgency
      episodes, at approximately three months after programming.

      Secondary Endpoint:

      Secondary endpoint will be the difference between the investigational and control groups in
      proportion of patients with reduction by half or more in urinary urge incontinence as
      measured by the average number of urge incontinence episodes per day.

      Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled in the Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation
      (PTNS) for Overactive Bladder study. After signing the informed consent and completing the
      screening visit, eligible candidates will be asked to (1) stop any OAB medications (including
      but not limited to anti-muscarinic medication or tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) as well as
      stabilize dosage and frequency of any concomitant medications for 3 weeks, if applicable, and
      then (2) complete a daily Patient Voiding Diary for 7 days .

      Subjects will then return to the office for baseline review. If all screening and baseline
      criteria are met, the subject will be enrolled, randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the
      &quot;control group&quot; or the &quot;investigational group&quot; and scheduled for implant with the StimRouter
      device.

      After approximately 3 weeks for healing post-implant, study participants will be programmed
      according to their randomization assignment. All subjects will be instructed to apply
      stimulation at least 3 days/week for at least 30 minutes/day (i.e., the minimum protocol
      requirements for device use) for 6 months and to apply stimulation when they anticipate OAB
      events. Patient Voiding Diaries will be completed by the participants for 7 days prior to
      each follow-up visit and provided to the office at each follow-up visit. Follow-up visits
      will occur at Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 5 and Month 6. Each follow-up visit will
      include the review of subject voiding diaries and the completion of other subject
      questionnaires for measuring OAB and quality of life assessments. Final follow-up evaluations
      for all subjects will occur at Month 6.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The daily Patient Voiding Diary is a self-reported record and it includes how frequently the patient intentionally urinates during the day (frequency) and is awakened to urinate at night (nighttime void frequency), amount voided, number of urgency episodes, voids with moderate to severe urgency, urinary urge incontinence episodes and the degree of urgency to urinate. The 7-day daily Patient Voiding Diary will be assessed at baseline and at approximately 3 months after programming to measure total number of voids (frequency) and voids with moderate-to-severe urgency.The average for each of the seven-day periods will be calculated and compared.</description>
