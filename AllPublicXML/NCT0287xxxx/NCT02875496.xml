      Establishment of a BNA reference database for the Adult and Elderly Population.
      Hypothesis-generating study designed to collect data that will aid in future scientific and
      engineering exploration of correlations between clinical assessments and BNA scores. The
      results are primarily intended for scientific inquiry and engineering development purposes,
      and may be used in future regulatory submissions.

      Currently, there is no reliable, bedside, and non-invasive method for assessing connectivity
      changes in electrophysiological activity of the brain associated with brain-related
      pathologies, e.g., concussion, ADHD, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), etc. Event Related
      Potentials (ERPs), which are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of
      cells in specific regions of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a
      method, as they provide both a non-invasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs
      provide excellent temporal information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally
      been limited. However, by using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording, spatial
      resolution for ERPs is improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will
      combine neurophysiological knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern
      recognition methods (BNA) to temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and
      synchronization.

      The need of objective measures that will help the clinician in its decision-making in
      brain-related pathologies is recognized. BNA is a new imaging modality that has been
      developed to fill this gap.

        Up to 2000 subjects, from both genders, aged 50- years and above will be recruited and
        stratified to age groups. Once enrollment reaches the below numbers for each age group,
        subjects will be statistically stratified and analyzed in 4 different Arms, one Normative
        and three Pathologies, according to a prospective statistical plan and based on the
        prevalence of common pathological conditions in each age group; this will be determined by
        analysis of the literature, analysis of study demographics and concomitant diseases, and on
        the PI and/or sponsor's discretion. Suggested enrollment numbers for the different age
        groups and different Arms are:
