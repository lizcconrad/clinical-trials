  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study. The first part is a single-dose open label design. The second part
      employs a multiple dose, randomized, placebo controlled study design. Studies have
      demonstrated that GRFT is highly potent for HIV prevention and is effective at very low
      concentrations. One 4 mL dose of PC-6500, designed to provide an adequate vaginal
      concentration of GRFT for the prevention of HIV, based on preclinical data, will be
      evaluated. Rising dose tolerance is not the goal of this study because GRFT is likely to be
      minimally absorbed systemically, if at all.

    <description>Griffithsin Gel is a large biologic molecule that is intended for vaginal rather than systemic administration. In addition, Griffithsin Gel is being developed for the prevention of HIV infection and not as a therapeutic agent. The concentration of Griffithsin Gel associated with prevention of HIV in vitro and in vivo has been established in non-clinical studies (see Section 5). Studies have demonstrated that Griffithsin Gel is highly potent for HIV prevention and is effective at very low concentrations.
One 4 mL dose of PC-6500, designed to provide an adequate vaginal concentration of GRFT for the prevention of HIV, based on preclinical data, will be evaluated. Rising dose tolerance is not the goal of this study because GRFT is likely to be minimally absorbed systemically, if at all.</description>

          -  3) Healthy, based on medical history, vital signs, physical examination, urinalysis,
