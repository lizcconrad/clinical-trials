  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy (non-injured) and concussed college-aged participants will complete two testing
      sessions that include (1) clinical symptom, balance, and cognitive evaluations and (2) a
      progressive exercise session to establish symptom exacerbation or maximal exercise capacity.
      Individuals randomized to the control group will receive no intervention between sessions,
      while individuals randomized to the intervention group will complete 30 minutes of stationary
      bike exercise at least 3 days/week.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy and concussed participants will be randomized to ACTIVE training (intervention) or
      control (no intervention) groups. Participants, regardless of group assignment, will receive
      clinical symptom, balance, and cognitive evaluations as well as a progressive exercise
      assessment at study outset. Concussed participants will enroll into the study within three
      days of injury and study participation will termination following 24 consecutive hours with
      no reported concussive symptoms. Healthy participants will have arbitrary start dates and
      will terminate the study 10-14 days later to approximate the general length of concussion
      recovery and, therefore, make the time between session in the healthy and concussed cohorts
      as equivalent as possible. Participants in the intervention group will complete stationary
      cycle ergometer workouts for 30 mins at least 3 days per week between testing sessions.
      Healthy participants will complete six ACTIVE training sessions, while concussed participants
      will complete ACTIVE training at least three days per week until asymptomatic. Concussed
      control participants will follow physician guidelines for rest and activity, while healthy
      control participants will be asked to follow their typical routines for rest and activity.
      Participants will repeat the identical testing session assessments prior to study
      termination.
