      This is a prospective multi-center cohort feasibility and exploratory study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to prospectively study a cohort of 18-25-year-old athletes to establish
      the reliability of EYE-SYNC data and the utility of the EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device as a
      sideline concussion assessment tool. The clinical research study will be conducted to 1)
      determine if eye-tracking, assessed on the sideline by EYE-SYNC eye-tracking device, is a
      potential marker of injury that can be used in conjunction with other sideline evaluations to
      inform decisions regarding removal of athletes from play and 2) to use the EYE-SYNC goggle
      data as a post- injury recovery monitor.
