  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to perform a French multicenter prospective interventional study in
      order to assess the feasibility and safety of ovarian hyperstimulation for oocyte / embryo
      cryopreservation in young women with breast cancer. The oncologic and reproductive benefit /
      risk ratio will be investigated in the oncology and reproductive area.

      Medical Oncology:

        -  Information and collection of consent,

        -  Imaging staging,

        -  Inclusion

        -  Physical examination

        -  Contraception advise given

      Reproductive medicine center:

        -  Ovarian reserve assessment: serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) measurement and antral
           follicle count (AFC) by ultrasound.

        -  Serology syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). In case of
           embryo cryopreservation, same serology determination for the men.

        -  Infertility risk and fertility preservation techniques information.

        -  In case of agreement, this technique will be done during the time-interval between
           surgery and chemotherapy

        -  Fertility preservation (COH stimulation, triggering and oocyte retrieval)

      Adjuvant chemotherapy:

        -  The chemotherapy regimen is 3 FEC (fluorouracil epirubicin cyclophosphamide) 100
           followed by 3 Docetaxel +/- Trastuzumab. Adjuvant chemotherapy may only begin after the
           oocyte retrieval.

        -  Usual adjuvant chemotherapy is not changed

      During chemotherapy:

        -  Clinical exam before each cycle of chemotherapy

        -  AMH, AFC at cycle 6

      After chemotherapy:

        -  Usual patient monitoring in expert center :

      physical examination at Month 3 (M3), M6 M9 M12 M18 and M24 and mammography at M9 then annual

        -  AMH at Month 3 (M3), M6 M9 M12 M18 and M24

        -  AFC at Month 12 (M12) and M24

    <description>After information and consent, patients are addressed to a reproductive medicine center.
The COH will be performed according to a standardized protocol between surgery and the start of adjuvant chemotherapy. Follicular growth will be achieved with an antagonist protocol and by using high dose recombinant FSH (r-FSH). The triggering of the final follicular and oocyte maturation will be obtained by a GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone) agonist injection in order to minimize the risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation.</description>
