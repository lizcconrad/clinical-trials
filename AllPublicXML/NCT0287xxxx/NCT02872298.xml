      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm (non-randomized) study of Targeted Lung Denervation
      (TLD) Therapy in subjects with severe asthma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm (non-randomized) study. All patients will undergo a run
      in period on optimal medical therapy as part of eligibility testing. Final determination to
      initiate treatment will be made after initial airway inspection. A total of 30 patients will
      be treated. Inflammatory biomarkers (washes and brushes) will be collected in all patients
      and bronchial biopsies will be collected from the last 15 patients at the time of treatment
      and at 90-days post-treatment. All patients will be prescribed peri-procedural antibiotics
      and steroids to minimize procedural risks. All patients will be provided a mobile handheld
      spirometer to measure and record daily peak expiratory flow both before and after treatment
      to monitor lung function. Patient follow-up will be conducted out to 3 years.
