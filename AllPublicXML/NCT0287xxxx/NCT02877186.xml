  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is being conducted to evaluate whether consumption of diet soda sweetened
      with sucralose and acesulfame-potassium leads to changes in the gut microbiota. Following a
      one week run-in period, healthy, young adults are randomized to consume either diet soda or
      carbonated water (control) three times per day for one week. Stool and urine samples are
      collected at baseline, following the run-in, and after the one-week intervention.
