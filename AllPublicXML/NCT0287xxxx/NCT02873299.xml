  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two slightly different methods of transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-blind pilot study investigating the efficacy of high-frequency
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) applied to the right dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex at either 10 Hz or 20 Hz as compared to a treatment as usual group for the
      treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
