  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vorapaxar is a recently approved protease activated receptor - 1 (PAR-1) inhibitor. Platelet
      inhibition may also exert positive results on coagulation activation and may beneficially
      influence the inflammatory response. Since vorapaxar is the first available substance of a
      new class of platelet inhibitors its effects on the human coagulation system and the
      inflammatory response will be assessed in the well-established human endotoxemia model.

    <textblock>
      Vorapaxar is a novel platelet inhibitor inhibiting PAR-1. It is the first available substance
      of a new class of platelet inhibitors blocking the activation of platelets via thrombin or
      thrombin receptor activating peptides via PAR-1. As platelets contribute to the coagulation
      activation, i.e. by providing the surface for the assembly of the Tenase complex, and
      furthermore to the inflammatory response by releasing their stored granula containing
      promotors of both, inflammation and coagulation, we want to assess the effects of vorapaxar
      on these in the human endotoxemia model. Sixteen healthy volunteers will be included in this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single center, crossover trial with a washout
      period of 8 weeks. This wash out period was chosen based on the long elimination half-life of
      vorapaxar and to prevent any carry-over effects. After intake of 10mg vorapaxar (-24h) the
      degree of platelet inhibition will be assessed by whole bood aggregometry and, in case of
      insufficient platelet inhibition, subjects may receive another 10mg of vorapaxar. A bolus of
      2ng/kg bodyweight lipopolysaccharide (LPS) will be infused and blood sampling will be
      performed at pre-defined time-points. After the washout-period the respective other treatment
      will be given to subjects.
