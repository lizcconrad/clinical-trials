  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized double blind clinical trial performed on 68 patients (32 in intervention and
      36 in control group) diagnosed with SLE. The patients in intervention group were given daily
      dose of 1000mg of aqueous green tea extract (of 6 gram of dried green tea leaf) in form of
      two capsules ( 500 mg). Also in control group, the patients were given daily dose of 1000mg
      of cellulose in form of two capsules ( 500 mg) Variables include SLE disease activity, some
      biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress and anthropometric indicators at baseline and
      end of the study.

      The investigators used SLEDAI (systemic lupus erythematous disease activity index )
      questionnaire for evaluating the clinical signs of the disease. The questionnaires filled out
      at baseline and after 3 month.
