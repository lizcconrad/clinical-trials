  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to identify the responding patients with vascular filling test, this research aims
      to compare the performance of the increased flow in the femoral artery to the performance of
      the blood pressure increase.

      The reference measurement will increase cardiac output measured by ultrasound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is notable that in the intensive care patient, the ultrasound measurement of cardiac flow
      is not always possible, especially in case of mechanical ventilation, often responsible for
      air interposed between the ultrasound probe and the heart, thus stopping the ultrasound. Use
      the blood pressure increase as a reflection of the increase in cardiac flow induced by fluid
      replacement is not a fully satisfactory alternative since its performance is at best just
      acceptable.

      Flow measurement in the femoral artery could be an attractive alternative to the cardiac
      output measurement as:

        -  It is easy: the femoral vascular ultrasound is booming with resuscitators, including the
           laying of intravascular catheter or thrombosis diagnosis.

        -  It is painless: it is based on the application of the ultrasound probe on the root of
           the thigh for less than 5 minutes.

        -  It is not subject to limitations echogenicity by interposition of air (except in
           exceptional circumstances)

        -  It measures the same physiological parameter (arterial flow) as measuring ultrasound
           cardiac output (based on measurement of the flow at the outflow tract of the left
           ventricle).

      Pathophysiology study, multicenter (conducted in three French ICUs), open, prospective in
      order to evaluate the flow doppler from the femoral artery as a reflection of cardiac flow in
      a vascular fluid test in patient with signs of acute circulatory failure in intensive care
      unit.

        One hundred and twenty adult patients hospitalized in one of the participating ICUs, will
        be included (see the justification required number of subjects in &quot;statistics&quot;) if

          -  They are already carrying an intra-arterial catheter (femoral or radial).

          -  They exhibit acute circulatory failure signs (see below)

          -  The doctor in charge prescribed a vascular fluid replacement, regardless of the
             purposes of the study:

               -  vascular fluid replacement

               -  initiation or catecholamine

               -  or increase (&gt; 10%) of catecholamine dosage.
