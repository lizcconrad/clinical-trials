  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 50% of infants and young children cry during the administration of their inhaled
      treatment for their asthma. This results in decreased lung deposition, and thus decreased
      effectiveness of their inhaled treatment.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether animated cartoons can increase the
      cooperation of young children with asthma who are not cooperative during the delivery of
      their ICS therapy through a pMDI/spacer.
