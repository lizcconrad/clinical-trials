  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is widely used in oncology for the treatment of many solid tumors. The side effects
      of docetaxel are many and sometimes serious. The primary toxicity of docetaxel is
      neutropenia. Skin and nail manifestations, frequency, the second category of adverse events
      after haematological adverse events.

      Use of the product Evonail® was demonstrated in a patient treated by doxetaxel and having
      nail damage.

      The purpose of this study is to confirm the effectiveness of the film-forming solution
      Evonail® versus a placebo on the prevention of nail damage in women with breast cancer and
      treated by adjuvant docetaxel.
