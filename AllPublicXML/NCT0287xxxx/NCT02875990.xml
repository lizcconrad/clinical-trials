  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with Human Papillomavirus high-risk Human (HR-HPV) is the main factor of risk of
      cancer of the cervix. Recent studies show that cancers linked to infection with HR-HPV are
      associated with immunosuppression and lack of T cell response Such mechanisms would promote
      progression to cancer and progression of it . Various factors such as an increase of
      regulatory T cells, the presence of myeloid cells and suppressor of defects in the signaling
      pathway Toll Like Receptor (TLR) may have a key role in these immunosuppression mechanisms.
      At this stage of knowledge, a better characterization of local and systemic immunosuppressive
      signing of cervical cancer is needed. The results should have a significant medical impact
      for the identification of new prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for the
      treatment of patients with cervical cancer.

      The aim of this research project is to define the signing of immunosuppressive cancer cervix
      and analyze the different mechanisms involved in this immunosuppression.
