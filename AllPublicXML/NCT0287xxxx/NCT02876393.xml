    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy(DR) is a sight threatening condition that occurs in persons with
      diabetes. DR arises as a consequence of damage to the retinal blood vessels and is related to
      the high and fluctuating sugar levels in the blood stream. An eye with DR will have abnormal
      appearing retinal blood vessels which become engorged and dilated, leaky and fragile or
      undergo closure. The net result is a picture of haemorrhage and or ischaemia (lack of blood
      supply). A particular feature of DR is the accumulation of fluid in the macula which is the
      central part of the retina and responsible for detailed eye sight. This peculiar form of DR
      is called Diabetic Macular Oedema (DMO). DMO can occur in isolation without other features of
      DR. DMO is commoner in type 2 diabetes where insulin resistance and abnormalities of blood
      fats are found. The investigators wish to study DR and DMO using high resolution retinal
      imaging and functional tests in normal participants, those participants with diabetes without
      any overt signs of disease and those with DR and DMO in order to understand how the condition
      develops and whether there are any unique risk factors that can be identified

        Potential participants with DR of different severity levels ranging from minimal DR to
        severe DR with or without DMO who attend the diabetic clinics will be invited to
        participate. Opportunistic sampling will be used to ensure that the different severity
        levels of DR and or DMO will be adequately represented.The Northern Ireland Cohort
        Longitudinal Study On ageing (NICOLA), a non-interventional epidemiological study of
        healthy ageing in older adults aged 50 years and above has commenced and is currently
        recruiting some 8500 participants. Participants in NICOLA who are known to have DM or have
        been recently diagnosed with DM will be approached and asked if willing to return for
        detailed functional testing of the eye. This will supplement the group with DM but with no
        changes of DR.

        Control participants with DM but without DR will be recruited from the metabolic clinics of
        the Belfast Trust.
