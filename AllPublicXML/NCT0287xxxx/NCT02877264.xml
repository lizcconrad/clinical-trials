    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-center, open-label, three-period, six-sequence, crossover,
      comparative study to evaluate the oral bioavailability of single doses of three vapendavir
      drug product formulations (the 264 mg free base tablet [test drug], 264 mg free base oral
      suspension [test drug], and two 132 mg phosphate salt capsules [reference drug]) in healthy
      volunteers. The study design consists of six dosing sequences. Each sequence comprises 3
      periods and each subject is administered one of the three dosing formulations in the first
      period. A subject receives a different formulation in each of the subsequent periods, so that
      all subjects receive each formulation. The periods are separated by an approximate 7-day
      washout.
