  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Having co-occurring depression and chronic headaches is challenging and can greatly impact
      one's professional, personal, family, and social life. People living with chronic headaches
      are often at a greater risk of having comorbid psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety),
      reduced quality of life, and impaired functioning because of under-diagnosis, misdiagnosis or
      under-treatment of both chronic conditions.

      This study is a pilot clinical trial that will compare the effectiveness of a brief
      cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) depression intervention to a care as usual (control) group.
      The aim of the study is to determine how well the CBT intervention will reduce the frequency,
      severity and level of disability of both the headaches and depression symptoms.

      STUDY LOCATIONS:

      (A) University of Georgia College of Education in Athens, GA

      (B) Henry Ford Hospital - Main campus in Detroit, MI.

        -  For the MI participants, you must be willing to travel to Detroit for the intervention
           if you choose to participate and are assigned to the treatment group.

      **Please contact me with any questions about the study.**

      Background: This research focuses on emphasizing alternative treatment approaches to
      underserved and marginalized groups. This study is a randomized pilot intervention to treat a
      community sample with co-occurring depression and chronic pain (i.e. headaches/migraines) -
      since they are at an increased risk for impaired functioning, comorbid psychiatric disorders
      and reduced quality of life.

    <description>The 4-session CBT treatment will include receipt of a manualized cognitive behavioral intervention, delivered individually, to treat the depression symptoms (e.g. cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation) and teach adaptive coping strategies to manage their depression. Ideally, the intervention will also positively affect their chronic headaches (i.e. reduction of headache frequency, severity and level of disability). Each session is approximately 60 minutes with specific, reflective and guided activities related to a specific module within the intervention.</description>
