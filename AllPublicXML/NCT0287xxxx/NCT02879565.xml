  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progress in resuscitation has increased the chances of survival after anoxic or traumatic
      brain injury. More and more patients with severe cerebral damages are resuscitated but upon
      awakening from coma, some patients remain in a state which cannot be qualified as conscious
      and is now known as an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; formerly known as vegetative
      state). This condition can be transitory and evolve towards recovery, or remain chronic and
      lasting for years.

      To improve the diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness, recent advances in
      brain imaging have led to the development of new methods of detecting awareness. In the
      absence of overt behavioral responses from these patients, imaging-based diagnostic methods
      have been first used to assess whether some cerebral areas were preserved in UWS patients and
      showed an activation of the primary sensory cortices in some UWS patients, whether it occurs
      at the auditory, visual or somatosensory level. Unavoidable technical and ethical issues are
      raised for clinicians before responding to such requests:

        1. Is it technically possible to generalize neuroimaging protocols to all healthcare
           institutions?

        2. Is it ethically acceptable to propose neuroimaging protocols without an accurate
           estimation of their psychological impact on families and caregivers?

      The present study aims to understand and anticipate the technical and ethical issues related
      to an evaluation of consciousness with functional neuroimaging. How the evaluation of
      awareness in a patient affects the caregivers and family members will be investigated. By
      using qualitative research hopes and expectations will be clarified through the experiences
      of families, clinicians and nurses faced to this situation.

      Will be included in this research professional caregivers and persons closely related to UWS
      patients:

        -  Family members or close circle visiting the patients on a regular basis

        -  Referring clinicians

        -  Nurses in charge of the patients' care

      This prospective study uses qualitative, interview-based, research. Two key-moments are
      explored in succession to examine the impact of a neuroimaging evaluation of consciousness in
      institutionalized UWS patients:

        -  interviews of professional caregivers and families about their hopes concerning the
           evaluation of consciousness of UWS patients,

        -  interviews of professional caregivers and families about the impact of evaluating
           consciousness on their beliefs
