      This study investigates safety and efficacy of traumatic bone defects treatment with use of
      3D tissue engineered bone equivalent (3D-TEBE).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate 3D-TEBE transplantation as a safe and efficient
      treatment for patients with traumatic long bone defects of critical size.

      This new method of critical sized long bone defects treatment is under clinical development.
      Treatment of critical sized bone defects is an actual clinical challenge. The &quot;gold standard&quot;
      in this case is autologous bone grafting. The method disadvantage is associated with limited
      donor bone resources. Based on our preliminary clinical trial positive results on use of
      autologous cultured bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) in
      traumatology, our aim was to develop 3D tissue-engineered bone equivalent transplantation
      technology for restoration of critical sized bone defects. The proposed 3D-TEBE
      transplantation for bone defects of critical size treatment expecting to restore the bone
      integrity, form new bone tissue in a site of bone defect, and reduce the rehabilitation
      period of a patient.

      The data obtained from this study will have practical implications for the treatment of
      reparative osteogenesis alterations and will be based on the principles of evidence-based
      medicine
