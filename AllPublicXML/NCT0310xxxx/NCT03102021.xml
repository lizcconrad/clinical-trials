  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of erythropoietin when used in high dose
      during acute kidney injury can decrease the number of days of kidney injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury is associated with increased morbidity. The most common injury to the
      kidney occurs during hospitalization with either ischemic or nephrotoxic insult to the
      kidney. This can prolong hospitalization and depending on the severity of the insult result
      in permanent decreased kidney function. Recent studies in animals have suggested benefits of
      using erythropoietin in high doses at time of kidney injury with eividence for less injury in
      the kidney tissue of those animals who received treatment compared to those animals that
      received only saline. Limited human data also suggests that use of high dose erythropoietin
      at the time of stroke can decrease the extent of brain injury. In addition cardiac cell
      culture studies also have shown decrease in cell injury with use of erythropoietin. These
      studies have prompted us to evaluate if admininstering erythropoietin to those with onset of
      acute kidney injury during their hospitalization may benefit from this intervention. This
      pilot study then evaluates that use of high dose erythropoietin administed daily over 3 days
      in patients with acute kidney injury on whether the days spent in renal failure are less than
      those who will receive no study medication. Those patients with kidney failure from either
      ischemic or nephrotoxic insult and no other contraindication to erythropoietin use will be
      considered for the study. Informed consent is obtained from the patient or next of kin
