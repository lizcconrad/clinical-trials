    <textblock>
      The investigators studied whether scalp hair cortisol and testosterone levels differed
      between sarcoidosis patients both with and without fatigue and healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>

      Rationale: Fatigue is a common symptom in patients with sarcoidosis and has great impact on
      quality of life. Several aspects in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and co-morbidities
      accompanying sarcoidosis could contribute to fatigue. However, until now the etiology of
      fatigue in sarcoidosis is unknown. Measurements of steroid hormones in scalp hair could
      possibly be directional in elucidating the underlying mechanism and could also be used as a
      screening and follow up tool in interventional studies.

      Objective: A pilot to investigate whether cortisol and testosterone levels measured in hair
      differ between patients with sarcoidosis related fatigue, sarcoidosis patients without
      fatigue and healthy subjects.

      Study design: A prospective observational study, using hair samples of sarcoidosis patients
      with and without fatigue, compared to an already existing age matched healthy control group.

      Study population: Adult sarcoidosis patients at the outpatient clinic of the pulmonary
      department of the Erasmus MC, Rotterdam Main study parameters/endpoints: Cortisol and
      testosterone levels in scalp hair, correlation with Fatigue Assessment Scale.
