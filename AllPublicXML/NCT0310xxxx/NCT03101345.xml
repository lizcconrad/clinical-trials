  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this research project is to determine the impact on brain HEP metabolites
      and fluxes of an oral consumption of a commercially available nutrition product (Peptamen®
      1.5 vanilla) in healthy volunteers.

      Therefore, we intend to perform 31P-MRS before and after oral intake of the nutrition
      product.
