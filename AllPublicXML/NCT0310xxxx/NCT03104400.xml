  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is designed to
      compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 Dose A once daily (QD) and Dose B
      QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab every other week (eow) in participants with
      moderately to severely active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) and have an inadequate response to
      non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494
      Dose A QD and Dose B QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2
      evaluates the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 Dose A QD and Dose B QD in
      participants with PsA who have completed Period 1.

    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire is a self-administered patient questionnaire that consists of 13 questions designed to measure the degree of fatigue experienced by participants in the previous 7 days. Participants respond to the questions on a scale from 'not at all' (0) to 'very much' (4). The scale score is computed by summing the item scores, after reversing those items that are worded in the negative direction. The FACIT-Fatigue subscale score ranges from 0 to 52, where higher scores represent less fatigue.</description>
