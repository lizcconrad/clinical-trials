      To characterize the performance of the nasal dilator strip in lowering nasal resistance
      during sleep, promoting nasal route breathing and reducing the signs and symptoms of sleep
      disordered breathing in a group of chronic nocturnal nasal congestion sufferers who report
      trouble with their sleep.

      This study was a baseline-controlled study. This study consisted of four phases: Screening
      phase, Baseline phase, 28 days Active phase (1 month in home treatment usage period with
      sleep laboratory nights after 7 (Night 8) and 28 days (Night 29) of treatment) followed by a
      two-night cross-over Nasal resistance phase. Screened participants were evaluated for sleep
      disordered breathing and PSG variables with sleep laboratory nights at Baseline, after 7 and
      28 days of in house use of nasal dilator strip (Night 8 and 29 of Active phase), at Day 29
      and 30 (Night 30 and 31 of Nasal resistance phase). Participants wore the Nasal dilator strip
      during Active phase. Participants then entered the Nasal resistance phase of the study, which
      consisted of two sleep laboratory nights at Day 29 and 30 (Night 30 and 31) separated by
      approximately two days where they were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/'
      no strip' or 'no strip'/'strip&quot;.

    <measure>Nasal resistance by posterior rhinomanometry</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Nasal resistance was measured by a modified method of posterior rhinomanometry in awake and seated position. Using posterior rhinomanometry, the transnasal pressure difference was measured between the nasopharynx and the external nares. The technique measures the difference in transnasal pressure that drives the flow of air through the nasal cavities. Posterior rhinomanometry was performed at baseline, Day1 (Visit 1) in baseline phase.</description>

    <measure>Total score of composite Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSQ was a 30-item, validated psychometric instrument that assessed the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness on functional outcomes relevant to daily behaviors and quality of life. The FOSQ was used in research and clinical practice to determine the extent to which intervention can improve the ability of participants with disorders of excessive sleepiness to conduct normal activities. The responses to the questionnaire were grouped according to five factors for analysis: 1) Activity Level, 2) Vigilance, 3) Intimacy and Sexual Relationships, 4) General Productivity and 5) Social Outcome. Participant used a scale of 0 to 4 to score the questions of FOSQ which then grouped in above factors (were 0= I don't do this activity for other reasons, 1= Yes, extreme difficulty, 2= Yes, moderate difficulty, 3= Yes, a little difficulty, and 4= No difficulty).</description>

    <description>This study was a baseline-controlled study. This study consisted of four phases, Screening phase, baseline phase, and 28 days Active phase followed by a two-night cross-over Nasal resistance phase. All the participants slept in the sleep laboratory at Day 1 (Night 1) in baseline phase. Participants wore the Nasal dilator strip over a 1 month in-home use period (Active phase) and returned for sleep laboratory nights after 7 (Night 8) and 28 days (Night 29) of treatment. Participants then entered the Nasal resistance phase of the study, which consisted of two sleep laboratory nights at Day 29 and 30 (Night 30 and 31) separated by approximately two days where they were randomized to receive a sequence of either 'strip'/' no strip' or 'no strip'/'strip'.</description>
