  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence from high-income countries suggests that diabetes mellitus is become a
      major health problem among HIV-infected patients. However, due to differences in social,
      environmental, and genetic factors data from high-income countries can not be extrapolated
      directly to low-income countries. This study investigates HIV, ART, inflammation, and body
      composition changes as risk factors for diabetes mellitus among HIV-infected patients in
      Tanzania.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is increasing rapidly in low-income countries and
      HIV-infected patients initiate ART much earlier. As a result, these patients have prolonged
      life spans and, hence, longer HIV and ART exposure. Emerging data from developed countries
      suggest that HIV-infected patients have a higher risk than HIV-uninfected people of
      developing diabetes mellitus (DM) and other non-communicable diseases. The excess diabetes
      risk is probably related to multiple factors including HIV-associated inflammation, the use
      of some antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, and body composition changes associated with
      HIV and ART. As a result, HIV-infected populations may develop DM at a younger age and may
      have a higher mortality if management is not optimal as may be the case in resource-limited
      countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

      Most of the data to-date on HIV and DM are from high-income countries, and data in SSA are
      few and inconsistent. Because of differences in genetic composition as well as environmental
      factors including high burden of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings, data from
      high-income countries cannot be extrapolated and reliably used to improve quality of DM care
      among HIV patients in SSA. The objective of this study is to investigate if HIV, ART, and
      body composition changes occurring during ART use are associated with higher risk of DM as
      well as other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in Tanzanian patients, and examine if
      HIV increases the risk of DM associated complications. This study is funded by the Danish
      Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2016 to 2021.

    <description>Participants recruited in the study will have diverse characteristics. Participants will either be HIV infected or HIV negative and among those HIV-infected there will be those on ART and those not on ART. In addition, participants will have other background characteristics like having history of tuberculosis treatment, being malnourished while starting ART, having diabetes at ART initiation etc. Investigators will also be able to examine the effect of immune activation, body composition changes, and other related factors on the risk of diabetes. This diversity of characteristics will help provide adequate data to address study outcomes.</description>

        A prospective cohort study with two annual follow-ups will be conducted. This will be based
        on two existing HIV cohorts i.e. Nutrition, Diabetes and Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)/HIV
        (NUT-TB) (NCT00311298) conducted in Mwanza from 2006-2009 and Nutritional Support for
        African Adults Starting Antiretroviral Therapy (NUSTART) ( PACTR201106000300631) conducted
        in Mwanza during 2011-2013 and a new HIV cohort which will be recruited at study
        initiation. In the New HIV cohort, investigators will recruit both HIV patients and HIV
        negative participants who will act as controls. These 3 groups will provide about 1900
        participants with and without HIV infection to address study objectives.
