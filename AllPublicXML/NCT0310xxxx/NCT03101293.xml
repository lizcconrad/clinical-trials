  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) of a single oral dose of
      TAK-831 400 milligram (mg) in the fasted state and to estimate the effect of food on the PK
      of a single oral dose of TAK-831 400 mg when administered as tablet formulation in healthy
      participants.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-831. TAK-831 is being tested in healthy
      participants in order to determine the effect of food on the PK of single oral dose of
      TAK-831 tablet formulation. The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. Participants
      will be randomly and equally assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to 1 of the 2
      treatment sequences following as:

        -  TAK-831 400 mg Fasted + TAK-831 400 mg Fed

        -  TAK-831 400 mg Fed + TAK-831 400 mg Fasted All participants will be asked to take single
           oral dose of TAK-831 tablet at the same time on Day 1 of each Intervention Period. This
           single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
           participate in this study is 23 days. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and
           remained confined until Day 3 of Intervention Period 1 and 2. A washout period of
           minimum 7 days will be maintained between the doses in each Intervention Period.
           Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic on Days 4, 6 and 8 on each Intervention
           Period and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day
           23) for a follow-up assessment.
