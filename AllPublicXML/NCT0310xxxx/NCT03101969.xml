    <textblock>
      Patients tend to miss their scheduled appointments in chronic pain clinics for unknown
      reasons. This study will test the hypothesis in a prospective pragmatic trial that a human
      telephone call in the primary language of the patient, promising a clinical encounter in this
      language improves attendance at scheduled appointments in an academic inner city pain clinic.

      Language barriers may lead to poor attendance at pain clinic appointments, especially in
      underserved patients. Targeted interventions can help overcome barriers and significantly
      improve adherence, but have rarely been rigorously investigated in randomized clinical
      trials. Our objective is to investigate if (1) making a telephone call in the patient's
      preferred language increases adherance with scheduled appointment in an inner city academic
      pain clinic or at least reduces failure to attend without a prior cancellation call and (2)
      if this intervention is more effective in Spanish speakers.

      After institutional review board approval and waiver of informed consent, we enroll all adult
      patients (18 years and up) with a scheduled first appointment at our outpatient Pain Center
      at Montefiore Medical Center located in the Bronx, New York from October 2014 through October
      2015. Participants are randomized to receive a phone call in their preferred language before
      their appointment, or not. We recorded if participants attended as scheduled and/or called to
      cancel. We fit stratified and multivariate multinomial logistic regression models.

      In a methodologically rigorous randomized design, we seek to demonstrate that a human phone
      call in the patient's primary language increases adherence with scheduled appointments in an
      ethnically diverse, poor population, typical for an inner city pain clinic. Our targeted
      intervention may provide considerable cost savings to the institution while bolstering the
      patient-doctor relationship and overcoming barriers to access much needed care.
