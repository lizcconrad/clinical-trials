  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chilblains are cutaneous lesions affecting extremities (foot and fingers) with erythemic
      papules, evolving by painful relapse due to cold and sudden reheating.

      This pathology is currently poorly understood while it's frequent.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate all the characteristics of this pathology by reporting
      clinical and biological data of patient consulting for chilblains; and the other point is to
      assess the evolution of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are going to collect data on patient medical report to fill up a case report
      form. And in a second time they call patient by phone to ask him/her about the evolution of
      their pathology.
