  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analgesia following surgery associates different intra-venous or oral analgesic drugs and
      sometimes opioids. To reduce opioid consumption, loco-regional anaesthesia might be
      administered as a complement. In the specific context of caesarean sections, pain control is
      mandatory to enable the mother to take care of her offspring and shorten their hospital stay.
      This intervention is mainly performed under neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal or epidural),
      enabling the injection of morphine in the subdural or epidural space, as part of a multimodal
      analgesia regimen.

      Studies have evaluated continuous wound infiltration catheters (CIC) and ultrasound-guided
      (UGD) transabdominis plane (TAP) block, and both techniques and both techniques reduce
      postoperative morphine consumption. Recent studies have compared the two techniques and found
      conflicting results. Furthermore, they did not consider caesarean section performed under
      epidural analgesia, with a different neuraxial injection site, neither did they compared pain
      after postoperative day 2.

      Consequently, the aim of this study was to compare resting and standing pain up to
      postoperative day 3 after caesarean section performed under spinal or epidural anaesthesia
      and receiving either USG-TAP block or CIC. Baseline hypothesis was that the continuous
      infiltration provided a better analgesia at day 2.
