  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this work is to compare two protocols (ketamine-fentanyl-midazolam versus
      thiopental-fentanyl-midazolam) for induction of anesthesia in patients with septic shock
      aiming to find the most safe protocol with regards to hemodynamic status of patients.

      Induction of anesthesia in hemodynamically compromised patients is a challenge for every
      anesthetist. Most of the intravenous induction agents have a negative effect on arterial
      blood pressure and cardiac output. Theoretically, the &quot;ideal&quot; emergency induction intravenous
      anesthetic should achieve rapid hypnosis and maintain the hemodynamic stability Ketamine has
      been reported as an induction anesthetic with a sympathomimetic activity. In patients with
      intact autonomic nervous system ketamine increases heart rate, cardiac output, and arterial
      blood pressure (ABP). Despite its sympathomimetic activity in hemodynamically stable
      patients, the hemodynamic response to ketamine in unstable cardiovascular conditions is not
      clear No studies to the best of our knowledge compared Ketamine and low dose thiopental in
      rapid sequence induction of anesthesia in hemodynamically unstable patients.

      In this study, patients with severe sepsis or septic shock scheduled for surgery will be
      assigned to receive either ketamine or thiopental for induction of anesthesia. After
      induction of anesthesia, endotracheal tube will be inserted aided by succinyl choline.
      Invasive blood pressure will be monitored through a transducer connected to arterial
      catheter. Electrical velocimetry (cardiometry) device will be used for non-invasive
      monitoring of cardiac output and stroke volume.
