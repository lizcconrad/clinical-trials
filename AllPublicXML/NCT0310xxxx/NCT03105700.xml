    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (TMS) is safe and feasible for treating depressive symptoms in patients with temporal lobe
      epilepsy. Patients will receive an accelerated protocol of TMS consisting of three
      consecutive days of treatment. Patients will have two in-person follow up visits after one
      month and again after six months.

      This is a pilot study designed primarily to assess whether patients with epilepsy can safely
      tolerate low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation in an accelerated protocol to treat
      depression. The investigators aim to enroll 20 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and
      comorbid depression to receive a total of 14 hours of transcranial magnetic stimulation over
      3 days at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). The investigators will assess safety of
      this protocol with regards to seizure frequency and other side effects of TMS treatment and
      the feasibility of using an accelerated protocol in this patient population. In addition to
      these primary aims, our secondary goal is to determine if dense array EEG can provide a
      useful biomarker for depression and its treatment in TLE. A structural MRI will be obtained
      before treatment and a dense array EEG before and after TMS treatment to assess for changes
      in specific dense array EEG based biomarkers.

      In addition to recruiting patients, the study staff will likewise request that family members
      or friends of the patient accompany the patient monitor him/her for increased seizure
      frequency. The recruited family member will bring the patient to the treatment and stay with
      the patient overnight at a local hotel and monitor for possible seizures or other adverse
      events of treatment. Family members will be instructed in seizure safety and be given
      emergency phone numbers to call if the patient is experiencing adverse effects of TMS.

    <description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a focal, nonpharmacological, noninvasive method for stimulating the brain and modulating neural network activity. To administer TMS, an electromagnetic coil is placed on the scalp, and uses electrical current to create magnetic fields that depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons in the brain.</description>
