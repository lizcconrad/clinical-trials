  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative analgesia for hallux valgus surgery (bunionectomy) is inconsistent and may even
      result in rebound pain when the (ankle) blocks wear off. It is hypothesized that the mixture
      of bupivacaine and liposome bupivacaine increases the extent and duration of postoperative
      analgesia and decreases opioid consumption as compared to bupivacaine alone or to general
      anesthesia.

             after completion of the study

          -  Able to demonstrate sensory function by exhibiting sensitivity to cold, pinprick, and
             light touch

          -  Able to understand the English or Dutch language, purpose and risks of the study,
             provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to use protected health

             hallux valgus and which may confound the postsurgical assessments (e.g., significant
             pain from other joints including chronic neuropathic pain, concurrent or prior
             contralateral knee or foot surgery)

             arthritis, coagulopathy, or loss of sensation in the extremities

             blood urea nitrogen level &gt;50 mg/dL [17.9 mmol/L]) or impaired liver function (e.g.,
             serum aspartate aminotransferase [AST] level &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  Suspected or known history of drug or alcohol abuse within the previous year

          -  Body weight &lt;40 kg (88 pounds) or a body mass index &gt;44 kg/m2

          -  Previous participation in an EXPAREL study

          -  Administration of an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives
