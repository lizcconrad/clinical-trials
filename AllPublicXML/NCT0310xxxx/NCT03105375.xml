      The purpose of this study is to assess and analyze the safety, tolerability and PK/PD data
      following single ascending and multiple ascending doses of X842 in healthy subjects.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open label, first-in-human study with the primary objective to
      evaluate safety and tolerability of X842 after administration of single and multiple oral
      ascending doses to healthy male and female subjects. The study comprises a Single Ascending
      Dose (SAD) part and a Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part including an open-label multiple
      dose cohort administered active comparator (omeprazole). Four subjects will be included in
      each of the SAD and MAD cohorts.
