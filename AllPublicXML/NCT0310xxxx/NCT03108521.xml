    <textblock>
      With the development of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, personalized medicine based on
      genetic are increasingly required clinically. Incretin-based therapy is currently the most
      popular diabetes treatment. This study mainly research the correlation of incretin-related
      gene polymorphism and individual differences in the response of these drugs from the
      following four aspects.

        1. . To study Chinese human gene polymorphism's mutation frequency and allele frequency, by
           screening Chinese people gene polymorphisms which affecting DPP-4 enzymatic activity.

        2. . To study the mutation frequency of DPP-4 mutation site(rs12469968, rs3788979,
           rs2284872, rs7565794) and GLP1R mutation site(rs3765467) in Chinese population.

        3. . By collecting clinical parameters and efficacy indicators to reveal the relationship
           between Chinese DPP-4 gene and GLP1R gene polymorphism on the clinical manifestations
           and drug response. This study will be improved based on actual experimental research
           methods, and design intervening measures for Chinese people, to explore the dose-effect
           relationship of DPP-4 and GLP1R gene polymorphism in the treatment of diabetes in
           Chinese population.

        4. . Incretins is a new generation hypoglycemic agent. By studying gene polymorphism and
           drug response, to research how to plan treatment for clinical diabetes with DPP-4 and
           GLP1R gene polymorphism. Provide the basis for individualized treatment of these drugs.
