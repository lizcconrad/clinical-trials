    <textblock>
      Maternity are latent or first stage of labor and complained of pain at the level of 4 or
      higher on a scale VAS, and are not in risk (HIGH RISK). And did not receive analgesics within
      4 hours.

      The sample will consist of at least 100 women in labor.

        1. women, will be identified in the reception room of a delivery room by midwives.

        2. The research team will ask for consent after receiving an explanation and confirmation
           of understanding.

        3. The midwife will perform and will record pain assessment by visual analog scores .

        4. Maternity reported pain level 4 and above will be asked four questions out of data
           collection and offered them treatment I.V. PARACETAMOL 1gr as directed by the physician.

        5. After giving I.V. PARACETAMOL 1g, carried out and documented estimate of the pain
           returns (by visual analog scores) after an hour wait at any time to wait four hours and
           two hours after birth.

           In cases of an outbreak of pain can give one of the following:

           Option A:

           Another portion of the I.V. PARACETAMOL 1gr within 4-6 hours the previous dose. The
           maximum daily dose of 4 grams.

           Option B:

           N2O by procedure

           A third possibility:

           Epidural physician approval

        6. At the end of the birth fetal blood sample taken from the placenta for testing the level
           of paracetamol.

        7. At the end of a blood sample taken birth for the client in liver function tests.

        8. Interview woman with postpartum questionnaire will be made during her stay in the
           maternity ward.

      Filling out a questionnaire that includes demographic data and about the process of birth,
      medical records.
