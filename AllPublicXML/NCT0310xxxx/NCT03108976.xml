  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly debilitating developmental syndromes which core
      feature is social and communications disorders. Motor skill impairments are frequently
      described in autism, but few studies have addressed the question of their origin and their
      specificity. Furthermore, it is not clear whether motor problems encountered in autism are
      related to dyspraxia, or if they present with specific features. This project aims at
      deciphering the origin of motor problems encountered by children who grow-up with autism in
      order to propose early interventions that could influence the other developmental
      trajectories, such as the social one.

      Brain dynamics during sensori-motor learning is explored by applying magnetoencephalography
      (MEG) during the Bimanual Load-Lifting paradigm. Different motor processes namely:
      proprioceptive monitoring, use and update of a sensori-motor representation, anticipatory
      executive control will be correlated to brain oscillation modulation, both topographically
      and temporally. Two groups of children (aged between 7 and 12) are compared: a group of
      children with ASD and a control group of typically developing children.
