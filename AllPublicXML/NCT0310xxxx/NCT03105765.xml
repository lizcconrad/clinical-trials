    <textblock>
      Chronic Pain, especially neuropathic pain, are adverse events after posterolateral
      thoracotomy for lung resection. The continuous application of ketamine may have a
      prophylactic effect and helps to prevent chronic pain. The investigators record the incidence
      and severity of acute pain and neuropathic pain during a seven day period after thoracotomy
      as well as the incidence of chronic pain and neuropathic pain after one and three month
      period. Parallel Group design, comparing one Group with a continuous application (24 hours)
      of ketamine against a Placebo Group.
