  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients affected by Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) need a safe and
      effective long-term treatment regimen. Unfortunately, there are still no disease-specific
      treatment for ADPKD approved in the US. A rational step towards identifying such agents is to
      test therapies that have a proven safety profile with mechanisms of action that can counter
      the disease progression.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether drinking increased amounts of water
      (water loading) might slow down polycystic kidney growth or kidney function decline. Water
      loading can cause the suppression of a pathway that causes fluid buildup and cyst growth.
      High water intake has been safely used in the clinical setting, such as in the case of kidney
      stone therapy. New York State tap water is widely available and safe, making it highly
      cost-effective as well.

      The study will involve 11 visits to the study site over 19 months. Participants will need to
      follow specific dietary and fluid recommendations. There will be physical examinations and
      medical history assessments at each visit. Testing will include undergoing magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), blood and urine tests. Study participants will be compensated for their time.
      Detailed study procedures will be reviewed upon contact with the study team.
