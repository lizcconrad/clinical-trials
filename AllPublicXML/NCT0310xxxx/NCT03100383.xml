  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the association of the number of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) consultations and
      eating behavior (cognitive restraint, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating) with GWG in
      women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

      Women in puerperium with known T2DM or GDM diagnosed at the hospital were invited to
      participate in the study. Gestational diabetes was diagnosed with a 75-g oral glucose
      tolerance test. Weight (kg) and height (m) were measured using a mechanical column scale
      (SECA).

      The specific dimensions of eating behavior were measured through the 18-item Three-Factor
      Eating Questionnaire-18 (TFEQ-18).

      The Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) was offered every 2-4 weeks. This therapy consists of
      providing a food plan with the following recommendations: limiting carbohydrate intake to
      35-45% of total calories calculated as 30 kcal/kg based on pregestational BMI for an ideal
      weight .

      We evaluated the effect of MNT on GWG using a multiple linear regression model
