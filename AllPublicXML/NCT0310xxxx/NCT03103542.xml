    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to describe the outcome of Immune Tolerance Induction
      (ITI) treatment performed with rFVIIIFc within a timeframe of 60 weeks in patients with
      haemophilia A who have failed previous attempts at tolerization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, interventional multi-center study designed to explore ITI
      performed with recombinant coagulation factor VIII Fc fusion protein (rFVIIIFc) within a
      timeframe of 60 weeks in patients with severe haemophilia A, who have failed previous
      attempts at tolerization including use of immunosuppressants.

             investigational drug has passed

         14. Foreseeable inability to cooperate with given instructions or study procedures

         15. Presence of any medical or psychological condition or laboratory result that in the
             opinion of the investigator can interfere with the patient's ability to comply with
