  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of childhood cancer are known to be at higher risk of developing premature, serious
      cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and
      diabetes increase this risk beyond that attributable to one's original cancer therapy
      exposures. Research has shown that childhood cancer survivors also have a high burden of
      underdiagnosis and undertreatment of these potentially modifiable conditions. The goal of
      this study is to:

        1. To determine the prevalence of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of common
           cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) in survivors of
           childhood cancer at high-risk of future serious cardiovascular disease.

        2. Among survivors who are found to be underdiagnosed or undertreated, to determine (via
           randomized clinical trial) the efficacy of an educational intervention to improve
           control of these cardiometabolic conditions.

        3. Determine barriers on among survivors enrolled on the randomized trial and their primary
           healthcare providers that contribute to undertreatment of the study's targeted
           cardiometabolic conditions.

      What is the CHIIP Study? The CHIIP Study is for Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) Study participants
      who are more likely to experience heart problems because of their cancer treatment. We want
      to figure out how common high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and high blood sugar
      are among LTFU Study participants.

      What will be asked of participants?

      LTFU Study participants who choose to enroll in this study will be asked to:

        -  Answer one or two short questionnaires about their medical history, current health,
           mood, lifestyle, and healthcare access.

        -  Schedule a one-time visit for an examiner to come to their home (or another location
           chosen by the participant) to measure blood pressure, height, weight, waist
           circumference, and to draw blood to test their cholesterol and blood sugar.

        -  If all the test results are normal, the participant will be done with the study. If the
           participant has a higher than normal test result, they will remain in the study and be
           randomly assigned to one of two groups to learn how to improve health. A year later,
           participants in both groups will be asked to repeat the tests mentioned above.

      What's in it for participants? Participants will have some basic health measurements done for
      free, including height, weight, blood pressure, and blood levels of cholesterol and sugar.

      The participant and their primary care provider will receive a copy of all these test results
      free of cost. We hope the information we gather will provide future benefits for people who
      were treated for cancer as children.
