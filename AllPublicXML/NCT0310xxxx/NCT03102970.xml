  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is between 8 and 12% of the
      adult population. This prevalence is expected to increase over the coming decades due to the
      aging of the population and the continued exposure to risk factors for the disease. The
      evolution of COPD is marked by the occurrence of exacerbations of varying severity and
      patients are frequently admitted to the emergency department for evaluation, treatment and /
      or hospitalization. Admission in emergency department for COPD exacerbation represents
      approximately 1% of emergency admission.

      Chronic pain is common in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The
      pain intensity may increase during acute episodes of exacerbations. This study is aimed to
      compare pain intensity during exacerbation and stable phase of patients with chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Chronic pain is common in patients with Chronic Obstructive pulmonary Disease (COPD). The
      pain intensity may increase during acute episodes of exacerbation. Fifty (50) patients in
      acute exacerbation of COPD will be included in the emergency department of CHU Grenoble Alpes
      and Hôpital du Sacré Coeur de Montréal. The intensity and characteristics of pain will be
      evaluated from the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) and the Brief Pain Inventory
      (BPI). Assessment of respiratory status, anxiety and depression, and clinical and biological
      data, defining the severity of exacerbation, will also be collected. A 30-day follow-up
      visit, after a return to the stable state of COPD, allowed the realization of Respiratory
      Functional Exploration and the same questionnaires.
