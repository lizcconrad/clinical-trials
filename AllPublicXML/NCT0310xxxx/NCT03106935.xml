    <textblock>
      The present study is divided into two groups ,one is the patients with subclinical
      hypothyroidism who has TPO antibody positive women with TSH concentrations &gt; 2.5 mU/L and
      below the upper limit of the pregnancy specific reference range ,another is TPO antibody
      negative with TSH concentrations greater than the pregnancy specific reference range and
      below 10.0 mU/L.The two groups are randomized into either the LT4 treatment group or control
      group by the use of a computer-generated list.

      The aim of our study is to determine whether the use of levothyroxine is beneficial in
      patients with subclinical hypothyroidism in two groups。

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have stratified the risk imparted by hypothyroidism according to TPOAb status,
      and consistently show that this risk is higher in TPOAb positive women. Some data also
      suggest that the adverse impact associated with maternal TSH levels is apparent at lower TSH
      elevations in women known to be TPOAb positive compared to women who are TPOAb negative.
      Furthermore, studies suggest a reduction in pregnancy loss when TPOAb positive women are
      treated with levothyroxine, even when biochemically euthyroid. Intervention trials have not
      been performed in TPOAb negative women. A etiology analysis process,from June 2010 to June
      2015 in The Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, were showed that 22.2% of total
      917 cases who had RPL history present as abnormal serum TSH level or positive TPOAb, while
      36.6% of 523 cases who repregnancy present as abnormal.This present study is divided into two
      groups ,one is the patients with subclinical hypothyroidism who hasTPO antibody positive
      women with TSH concentrations &gt; 2.5 mU/L and below the upper limit of the pregnancy specific
      reference range ,another is TPO antibody negative with TSH concentrations greater than the
      pregnancy specific reference range and below 10.0 mU/L.The two groups are randomized into
      either the LT4 treatment group or control group by the use of a computer-generated list.For
      the LT4 treatment group, 50μg LT4 (Merck Serono, Geneva,Switzerland) was administered every
      morning from the first day of diagnosed as subclinical hypothyroidism and continued up to the
      day of serum β-HCG measurement.If pregnancy was confirmed, levothyroxine dose need to
      increase 25-30% and be adjusted according to the pregnancy specific reference range ( T1
      0.1－2.5mIU/L,T2 0.2-3.0mIU/L, T3 0.3-3.0mIU/L).For the control group ,women with subclinical
      hypothyroidism are not given any drugs . The aim of our study is to determine whether the use
      of levothyroxine is beneficial in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism who has TPO
      antibody positive women with TSH concentrations &gt; 2.5 mU/L and below the upper limit of the
      pregnancy specific reference range or TPO antibody negative with TSH concentrations greater
      than the pregnancy specific reference range and below 10.0 mU/L.

    <description>The research doctor site telephoned every participant at between 6 and 7 weeks of gestation, to ensure there were arrangements for an ultrasound appointment with her usual carers, before 8 weeks of gestation. If an appointment had not been booked, the research doctor assisted with booking. The research doctor telephoned each participant again between 3 and 5 days after the scheduled date of the ultrasound appointment, to obtain details of the observations of a gestational sac.</description>

    <description>The research doctor site telephoned each participant between 10 and 12 weeks of gestation, to ensure there were arrangements for an ultrasound appointment with her usual carers, at between 12 and 14 weeks of gestation. As previously, the research doctor assisted with booking an appointment if necessary, and telephoned the participant afterwards to obtain details of variables such as fetal heartbeat. The research doctor also recorded the expected date of delivery at this stage.</description>
