  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no study of the association between ScO2 and POCD in non-cardiac, thoracic or
      vascular surgery. The few studies found in cardiac, thoracic and vascular surgery show an
      incidence up to 50% with a variation of the ScO2 threshold which varies between 15 and 25%
      according to the studies.

      Age is the main risk of OCDD. The management of this pathology should be early to avoid loss
      of autonomy of the patient. Finding a relationship, if it exists, would therefore
      significantly improve the mortality and morbidity of the said patient.
