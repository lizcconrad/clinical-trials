  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent observations in Germany revealed above-average high proportions of refugees affected
      by infectious diseases of public health significance. Scrutiny of the vaccination status
      showed sizeable presence of seronegative subjects, with conspicuously higher prevalence among
      children and adolescents, thus indicating urgent necessity of i) rapid identification of
      carriers of vaccine-preventable diseases and ii) adjustment of protection against such
      infections to European Standards. Rapid immune status check needs comprehensive diagnostic
      tool permitting simultaneous assessment of seropositivity. Validation of such tools requires
      comparisons of the immune status of subjects with known vaccination history with that of
      migrants with incomplete or missing health and vaccination records.

    <textblock>
      The current massive inflow of refugees and migrants poses urgent necessity of i) rapid
      identification of carriers of communicable diseases and ii) adjustment of protection against
      vaccine-preventable infections to European standards. While universal vaccination is supposed
      to ensure the intended degree of protection, targeted vaccination on the basis of previous
      assessment of the immune status (seropositivity) was repeatedly shown to be a cost-efficient
      alternative. Currently, the broad use of immune status assessment prior to targeted
      vaccination is impeded by the necessity to apply separate seropositivity detection assays for
      each individual condition. This drawback can be overcome by the introduction of a
      comprehensive diagnostic tool permitting simultaneous assessment of seropositivity for
      several vaccine-preventable infections.

      The objective of the present study consists in compilation of an array of sera from

        -  subjects with known history of immunization against vaccine-preventable infections for
           which vaccines are routinely available (measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus,
           pertussis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, meningococcal infection) and

        -  new migrants/refugees without reliable vaccination records and undefined immune status
           to be subsequently used for the validation of a multi-pronged diagnostic tool for
           seropositivity detection
