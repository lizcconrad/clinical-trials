  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study tests whether contemplative-based intervention can modify pathogenic processes in
      participants with Lupus. Techniques such as meditation, mindfulness and yoga may have an
      impact on the disease and may decrease psychological distress, increase self-regulation
      capabilities, and reduce pain. Additionally, incorporating patients' caregivers may
      strengthen their relationships and, thereby, improve their health and well-being.

      The objective of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of an innovative
      contemplative-based and caregiver-inclusive intervention can modify pathogenic processes in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Contemplative techniques such as meditation, mindfulness
      and yoga may have an impact on the disease burden and may decrease psychological distress,
      increase self-regulation capabilities, and reduce pain. Research also suggests that
      contemplative practices, such as an intensive mindfulness intervention, may have a direct
      effect on the underlying disease process itself by altering epigenetic control of gene
      expression, decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production and reestablishing immunologic
      homeostasis. It is also well documented that social relationships moderate physical health.
      Incorporating patients' caregivers may strengthen their relationships and thereby improve
      their health and well-being. It is anticipated that the successful outcome of the
      intervention described in this proposal will provide the basis for a new and effective
      contemplative-based and caregiver-inclusive therapy for SLE and other rheumatic diseases.

             rating scales and questionnaires accurately

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus

          -  Must pass the initial MRI screening administered over the phone

          -  Inclusion criteria for support person: must be able to attend sessions with SLE
             patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             meditation practice)

          -  Any current Axis I DSM-IV-TR psychiatric disorder that, in the clinician's opinion,
             warrants treatment or would preclude safe participation in the protocol, including,
             but not limited to: psychosis, schizophrenia, dementia, schizotypal personality
             disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, primary diagnosis of
             eating disorder, or chronic suicidality or homicidality.

          -  Have clinical evidence of significant unstable or uncontrolled acute or chronic
             diseases not related to SLE (i.e., diabetes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic,
             gastrointestinal, neurological, or infectious) which, in the opinion of the treating
             physician, could confound the results of the study or put the patients at undue risk

          -  Chronic use of prescribed or recreational psychoactive drugs (self-reported)

          -  Have current drug or alcohol abuse or dependence, or a history of drug or alcohol

          -  Too sick to meaningfully participate (e.g. hospitalized, flaring at the time of
             screening)

          -  In order to participate in the MRI portion of the study, participants must pass the
             in-person MRI screening administered by the MRI technician before each MRI. If
             participants fail the in-person MRI screening, they will be excluded from the MRI
             portion of the study, but can still participate in the intervention and blood draw
             portions of the study.
