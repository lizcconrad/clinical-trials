  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From November 2014 to October 2015, a multi-centers retrospective study was conducted to
      collect compliance, and 8 three-level hospitals from China were included. The infants
      survived to a postmenstrual age of 36 week with birth weight less than 1500g and without
      congenital disease. The birth weight, gestational age, morbidities and poor outcomes( death,
      cerebral palsy, cognitive, et al) were recorded. Data were analyzed with Chi-square test to
      observe the relationship between morbidities and poor outcomes. And the predictive effect on
      the number of the top three morbidities were analyzed by Logistic regression analysis.
