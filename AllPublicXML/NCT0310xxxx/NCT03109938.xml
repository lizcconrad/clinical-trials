  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic diagnosis of lateral spreading tumours (LST) with submucosal invasion is important
      in guiding the treatment strategy. The use of advanced imaging is not standard clinical
      practice in China. A clinical trial is now under way comparing the accuracy of narrow band
      imaging (NBI), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and magnifying chromoendoscopy (MCE) for the
      diagnosis of LST with submucosal invasion.

      diagnosis of LST with submucosal invasion.The final histologic diagnosis was used as the true
      diagnosis in the present study. By comparing the consistency of histologic diagnosis and
      preoperative evaluation,the diagnostic accuracies of various endoscopic examination
      techniques(narrow band imaging , endoscopic ultrasonography , and magnifying chromoendoscopy)
      was calculated respectively.
