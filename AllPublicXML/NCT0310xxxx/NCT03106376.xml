  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the impact of hypoxic and hyperoxic breathing on measures of brain redox
      balance and metabolism in healthy individuals. All participants will undergo an MRI scan
      during administration of air mixtures with different oxygen concentrations to collect the
      brain measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Molecular oxygen (O2) constitutes 21% of the air people breathe at sea level. But humans can
      safely be exposed to somewhat lower and higher concentrations of oxygen. The varying amounts
      of oxygen entering the body modulate the oxygen available in tissue, ultimately leading to
      change in redox balance and metabolism. The investigators recently developed non-invasive
      MRI-based techniques to quantify redox balance and ATP generation in the brain. These
      processes are thought to be abnormal in people with psychiatric disorders.

      In this study, the investigators aim to manipulate the concentration of oxygen in the
      breathed air in 2 separate MRI scans on consecutive days (16% and 26%). The investigators
      anticipate that healthy individuals will demonstrate changes in brain redox balance and
      metabolism in response to these modulations.
