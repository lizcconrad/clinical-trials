  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Determine if audio recorded guided imagery vs deep breathing exercises delivered via a
           digital media player improves abdominal pain symptoms in children with functional
           gastrointestinal pain disorders managed in the primary care setting.

        2. Determine if audio recorded guided imagery and deep breathing exercises delivered via a
           digital media player improves psychosocial distress in children affected by functional
           gastrointestinal pain disorders managed in the primary care setting.

      The possibility of treating functional gastrointestinal pain disorders using remotely
      delivered psychosocial therapies has the potential to treat many children affected by
      functional gastrointestinal pain disorders in a cost-effective manner. This study will
      provide insight into how well these patients in the primary care could benefit from such
      interventions.

      Children managed in primary care with a functional gastrointestinal pain disorder will be
      recruited and studied for this trial. After participants are deemed eligible, they will
      complete multiple questionnaires and then be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to
      either guided imagery or deep breathing exercises delivered via a digital media player.
      Participants will be instructed to listen to the tracks at least 5 days per week for an 8
      week intervention period.

      At week 3 of the intervention period, the participant will complete another 2 week pain and
      stool diary.

      At week 7 of the intervention period, the participant will complete another 2 week pain and
      stool dairy. After this diary is completed, the participant will again complete multiple
      questionnaires for their final visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children who meet criteria for a functional gastrointestinal pain disorder.

          2. Children who manage their abdominal pain in the primary care setting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children who have other comorbidities that are associated with chronic abdominal pain
             including abdominal surgery and other medical diagnoses that can cause chronic
             abdominal pain.

          2. Children with an intellectual disability which would hamper their ability to
             communicate with study staff about their pain and complete study questionnaires.

          3. Children who have presented to a gastroenterologist for abdominal pain management

          4. Children who have previously used deep breathing exercises or guided imagery to manage
             their abdominal pain.
