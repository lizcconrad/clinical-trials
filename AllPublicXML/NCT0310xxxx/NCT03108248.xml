  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein tumor thrombosis
      (PVTT), the survival benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains modest. This
      study aimed to investigate whether TACE in combination with irradiation stent placement (ISP)
      could prolong the survival in patients with HCC and PVTT.

    <description>Conventional TACE was performed in both groups as follows. First, multiple angiographies were performed to detect the hepatic arterial anatomy and the possible feeding arteries of tumor, selective catheterization of the artery feeding the tumors was performed. A mixture of ethiodized oil was injected, followed by injection of Gelfoam particles.</description>

    <description>In the ISP-TACE group, stent placement was performed one week before TACE. Under fluoroscopic and ultrasonic guidance, the outer stent was firstly placed at the site of the obstructed portal vein, and a self-expandable nitinol stent was immediately followed through a same 10-F sheath.</description>

        Between January 2011 and December 2016, patients with HCC and PVTT underwent TACE combined
        with irradiation stent placement or TACE monotherapy as an initial treatment at the
        authors' center were retrospectively reviewed.
