  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The performance of keratoplasty is hampered by the limited availability of donor cornea in
      many countries, especially in Asia. For this reason, attempts have been made to fabricate
      artificial substitutes for natural human cornea. So far, all polymeric biomaterials, such as
      collagen configurations and plastic compression, could mimic the functional optically
      transparent but failed to replicate the complicate three-dimension microstructure of natural
      cornea. Therefore, despite some favorable results yielded by polymeric biomaterials, they
      cannot be suited for long-term use. To overcome these disadvantages, in recent years, porcine
      cornea appeared specifically attractive for xenotransplantation, because of its accessibility
      and similarities to natural human cornea. However, xenotransplantation using fresh porcine
      cornea can occurs hyperacute immune rejection, resulting in graft failure. Such transplant
      rejection can be substantially lessened by using acellular porcine cornea (APC), which
      preserves the constructure of natural cornea, whilst having well biocompatibility and low
      antigenicity. These properties feature APC particularly suitable for high-risk keratoplasty,
      such as corneal grafting in infectious keratitis.

      Use of APC in LK has been shown promise in many preclinical animal studies and initially in
      human clinic trail. However, to optimize APC biological and biomechanical properties, the
      strategies for its preparation has evolved extensively over recent years, like various
      decellularization approaches (e.g. detergents, enzymes, human sera, hypertonic solutions and
      et al) and additional procedures (e.g. collagen re-crosslinking and repeated frozen-dry).
      Therefore, in the current study, the investigators analyzed the early surgical outcomes of
      deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) using the APC that was very recently approved by
      the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC) of China for clinic practice, for
      management of infective keratitis, including fungal, viral and acanthamoeba keratitis. Here
      major concern of this study was to clarify the behavior of APC after implantation in
      participants.
