    <textblock>
      In a cluster-randomized design, the study evaluates the effectiveness of a skill- training
      program for social work professionals with the aim of improving the follow-up of low income
      families within Norwegian labor and welfare services. While the Norwegian Labor and Welfare
      Administration are responsible for developing and implementing the program, researchers at
      Oslo and Akershus University College are conducting an independent evaluation of its
      effectiveness. By close follow up and better coordination of existing services the model aims
      to improve the financial and housing situation of the family, labor market attachment among
      the parents and the social inclusion of children. The cluster-randomized field experiment
      will take place over a 40-month period, involving 29 labor and welfare offices, 58 family
      coordinators and, based on estimations, 650 families. The research is funded by the Norwegian
      Labor and Welfare Administration.

      The project is financed by Labour and Welfare Administration and led by Ira
      Malmberg-Heimonen, Faculty of Social Sciences. Participants in the project are: Ira
      Malmberg-Heimonen (project leader), Anne Grete Tøge, Krisztina Gyüre, Knut Fossestøl,
      Marianne Rugkåsa, Berit Bergheim and Tone Liodden.

      Comprehensive follow up of low-income families. A cluster-randomised study. Start 1.1 2016,

      The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration has developed a comprehensive model in order
      to improve the follow-up of low income families, and thereby decrease poverty and its
      consequences. By close follow up and better coordination of existing services the model aims
      to improve the financial and housing situation of the family, labour market attachment among
      the parents and the social inclusion of children.

      Oslo and Akershus University College has been commissioned to evaluate the effects of the
      model between 2016 to 2019, with long-term follow-ups until 2021. The evaluation is conducted
      as a cluster-randomized controlled trial, where 29 labor and welfare offices have been
      randomly assigned to the experimental and control group. All 29 offices receive funding two
      family coordinators each in order to work with low-income families. While the experimental
      group offices implement the HOLF-model for the follow-up of low income families, the control
      group offices implement locally developed models.

      Prior to randomization, a baseline questionnaire was collected from office leaders and
      family-coordinators, while baseline information on families is collected based on
      administrative data prior to randomization and questionnaire data after randomization, but
      prior taking part in family projects. Shorter-term effects will be measured + 12 months after
      baseline for families, and long-term effects will be measured based on administrative data
      fup to four years after baseline.

      Researchers at Oslo and Akershus University College analyses the implementation processes and
      effects of the implementation through questionnaires, administrative data, observational
      data, qualitative interviews with leaders, family coordinators and families.

      The project will contribute to increased knowledge about measures to improve the follow up of
      low income families. It will generate knowledge of whether the HOLF-model is more effective
      than locally developed follow-up models, knowledge important for the discussion of
      evidence-informed vs practice-based interventions.

      The project is financed by Labor and Welfare Administration and led by Ira Malmberg-Heimonen,
      Faculty of Social Sciences.

      Participants in the project are: Ira Malmberg-Heimonen (project leader), Anne Grete Tøge,
      Krisztina Gyüre, Knut Fossestøl, Marianne Rugkåsa, Berit Bergheim and Tone Liodden.

After baseline at office leader and family coordinator level as well as administrative data for families in target group, offices have been randomized to experimental and control group offices. The HOLF-model is implemeted in experimental group offices, while control group offices implement local family projects. Effects on families are analysed on the four main follow-up areas: employment, housing, financial situation and the social situation of the children.</intervention_model_description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

             latest 12 months, or

          -  received social assistance in addition to other types of welfare support at least for
             six of the latest 12 months, and

          -  have up to four children under the age of 16. Based on these criteria offices
             identified a total of 3201 families.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             with relatives or other caregivers.

          -  the family is under investigation by child welfare authorities, due to suspected child
             neglect or that a placement to new caregivers is in process.
