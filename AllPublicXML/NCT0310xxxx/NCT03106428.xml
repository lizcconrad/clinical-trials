  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess safety and tolerability, describe the dose-limiting toxicities, determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the highest protocol-defined dose (maximum administered dose)
      in the absence of establishing the MTD, and a recommended dose for further evaluation of
      MEDI7247 in patients with selected hematological malignancies who have relapsed after, or are
      refractory to prior standard therapy, and for whom there is no standard salvage regimen
      available.

          1. Confirmed relapsed/refractory diagnosis of select hematologic malignancies for which
             no standard/salvage therapies are available.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of screening.

          3. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 during dose finding,
             0-2 during MTD expansion

          5. CrCL ≥ 40 mL/min

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized
             male partner must use at least one highly effective method of contraception from 7
             days post-screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 90 days
             after the last dose of investigational product.

          7. Nonsterilized male patients who are sexually active with a female partner of
             childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from 7 days
             post-screening and for 90 days after receipt of the last dose of investigational
             product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 21 days (or 42 days for nitrosureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to the first scheduled dose of MEDI7247.

          2. Received major surgery (as defined by the Investigator), radiotherapy, or
             immunotherapy within 28 days of the first scheduled dose of MEDI7247.

          3. Received an investigational drug within 14 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter,
             of the first scheduled dose of MEDI7247 or not recovered from associated toxicities.

          4. Patients who have previously received an autologous SCT, are excluded if less than 90
             days have elapsed from the time of transplant or the patient has not recovered from
             transplant-associated toxicities prior to the first scheduled dose of MEDI7247.

          5. Failure to recover from all prior treatment-related non-hematological toxicities to ≤
             Grade 1 prior to the first scheduled dose of MEDI7247 (except for alopecia and
             neuropathy).

          6. Patients at risk of non-disease related major bleeding (eg, recent GI hemorrhage or
             neurosurgery, within previous 21 days).

          7. Current severe active systemic disease including active concurrent malignancy

          8. Central nervous system (CNS) disease that is untreated, symptomatic, or requires
             therapy to control symptoms.

          9. Active human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C
             virus (HCV) infections at the time of screening.
