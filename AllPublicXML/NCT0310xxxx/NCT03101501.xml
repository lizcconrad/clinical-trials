      The clinical objective of this study is to evaluate the RaindropÂ® Near Vision Inlay for the
      improvement of near vision in presbyopic or pseudophakic patients treated with low dose
      Mitomycin C immediately following femtosecond flap creation.

    <textblock>
      The scientific objective of this study is to evaluate the postoperative incidence of corneal
      reaction in patients treated with low dose Mitomycin C, immediately following femtosecond
      flap creation (LASIK correction if needed), and before implantation with the Raindrop corneal
      inlay in the non-dominant eye. The postoperative incidence of haze, visible by broad
      tangential illumination of the slit lamp, is known to adversely impact the safety and
      efficacy of the Raindrop corneal inlay. Three main strategies have been employed to minimize
      haze incidence after surgery: (i) perfection of the surgical technique, (ii) deeper
      implantation in the cornea, and (iii) extension of the steroid regimen after surgery. Haze
      has also been observed after another type of corneal refractive procedure, Photorefractive
      Keratectomy (PRK). Several prospective studies have shown that Mitomycin C, applied
      immediately following the PRK laser procedure, is effective in reducing the postoperative
      incidence of haze.
