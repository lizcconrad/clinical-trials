  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who are perinatally-infected with HIV are extremely vulnerable to cognitive delays
      and psychiatric disease, and the risk for neuropsychiatric illness is compounded in children
      who are internationally-adopted and may have suffered trauma, abandonment, malnutrition and
      neglect. While cognitive and psychiatric issues have been described in HIV-infected children,
      and even more so in HIV-positive adults, there have been no reports on neuropsychiatric
      interventions that can improve cognitive and psychiatric states in this highly vulnerable
      population. Without these needed data, Pediatric HIV providers have not been able to advocate
      for optimal neuropsychiatric care in perinatally HIV-infected children, let alone those who
      has suffered the additional risk of being internationally adopted. In the proposed study, the
      investigators will report on the neuropsychological profiles and outcomes in a cohort of
      internationally-adopted, perinatally HIV-infected children between ages 6 to 16 years who
      have not previously undergone neuropsychological testing or treatment. Data obtained from
      this study will provide important contributions to the literature by building understanding
      of the complex needs of this population as well as guiding future intervention efforts. The
      investigators predict that intervention efforts aimed at helping educators understand the
      learning and cognitive challenges for many of our patients will guide targeted academic
      supports in the school setting and lead to gains in academic skills. The detailed information
      obtained during the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and follow-up care will be
      shared with the child's key educators at school so that individualized educational strategies
      can be developed, while maintaining confidentiality regarding the child's HIV status.
