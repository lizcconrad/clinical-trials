    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate comparatively the efficiency of traditional treatment
      methods in patients with chronic venous diseases of C6 class, and a new combined low level
      laser therapy (LLLT) by LASMIK device.

      The results of outpatient examination and treatment of patients with venous trophic ulcers,
      observed in the City Polyclinic of &quot;Tula Municipal Clinical Hospital №2&quot; were analyzed.

      During a longitudinal study, a group of patients was followed up in the period of complete or
      partial recovery. International classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders
      СЕАР was used as a clinical classification of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI).

      Depending on the applied treatment method, patients were divided into 2 groups:

        1. (n=34) Conventional treatment

        2. (n=34) Conventional treatment + combined LLLT, including external exposure with 635nm
           wavelength + intravenous laser blood illumination (ILBI) with 365-405nm (UV-spectrum)
           and 520-525nm (green spectrum) wavelength alternately, according to the special scheme

    <description>Conventional treatment only.
An elastic compression of lower extremities: elastic bandages or compression hosiery of class 2
Pharmacotherapy: Anavenol, Aescusan, Glyvenol; drugs of the Benzopyrone group, including Troxevasin and Venoruton. Trental, Aspirin and Ticlid (Ticlopidine). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Nimesil, OKI), various ointments containing Heparin, corticosteroids, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Antibiotic therapy.
Topical treatment: in the presence of purulent discharge (phase I of the wound healing process) - bandaging with antiseptic solutions (1% Iodopiron solution, 0.1% Chlorhexidine solution) and hydrophilic ointments (Levosin, Levomecol). In phases II and III - after ulcer cleansing the preparations based on Hyaluronic acid (Curiozin).</description>

    <description>Conventional therapy and combined LLLT (LASMIK device) was performed. External exposure was conducted on the 1-4 affected area during one session for 2 minutes per zone in pulsed mode, light pulse duration - 100-130ns, wavelength - 635nm, by a matrix emitter consisting of eight laser diodes with a surface area of 8cm2, at a distance of up to 7cm, with pulsed power of 40W. ILBI was conducted in continuous mode with wavelength between 365-405nm (UV-spectrum) and 520-525nm (green spectrum) alternately, during 12 daily treatment sessions according to the scheme:
- 365-405nm, power 1-2mW, exposure 2 min;
- 520-525nm, 1-2mW, 5 min;
- 365-405nm, 1-2mW, 2 min;
