  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, six-sequence, three-period cross-over
      study in asthma patients. The study will consist of a 14-day screening period, followed by a
      14-day run-in period, and a treatment epoch which consists of three treatment periods, with a
      minimum duration of 14 days each followed (for the 2 first treatment periods) by a wash-out
      period. The duration of each treatment period may be extended up to a duration of 18 days if
      needed for operational reasons. The third treatment period will be followed by a Study
      Completion evaluation at 1-7 days following the last dose. The treatment periods will be
      separated by wash-out periods of 14 to 21 days duration.

          -  On a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

               -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 60 % and &lt; 100% of the predicted normal value for the
                  patient during screening.

                  administration of 400 μg salbutamol/360 μg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at
                  Screening. All patients must perform a reversibility test at Screening.

                  in the SOM. Sitting and standing vital signs should be within the following
                  ranges:

          -  oral body temperature between 35.0-37.5 °C

             hospitalization or emergency room visit within 1 year of Screening.

          -  Patients who have had previous intubation for a severe asthma ttack/exacerbation.

          -  Patients with a history of clinically relevant bronchoconstriction upon repeated
             forced expiratory maneuvers.

          -  History of paradoxical bronchospasm in response to inhaled medicines.

          -  Patients who during the run-in period prior to randomization require the use of ≥12
             puffs / 24 hours of rescue medication for 48 hours (over two consecutive days) or who
             have a decline in PEF from the reference PEFof ≥ 30% for 6 consecutive scheduled PEF
             readings
