    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the Veinplicity Device as an adjunctive IV
      cannulation tool in subjects with a history of difficult to access veins. The Veinplicity
      Device is intended to improve venous access rates in compromised patients by taking advantage
      of the increased circulation that results from provoked muscle stimulation. The study
      collected information about the device, intravenous access, user and patient perceptions for
      IV access, and any device or procedural complications or other adverse events. Device use was
      examined with patients in both a prone and upright position.

    <description>All subjects received treatment (stimulation-assisted) with the Veinplicity Device per the Instructions for Use. The subject underwent standard IV cannulation using a 20 gauge cannula into the available vein immediately after completion of device stimulation. Use of a tourniquet was at the discretion of the nurse performing the IV cannulation.</description>
