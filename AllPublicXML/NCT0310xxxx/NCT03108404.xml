  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pretern premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM) remains the leading cause of preterm
      deliveries and neonatal mortality and morbidity. PPROM is defined as rupture of the fetal
      membranes prior to 37 weeks' gestation. PPROM complicates 2-4% of all pregnancies and
      accounts for approximately 30 % of preterm births.

      The etiology of PPROM remains elusive. PPROM is one of the main causes of prematurity and its
      complications, such as newborn respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis, necrotizing
      enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage, perventricular leucomalacia, varying degrees of
      lung hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. All these factors contribute greatly to an
      increase in neonatal morbidity and mortality Management of PPROM followed actual guidelines.
      Conservative management to prolong a pregnancy is a classical approach to treat PPROM before
      34 weeks' gestation in association with antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids.

      Maternal and neonatal data were collected from maternal and newborns medical records.
