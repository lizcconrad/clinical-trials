      OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS:

      The objective of this study will be to examine the effects of watching a screen or listening
      to music while exercising on acute energy intake and expenditure. It is hypothesized that the
      post-exercise energy compensation will be greater in both conditions with stimuli (i.e.,
      screen and music) compared with the control condition (i.e., exercise alone).

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Randomized, 3-condition crossover study (within-subjects experimental design).

      PARTICIPANTS:

      The present study will recruit 25 male adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 years.
      Participants will be recruited via advertisements and word of mouth (first come first served
      approach).

      OVERVIEW OF THE STUDY PROTOCOL:

      Preliminary Visit The participants will attend one baseline session and three experimental
      sessions. The preliminary visit will include measurements related to anthropometry (body
      weight, height, waist circumference) and resting metabolic rate. Participants will also
      complete questionnaires in order to better characterize them.

      Experimental Sessions Each participant will be engaged in each of the following three 30-min
      experimental conditions followed by an ad libitum lunch: (1) walking/jogging on a treadmill
      at 60% of VO2 peak while watching a screen (exercise + screen); (2) walking/jogging on a
      treadmill at 60% of VO2 peak while listening to music (exercise + music); and (3)
      walking/jogging on a treadmill at 60% of VO2 peak with no other stimulus (control condition).

      MEASUREMENTS:

      The main measures for this study include: anthropometric measurements, food intake, appetite
      sensations, energy expenditure, resting metabolic rate, and ratings of perceived exertion.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The primary outcome measure will be post-exercise energy compensation. The food intake
      outcome will be assessed by using an ad libitum test meal immediately after the conditions
      and a dietary record for the remainder of the day. The energy expenditure outcome will be
      assessed by using an Actical accelerometer until bedtime. The secondary outcome measures will
      include appetite sensations and the ratings of perceived exertion (OMNI scale).
