        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults with chronic HCV genotype 1, 4 infection with or without HIV infection aged 18
             years or above

          -  HCV RNA plasma concentration of at least 1000 IU / mL

          -  Subjects previously treated with NS5A-based regimens for at least 8 weeks.

          -  Patients with HCV relapse after receiving a complete treatment with NS5A-based AAD
             regimen for at least 8 weeks and becoming undetectable at the end of treatment.
             Relapse is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA detectable upon completion of therapy of A5
             based on NS5A against HCV.

          -  Subjects with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child A) could be included.

          -  For patients with HIV coinfection:

               -  Be infected with HIV-1, documented by any rapid HIV test with the corresponding
                  license and confirmed by a Western blot or second antibody test using a method
                  other than the initial rapid HIV and / or I / CIA method or by HIV-1 p24 antigen
                  or viral load of HIV-1 RNA plasma.

               -  Be on stable HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 4 weeks prior to entry
                  into the study using a dual ITN backbone of tenofovir or abacavir and
                  emtricitabine or lamivudine PLUS raltegravir or dolutegravir or rilpivirine (with
                  CD4 + T cell count&gt; 100 cells / mm 3 and undetectable HIV-1 RNA at baseline.
                  Results from prior analysis will be accepted within 24 weeks prior to study
                  entry).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with hepatitis other than C or steatosis.

          -  Subjects previously treated less than 8 weeks with regimens based on NS5A.

          -  Evidence of previous hepatocellular carcinoma although it has criteria of cure

          -  Subjects with past or current decompensated liver disease; Only decompensated patients
             who have received a liver transplant and have not decompensated after transplantation
             will be included.

          -  Subjects suspected of clinical or genotypic reinfection of HCV.

          -  Subject with HCV response regrowth while receiving NS5A-based ADA therapy against HCV.
             Said regrowth is defined as a confirmation of detectable HCV RNA after achieving
             undetectable HCV RNA during NS5A-based AADs against HCV.

          -  Recent history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Important comorbidities.

               -  Pregnant, lactating or non-lactating women Contraceptives, if they are women of

                  less than 12 months.

               -  Subjects with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 ml / min.
