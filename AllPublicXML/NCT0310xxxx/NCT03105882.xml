        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  16-70 years of age, inclusive

          -  AIS A classification of traumatic spinal cord injury with a neurological level within
             C5-T1 inclusive

          -  Recent injury

          -  Non-penetrating SCI

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Terminally ill subjects not likely to be able to participate in follow-up

          -  Incomplete spinal cord injury (AIS B, C, D, and E injuries)

          -  No identifiable intra-spinal cavity following myelotomy/irrigation in the contused
             spinal cord in which a Scaffold can be placed

          -  Spinal cord injury associated with significant traumatic brain injury or coma that

          -  Radiographic or visual evidence of parenchymal dissociation or anatomic transection as
             determined by the Investigator where the contusion completely bridges a full
             cross-section of the spinal cord

          -  Subjects with spinal cord injuries directly due to gunshot, knife, or other
             penetrating wounds
