      Aim: To develop a nurse-led, home-based self-management psychosocial education programme,
      entitled HOMe-based HEart Failure Self-Management Programme (HOM-HEMP), and evaluate its
      effects in improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being,
      self-efficacy, self-care behavior and social support, as well as clinical outcomes among
      older patients with CHF in Singapore.

      Background: The number of elderly people is expected to increase in the coming decades, and
      so too the prevalence of with chronic heart failure (CHF) is expected to increase. Since CHF
      is a chronic condition, there is a need to develop programmes that will improve the quality
      of life of older patients who have to manage this condition for years to come.

      Design: A stratified, three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) will be adopted.

      Methodology: The HOM-HEMP is designed a six-week home-based psychosocial education programme
      comprising of a specifically developed HF Tool Kit and a supplementary smartphone app. A
      consecutive sample of 213 older patients with CHF will be recruited from the cardiac ward of
      a tertiary public hospital in Singapore. They will be randomly assigned to the control group,
      or experimental group A (HOM-HEMP without App) or the experimental group B (HOM-HEMP with
      App). A research nurse will be delivering the HOM-HEMP to the participants in the
      experimental groups, while another research assistant who is blinded to participants' group
      assignment will be responsible for data collection. Data will be collected at baseline, at 6
      weeks immediate after the intervention, and at 3 and 6 months from the baseline. At the end
      of the programme, a process evaluation will be conducted to assess the acceptability,
      strengths and weaknesses of the HOM-HEMP based on the participants' perspectives.

      Discussion: It is expected the proposed RCT will make a contribution to knowledge development
      of the effectiveness of the HOM-HEMP and the active ingredients of the programme.

      Specific Aims

      The primary aims of this study are:

        1. To develop a nurse-led, home-based self-management psychosocial education programme,
           entitled HOMe-based HEart Failure Self-Management Programme (HOM-HEMP)

        2. To examine its effectiveness on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety and
           depression symptoms, self-efficacy, self-care behavior, social support, and clinical
           outcomes among older patients with heart failure (CHF) in Singapore.

      Study Hypotheses

      Study participants will be randomised into one of the three groups: a Control Group
      (receiving usual care), an Experimental Group A (receiving HOM-HEMP without a supplementary
      smartphone App), and an Experimental Group B (receiving HOM-HEMP with a supplementary
      smartphone App). It is hypothesised that participants in the Experimental Group A or B as
      compared with participants in the Control Group will have significantly:

        1. More positive perceived health-related quality of life.

        2. Lesser anxiety and depression symptoms experienced.

        3. Higher levels of self-efficacy.

        4. Higher levels of CHF self-care behavior.

        5. Better social support.

        6. Better clinical outcomes, including improved exercise capacity, decreased severity of
           CHF status, and unplanned health service utilization (i.e. unplanned medical
           consultation, emergency department visit due to heart disease, and hospital readmissions
           due to heart disease).

      Approach adopted in the development of HOMe-based HEart Failure Self-Management Programme
      (HOM-HEMP).

      The HOM-HEMP, is designed as a six-week home-based psychosocial education programme
      comprising of a specifically developed Tool Kit, smartphone app, one education session and
      six weekly home visits. The duration of the programme is determined based on the literature,
      in which the psychosocial interventions for patients with heart failure varied from two to 16
      weeks across studies, with the average length being six weeks.

      HOM-HEMP Tool Kit Development A HOM-HEMP Tool Kit will be developed for the participants to
      use whenever they encounter problems related to their condition at home. Participants can
      always read the Tool Kit by themselves or with their family members/caregivers repeatedly to
      reinforce the learning of key information. The Tool Kit is therefore an important element of
      the whole programme.

      The development of the content of the Tool Kit will follow patient-centred principle, which
      will be driven by patients' needs. The results of our recent study exploring the needs and
      living experiences of patients with CHF in Singapore will be used to guide the research team
      to develop the Tool Kit. This is an important part of the development of the Tool Kit because
      it is crucial to ensure that the information presented is updated and relevant for local
      patients. This will help patients to make the necessary changes (e.g. healthier local food
      options instead of their current unhealthy choices) in their lifestyle, which is a key part
      of the recovery process. Another key emphasis of the development of this Manual is the
      psychosocial-related content which includes relaxation techniques, stress management, family
      and social support, and symptoms monitoring (e.g. shortness of breath, angina).The content of
      the HOM-HEMP Manual mainly includes: (1) CHF facts (e.g. definition, risk factors, signs and
      symptoms), and self-care management principles for the older patients, (2) stress and anxiety
      management (e.g. stress coping strategies, relaxation techniques), (3) medication management
      (e.g. effects and side-effects of medication), (4) physical exercises (e.g. 6-meter walking
      test; exercise for elderly, self-monitoring and evaluation of exercise intensity and
      progress), (5) dietary and fluid management including practice tips, (6) smoking cessation
      (for smokers), and (7) family and social support (for family members and caregivers).

      A panel of experts will be invited to validate the content of the Tool Kit to ensure it is
      relevant and helpful. The panel will include one geriatric cardiologist, one psychologist,
      one physiotherapist, one dietician, one cardiac case manager (i.e. advanced practice nurse),
      and one researcher who have experience in developing and running psychosocial education
      programmes. Special attention on the readability of the Manual for older people will be
      considered when we design the Manual, e.g. large-type print, short sentences, avoidance of
      medical terminology and jargon. Two lay older CHF patients will be also invited to review the
      drafted content. It is assuming that the educational level of most potential users would be
      at the lower end of reading skill required the easy use of written material.

      HOM-HEMP Smartphone App Development A smartphone app will be developed by a team of software
      engineers from School of Computing, National University of Singapore. The content and scope
      of the app will be mainly guided based on the content of the Tool Kit. The proposed functions
      included in the app are: (1) visual material including video clips of educational talks given
      by heart experts (e.g. triggering factors of CHF, signs and symptoms of CHF), relaxation
      techniques (e.g. deep breathing, meditation, muscle relaxation), stress management techniques
      (e.g. stress alleviating exercise) and recommended physical exercises (e.g. walking exercise,
      exercise logs) and Dietary matters (e.g. practical tips of selecting food, healthy recipes to
      try); (2) fluid calculator, (3) individualized scheduled reminders for doing exercise and
      relaxation, taking medication, medical appointment; salt/fluid targets; (4) weight/vitals
      logs (e.g. weight monitor, blood pressure and heart rate monitor with the use of
      Bluetooth-enabled devices such as Polar H7 or Wahoo Tickr) and (5) chat room with the
      research nurse.

      The app will be designed as &quot;elderly friendly&quot; with features like large font size, using
      videos and pictures, and sound/voice reminders. There will be a monitoring function when
      participants log in the system. After the development of the app, it will be uploaded to
      mobile app stores, and users can download it from Googleplay (for Android users) or Apple app
      store (for IOS user) Technical issues such as compatibility, ease of use, potential causes of
      crashes will be tested. Once the test is completed, a field test will be conducted with 5
      participants and/or their caregivers. They will be required to provide their overall
      evaluation of the app, and their feedback regarding the utilization of the app will guide the
      study team to further revise the app.

      Study Design, setting and participants:

      A stratified randomised controlled, three-arm, pretest and repeated posttest design will be
      used in this project with both quantitative and qualitative measures. The study will be
      conducted at the cardiac ward of one of the largest acute public hospitals in Singapore.
      After the baseline measurements, the participants will be randomly assigned to one of the
      three groups using stratified randomization. These three groups are: the Control Group, in
      which participants will receive usual care; the Experimental Group A, in which participants
      will receive usual care, one face-to-face education session, six weekly home visits and the
      HOM-HEMP Tool Kit but without HOM-HEMP app; the Experimental Group B, in which participants
      will receive the usual care and the whole package of HOM-HEMP, including one face-to-face
      education session, six weekly home visits, the HOM-HEMP Tool Kit and the HOM-HEMP app.

      One research nurse (RN) will be trained to conduct the intervention, and another research
      assistant (RA) will conduct the data collection. The RN will be responsible for delivering
      the HOM-HEMP to the participants (i.e. intervention), while the RA will be responsible for
      data collection. The RA will be blinded to participants' group assignment to prevent
      subjective bias stemming from the knowledge of grouping. Four measurements will be conducted
      at the baseline prior to the intervention (T0), at 6 weeks immediate after the intervention
      (T1), at 3 months from the baseline (T2), and at 6 months from the baseline (T3).

      Outcome measures:

      Outcome measures include: Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLCHFQ)
      ,Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Cardiac Self-efficacy Scale (CSS) , Self-Care
      of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI), Short Form of the Social Support Questionnaire
      (SSQ6),Six-Minute Walking Test (6-MWT),NYHA Functional Classification, the LVEF and unplanned
      Health service use. Data will be collected at 6 weeks, 3 months and again at 6 months after
      the commencement of the programme.

      Data analysis:

      The IBM SPSS 24.0 will be used for data analysis. Baseline categorical demographic
      characteristics across the 3 groups will be examined using Chi-squared or Fisher's Exact
      test; quantitative variables using ANOVA if normality and homogeneity assumptions satisfied
      otherwise Kruskal Wallis test will be used. General Linear Mixed Model (GLM) will be used to
      compare the study outcomes between 2 intervention groups against the Control group using
      Dunnett test at each individual time point. To correct for type 1 error on the multiple
      comparisons for each time point, statistical significance is set at p &lt; 0.01. For the
      differences in the unplanned health service use between the experimental two groups against
      the control group, logistic regression will be performed adjusting for relevant covariates. A
      repeated measurement analysis will be performed to analyse the trend of groups' numerical
      outcomes over time setting significance level at p&lt;0.05 and at two-tailed test.

      For all qualitative data obtained from the face-to-face interviews, all audio taped
      interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Latent content analysis, which involves an
      interpretative reading of the symbolism underlying the surface structure in the text, will be
      used for the qualitative data-set. There are three basic steps involved in content analysis
      namely, developing meaningful units, developing the set of categories, and developing the
      rational and illustration to guide the coding of data into categories. This principle will
      guide the researcher to analyze the qualitative data gained from the interviews.
