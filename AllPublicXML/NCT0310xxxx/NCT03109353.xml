  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), is commonly used for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell
      lymphoma (CTCL) and chronic graft-versus-host disease. ECP (cGVHD) is an immune modulating
      treatment. White blood cells from the patient are standardized activated by a photosensitizer
      psoralen (8-MOP) and irradiated with visible ultraviolet light (UV-A). The purpose is to
      induce programmed cell death (apoptosis). Disadvantage of current treatment is that 8-MOP
      targets both diseased and normal cells with no selectivity.

      The purpose of this study is to improve the current ECP technology using aminolevulinic acid
      (ALA) and UV light. ECP will be carried out in conventional manner except that 8-MOP will be
      replaced with ALA. Systemic ALA / UV light is already approved and used in the detection and
      treatment of disease in humans. The primary objective is to assess its safety and
      tolerability after single and multiple treatment in patients with CTCL or cGvHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main advantages of using ALA for ECP are (1) highly effective and selective apoptotic
      destruction of transformed/activated hyper-proliferative T-cells through an endogenously
      selective production of the potent photosensitiser, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) from ALA via
      heme biosynthetic pathway; (2) ALA/PpIX only targets membranous structures outside of the
      cell nucleus thus causing no risk of carcinogenesis and (3) induces systemic anti-tumour
      immunity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent

          -  cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) (Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome)

          -  considered to respond inadequately to 8-MOP-ECP therapy. Inadequate response is
             defined as:

               1. progressive disease: disease progression from baseline in skin score, blood or
                  lymph nodes after 3-6 months or

               2. stable disease: No- response after 3-6 months or

               3. minimal response &lt; 50% (from baseline) reduction of skin scores and/or CD4/CD8
                  ratio or a loss of peripheral blood clone after 3-6 months.

          -  (or) chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) and considered to respond inadequately
             to 8-MOP-ECP therapy. Chronic GvHD is defined as

               1. presence of at least 1 clinical sign of cGvHD or
