      This phase 0/I trial studies the side effects and best dose of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 in
      treating patients with glioblastoma that is newly diagnosed or has come back. MDM2 inhibitor
      AMG-232 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the concentration and variability in concentration of MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232
      (AMG 232) in brain and brain-associated tissue in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM).
      (Part 1) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AMG 232 given in combination with
      standard radiation following surgery for patients with newly diagnosed GBM harboring
      unmethylated MGMT promoters and wild-type TP53. (Part 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of AMG 232 in patients with recurrent GBM. (Part 1) II.
      Assess the variability of AMG 232 concentration in tumor enhancing versus (vs.) infiltrative
      tissue. (Part 1) III. Assess the pharmacodynamic effect of AMG 232 on p21 elevation. (Part 1)
      IV. Determine the safety of AMG 232 given concurrently with radiation therapy (RT) and
      adjuvantly as monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed GBM harboring unmethylated MGMT
      promoters and wild-type TP53. (Part 2) V. Assess AMG 232 exposure and correlations with PD
      effect PD effect on p21 elevation. (Part 2) VI. Assess pharmacodynamic (PD) effect on MIC-1
      elevation in serum. (Part 2)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase 0, intratumoral pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) study of
      MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 followed by a phase I dose-escalation study.

      PART I: Patients with recurrent glioblastoma receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) for 2 days. Within 3-6 hours of the last dose, patients undergo standard of care
      surgery. Upon recovery (within 45 days), patients with TP53 wild-type tumors continue to
      receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 PO QD on days 1-7. Courses repeat every 21 days in absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART II: Within 6 weeks of standard of care surgery, patients with newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma undergo radiation therapy daily during weeks 1-6. Patients also receive MDM2
      inhibitor AMG-232 PO once weekly for 6 weeks or 3 times weekly on days 2, 3, and 5 for 6
      weeks or 2 times weekly on days 2 and 4 for 6 weeks during radiation therapy.

      PART II (EXPANSION COHORT): Patients receive MDM2 inhibitor AMG-232 PO QD on days 1-7.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for the first two
      years from the off-treatment date, and then every 6 months until death.
