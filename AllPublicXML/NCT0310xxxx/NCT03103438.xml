    <textblock>
      This is an open label, phase 1, &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalating study of tolerability, safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous injection of
      the novel monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor - BCD-089. The study will
      enroll 19 healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-6 is a new potential therapeutic target which plays important role in pathogenesis of
      several autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis. BCD-089 is a novel fully human
      monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor developed by JCS BIOCAD (Russia) which
      is now on the first step of clinical evaluation. BCD-089-1 study is the first-in-human
      clinical trial which is intended to evaluate tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of BCD-089 when used as a single step-by-step escalating
      subcutaneous dose in healthy male volunteers. During this study it is expected to determine
      diapason of safety doses of BCD-089 (incl. MTD) which thereafter can be evaluated in phase 2
      studies.

    <description>his cohort includes one subject who will receive the maximum safe starting dose of BCD-089 (0.06 mg/kg) subcutaneously. If the dose limitating toxicity occurs within the first seven days after injection the study will be stopped.

If 0 of the 3 subjects are observed to have DLT, the dose level is escalated one step for the next cohort no.3 of 3 subjects, and the process continues as above. If exactly 1 of the 3 subjects treated show DLT, 3 additional subjects are treated at the current dose level. If none of these additional 3 patients show DLT, the dose level is escalated for the next Cohort no. 3.</description>
