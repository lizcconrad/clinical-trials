      This phase I trial studies the side effects of autologous human anti-CD19 chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR)-4-1BB-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing CD4+/CD8+ T-lymphocytes (huJCAR014) in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. huJCAR014 CAR-T cells are made in the laboratory by genetically modifying a
      patient's T cells and may specifically kill cancer cells that have a molecule CD19 on their
      surfaces.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate preliminary safety of huJCAR014 in adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or
      refractory (R/R) aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive
      B-cell NHL and ALL.

      II. To assess the antitumor activity of huJCAR014 in CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL.

      III. To estimate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients
      with CD19+ R/R aggressive NHL and ALL treated with huJCAR014.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the cellular and humoral immune responses to huJCAR014.

      II. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of huJCAR014.

      III. To assess the effect of huJCAR014 product attributes on safety, PK, and antitumor
      activity.

      IV. To assess the effect of tumor and tumor microenvironment on huJCAR014 PK and biomarkers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of huJCAR014.

      Patients undergo leukapheresis. Beginning 14-16 days after leukapheresis, patients undergo
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising either cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) daily for
      1 day and fludarabine IV daily for 3 days or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine IV daily for 3
      days. Within 36-96 hours after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, patients receive
      huJCAR014 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for the first 3
      months, every 3 months for up to 12 months, and then yearly for 15 years.

             not permit compliance with the protocol as judged by the PI or designee, or
             unwillingness or inability to follow protocol procedures

        CRITERIA FOR LEUKAPHERESIS AND PRE-THERAPY EVALUATION

          -  Known active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by malignancy; subjects with
             prior CNS disease that has been effectively treated are eligible if treatment was
             completed at least 1 month prior to enrollment and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling
             and imaging studies show no evidence of progressive disease

          -  History or presence of clinically relevant CNS pathology that, in the opinion of the
             PI or designee, is a contraindication to lymphodepleting chemotherapy or huJCAR014
             infusion

          -  History of another primary malignancy that has not been in remission for at least 2
             years with the following exceptions: nonmelanoma skin cancer, curatively treated
             localized prostate cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ on biopsy or a squamous
             intraepithelial lesion on pap smear, or other malignancy considered by the
             investigator to have a low risk of relapse or progression

          -  Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy, unless considered by
             the PI or designee to be eligible

          -  Presence of active acute or chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)

          -  Use of any of the following:

               -  Cytotoxic or lymphotoxic agents (including prednisone &gt; 5 mg/day or equivalent
                  corticosteroid) within 1 week prior to leukapheresis; physiologic corticosteroid
                  replacement, and topical or inhaled corticosteroids are not excluded

               -  GVHD therapies within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis (e.g., calcineurin
                  inhibitors, methotrexate or other chemotherapeutics, mycophenolate, rapamycin,
                  thalidomide, immunosuppressive antibodies such as anti-TNF, anti-IL-6, or
                  anti-IL-6R)

               -  Experimental agents within 4 weeks prior to leukapheresis unless progression is
                  documented on therapy and at least 3 half-lives have elapsed prior to
                  leukapheresis

               -  Radiation within 6 weeks prior to leukapheresis unless there is progressive
                  disease in irradiated lesions or there are additional non-irradiated, positron
                  emission tomography (PET)-positive lesions

               -  Allo-HSCT within 60 days prior to leukapheresis or donor lymphocyte infusion
                  (DLI) within 6 weeks prior to leukapheresis

               -  Treatment with cladribine within 3 months prior to leukapheresis

               -  Treatment with alemtuzumab within 3 months prior to leukapheresis

        CRITERIA FOR LYMPHODEPLETING CHEMOTHERAPY AND huJCAR014 TREATMENT

          -  Known active CNS involvement by malignancy; subjects with prior CNS disease that has
             been effectively treated are eligible if treatment was completed at least 1 month
             prior to enrollment and imaging studies show no evidence of progressive disease

          -  Uncontrolled and serious infection

          -  Presence of active acute or chronic GVHD

          -  DLI within 6 weeks prior to lymphodepletion chemotherapy
