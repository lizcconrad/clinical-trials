  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is a type of bacteria that is carried (lives) in the nose of most
      individuals and can sometimes go on to cause severe infections such as meningitis and
      pneumonia. There are over 100 types of pneumococcus, and children in the UK have been
      routinely immunized against pneumococcal disease since 2006. A vaccine against 13 types of
      pneumococcus (PCV 13) was introduced into the UK in 2010, replacing a previous version that
      prevented 7 types.

      Pneumococcal carriage in the Thames Valley region has been studied over the last 7 years with
      carriage rates having been shown to be reflective of potential severe pneumococcal disease
      and hence vaccine effect.

      The main purpose of this study is to see whether the pneumococcal immunization program has
      changed the frequency and nature of pneumococcal bacteria carried by children, as this may
      give a clue as to what changes in pneumococcal disease are likely to be seen in the future.
      In addition, this study is especially timely given the possibility of a change in the PCV 13
      immunization schedule that is currently being assessed in the 'Sched3' Immunization study
      (NCT02482636). Obtaining accurate baseline data will be important in informing the
      interpretation of any subsequent data on carriage rates obtained following introduction of
      the new schedule.

      This study will enroll approximately 1600 children aged 13 to 48 months living in the Thames
      Valley and South Midlands and which have had three doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate
      vaccine. The study consists of one visit done at a convenient venue (GP surgeries,
      educational/ play settings, or home) where a single nasal swab and an optional finger-prick
      blood sample for a sub-set of 632 participants, will be performed. No additional follow-up is
      needed. The study recruitment period will be done over 12 months.

      This is a cross sectional observational study to determine the point prevalence of
      pneumococcal carriage in children. In this study approximately 1600, healthy children aged
      13-48 months who have received a complete course of PCV13 at least one month prior to study
      enrollment, will be recruited.

      The study will be carried out in the Thames Valley and South Midlands. Parents/legal
      guardians will be approached either by website based advertisements, social media, poster
      advertisements and emailing and/or handing out information booklets through their child's
      nurseries, GP Surgeries and educational/play settings. The investigators may also identify
      potential participants by mailing out invitation letters and leaflets to age appropriate
      children via the Open Exeter system of National Health Application and Infrastructure
      Services, the Child Health Computer Department, equivalent NHS database or through the
      Clinical Research Network. Parents/legal guardians of potential participants who have
      expressed interest will be directed to the Oxford Vaccine group (OVG) website where they will
      be able to access the participant information booklet and if appropriate complete online
      self-screening. If parents approach OVG to express interest, the information booklet will be
      sent to them and they may be telephone screened.

      This study will involve a one off visit. The study visit will be arranged to occur in a
      convenient venues such as: hospital out patients, university clinic rooms, village halls,
      church halls, nurseries, participant's homes, sporting and recreational areas, GP practices
      and other similar venues where pre-school children frequently attend. Permission would be
      seek from the above venues to carry out any study procedures on their premises. Pre-arranged
      dates and times will be offered to parents/legal guardians by online booking, phone call or
      email.

      During the visit the investigators would go through the details of the study and provide an
      opportunity for further questions. For those willing to proceed the investigators would then
      ask participants to sign a consent form and collect demographic information. A nasopharyngeal
      swab will be taken, and if consented to do so an optional blood sample will be performed in a
      subset of 632 participants. No further visits or follow-up will be required.

          4. Aged 13-48 months and at least 28 days since their third PCV13 vaccination.

          5. Able (in the Investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Parent/legal guardian unwilling or unable to give written informed consent to
             participate in the study.

          2. Parent/legal guardian less than 18 years of age at time of enrollment.

          3. Parent/legal guardian is listed on the study delegation log.

          4. Children who were known to be un-immunized or have an incomplete course of PCV13.

          5. Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may either put the participants at risk because of participation in the study, or may
