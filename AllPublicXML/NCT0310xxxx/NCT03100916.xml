  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI 690517
      in healthy male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses over 14 days
      (MRD part).

      Secondary objectives for the MRD part are the exploration of PK (Pharmacokinetic(s)),
      including dose proportionality, as well as investigation of linearity and PD
      (Pharmacodynamic(s)) of BI 690517 after multiple dosing.

      For the FE (food effect) part, the secondary objective is to investigate the relative
      bioavailability of BI 690517 under fasted conditions (Reference, R) compared to BI 690517
      (single dose) after a high fat high caloric breakfast (Test, T).

             repeatedly greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding at screening

          -  A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalaemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Values for serum sodium and potassium outside normal range at screening

          -  Male subjects with WOCBP partner who are unwilling to use male contraception (condom
