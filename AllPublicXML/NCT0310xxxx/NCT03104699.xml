      locally advanced solid tumors, with a consecutive Phase 2 expansion to evaluate efficacy in
      subjects with recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic (advanced) cervical cancer that has

                  ≥3 months.

               5. Evidence of objective disease. A measurable lesion is not necessary.

               6. Adequate hematological function defined by white blood cell (WBC) count ≥3 ×
                  10^9/L; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 × 10^9/L; lymphocyte count ≥0.5 ×
                  10^9/L; platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L; and hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may have been
                  transfused).

               7. Adequate hepatic function, defined as total bilirubin ≤1.5 × upper limit of
                  normal (ULN); AST ≤2.5 × ULN; and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN. For subjects with documented

               9. Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if risk of conception
                  exists.

          -  Efficacy Expansion Cohort (Second-Line Cervical Cancer)

               1. Signed written informed consent.

               2. Age ≥18 years.

               3. Subjects must have recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic cervical cancer and
                  have relapsed after a platinum-containing doublet administered for treatment of
                  advanced (recurrent, unresectable, or metastatic) disease.

                  Subjects must have persistent, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma,
                  adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, with documented disease
                  progression (disease not amenable to curative therapy).

                  Note: The following cervical tumors are not eligible: minimal deviation/adenoma
                  malignum, gastric type adenocarcinoma, clear cell carcinoma and mesonephric
                  carcinoma. Histologic confirmation of the original primary tumor is required via
                  pathology report.

                  Subjects must have had one prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen for management
                  of persistent, recurrent, or metastatic carcinoma of the cervix (e.g.,
                  paclitaxel/cisplatin, paclitaxel/cisplatin/bevacizumab). Chemotherapy
                  administered concurrently with primary radiation (e.g., weekly cisplatin) is not
                  counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen. Adjuvant chemotherapy given following
                  completion of radiation therapy (or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation
                  therapy) is not counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen (e.g., paclitaxel and
                  carboplatin for ≤4 cycles).

                  Note: Subjects who have received &gt;1 prior regimen are not eligible.

                  slide).

               7. Disease must be measurable, with ≥1 unidimensional measurable lesion per RECIST

               8. Adequate hematological function, defined as WBC ≥3 × 10^9/L; ANC ≥1.5 × 10^9/L;
                  lymphocyte count ≥0.5 × 10^9/L; platelet count ≥100 × 10^9/L; and hemoglobin ≥9
                  g/dL (may have been transfused).

               9. Adequate hepatic function, defined as total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN; AST ≤2.5 × ULN;
                  and ALT ≤2.5 × ULN.

              10. Adequate renal function, defined as estimated creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/min
                  according to Cockcroft-Gault formula or measured 24-hour creatinine clearance (or
                  local institutional standard method).

              11. Effective contraception for female subjects if risk of conception exists. Note:
                  Effects of the study drug on the developing human fetus are unknown. Thus, women
                  of childbearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception,
                  defined as 2 barrier methods, or 1 barrier method with a spermicide, an
                  intrauterine device or use of oral female contraceptive. Effective contraception
                  must be used 30 days before first study drug administration, for the duration of
                  trial participation, and ≥60 days after stopping trial participation. Should a
                  woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is
                  participating in this trial, the treating physician should be informed
                  immediately.
