      The study consists of 3 sub-studies, as follows:

        -  Sub-study 1 (Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study) to evaluate the
           efficacy and safety of risankizumab versus placebo as maintenance therapy in subjects
           with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease (CD) who responded to risankizumab
           induction treatment in Study M16-006 or Study M15-991

        -  Sub-study 2 (Randomized, exploratory maintenance study) to evaluate the efficacy and
           safety of two different dosing regimens for risankizumab as maintenance therapy in
           subjects who responded to induction treatment in Study M16-006 or Study M15-991;

        -  Sub-study 3 (Open-label, long-term extension study) to evaluate long-term safety of
           risankizumab in subjects who completed Sub-study 1 or 2.
