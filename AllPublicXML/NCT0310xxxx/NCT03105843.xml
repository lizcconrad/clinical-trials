  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the sensory-mechanical responses to Eucapneic
      Voluntary Hyperventilation (EVH) and Hypertonic Saline (HS) in individuals with cough variant
      asthma (CVA) and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity (COUGH) and
      compare these responses to a control group of healthy individuals without asthma or chronic
      cough.

      We hypothesize:

        1. EVH and HS cause dyspnea, cough, small airway obstruction with resultant dynamic
           hyperinflation, gas trapping and autoPEEP in individuals with CVA and COUGH, but not
           healthy controls.

        2. The sensory-mechanical responses to both hyperosmolar challenges (EVH and HS) are
           comparable within groups (CVA, COUGH and healthy controls).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation.
      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,
      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which
      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of
      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic
      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals
      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do
      not have asthma or CVA) (COUGH) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose
      of this research is to further explore the pathophysiologic basis for cough in these
      conditions using two 'indirect' inhalation challenge tests: eucapneic voluntary
      hyperventilation (EVH) and hypertonic saline (HS), which induce osmotic and/or temperature
      changes in airway. Specifically, this study will collect preliminary data on the
      sensory-mechanical responses of individuals with CVA, COUGH and healthy controls to EVH and
      HS challenge.

    <time_frame>Time frame of the methacholine challenge varies between individuals. At provocative dose/ventilation causing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PD20 and PC20 respectively). On average, these occur about 15-25 minutes into the challenge test</time_frame>
    <description>The bronchodilating effect of a DI will be examined using responses to the challenge testing (Visit 2/3) in these subgroups by comparing the mid-expiratory flow difference between the partial (PEF) and full maximal flow-volume (MEF) loops at 40% above Residual Volume (RV) from the forced vital capacity (FVC) (PEF40 and MEF40 respectively) at provocative dose of 4.5% saline causing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PD20 (HS)) and provocative minute ventilation causing a 20% decline in FEV1 (PC20 (EVH)) with that recorded at baseline.</description>
