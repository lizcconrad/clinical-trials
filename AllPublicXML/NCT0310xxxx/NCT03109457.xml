    <textblock>
      Compare Hepatiis C Virus (HCV) detection between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and
      normal tissues, to determine the possible relationship between HCV and OSCC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient / Population: Paraffin embedded tissue samples of OSCC. Indicator: OSCC patients
      Control: Normal patients Formalin fixed paraffin embedded specimens from blocks retrieved
      from the archives of the Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Department, Faculty of dentistry,
      Kasr Alini hospital setting from January 2014 till February 2018. All clinical and
      histopathological data from medical reports, will be reviewed and data will be collected
      regarding age, sex, tumor location, history of smoking and alcohol consumption, nodal status,
      tumor recurrences and histological classification of the patients. The specimens will be
      obtained from 2 groups:-

        1. OSCC specimens. Histological diagnosis of H&amp;E stained sections will be performed
           according to World health organisation (WHO) guidelines by 2 independent pathologists.

        2. Normal oral mucosa specimens (control).

      outcome: I) Immunohistochemical detection of Hepatitis C core antigen (Hep C cAg) : sc-58144,
      santa cruz biotechnology, USA) a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against Hepatitis C virus
      will be purchased and used for immunohistochemical staining. Staining procedure using an
      automated system Ventana Benchmark. The four Âµm thick paraffin embedded tissue sections will
      be deparaffinized in three changes of xylene then microwaved for antigen retrieval. The
      slides will be incubated with primary antibody overnight in the humidity chamber at room
      temperature. Then, the slides will be incubated with secondary antibody. The peroxidase
      activity will be made visible with diaminobenzidine. Finally, counterstaining will be
      obtained using Mayer's hematoxylin.

      The immunostained sections will be examined using analyzer computer system (Germany).
