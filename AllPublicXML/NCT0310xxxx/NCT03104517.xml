      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Urinary
      Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) compared to a placebo in the treatment of stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI) in adult female patients. Half of the participants will receive AMDC-USR
      (injections with cells) and the other half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the accidental loss of urine due to physical activity,
      such as laughing, coughing, or sneezing. Autologous Muscle Derived Cells for Urinary
      Sphincter Repair (AMDC-USR) involves a medical procedure in which a participant's own muscle
      cells are collected, processed, and then injected into the tissues of the urinary passage.

      This is a double-blind randomized study, which means neither the participant, nor the study
      doctor will know which treatment group the participant will be in. Participants who are
      randomly chosen to receive injection with placebo will have the option to receive an
      injection with their cells after completion of the blinded portion of their study
      participation (12 months).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult female patient 50 to 75 years of age who has primary and moderate-to-severe
             symptoms of SUI for at least 6 months, as confirmed by patient medical history and
             clinical symptoms, including a focused incontinence evaluation.

          -  Must be willing and able to comply with the study procedures, be mentally competent
             and able to understand all study requirements, and must agree to read and sign the
             informed consent form prior to any study-related procedures.

          -  Must have completed 100% of the screening 3-day diary evening reports.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has symptoms of only urge incontinence as confirmed by basic evaluation of
             etiology from a patient medical history, including a focused incontinence history.

          -  Patient has symptoms of mixed urinary incontinence where urge incontinence is the
             predominant factor.

          -  Patient has had stress urinary incontinence symptoms less than 6 months prior to
             signing the informed consent.

          -  Patient has not previously attempted conservative treatment prior to signing the
             informed consent. (Examples of conservative treatment include behavior modifications,
             bladder exercises, biofeedback, pelvic floor muscle therapy, etc.)

          -  Patient BMI â‰¥ 35.

          -  Patient routinely has more than 2 episodes of awakening to void during normal sleeping
             hours.

          -  If taking a medication known to affect lower urinary tract function, including but not
             limited to, anticholinergics, beta 3 adrenergic receptor agonists, tricyclic
             antidepressants, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) or selective
             serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, diuretics, or alpha-adrenergic
             blockers, patient cannot be maintained on a stable dose and/or frequency of medication
             (including diuretics), cannot be maintained on a stable dose and/or frequency for at
             least 2 weeks prior to screening or is likely to change during the course of the
             study.

          -  History of cancer in pelvic organs, ureters, or kidneys.

          -  Patient is pregnant, lactating, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the
             study.
