  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the predictors, mediators, outcomes, and critical therapy
      processes associated with manual-based psychological therapies for 400 youth (ages 7-16
      years) with anxiety and/or depression seeking services within a semi-natural clinic setting.
      Essentially, this study seeks to determine &quot;what works&quot; about psychological therapy for
      youth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will evaluate the efficacy of manual-based psychological therapies
      administered with youth with anxiety and mood problems. It will also assess the role of
      several mediators (e.g., coping skills, negative self-statements, parenting practices)
      hypothesized to maintain youth anxiety and depression. Youth (ages 7 - 16) diagnosed with a
      principal Anxiety or Depressive Disorder will be recruited to receive Cognitive-Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT). Anxiety (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder,
      Social Phobia) and depressive disorders (e.g., Major Depression Disorder, Dysthymia Disorder)
      are among the most common emotional disorder affecting America's youth, with 12-20% of youth
      meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder and 2-5% meeting criteria for depression at any one
      point in time. Both forms of disorders are associated with significant distress and
      functional impairment in school, peer, and family domains. Left untreated, early affliction
      with these disorders leaves individuals at risk for adult anxiety disorders, chronic
      depression, substance abuse, and long-term functional impairment. Identifying efficacious
      treatments and their most effective, &quot;active ingredients&quot; is a top health research priority.
      In addition, knowledge about how our psychotherapies work lags behind research documenting
      simple treatment effects. Knowing the therapy techniques that have the best outcomes as well
      as knowing how those interventions produce gains will provide valuable information for
      improving our already effective therapies.

      Two manual-based psychological treatments that have received empirical support in clinical
      trial outcome studies are cognitive-behavioral treatment for anxious children (Kendall's
      Coping Cat) and cognitive-behavioral treatment for depressed children (Weisz's PASCET). Both
      treatments (a) use a manual and (b) have been supported in clinical trial outcome studies
      where youth receiving the manualized treatment interventions improve more than the control
      groups. The Kendall treatment program has produced some of the strongest treatment effects
      yet seen in the empirical literature for children and adolescents.

      Despite our increasing knowledge of treatments that work, there has been insufficient
      analysis of psychological mediators in youth psychotherapy. Research on psychological
      mediators, or &quot;mechanisms of action,&quot; provide information about how psychotherapy works.
      Randomized clinical trials document that CBT produces clinical outcomes, such as decreased
      symptoms and impairment following treatment. Fewer studies have assessed the degree to which
      coping skills, emotion management, or cognitive restructuring mediate these clinical gains.
      This type of mediator analysis is essential to test the theory underlying our treatments and
      helps inform our models of pathology. For example, if increased primary (active) coping
      skills precede a reduction in depressive symptoms, we might infer that poor coping skills are
      a maintaining factor of depression and that successful therapy works by increasing a youth's
      use of such skills.

      In the current study, we will invite youth to participate in a CBT intervention with
      demonstrated efficacy and will conduct a thorough assessment of potential therapy process and
      mediator variables that impact treatment outcomes. Both primary (active problem solving) and
      secondary (attempts to adjust to situations that can not be changed) coping skills have been
      linked to a number of psychological distress states in youth and may have specific links to
      maintaining depression in youth. In anxious youth, the ratio of negative to positive
      self-talk has been shown to mediate gains in CBT. The role of parenting practices has also
      been highlighted as an important maintaining factor in anxiety (e.g., modeled anxious
      behavior, parent intrusiveness). Self-efficacy, a cognitive appraisal of one's ability to
      manage challenges, has also been related to distress in youth. Affective components, such as
      positive affect, negative affect, and physiological hyperarousal have received increased
      attention because of they reflect basic emotional processes that underlie and distinguish
      anxiety and depressive disorders. Finally, less research has identified cognitive functioning
      related to anxiety and depression, but experts encourage the assessment of multidimensional
      cognitive factors in the expression of psychological distress to enhance our ability to
      factor in normative developmental processes. Given this, the current study will assess youth
      primary and secondary coping skills, youth automatic thoughts and self-statements, parenting
      practices, affective processes and cognitive functioning as treatment outcomes and potential
      mediators of symptom change in CBT.

      There have also only been minimal attempts to explore the therapist and client factors that
      impact within-session therapy processes that could improve the delivery of our
      empirically-supported treatments. Process factors like client engagement and therapeutic
      alliance may deserve particular attention in youth-based therapies because youth rarely refer
      themselves for treatment, often do not recognize or acknowledge the existence of problems,
      and frequently are at odds with their parents about the goals of therapy. Recent empirical
      data suggests that youth demonstrating greater engagement or stronger therapeutic alliance
      may experience better treatment outcomes. Therapist responsiveness to child needs and
      flexibility in implementing manual-based therapies might also have significant, if indirect,
      effects on successful treatment. A greater understanding of therapist, child, and
      interpersonal factors that improve the delivery of therapy could lead to concrete
      recommendations in training novice clinicians or in developing improved versions of current
      therapy manuals.

      Because treatment will occur within a semi-natural clinic setting, a multiple baseline,
      single-case design will be used. Employing a single-case design in this context will permit
      continuous assessment throughout baseline and treatment phases. This design will provide data
      for the course and sequence of symptom and mediator change. We will also be able to document
      the sequence of symptom change as it relates to the introduction of specific treatment
      interventions. The combined information can provide valuable information for how these
      treatments work and which interventions produce what specific client change.

      II. SPECIFIC AIMS

      The current study will attempt to address the following aims:

      Aim 1. Determine whether CBT for anxiety and depression are effective in a natural clinic
      setting where cases exhibit greater range of symptom severity, multiple clinical problems,
      and greater socioeconomic and cultural diversity. Effectiveness will be assessed in
      diagnostic, symptom, and adaptive functioning domains, including executive cognitive
      functioning.

      Aim 2. Determine if youth coping skills, behavioral activation, automatic thoughts, affective
      process, self-efficacy or parenting practices mediate the relationship between CBT
      interventions and clinical outcomes.

      Aim 3. Determine if youth or therapist within-session processes (e.g., child involvement,
      therapeutic alliance, therapist adherence to treatment protocol) moderates treatment success.

      Aim 4. Determine the pattern of symptom change associated with CBT for youth (e.g., gradual
      symptom decline, presence of sudden gains).

      Aim 5. Note patterns of additional youth mental health services and auxiliary services that
      families seek beyond treatment received at the Youth Anxiety and Depression Clinic.

    <intervention_model_description>This study will employ a quasi-experimental open-trial design that includes a comprehensive diagnostic assessments at pre- and post-treatment (diagnostic interview, symptom and functioning measures, and prospective mediators) and continuous assessment throughout an active treatment phase. Anxiety/depression symptoms will be assessed each session and prospective mediators (cognitive, behavioral, and affective variables) will be assessed every four sessions. A two-week baseline period will separate the initial intake from the first treatment session. The traditional ABAB experimental single-case design will not be used because it is not appropriate in clinical situations where the removal of treatment intervention could be harmful to clinical patients (Kazdin, 1992). Each youth who meets inclusion criteria will complete a two-week baseline phase that includes three assessments (intake, phone follow-up, and first session).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The ADIS-C/P (Silverman &amp; Albano, 1996) is a semi-structured interview consisting of independent but comparable parent and child interviews that have good interviewer reliability (e.g., k= .98, parent interview; k=.93, child interview; Silverman &amp; Nelles, 1988), retest reliability (i.e., r=.76, parent interview; Silverman &amp; Eisen, 1992), and sensitivity to treatment effects (e.g., Albano, Know, &amp; Barlow, 1995; Kendall et al., 1997). The parent and child interviews are conducted individually allowing the diagnostician to derive parent-reported, child-reported, and composite (parent and child) diagnoses. Diagnosticians will be trained to reliability by shadowing trained interviewers, being shadowed by a trained interviewer, and by coding videotaped interviews and matching gold-standard ratings of diagnoses.</description>

    <description>Clinicians rate 17 symptom areas covering academic, social, health and cognitive functioning. Administered alone, the CDRS-R takes 15-20 minutes to complete. Administered with the ADIS-IV, it requires an additional 5 minutes with the parent or child because many questions overlap. The majority of ratings also get completed by the Interviewer after the ADIS is completed (not directly with parent or child).</description>

    <description>RCADS-C/P (Chorpita, Yim, Moffitt, Umemoto,&amp; Francis, 2000) is a 47-item scale whose items correspond closely to DSM-IV anxiety and major depressive disorders. Parallel parent and child versions will be used. Factor analysis has yielded subscales associated with the diagnoses of interest (e.g., Separation Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder). The subscales demonstrated good factorial validity, internal consistency, one-week test-retest reliability, and good convergent and discriminant validity (Chorpita et al., 2000). It has also demonstrated reasonable convergent validity with other leading anxiety and depression measures (e.g., Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Children's Depression Inventory; Chorpita et al., 2000). The RCADS-Parent Form (RCADS-P) is a 47-item parent-report version of the youth RCADS.</description>

    <description>The CES-D (parent and child forms) includes 20 items designed to assess depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness/guilt, sense of helplessness/hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. Parallel parent and child versions will be used. Using a four-point scale, respondents indicate the frequency with which symptoms have been experienced during the past week. Response categories include 0 = rarely (less than 1 day); 1 = little (1-2 days); 2 = moderately (3 to 4 days); or 3 = most of the time (5-7 days). Four items are reverse-scored, and a composite is calculated by summing item responses (range 0-60). CES-D was developed with adults but has been applied without adaptation to young adolescents. A cutoff point of 16 and above for screening adolescents for current major depressive disorder or dysthymia is considered optimal.</description>

    <description>For youth 13 years and older, diagnosticians will complete the Adolescent Alcohol and Drug Involvement Scale (AADIS) to screen for alcohol and substance use. All teens will be asked if they have ever used tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana and then interviewers will give a general prompt for other substance use. If the teen endorses use of other elicit or controlled substances, frequency ratings will be obtained. If the teen endorses any substance use, the interviewer will administer an additional 14 items assessing the context, function, and history of drug and alcohol use. The AADIS has been tested to be reliable and appropriate for adolescent respondents (Winters, 2003).</description>

    <description>The OBVQ (Solberg &amp; Olweus, 2003), designed for grades 3-10, is used to assess experiences with being bullied and bullying others. The OBVQ will be administered as an interview, individually with the child and parent/s, following the other clinician-administered measures (ADIS, AADIS, SACA). A shortened and revised version of the original OBVQ (28 items) will be used that includes global assessment of being bullied and bullying others, as well as specific items that assess nine different forms of bullying including hitting and kicking, spreading false rumors, ignoring peers, and bullying of a sexual or racial nature. The OBVQ demonstrated adequate internal consistency (alpha &gt; .80), and construct and criterion-related validity have been reported (Solberg &amp; Olweus, 2003).</description>

    <description>The MBIS is a recently developed measure (Chu, B. C., Hoffman, L., Johns, A., Reyes-Portillo, J., &amp; Hansford, A, 2014) that assesses socio-emotional impairment related to bullying in school-aged youth. The BIS is a 44-item measure, rated 0 (not at all) to 3 (most of the time; total range: 0 - 60). Initial piloting demonstrated that BIS total scores correlated with bullying experiences and anxiety and depressive symptoms (Chu et al., 2014). Items begin with the clause, &quot;When I have been bullied, I...&quot; and assess the frequency that victimization negatively impacts family relations, peer relations, academic performance and attendance, and extracurricular participation.</description>

    <description>The RSQ (Connor-Smith et al., 2000) will be used to assess youth-self-reports and parent-reports of the use of primary control and secondary control coping strategies in response to significant life stressors. Research with three samples of adolescents and two samples of parents (reporting on their adolescents) has shown good evidence for the psychometric integrity of the measure. The factor structure of the RSQ has been tested and replicated using confirmatory factor analysis across three stressor classes in two samples. And both internal consistency and retest reliability of the five factors are strong, across samples. Across samples, scores on the primary and secondary control coping factors have shown strong negative correlations with both internalizing and externalizing problems. The parent form consists of 68 items and can be administered to target anxiety (RSQP-Scared) or depressive feelings (RSQP-Bad). The child form (Responses to Stress) is a shorter 30-item scale.</description>

    <description>CATS (Schniering &amp; Rapee, 2002) is a 40-item child-report measure designed to assess negative self-statements in children and adolescents. The CATS was developed and validated on a wide age range of youth (7 - 16 years old) and found to effectively discriminate between non-clinical youth and those with clinical anxiety, depression, and behavior disorders. Confirmatory factor analyses supported four distinct but strongly correlated factors relating to automatic thoughts on physical threat, social threat, personal failure and hostility. The internal consistency of the total score and subscales was high (α &gt; .85) and test-retest reliability at 1 and 3 months was acceptable (r = .91).</description>

    <description>DERS (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004) is a 41-item measure evaluating six domains of emotion regulation, including: (1) Nonacceptance of Emotional Reponses (Non-acceptance), (2) Difficulties Engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior (Goals), (3) Impulse Control Difficulties (Impulse), (4) Lack of Emotional Awareness (Awareness), (5) Limited Access to Emotion Regulation Strategies (Strategies), and (6) Lack of Emotional Clarity (Clarity). The Difficulties Engaging in Goal-Directed Behavior subscale is most conceptually related to distress tolerance. The DERS has demonstrated good test-retest reliability over a period of 4-8 weeks (r = 0.88, p &lt; .01), adequate internal consistency for each subscale (α &gt; .80), and high internal consistency (α = 0.93). Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from (1) almost never to (5) almost always, with higher scores indicating greater emotion dysregulation.</description>

    <description>The REACT system (Chu, Skriner, Silk, &amp; Nock, 2009) is an electronic diary system that can be completed by a respondent on a smart phone, ipod, or computer via a website. The 169 screen interview is administered through the Symtrend mobile application (https://www.symtrend.com/) which provides a customizable interface for creating electronic diary interviews. REACT will be used to evaluate relations between mood and coping at three points in treatment (intake, midtreatment, and posttreatment). It has been piloted with 53 youth (ages 12-14 years old; Chu, Crocco, Esseling, Areizaga, Lindner, &amp; Skriner, 2016) and reliably distinguished non-clinical youth from anxious/depressed youth in frequency of behavioral disengagement and intensity of emotions experienced.</description>

    <description>The Rearing Behaviors Questionnaire is a 33-item instrument designed to capture three aspects of parenting behavior: Psychological Control, Autonomy versus Overprotection, and Acceptance versus Rejection. The RBQ combines the 23-item Mother-Father-Peer Inventory (MFP; Epstein, 1983) with the 10-item Psychological Control subscale of the Child Report of Parental Behavior Inventory (CRPBI; Schludermann &amp; Schludermann, 1970), creating a measure that taps parenting constructs reflective of etiological models of anxiety disorders in children.</description>

    <measure>Change in Family Environment Scale - parent and child</measure>
    <time_frame>Trajectory of change every four weeks from pretreatment to postreatment (an average of 16 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>is a 90-item multi-respondent (parent/child) scale that measures each member's perspective on family environment. Four of the 10 subscales (36 items) will be used to assess control (degree of set rules and procedures used to run the family), cohesion (degree of commitment to help and support family members), independence (extent to which family members are assertive and self sufficient), and conflict (amount of openly expressed anger and conflict). The FES is the most widely used measure of family climate with well-documented reliability and validity (Moos &amp; Moos, 2009). The four chosen subscales have also been most consistently associated with internalizing (anxiety/depression) problems in youth. Respondents complete 36 True/False statements about their families; lower scores equate to more negative family environments.</description>

    <description>The DASS-21 is a widely used self-report measure that assesses symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression in adults. Parents will complete this measure about themselves. The DASS-21 will be used to assess the parent's own symptom and stress levels. It asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item was applicable over the previous week using a 0-3 scale with the following response options: did not apply to me (0), applied to me to some degree, or some of the time (1), applied to me a considerable degree, or a good part of the time (2), applied to me very much, or most of the time (3). The DASS-21 distinguishes well between features of depression, physiological arousal, and psychological tension (Antony, Beiling, Cox, Enns, &amp; Swinson, 1998), and has scores in the acceptable to excellent ranges. Additionally, the measure has been demonstrated to be a valid tool for assessing client outcomes in routine clinical practice (Ng, Trauer, Dodd, Callaly, Campbell, &amp; Berk, 2007).</description>

Parents report attitudes toward their child's distress on a Likert-type scale ranging from Never True (1) to Always True (7). The PAAQ is comprised of two factors, Unwillingness (parents' unwillingness to witness their child experience negative emotion) and Inaction (parents' inability to effectively manage their reactions to their child's affect). Psychometric data indicate moderate test-retest reliability, r=.72, and support the temporal stability, internal consistency, and criterion validity of the measure.</description>

In its standard format (Golden, 1978), the SCWT features three subtests: Stroop Word (SW), Stroop Color (SC), and Stroop Color-Word (SCW). All three Stroop subtests comprise 100 items and scoring is based on the number of items read or named correctly within a 45-second time interval. All three subtests have demonstrated good test-retest reliability (r &gt; 0.80; Connor, Franzen, &amp; Sharp, 1988; Graf, Utte, &amp; Tuokko, 1995).</description>

    <description>An important question to ask about any treatment program is whether it reduces the need for other services. To address this question for the VGTS, we rely on the SACA (Horwitz et al., 2001), a standardized interview for parents, tapping use of mental health services across a broad spectrum (including outpatient, inpatient, and school-based). SACA reliability and validity data are now well-documented (Hoagwood et al., 2000; Horwitz et al., 2001; Stiffman et al., 2000).</description>

If a youth meets criteria for a primary diagnosis for a clinical or subclinical anxiety disorder, she or he will be assigned to the Coping Cat (Kendall, 2000). Both CBT treatments include a therapist manual and companion workbooks for the youth. CBT teaches coping skills that help anxious and depressed youth challenge anxious and depressive thinking. It also helps the child habituate to negative physiological feelings and learn skills to cope with emotional distress.</description>

The therapist uses modeling (e.g., revealing therapist's own anxiety and sharing successful coping experiences), in vivo exposure tasks, role-playing (e.g., to prepare for exposure tasks), relaxation training, and contingent reinforcement (e.g., for trying and for succeeding at exposure tasks), in developing these four themes.</description>

    <description>PASCET is a brief (11-15 sessions) CBT program for depressed youths typically aged 8-15. Sessions and practice assignments are built on findings concerning cognitive and behavioral features of youth depression (e.g., Lewinsohn et al., 1990; Stark et al., 1987), and on the two-process model of perceived control and coping (Rothbaum, Weisz, &amp; Snyder, 1982; Weisz et al., 1984a,b). In this model, primary control involves efforts to cope by making objective conditions (e.g., one's activities, one's peer status) conform to one's wishes. In contrast, secondary control involves coping by adjusting oneself (e.g., one's expectations, interpretations) to fit objective conditions, so as to influence their subjective impact without altering the actual conditions. The goal is for youngsters to build their skills in primary and secondary control coping, and apply those skills to events and conditions that can trigger depression. Therapists are guided by a Therapist's Manual and use a youth workbook.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        We expect 200 youth (ages 7-16 years) with a primary anxiety disorder and 200 youth (ages 7
        - 16 years) with a primary depressive disorder to serve as participants. To participate, a
        youth must meet criteria for a primary DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000)
        diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, Social Phobia,
        Specific Phobia, Panic Disorder with or without a history of Agoraphobia, Major Depression
        Disorder, Minor Depression, or Dysthymia. Diagnosis will be based on both youth and parent
        report during an Independent Evaluator (IE) semi-structured interview. Youth may also
        participate with a subclinical diagnosis for any of these disorders if: (a) the youth
        demonstrates sufficient symptoms but does not yet reach clinical levels of impairment OR
        (b) the youth demonstrates only several symptoms related to the above disorders but
        demonstrates clinical impairment, AND (c) the consenting parent agrees that anxiety or mood
        problems would be appropriate as a clinical focus for treatment. Allowing youth with
        subclinical diagnoses will allow the study to investigate the effectiveness of the
        therapies across a range of clinical severity. This design models usual community care
        where a larger range of severity is witnessed and many youth may not meet all criteria for
        formal diagnosis. After receiving an initial diagnostic assessment, the parent must consent
        and the youth must assent to continued participation in the study and must be willing to
        receive psychological therapy at the Youth Anxiety and Depression Clinic (YAD-C), a
        specialty program within the outpatient clinic of the Rutgers University Graduate School of
        Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Youth who have a primary diagnosis of a DSM-IV disorder other than anxiety or depression
        (e.g., anorexia nervosa, Postraumatic Stress Disorder, Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity
        Disorder), or who have received any diagnosis of mental retardation, a pervasive
        developmental disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder will be excluded. Youth who
        demonstrate suicidal ideation or intent (by child or parent report) severe enough to
        require current hospitalization, or youth who have attempted suicide in the past 3 months,
        will also be excluded. These clinical problems require specialized treatment that YAD-C is
        not prepared to offer.
