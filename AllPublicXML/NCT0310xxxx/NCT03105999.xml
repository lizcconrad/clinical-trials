    <textblock>
      In COPD patients, a distinctive clustering of symptoms in the 3 parts of the day, early
      morning, day-time and night-time has been observed. These clusters are relevant to shape the
      health status and to explain the need of care. The objective of the STORICO study is to
      quantify the intra-day fluctuation of symptoms and to verify whether it: marks selected COPD
      phenotypes and is stable over time. STORICO is an observational prospective cohort
      multicenter study. 600 COPD patients &gt;50 years will be enrolled. The multidimensional
      assessment will cover pattern of symptoms, complete spirometry and DLCO (Diffusing capacity
      of Lung for Carbon Monoxide ), comorbidity and health status. Based on clinical data,
      patients will be grouped in clinical phenotypes. Intra-day symptoms fluctuation will by rated
      by standardized questionnaires and the relationship between clinical/statistical clusters and
      symptoms fluctuations assessed. Finally, patients will be reassessed at 6 and 12 months, and
      the 12 month incidence of selected outcomes (frequency of exacerbations, use of health care
      resources) will be computed. Results are expected to clarify the classificatory and
      prognostic role of symptoms fluctuations in addition to classical measures of disease status
      and to compare health status and prognosis of clusters. Intra-day variations and stability of
      symptoms over time will likely improve our understanding of phenotypic variability of COPD.

      Primary objective - cross-sectional phase 1. To describe the frequency of early-morning, day-
      and night-time COPD symptoms according to phenotypes in a cohort of Italian patients with
      stable COPD (GOLD 2014 criteria). Symptoms will be evaluated by means of the Night-Time,
      Morning and Day-Time symptoms of COPD questionnaire. Primary objective - longitudinal phase
      1. To describe the 12-month frequency and evolution of early-morning, day- and night-time
      COPD symptoms according to phenotypes measured at enrolment. Symptoms will be evaluated by
      means of the Night-Time, Morning and Day-Time symptoms of COPD questionnaire. Secondary
      objectives - cross sectional phase 1. To evaluate the association between early-morning, day-
      and night-time symptoms frequency at enrolment and the following outcomes: • dyspnea level •
      disease severity, as defined by the GOLD 2014 criteria (stages A to D) • quality of life •
      physical activity • quality of sleep • frequency and severity of exacerbations • level of
      depression and anxiety Secondary objectives - longitudinal phase 1. To describe the 12-month
      variation of the following outcomes according to phenotypes measured at enrolment: • dyspnea
      level • quality of life • physical activity • quality of sleep • frequency and severity of
      exacerbations • level of depression and anxiety 2. To describe the healthcare resources
      utilization in a cohort of Italian patients with COPD during 12-month observation, globally
      and by phenotypes. STUDY DESIGN: Italian observational cohort multicentre study in patients
      with stable COPD PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: 600 patients STUDY PROCEDURE The study plan
      foresees: -Enrolment visit [Baseline visit (V1)] -A control visit at 6 months since Baseline
      at the investigational site (V2) -A final visit at 12 months since Baseline at the
      investigational site (V3) The clinical staff at the investigational sites will collect
      retrospectively all the necessary information about the medical history of the patient to
      confirm his-her eligibility. Patients confirmed with a diagnosis of stable COPD will be
      evaluated at enrolment visit and, if eligible, they will be asked to provide a written and
      signed privacy and informed consent form. The diagnosis of stable COPD should be compliant
      with 2014 GOLD criteria (stages A to D). At enrolment visit, patients will be asked to
      complete questionnaires for early-morning, day- and night-time symptoms, level of dyspnea,
      quality of life, physical activity, anxiety and depression levels, sleep quality, as well as
      to provide data on lifestyle, such as smoking. The investigator will be requested to complete
      study case report forms (CRFs) recording specified baseline information (demography data,
      medical history and comorbidities, COPD phenotype, ongoing treatments for COPD). Finally
      patients will perform a spirometry (baseline, lung volumes, bronchodilation test and CO
      diffusion) according to routine clinical practice. No additional mandated interventions on
      top of routinely performed physician visits, examinations or treatments will be required.
      Except the completion of the questionnaires, there are no other study-prescribed procedures.
      Any procedure ordered by the physician during this study will be one that is appropriate to
      the routine clinical care delivered to the COPD patients at the discretion of the physician.
      After 6 and 12 months, the same information as in the enrolment visits will be collected,
      excluding demographic data, to ascertain any changes in the outcomes of interest, including
      any exacerbations and medical healthcare resources utilization in the period between the
      visits. At follow up visits, patients will undergo the same procedures (spirometry) performed
      at the enrolment visit. For the entire period of observation, data regarding Adverse
      Event/Serious Adverse Event will be collected.

    <measure>Frequency of early-morning, day- and night-time COPD symptoms according to phenotypes in a cohort of Italian patients with stable COPD. Symptoms will be evaluated by means of the Night-Time, Morning and Day-Time symptoms of COPD questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of early-morning, day and night-time symptoms at enrolment will be assessed based on the questions of the &quot;Night-time, Morning and Day-time Symptoms of COPD questionnaire&quot;. It will be calculated within each class of phenotype as the ratio between the number of patients with at least 1 (early-morning, day and night-time) symptom in the week before enrolment and the total number of evaluable patients in the class. Three proportions will be calculated (for early-morning, day and night-time). The frequency of early-morning, day and night-time symptoms severity will be described too: for this reason, the proportion of mild, moderate, severe and very severe early-morning, day- and night-time symptoms in the week before enrollment will be provided.
The frequency of specific COPD symptoms (breathlessness, coughing, bringing up phlegm or mucus, wheezing, chest tightness, chest congestion) will be also provided according to phenotypes.</description>

    <measure>12-month frequency and change from baseline of early-morning, day- and night-time COPD symptoms according to phenotypes measured at enrolment. Symptoms will be evaluated by means of the Night-Time, Morning and Day-Time symptoms of COPD questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Phenotypes will be defined as per clinician judgment at enrollment. The proportion of patients changing phenotype during one-year observation provided.
Within each class, the frequency of early-morning, day and night-time symptoms at each follow up visit will be calculated as the ratio between the number of patients with at least 1 symptom in the week preceding the follow up visit and the total number of evaluable patients in the class of phenotype with available &quot;Night-time, Morning and Day-time Symptoms of COPD questionnaire&quot; (COPD questionnaire) at follow up visit.
For each patient the number of early-morning, day- and night-time symptom at each study visit together with the variation between visits will be calculated separately in the groups of patients according to baseline phenotype.
The variation will be calculated as the difference between the number of symptoms at 12- (6-) month follow up and at baseline and between the number of symptoms at 12- and at 6-month follow up.</description>
