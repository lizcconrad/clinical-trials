    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomised study is to investigate the feasibility of conducting a superiority
      randomised controlled trial comparing the application of combined autologous PRP and
      concentrated autologous bone marrow (PRP-BMA) in addition to standard of care (either reamed
      intramedullary nailing or fine wire ring external fixator) for patients presenting with fresh
      tibial diaphyseal fractures.
