  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that long-term fermented high-fibre rye intake may reduce the
      Helicobacter pylori infection through dampening inflammation and thereby leading to lower
      adherence of the bacteria to surfaces.The investigators further hypothesize that that
      inflammation could be a potential causal link between HP infection and insulin resistance, a
      risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

      A randomized, double-blind, 12 week parallel dietary intervention study is conducted to
      evaluate the effects of the two novel food products containing fermented rye bran in normal
      weight and overweight men and women with prevalent HP infection. A follow-up is planned at
      week 24. The primary endpoint is severity of HP infection indicated by a breath test.
      Secondary endpoints include effects on chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, blood
      lipids, blood cholesterol,body weight, intestinal microbial clusters et al. The food products
      given to the treatment group will be a novel breakfast cereal product and a crispbread
      product containing fermented rye bran. The control product will be corresponding products
      based on refined wheat. The foods will be served for breakfast, lunch, and a snack as part of
      an isocaloric diet.

    <description>Intake of food product with a patented fermented rye bran: A patented fermented rye bran ingredient for food purpose has been produced through a process where a specific Lactobacillus curvatis strain was incubated with rye bran by Kampffmayer Food Innovation GmbH, Germany. The dried fermented rye bran was incorporated into a whole grain rye crisp bread product (25% on weight basis) commercially available in Sweden and in a novel extruded whole grain rye product (20%) developed by Lantmännen.Two crisp rye bread pieces (2 x 12g) were packed into moisture and air tight portion package. Participants are advised to consume 4 pieces daily. Rye puff was packed into 2 moisture and air tight portion bags. Participants are advised to consume 2 bags daily. Total energy: 518 kcal/day.</description>
