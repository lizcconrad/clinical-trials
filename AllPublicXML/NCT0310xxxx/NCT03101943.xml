  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the impact of a brief home-visiting module, called &quot;Family Spirit
      Nurture&quot; (FSN), on American Indian (AI) parent feeding practices associated with increased
      risk for early childhood obesity, with a primary focus on delaying introduction of infants'
      Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) (including soda, energy drinks, juice with added sugar and
      other drinks with added sugar) intake while teaching mothers complementary feeding and
      responsive parenting practices. The investigators will also assess how water insecurity may
      moderate parents' feeding of SSBs to young children. Finally, the investigators will explore
      whether maternal knowledge of oral health practices and/or reduction of infants' SSB intake
      influences early indicators of infant's oral health (i.e., infants' oral microbiome and
      plaque formation). Our evaluation will employ a randomized controlled design, in which the
      control condition receives a beneficial home-safety educational model and assistance in
      safety proofing their homes for small children. Assessments in both groups will occur at
      baseline (between 6 and 10 weeks postpartum) and 4 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months
      postpartum.

      Primary Aims:

      Aim 1: To determine the effectiveness of the brief (6 lessons) FSN home-visiting parent
      feeding practice module on reducing SSB initiation and frequency among infants between 3 and
      12 months of age. Hypothesis 1: Infants whose mothers receive FSN vs. controls will be less
      likely to introduce SSBs between 3 and 12 months of age.

      Aim 2: To determine the effectiveness of FSN to promote optimal complementary feeding and
      responsive parenting practices. Hypothesis 2: Mothers who receive FSN vs. controls will be
      more likely to practice recommended complementary feeding and responsive parenting practices
      between 3 and 12 months of age.

      Aim 3: To determine the impact of water insecurity on SSB consumption among infants between 3
      and 6 months of age. Hypothesis 2: Parents who report water insecurity vs. those who do not
      will be more likely to give infants SSBs between 3 and 6 months of age.

      Secondary Aims:

      Secondary Aim 1: To explore if provision of water to families reduces SSB intake among
      mothers and infants ages 6 to 9 months of age.

      Secondary Aim 2: To explore if infants in the FSN intervention have better oral health
      outcomes than control infants up to 12 months postpartum.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a pilot randomized 1:1 controlled trial with 136 mother-infant
      dyads. Participants will be pre-screened for water insecurity and distributed equally across
      the two study arms using stratified block randomization. The intervention group (n=68) will
      receive the FSN home-visiting module, consisting of six 45-minute lessons delivered biweekly
      by trained local AI Family Health Coaches (FHCs), from 3 to 6 months postpartum. The lessons
      focus on elimination or reduction of Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) among infants while
      teaching mothers complementary feeding and responsive parenting practices. The control group
      (n=68) will receive three home-based lessons with home safety information (injury prevention
      is a priority identified by Navajo leadership that does not interfere with study questions).
      All families will receive delivery of drinking water from 6 to 9 months postpartum. Through
      this staggered design, the investigators will evaluate the impact of the FSN on infant
      feeding practices associated with increased risk for early childhood obesity, with a primary
      focus on delaying introduction of infant's SSB intake. The investigators will also be able to
      evaluate the impact of the availability of potable water on SSB intake, with or without
      family education. In addition, participants will have the opportunity to provide additional
      consent for a nested oral health study to evaluate the impact of the FSN curriculum and water
      provision on infant oral health indicators.

      Methods:

      Study implementation will include four phases:

      Phase 1 (Referral, Recruitment, Consent, Baseline Assessment and Randomization): Potentially
      eligible mothers will be referred to our study staff, who will screen for eligibility,
      consent/assent mothers, conduct baseline assessment, and assign randomization status.
      Randomization will be assigned after the completion of the baseline assessment, including
      scoring of the participant's water insecurity status. Two randomization lists (one for water
      secure mothers and one for water insecure mothers) will be created prior to study initiation
      using STATA 14 statistical software37.

      Part 2 (Home-Based Education Intervention): Local FHCs, trained and employed by Johns
      Hopkins, will deliver either the intervention (6-session FSN) or the control condition (3-
      Home-Safety Lessons) between 3 to 6 months postpartum.

      Part 3 (Water Delivery): All participants will have drinking water delivered to their home
      from 6 to 9 months postpartum. FHCs will deliver water either weekly or less often, depending
      on needs of family. The amount of water delivered will be based on number of adults and
      children residing in home during this period of the study.

      Part 4 (Assessment): Our assessment post-baseline consists of a mixed-methods assessment,
      including maternal self-reports and maternal FHC-administered interviews collected using
      REDCap at 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 12 months postpartum and maternal and infant medical chart
      reviews. If consent is given for the nested oral health study, the additional assessments
      will include a maternal self-report measure, collection and microbiologic testing of infant
      plaque and saliva, an infant oral examination, tooth eruption evaluations and infant medical
      and dental chart reviews.

    <description>The control group (n=68) will receive three home-based lessons with home safety information (injury prevention is a priority identified by Navajo leadership that does not interfere with study questions). Mothers randomized to the control group will receive 3 educational lessons on home safety and child safety proofing. These meaningful topics were selected so as not to dilute measurement on key FSN outcomes and to provide benefit to all study participants. Lessons will be delivered monthly (at 3, 4 and 5 months postpartum) in the same format as the FSN lessons, by trained FHCs in the home of the participant or in a private place of their choosing. All families will receive water delivery of drinking water from 6 to 9 months postpartum.</description>

    <description>Drinking water will be delivered to the household of each participant (both in the FSN intervention and control groups) from 6 to 9 months postpartum. The amount of water will be determined by the number of children and adults living in the household at the time of water delivery. The first delivery of water will occur at the time of the 6-month evaluation and the last delivery will occur at the time of the 9-month evaluation. Water will be delivered as often as weekly. Those families who do not need weekly water delivery (based on their preference and their usage of the first delivery of water) will receive water less frequently.</description>
