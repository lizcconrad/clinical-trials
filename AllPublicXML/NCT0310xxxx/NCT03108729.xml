      A pediatric drug study to determine the long-term safety and tolerability in children and
      adolescents (4-17 years in age) taking the drug (elsicarbazepine acetate)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, multicenter, open-label, safety, tolerability, and maintenance of effect
      study of flexible daily dosing with Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in subjects 4 to 17 years
      of age with partial onset seizures (POS). The study is designed to enroll subjects to receive
      ESL as adjunctive treatment with the option to convert to ESL monotherapy after 6 months of
      ESL adjunctive treatment. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled to obtain approximately
      75 subjects completing 1 year of treatment. At least 25% of subjects will be enrolled in each
      age group (4 - 6, 7 - 11, and 12 - 17 years of age). An attempt will be made to enroll no
      fewer than 30% of subjects in each gender. It is anticipated that approximately 50 subjects
      will convert to monotherapy during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female, 4 to &lt; 18 y at enrollment, and weighs at least 11 kg at
             Screening and on the first day of ESL dosing.

          2. The informed consent must be signed by the parent or legal guardian, and, when
             appropriate and/or required by state or local law, minor subjects must give written
             informed assent prior to participation in the study. All subjects in the United States
             (US) must have a parent or legal guardian, sign a Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act (HIPAA) form.

          3. Confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy with partial onset seizures as defined in the
             Classification of Seizures of the International League Against Epilepsy:

               1. Epilepsy with partial onset seizures with observable motor component, or complex
                  partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization

               2. Documented EEG recording without generalized epileptiform abnormalities and with
                  demonstrated focal abnormalities (done within 5 years prior to screening)

          4. Documented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan conducted within 5 years (older scans
             may be acceptable with consent of Medical Monitor) prior to screening, showing either
             normal results or static focal abnormalities.

          5. Documented seizure frequency of at least 6 seizures per month prior to screening as
             reported by a caregiver and documented in subject's seizure history. Note:
             Retrospective reporting of seizure frequency does not require diary documentation.

          6. Stable treatment with 1 to 3 AEDs (excluding carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine) for ≥ 2
             weeks prior to screening and at least 4 weeks prior to the first ESL dose. Vagal nerve
             stimulation (if present) does not count as an AED.

          7. Subject and/or caregiver are willing and able to complete a daily seizure diary for
             the duration of the study and comply with study procedures.

          8. A female subject is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:

               1. Non-childbearing potential because she is premenarchal (as assessed by physical
                  examination) and &lt; 7 y; or

               2. Non-childbearing potential because she is premenarchal (as assessed by physical
                  examination), ≥ 7 y, and has a negative urine pregnancy test at screening; or

               3. Childbearing potential; has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and
                  agrees to satisfy one of the following requirements:

                  • Complete abstinence from intercourse as a component of a habitually abstinent
                  lifestyle; a minimum of 4 weeks prior to administration of the first dose of
                  study drug, throughout the treatment period, and for a minimum of 8 weeks after
                  completion or premature discontinuation from the study drug (abstinence must be
                  part of an established abstinent lifestyle), and agrees to use a double-barrier
                  method if she becomes sexually active; or

                  • Established use of acceptable methods of contraception; a minimum of 4 weeks
                  prior to administration of the first dose of study drug, throughout the treatment
                  period, and for a minimum of 8 weeks after completion or premature
                  discontinuation from the study drug. Acceptable methods of birth control are
                  those with established failure rates of &lt; 1%per year and include:

                    -  Double barrier birth control, which is limited to a condom plus spermicide
                       or a condom plus diaphragm.

                    -  Intrauterine device (IUD). Note: Female subjects who are ≥ 7 y and
                       premenarchal will not routinely undergo serum pregnancy tests and will only
                       be administered a urine pregnancy test. A positive urine pregnancy test
                       should be confirmed by a serum test in these subjects regardless of weight.
                       Female subjects who are &lt; 7 y will not undergo a serum or a urine pregnancy
                       test.

             Note: ESL may interfere with the action of hormonal contraceptive and therefore
             hormonal contraceptives are not sufficient for this protocol.

          9. Males must be willing to remain sexually abstinent (consistent with lifestyle) or use
             an effective method of birth control (eg, male using condom and female using
             diaphragm, contraceptive sponge, spermicide, contraceptive pill, or intrauterine
             device) from signing informed consent to at least 7 days after the last dose of study
             drug has been taken.

         10. Stable environment with caregiver who can assist in completion of seizure diary and
             other study assessments, if needed.

         11. Subject and/or caregiver must read and write and possess an educational level and
             degree of understanding of the local language at a level sufficient to complete study
             related assessments or communicate suitably with the Investigator and study
             coordinator. For subjects who do not meet this criterion, a caregiver must be able to
             meet this requirement on the subject's behalf.

         21. Subject has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) at screening. Note: Subjects with a
             positive drug screen for amphetamines, opiates, or benzodiazepines, who have a
             prescribed medication for at least 4 weeks prior to screening, may be eligible to
             participate in the study upon approval from the Medical Monitor.

         22. Subject has a major medical illness other than epilepsy that would prevent safe
             participation in this study, at the discretion of the Investigator, such as (but not

             gastrointestinal surgery, clinically significant abnormality of the hepatic or renal
             system). Note: Active medical conditions that are minor or well-controlled are not
             exclusionary if they do not affect risk to the subject or the study results. In cases
             in which the impact of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is
             unclear, the Medical Monitor should be consulted.

        Subject has a history or presence of abnormal ECG, which in the Investigator's opinion is
        clinically significant or QTcB of ~ 450 msec per screening central over read ECG.

        testing (free T3, free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH]) indicating the presence of
        significant thyroid dysfunction.

        28. Subjects has the following abnormal laboratory tests (not limited to, but including the
        following): a. Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT)/alanine aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 1.5 times
        the upper limit of normal (ULN) b. White blood cell (WBC) count of &lt; 2500 cells/μL c.

        mL/min/1.73m2.

        e. Subject has a sodium level of &lt; 130 mEq/L.

        Note: If any laboratory exclusion criteria are outside the normal range, the necessity for
        a repeat test should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. If upon retesting the value
        remains outside the protocol-specified range, the significance of this value may be
        discussed with the Medical Monitor for enrollment consideration.

        29. Subject has difficulty providing blood samples due to poor venous access or cannot
        safely provide a sufficient quantity of blood.
