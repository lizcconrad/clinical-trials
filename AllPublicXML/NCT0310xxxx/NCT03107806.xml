    <description>The above specified part of the study is ongoing. Preliminary data confirms accuracy of recorded glucose values but there is a problem with venous access over the intended time of 48 hours. A new type of venous access will be tested and ethics approval has just been accomplished.</description>

    <description>Targets for plasma glucose are defined and the personnel will have support of the new equipment allowing continuous monitoring of glucose levels when adjusting glucose lowering therapy. This will be compared to monitoring with standard, intermittent glucose measuring.</description>
