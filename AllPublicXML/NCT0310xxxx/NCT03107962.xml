      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 blockade
      pembrolizumab for patients with relapsed or refractory Natural Killer(NK)/T Cell Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed or refractory NK/T cell lymphoma usually have a bad prognosis. These
      patients cannot be treated successfully with the conventional chemotherapy. The investigators
      have been proceeding this trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the immune checkpoint
      inhibitor PD-1 blockade, pembrolizumab in the patients with relapsed or refractory NK/T cell
      lymphoma.
