  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel, and nivolumab combination will be administered for three cycles
      of three weeks duration each. TORS or RT/CRT will be performed after induction chemotherapy
      (i.e. day 64 of therapy). Patients with low risk and small volume tonsillar disease (T1-T2,
      non-bulky N2A-N2B with ≤2 non-lower neck lymph nodes measuring ≤5 cm in size) or base of
      tongue disease (T1-2 with lateralized primary ≤3 cm, non-bulky N2A-N2B with ≤2 non-lower neck
      lymph nodes measuring ≤5 cm in size) who have ≥50% reduction by RECIST following induction
      chemotherapy will undergo TORS and selective nodal dissection. De-intensified adjuvant RT
      will be given for adverse pathologic features. Patients may refuse TORS treatment.

      Patients with low risk, who do not qualify for TORS (due to volume of disease or poor
      visualization/access) or refuse TORS, who have ≥50% reduction by RECIST following induction
      chemotherapy will be given de-intensified treatment with radiation alone to 50 Gy.

      Before induction chemotherapy, patients will undergo examination under anesthesia and direct
      laryngoscopy to tattoo and photograph the primary tumor to plan the post-induction resection.
      Adjuvant nivolumab will be offered to all patients for 6-months post completion of definitive
      therapy (7 doses given as a flat dose of 480mg, every four weeks).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A phase II trial in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer
      (as determined by p16 immunohistochemistry with confirmatory ISH or PCR) to determine
      radiologic response to induction chemotherapy with nivolumab. Patients will undergo
      evaluation by a multidisciplinary team prior to risk assessment. The patients will be
      assigned to high or low risk groups based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and smoking
      history. Patients will be assigned to treatment with induction chemotherapy with carboplatin,
      nab-paclitaxel, and nivolumab. Radiologic response to induction chemotherapy according to
      RECIST measurement of tumor shrinkage will then be used for therapeutic stratification of
      locoregional therapy, consisting of either transoral robotic surgery (TORS) or radiation with
      or without chemotherapy. Patients with low risk disease (see table above) and small volume
      tonsillar/BOT disease (T1-2 primary, non-bulky N2A-N2B nodal status) who have ≥50% reduction
      by RECIST following induction chemotherapy will undergo TORS for primary site resection and
      selective nodal dissection as a definitive treatment if technically feasible with adjuvant
      radiation for adverse pathologic features. Patients with other low risk tumors e.g. with
      higher volume disease, or who refuse surgery, who also have ≥50% reduction by RECIST
      following induction chemotherapy will be given de-intensified treatment with radiation alone
      to 50 Gy (no chemotherapy). Patients with low risk features and &lt;50% but ≥30% reduction OR
      high risk features (T4, bulky N2B or N2C-N3, &gt;10 pack-years tobacco use) with ≥50% reduction
      will receive de-intensified chemoradiation with concurrent cisplatin-RT to 50 Gy (5 weeks) or
      TFHX to 45 Gy (3 cycles/6 weeks). Patients with low risk features and &lt;30% reduction OR high
      risk disease with &lt;50% reduction or any patients with progressive disease during induction
      chemotherapy will undergo chemoradiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin-RT to 70 Gy (7 weeks)
      or TFHX to 75 Gy (5 cycles/10 weeks). Patients with both high and low risk features who have
      ≥50% reduction will receive locoregional therapy targeting the pre-chemotherapy extent of
      disease only. Adjuvant nivolumab will be offered to all patients for 6-months post completion
      of definitive therapy (7 doses given as a flat dose of 480mg, every four weeks).

                  exempt from contraceptive requirements. However, they must still undergo
                  pregnancy testing as described in this section.

          -  Investigators shall counsel WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active with WOCBP
             on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of an unexpected
             pregnancy. Investigators shall advise WOCBP and male subjects who are sexually active

          -  Complete Abstinence*

               -  *Complete abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse
                  and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. Female subjects
                  must continue to have pregnancy tests. Acceptable alternate methods of highly
                  effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the subject chooses
                  to forego complete abstinence.

        Subjects are encouraged to use two methods of contraception, with one method being highly
        effective and the other method being either highly effective or less effective as listed
        below:

        LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION

          -  Diaphragm with spermicide

          -  Cervical cap with spermicide

          -  Vaginal sponge

          -  Male condoms and spermicide

          -  Male condom without spermicide

          -  Progestin only pills by WOCBP subject or male subject's WOCBP partner

          -  Female condom*

               -  *A male and female condom must not be used together

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unequivocal demonstration of distant metastases (M1 disease).

          -  Unidentifiable primary site.

          -  Intercurrent medical illnesses which would impair patient tolerance to therapy or
             limit survival. Including but not limited to ongoing or active infection,
             immunodeficiency, symptomatic congestive heart failure, pulmonary dysfunction,
             cardiomyopathy, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance.

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded because of the potential teratogenic effects
             and potential unknown effects on nursing newborns (please see above paragraph under
             inclusion criteria regarding WOCBP) 31 Version Date: 12/28/2016

          -  Prior surgical therapy other than incisional/excisional biopsy or organ-sparing
             procedures such as debulking of airway-compromising tumors. Residual measurable tumor
             is required for enrollment on study as outlined above

          -  Patients receiving other investigational agents.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt;grade 1

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy in excess
             of physiologic dose or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior
             to the first dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known history of active tuberculosis (Bacillus Tuberculosis infection)

          -  Has hypersensitivity to nivolumab or any other drug used in this protocol.

          -  Has had a prior systemic anti-cancer treatment within the last 8 weeks

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer or any
             tumors that are not likely to influence live expectancy in the subsequent 3 years
             without active treatment (e.g. low grade prostate cancer in absence of therapy).

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past year
             (i.e. with use of steroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy e.g.
             levothyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid doses for adrenal or pituitary
             insufficiency, etc. are not considered a form of systemic treatment.

          -  Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          -  Has a history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected). However, if eradicated patient is eligible.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy. o Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed within 28 days prior to initiation of
             treatment.
