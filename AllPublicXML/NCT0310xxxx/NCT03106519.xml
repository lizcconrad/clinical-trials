  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Dupuytren's contracture requires multiple injections into the palm of the hand
      to weaken the cords, followed by rupture of the strands 2 days later. Anesthesia is required
      for both phases of treatment. It is hypothesized that extended-release liposome bupivacaine
      prolongs nerve blockade of the wrist allowing patients to undergo this 2-part regimen with
      less pain.
