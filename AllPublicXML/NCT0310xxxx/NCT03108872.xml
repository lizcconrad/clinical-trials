      We will compare long-term effectiveness and safety in patients with atrial fibrillation
      treated with left atrial appendage occlusion versus new oral anticoagulants to prevent
      ischemic stroke from multicenter registry data
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a substantial risk of stroke and systemic
      embolism. Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with
      atrial fibrillation and high risk of ischemic stroke. However, their use is limited by a
      narrow therapeutic range, increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage, the need for continuous
      monitoring of INR, and drug or food interaction. New oral anticoagulants (NOACs), the direct
      thrombin inhibitor and the factor Xa inhibitor, have settled these limitations of warfarin
      therapy. In four pivotal phase 3 clinical trials and their meta-analysis, NOACs have been
      shown to significantly reduce ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality, and
      had similar major bleeding as for warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation
      (NVAF). Another new treatment strategy for prevention of stroke is left atrial appendage
      occlusion (LAAO). Left atrial appendage has been considered to be an origin of thrombi more
      than 90% of cases. The concept that exclusion of LAA from the circulation reduces the risk of
      stroke in patients with NVAF is therefore being tested in clinical studies. LAAO with
      Watchman device and only aspirin were proved to be non-inferior to warfarin for ischemic
      stroke prevention or systemic embolism. And, LAAO reduced significantly cardiac death and
      hemorrhagic stroke compared to warfarin in a long-term follow up. Up to date, there was no
      study to compare long-term clinical outcomes between LAAO and NOACs, which are two new
      treatment strategies for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF.
