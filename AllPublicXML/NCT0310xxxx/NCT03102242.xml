      Phase II trial of induction immunotherapy with atezolizumab for patients with unresectable

      This phase II pilot trial will combine neoadjuvant immunotherapy with Atezolizumab q 21 days
      for 12 weeks with standard chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for good PS patients with
      unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCLC. Because of the consequences of progression in this
      curative-intent population, restaging CT scans will be carried out after the first 2 cycles
      of neoadjuvant therapy. Non progressing patients will complete a total of one year of
      anti-PDL1 therapy with an interruption during chemoradiotherapy. Patients with evidence of
      progression at the first restaging evaluation will proceed immediately to chemoradiotherapy
      if still eligible for curative intent therapy.

    <description>The primary objective of this single arm phase II trial is to determine whether neoadjuvant and adjuvant anti-PD-L1 therapy bracketing standard chemoradiation therapy and consolidation therapy is worthy of further investigation. The primary endpoint will be the disease control rate (DCR) after 12 weeks induction immunotherapy.</description>

    <description>Induction immunotherapy: atezolizumab 1200 mg IV q 21 days x 4 cycles. Restaging after cycle 2 and cycle 4 induction: patients with progression of disease (PD) at the post-cycle 2 assessment will stop atezolizumab and go immediately to chemoradiotherapy if still stage III and eligible for curative intent therapy.
Chemoradiotherapy: carboplatin AUC = 2 + paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 IV weekly x 6 weeks concurrent with radiation to a total dose of 60 Gy given in 2 Gy fractions daily M-F x 30 fractions
Consolidation chemotherapy: Carboplatin AUC = 6 + paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV q 21 days x 2 cycles beginning 3-5 weeks after completion of radiation.
Adjuvant immunotherapy: atezolizumab 1200 mg IV q 21 days to complete one year of therapy (from start of induction).</description>
