  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      End-stage heart failure (ESHF) represents a major burden in terms of quality of life,
      mortality and costs. The current practice in France is to treat patients with ESHF by a
      combination of drugs and lifestyle interventions before proposing heart transplant (HT) if
      there is no contraindication. In the Heart and Diabetes Center of Bad Oyenhausen (BO) in
      Germany, patients presenting with ESHF are preferentially managed by ventricular assist
      device (VAD) therapy. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of these
      two strategies in the management of ESHF and associated consumption of resources.

        All patients presenting with end-stage heart failure between November 2010 and October 2011
        at the Heart and Diabetes Center of Bad Oeynhausen, and who underwent ventricular assist
        device implantations were included in group I. All patients presenting with end-stage heart
        failure to the Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou or the Groupe Hospitalier
        Pitié-Salpêtrière, during that same period, were included in group II.
