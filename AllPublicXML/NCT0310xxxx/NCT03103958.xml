  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The probiotic for oral use, Probiatop®, consists of Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM,
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, Lactobacillus paracasei LPC-37 and Bifidobacterium lactis
      HN019. Its activity will be compared with placebo (Maltodextrin). The metagenomics data will
      be correlated with the Quality of Life Questionnaire answers obtained from participants with
      intestinal transit problem. The Increase in the number of evacuations, as well as the
      improvement of complaints related to intestinal transit alteration will be evaluated during
      the study. The participants will use probiotic or placebo for a period of 28 days and the
      gastrointestinal function questionnaire and collect stool will be performed before the study
      and after period of treatment

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a double-blind, randomized, placebo control study that evaluated the action of a
      probiotic in relation to a placebo in the human intestinal microbiome by the technique of
      metagenomics, as well as evaluated the effects of this probiotic on the gastrointestinal
      transit of constipated participants.

      One hundred and twenty constipated patients will be randomized into two groups:Probiatop or
      Placebo. The first 22 patients from each group will also perform a metagenomic evaluation
      through the stool sample collection before and after of treatment. Besides these procedures,
      all patients will fill out a symptom assessment questionnaire at baseline of the study, and
      then after 14 and 28 days after the beginning of the treatment.
