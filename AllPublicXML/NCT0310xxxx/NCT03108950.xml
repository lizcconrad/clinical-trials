  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of the study in our example is to conduct a feasibility translational
      home-based exercise trial established in the LEADERS (R2) project with the TExt-ME
      tele-exercise training system for participants with neurologic disability. We hypothesize
      that participants in this home-based tele-exercise training program will achieve similar
      gains in health and function outcomes as the onsite exercise training program. Further, there
      will be no difference in adverse side effects (safety) between the home-based and onsite
      exercise treatment groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TExT-ME is a home-based tele-exercise study providing a novel exercise program to
      participants with neurologic disabilities. The exercise curriculum is a Movement 2 Music
      (M2M) program developed during phase 2 of the grant (clinicaltrials.gov identifier
      NCT02533882). The exercise exercise classes are taught by trained dance instructors and are
      composed of a set of exercises tailored to the specific needs and capabilities of adults with
      neurologic disability. Each set of exercises is performed to high and low tempo music based
      on the individual's baseline level of function, with adjustments made to increase or decrease
      intensity if needed. The class consists of several training components: a) warmup (10 min.)
      to increase range of motion; strength/balance (15-20 min), aerobics (25-30 min. with rest
      periods as necessary); cool down (5 min).

      The TExT-ME training and monitoring system is a user-centered design (UCD) involving a
      tele-exercise coach (e.g., a trained research staff person) interacting remotely with a
      participant in their home using video conferencing programs. Participants wear monitors to
      maintain safe levels of exercise and provide feedback regarding exercise intensity to the
      instructors. Self-reported indicators of exercise intensity are also collected using rating
      of perceived exertion.
