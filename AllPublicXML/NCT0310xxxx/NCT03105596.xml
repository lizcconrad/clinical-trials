    <textblock>
      This is a prospective phase II clinical trial to observe the efficacy and safety of Chidamide
      combined with DICE (Dexamethasone, Ifosfamide, Cisplatin and Etoposide) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

      Chidamide，a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in China. The aim of this study was to
      observe the efficacy and safety of Chidamide combined with DICE in patients with relapsed or
      refractory B-cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).
