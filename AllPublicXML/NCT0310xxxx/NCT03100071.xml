  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients with Central Venous Catheter (CVC) Associated Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) will
      be treated with Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) and apixaban. Study duration is 12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients who have developed blood clot in the arm that has the central venous catheter
      will be treated with standard of care blood thinning injection of low molecular weight
      heparin for 1 week and then for apixaban 5 mg twice daily for the rest of 11 weeks. Data will
      be collected to see if the central venous catheter &quot;survived&quot; or remained in place and did
      not have to be taken out because of the clot.
