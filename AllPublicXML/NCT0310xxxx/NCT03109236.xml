  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal translates a hypothesis driven basic research into clinical setting to
      determine the potential of using autologous CD133+ cells to reverse fibrosis and improve
      clinical outcome for patients with end stage cirrhosis. This has significant impact on the
      management of cirrhosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 arm randomised study patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis involving
      minimum of 23 and maximum of 33 patients in each arm.

      The investigators propose that transplantation of mobilized autologous CD133+ cells harvested
      from the bone marrow directly into the liver has the ability to replace and regenerate the
      damaged sinusoidal endothelium as well as normalize macrophage and Natural Killer (NK) cell
      function. The niche provided by the refenestrated endothelium can polarize the macrophage to
      antifibrotic phenotype as well as directly inactivate the activated myofibroblast, resulting
      in reversal of liver fibrosis and improvement in liver function. Transplantation of cells
      will be via intraportal route delivered by percutaneous cannulation of the portal vein
      system.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 2 arm randomised study patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis involving 33 patients in each arm. Randomisation will be done by statistician to determine which arm patients will be in (control / treatment).
Treatment arm:
Patient will undergo CD133+ cells transplantation at stable compensated state. 5 dose Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (GCSF) will be administered 5 days consecutively before bone marrow harvesting.
Approximately 250ml of bone marrow will be harvested and subjected to CD133 isolation using clinimacs (Miltenyi Biotec) in a closed system
Under ultrasound guidance, 50 mls of 50-100 million CD133 cells will be infused directly through transhepatic route into portal venous circulation of the liver over 5 mins.
Control Arm:
Patients will receive 5 doses of GCSF</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding will be maintained by investigators performing analysis of the results. Given the invasive procedure of percutaneous transhepatic cannulation, the investigators felt that it will be unethical to perform sham procedure on control arm patients. Both managing doctors and patient will know which arm they are on but where not inevitable, data collection such as quality of life and results interpretation such as histology and laboratory analysis of results will be performed anonymously.</masking_description>
