  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Implement a Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) model that identifies and proactively
      manages Veterans at the highest risk for hospital admission and death while they are still in
      the ambulatory care setting.

      Goal:

        -  Reduce emergency department and urgent care utilization, hospitalization, and mortality
           in complex, high risk patients

        -  Improve Veteran and staff satisfaction

      Objectives:

        -  Maintain the patient in the home setting as much as possible

        -  Secure appropriate home environment to facilitate health and well-being

        -  Utilize comprehensive team-based care

        -  Engage appropriate Veteran Health Administration (VHA) programs to provide
           interdisciplinary, coordinated, and timely management of complex medical issues

    <measure>Primary Care Staff Job Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years (two waves)</time_frame>
    <description>We will survey Primary Care Providers (PCPs) (physicians, MDs/DOs; nurse practitioners, NPs; physician assistants, PAs) and nurses (registered nurses, RNs; licensed practical nurses, LPNs; licensed vocational nurses-LVNs) at the five healthcare systems that have a PIM team. We will use both online using RedCap and paper-and-pen versions of the survey to increase response rate. We will survey Primary Care staff at baseline and one year later. The first survey was fielded December 2014 - May 2015 and again from October 2016 - January 2017). Primary Care Staff Job Satisfaction is measured by a single item &quot;Overall, I am satisfied with my job,&quot; rated on a 5-point Likert agreement scale.</description>
