      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized study with a phase 2 portion and a phase 3
      portion. Approximately 190 patients will be enrolled in this study.

      All patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2.

      In Phase 2, patients only with advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based
      therapy will be enrolled.

      In Phase 3, patients with one of the following will be enrolled: advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer, who have failed ≥ 1 but &lt; 5 prior lines of chemotherapy; advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy; or hormone refractory (androgen
      independent) metastatic prostate cancer.

      The eligibility of all patients will be determined during a 28-day screening period.

      Phase 2:

      Approximately 40 patients with advanced and metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled. Patients are
      randomly assigned, with 10 patients enrolled in each arm, with the arm designation and
      planned intervention as follows:

      Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin

      Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (20 mg/m2) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim

      Arm 3: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (10 mg/m2) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim

      Arm 4: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (5 mg/m2) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim

      The study will be temporarily closed to enrollment when 40 patients have been enrolled and
      completed at least 1 treatment cycle in each arm in phase 2. The Sponsor will notify the
      study sites when this occurs.

      Once the study is temporarily closed to enrollment in phase 2, a PK/PD analysis will be
      performed to determine the RP3D. The PK/PD analysis will be done by an independent party at
      the time 40 patients in Phase 2 have completed at least Cycle 1. This analysis will be
      blinded to the study team.

      Phase 3:

      Phase 3 will not begin until RP3D has been determined based on the phase 2 PK/PD analysis as
      mentioned above; the RP3D will be the only plinabulin dose administered in Phase 3.

      Approximately 150 patients are planned to be enrolled in the Phase 3 with one of the
      following diagnosis: advanced or metastatic breast cancer, who have failed ≥ 1 but &lt; 5 prior
      lines of chemotherapy; advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failing platinum based therapy; or
      hormone refractory (androgen independent) metastatic prostate cancer. Each eligible patient
      will be stratified according to his or her diagnosis (advanced or metastatic breast cancer,
      NSCLC, or HRPC). Patients will be randomly assigned with equal probability (1:1 ratio) or
      75:75, with the arm designation and planned intervention as follows:

      Arm 1: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + pegfilgrastim (6 mg) + placebo matching plinabulin

      Arm 2: Docetaxel (75 mg/m2) + plinabulin (RP3D) + placebo matching pegfilgrastim

      Data from all patients receiving the RP3D plinabulin dose in Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be
      pooled for assessing the primary and secondary study endpoints, but analyzed separately.

                  control includes (a) intrauterine device (IUD) plus one barrier method; (b) on
                  stable doses of hormonal contraception for at least 3 months (e.g., oral,
                  injectable, implant, transdermal) plus one barrier method; (c) 2 barrier methods.
                  Effective barrier methods are male or female condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides
                  (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm); or (d) a vasectomized
                  partner.

               -  For male patients who are sexually active and who are partners of premenopausal
                  women: agreement to use two forms of contraception during the treatment period
                  and for at least 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             or metastatic breast cancer (adjuvant chemotherapy will count as one line of
             chemotherapy, and any hormonal or biological, non conjugate therapy [e.g.,
             trastuzumab] will not count as a line of therapy).

          5. Current use of strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors, within 3 days of the first
             administration of study drug, and 7 days after treatment with taxanes OR requires use
