  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research deals with amblyopia or lazy eye, a condition that affects about 3% of the
      population, and results in a variety of visual deficits. Recent work suggests that there is
      limited neural plasticity in the visual system of adults with amblyopia. This study is aimed
      at understanding and increasing this plasticity. In this study, the investigators aim to
      understand how the amblyopic brain learns and how this process is affected by a drug called
      donepezil, which is sometimes given as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The investigators
      hope that this study will help to identify the chemical components that help the brain to
      learn, as well as the mechanism of amblyopia. The investigators also plan to test the normal
      periphery, as control.

      The research deals with amblyopia or lazy eye, a condition that affects about 3% of the
      population, and results in a variety of visual deficits. Recent work suggests that there is
      limited neural plasticity in the visual system of adults with amblyopia. This study is aimed
      at understanding and increasing this plasticity. In this study, the investigators aim to

      learn, as well as the mechanism of amblyopia. The investigators also plan to test the normal
      periphery, as control.

      In this study, donepezil will be administered while amblyopic subjects (or normally sighted
      subjects tested in the periphery) are trained on a low-contrast single-letter recognition
      task, or an uncrowd task (recognizing a letter closely embedded within two other letters).
      Subjects will be asked to identify the target letter (the low-contrast single letter, or the
      letter embedded within other letters). Training will take place for 10 consecutive days. Pre-
      and post-tests will be conducted immediately before and after training, and will consist of
      the measurements of visual acuity, crowding extent and contrast threshold for recognizing
      single letters.

    <measure>Improvement in percent-correct performance in the respective training task</measure>
    <time_frame>During training (performance will be summarized for each block of trials (a block takes approximately 5 - 10 min to complete). In other words, there should be 100 points of measurements throughout the training period.)</time_frame>
    <description>During training, for each trial, participants' responses can be categorized as correct or incorrect. The investigators will use the percent-correct performance to quantify the performance in each block, and this percent-correct performance will be measured throughout training (i.e. for each block on each day (10 blocks per day), and for 10 training days).</description>

    <time_frame>Immediately (one day) before and after training</time_frame>
    <description>The change in visual acuity before and after (one day before and one day after) training will be compared. The change will be expressed as a ratio.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Contrast sensitivity for identifying single letters (the lowest contrast required to identify letters)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately (one day) before and after training</time_frame>
    <description>Contrast refers to the smallest difference in luminance between a letter and its background. This is a standard clinical measurement. Essentially, the lowest contrast letter is also the faintest letter that a participant can see. The change in contrast sensitivity for identifying single letters before and after (one day before and one day after) training will be compared. The change will be expressed as a ratio.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Crowding extent (the extent over which adjacent letters will affect the recognition of a letter)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately (one day) before and after training</time_frame>
    <description>Crowding extent refers to the minimum distance between adjacent letters such that the presence of adjacent letters affects the recognition of a target letter. Usually the letter separation will be adjusted until the adjacent letters no longer affects how well the middle letter can be recognized. This distance is the crowding extent. The change in the crowding extent before and after (one day before and one day after) training will be measured. The change will be expressed as a ratio.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be trained on a low-contrast single-letter task. The task is to identify a faint letter (low-contrast). Performance will be measured as correct or incorrect. Training will consist of identifying these low-contrast letters for 1000 trials per day (10 blocks of 100 trials each, subjects can take breaks in-between blocks), for a total of 10 days. During training, subjects will be administered a daily dosage of 5 mg of donepezil. Immediately before and after training (the day before and the day after), subjects' performance on (1) visual acuity; (2) contrast for identifying letters and (3) crowding extent will be measured.</description>
