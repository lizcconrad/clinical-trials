  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of at-home use of
      the Cohero mHealth (mobile health) technology, which consists of a Bluetooth Low Energy
      connected medication-use sensor (HerotrackerTM) that monitors at-home medication use, mobile
      application (BreatheSmart) that sends real-time reminders, and mobile spirometer
      (mSpirometer) that measures lung function, through a virtual observational study format in
      order to improve patient engagement with the platform for sustainable use and motivate
      subjects to self-manage their disease.
