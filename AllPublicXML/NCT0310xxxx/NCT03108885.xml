  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To prospectively collect blood and tumor tissue from esophageal cancer patients to identify
      specific esophageal cancer mutations that can be measured in the blood (cell free DNA) during
      the course of treatment as a marker of response and recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive malignancy and about a third of patients present with
      distant metastatic disease. While survival is slowly improving with better diagnostic tools
      and therapy, the overall 5-year survival remains low at 18%. Unlike other malignancies, such
      as colon cancer and prostate cancer, there is no peripheral blood marker of response or
      recurrence during treatment in esophageal cancer. However, quantifying cfDNA is a unique and
      tumor specific avenue that may allow real time response to treatment in esophageal cancer.

      To identify esophageal cancer specific mutations, tumor samples will undergo whole exome
      sequencing. From this data, the investigators will select 10-15 genes to focus their efforts.
      PCR primers will be designed to detect these tumor specific mutations in the cell-free
      component of peripheral blood samples over the course of treatment for esophageal cancer.

      The investigators will obtain baseline blood (before treatment) and then collect blood after
      neoadjuvant treatment, after surgery, and then at subsequent visits from the participants.

      Patients will have blood drawn prior to any neoadjuvant treatment or surgery. Tumor tissue
      will be collected and stored after pathologic evaluation has been completed. Blood
      collections will then be drawn at every subsequent follow up visit at Mayo Clinic for
      surveillance.
