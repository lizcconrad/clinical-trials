  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the recent introduction of novel anti-multiple myeloma (MM) agents, high risk MM
      remains with poor prognosis and a therapeutic challenge. Elotuzumab (ELO) is a humanized
      monoclonal antibody that recognizes CS1/CD139, a molecule highly expressed in MM cells. The
      ELO (10 mg/kg), lenalidomide (LEN) and dexamethasone (DEX) combination achieves high overall
      response rates (ORR) and long progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with
      relapsed/refractory disease (RR) MM and those with impaired renal function. However, its
      efficacy for MM patients with high risk characteristics is still unknown. Pomalidomide (POM)
      is a recently approved immunomodulatory agent (IMiD) that produces response rates for
      high-risk RRMM patients when used in combination with DEX and other agents, including the
      proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib (BTZ). POM has also demonstrated activity for LEN
      refractory patients. Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a potent second generation PI that has shown to be
      efficacious for IMiD and BTZ refractory patients as well as high risk patients carrying
      cytogenetic abnormalities. In this study, we propose to evaluate efficacy and safety of ELO
      in combination with POM, DEX and CFZ for high-risk RRMM patients.

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label, nonrandomized study with six patients safety
      lead-in cohort to evaluate efficacy and safety of elotuzumab in combination with
      pomalidomide, carfilzomib and dexamethasone among high risk relapsed and refractory multiple
      myeloma patients.

      This study will enroll previously treated patients that currently show evidence of
      progressive disease and have been diagnosed with high risk multiple myeloma. Thirty-nine
      patients will be enrolled in the study.

      First, six patients will be enrolled and used as a lead-in cohort for the safety evaluation
      and MTD re-determination (if necessary). The results of the safety lead-in cohort will be
      evaluated after the 6th patient has completed one full cycle of treatment. Recruitment of
      patients will be withheld during safety data analysis. Enrollment of the remaining 33
      patients will be contingent upon safety committee's decision.

      The study consists of: 1) a screening period; 2) up to eight 28-day treatment cycles; 3) a
      final assessment to occur 28 days after the end of the last treatment cycle; and 4) a
      follow-up period.

      All drugs will be administered on a 28-day cycle schedule throughout the study. Subjects
      eligible for this study will receive treatment with study drug for a maximum of eight 28-day
      treatment cycles. Subjects are to be treated for 8 cycles of therapy without demonstrating
      PD.
