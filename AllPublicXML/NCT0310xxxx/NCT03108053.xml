  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up-to-date, urology guidelines introduce safety guidewire (SGW) as an integral tool in
      ureteroscopy and recommended its routine use. However, the necessity of SGW placement in
      endourological procedures lack evidence and is being suggested as an expert opinion. Present
      study aimed to evaluate the use of SGW placement and its necessity in treatment of ureteral
      stones with semi-rigid ureteroscopy (s-URS).

      For this purpose patients with ureteral stones are being stratified according to ureteral
      stone location and prospectively randomized into two groups' according to SGW usage or not in
      s-URS. Ureteroscopy and litotripsy is being done with a semi-rigid ureteroscope of 6.4/7.8 Fr
      (Olympus) and laser. Chi-square and student t-test were used for comparing data.
