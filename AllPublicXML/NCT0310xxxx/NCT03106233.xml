  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lateral thigh perforator (LTP) flap was previously introduced as an alternative flap for
      autologous breast reconstruction when the abdomen is not suitable as a donor site. In this
      prospective study all LTP flap breast reconstructions that have been performed since
      September 2012 are analyzed. In addition, the surgical refinements that were introduced over
      the years are reported.
