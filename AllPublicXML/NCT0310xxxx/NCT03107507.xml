  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last three decades, several tools have been developed to enhance the detection and
      treatment of neonatal seizures. Regarding treatment, phenobarbital maintains is still used as
      a first-line therapy worldwide. However, newer anti-epileptic drugs (AED) s such as,
      levetiracetam, bumetanide, and topiramate are increasingly being applied to the neonatal
      population, offering the potential for seizure treatment with a significantly better
      side-effect profile.

      Levetiracetam is a very promising medication for the treatment of neonatal seizures. It has
      been in clinical use for almost a decade in adults and older children with good efficacy, an
      excellent safety profile and near ideal pharmacokinetic characteristics. It has been approved
      and used for treatment of seizures in infants starting one month of age since 2012.

      The investigators are comparing the efficacy of levetiracetam to that of phenobarbital as a
      first-line drug in control of neonatal seizures. The investigators monitor the efficacy
      through assessment of frequency of seizures before and after drug administration, amplitude
      integrated EEG changes in background activity and seizure frequency in participants, duration
      taken for participants to be seizure free and short term neurodevelopmental outcome and EEG
      at 3 months of age
