  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether subjects who were responders to cNEP during an
      overnight sleep lab titration in a previous clinical trial, Study SOM-012, will maintain a
      response throughout the night for up to two weeks in a home setting. It will also be
      determined whether two weeks of home use of cNEP is associated with any adverse events.
