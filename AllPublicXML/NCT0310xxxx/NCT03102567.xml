    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      evaluate the effect of aging on safety, tolerability and PK of multiple oral doses of
      GLPG1205 in healthy male subjects.

      The study will comprise of 2 parts, a first part to investigate the effect of aging and a
      second part to investigate the effect of a loading dose.

      In Part 1, a total of 24 healthy male subjects matched for weight will be divided into 3 age
      groups:

        -  Cohort A: 8 subjects aged 65 to 74 years, inclusive

        -  Cohort B: 8 subjects aged ≥ 75 years (1:1 weight matched with subjects of Cohort A [±5
           kg])

        -  Cohort C: 8 subjects aged between 18-50 years, inclusive (1:1 weight matched with
           subjects of Cohort A [±5 kg])

      Each cohort will be randomized 3:1 to active (6 subjects) and placebo (2 subjects) treatment
      respectively. Weight matched subjects in Cohorts B and C will be assigned to active treatment
      and placebo accordingly. Cohorts A and C will be dosed with 50 mg q.d. GLPG1205 for 14 days.

      In the open-label Part 2, an additional cohort of 8 subjects aged 65-74 years (Cohort D) will
      be included to characterize the PK profile after a loading dose followed by multiple doses of
      GLPG1205 q.d. for 13 days. A 250 mg loading dose will be administered on Day 1 followed by 50
      mg q.d. from Day 2 to Day 14.
