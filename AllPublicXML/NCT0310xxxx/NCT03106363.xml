  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol and cannabis are the two most widely used substances of abuse in the world and are
      the psychoactive substances most often found in seriously and fatally injured drivers. In a
      recent study, it was observed that individuals who reported both driving under the influence
      of alcohol (DUIA) and the influence of cannabis (DUIC) experienced collision risk that was
      nearly 4 times that of individuals who reported driving after using only one of these drugs.
      Recent research in the United States and Canada indicates that the prevalence of DUIC among
      young drivers of high school and university age, and young adults is similar to, or higher
      than, the prevalence of DUIA. This is a serious public health issue, since motor vehicle
      collisions are the leading cause of death in this age group. Given the frequency with which
      alcohol and cannabis are consumed together, it is important to understand their combined
      effects on driver behaviour. The residual or 'hangover' effects of these substances on road
      safety are also not well understood, but may be substantial. To date, the residual effects of
      combined use have not been examined. The current study will examine the acute and residual
      effects of a moderate dose of cannabis (12.5% THC) combined with an intoxicating amount of
      alcohol (BAC=0.08) on driving simulator performance of young drivers. Following an
      eligibility screening and practice session, a total of 70 participants aged 19 to 25 years
      will each complete 8 experimental sessions (2 sessions/week). During the first session of
      each week, subjects will drink alcohol or placebo alcohol and smoke an active or placebo
      cannabis cigarette. The effects of alcohol and cannabis on the performance of driving-related
      skills will be assessed using a high-fidelity driving simulator. Cognitive, psychomotor, and
      mood effects will also be assessed. Twenty-four hours after alcohol/drug exposure, subjects
      will attend the second session of the week where driving-related, cognitive, psychomotor, and
      mood effects will be assessed again.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will pursue the following primary aims:

      Aim 1: Examine the residual effects of a moderate dose of cannabis (12.5% THC) combined with
      an intoxicating amount of alcohol (BAC=0.08) on driving simulator performance of young
      drivers. Simulated driving performance, tests of cognition, verbal memory, and mood will be
      measured concurrently with levels of cannabinoids and alcohol metabolites in biological
      fluids at approximately 24 hours following acute drug exposure in male and female drivers
      aged 19 to 25.

      Aim 2: Examine the acute effects of a moderate dose of cannabis (12.5% THC) combined with an
      intoxicating amount of alcohol (BAC=0.08) on driving simulator performance of young drivers.
      Simulated driving performance, tests of cognition, verbal memory, and mood will be measured
      concurrently with BAC and levels of cannabinoids in biological fluids before and after acute
      drug exposure in male and female drivers aged 19 to 25. BAC and biological fluids will be
      measured up to 5 hours following drug exposure.

      Aim 3: Explore the effects of driving history, driving attitudes, and individual difference
      measures (e.g., demographics, drug and alcohol use, etc.) on the acute and residual effects
      of alcohol and cannabis on driving simulator performance of young drivers. Exploratory
      analyses will be undertaken to determine if the acute and residual effects of cannabis plus
      alcohol on the driving simulator task are influenced by these measures.

      Study Design and Duration

      This study will be a within-subjects, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      counterbalanced, randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of alcohol and cannabis
      combined on driver behaviour. Although a placebo condition is part of the study, this is not
      a treatment study.

      Initial contact with potential subjects will be made via telephone, and study personnel will
      conduct a telephone screen for eligibility. Upon eligibility confirmation by telephone,
      participants will be asked to attend CAMH for an eligibility assessment. Subjects will attend
      CAMH for a total of 10 study sessions (an eligibility assessment, a practice day, and 8
      testing days).

      Participants will come to the lab for four testing weeks (Sessions 1-8) comprising two
      sessions each week. Each week participants will undergo one of these alcohol and cannabis
      exposure conditions: 1) placebo alcohol and placebo cannabis; 2) intoxicating dose of alcohol
      and placebo cannabis; 3) placebo alcohol and active cannabis, and; 4) intoxicating dose of
      alcohol and active cannabis. The order of these conditions will be randomly assigned. Each
      week the first session will be a session where participants will complete an alcohol
      manipulation followed by a cannabis manipulation (Sessions 1, 3, 5 and 7). Each week a second
      session will be completed approximately 24 hours after the alcohol and cannabis exposure
      session to measure residual effects (Sessions 2, 4, 6 and 8). The alcohol and cannabis
      exposure sessions will be separated by 7-15 days.

      Participants will be asked not to use cannabis for 72 hours and alcohol for 48 hours prior to
      attending CAMH.

      In certain instances, the Qualified Investigator may ask a participant to return for
      re-screening, e.g. repeat of urine test or other assessments performed for eligibility
      assessment. Also, in case of unforeseen delays in scheduling study participation, the
      Qualified Investigator will determine if there is a need to ask a participant to repeat some
      assessments, e.g., physical examination.
