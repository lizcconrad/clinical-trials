  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treat to target strategy coupled
      with early endoscopic assessment versus a clinically driven (routine care) approach in
      achieving endoscopic response.

    <textblock>
      Study investigates benefit of treat to target maintenance treatment strategy versus routine
      care to test hypothesis that 'treat to target' ustekinumab (UST) maintenance treatment
      strategy coupled with early endoscopic assessment will result in higher endoscopic response
      rate after 48 weeks of treatment, compared to pragmatic maintenance treatment strategy. It
      consists of screening (5 weeks); treatment period (Week 0 to 48); extension period (Weeks 48
      to 104) and safety follow up visit (16 weeks after last dose). Participants will be given an
      option to enter ultrasound sub-study to assess intestinal ultrasound (IUS) parameters
      indicating transmural changes in response to treatment with UST in participants with Crohn's
      disease. Study treatment will be unaffected by participation in sub-study which is optional
      for participants of main study.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopic Response is defined as reduction from baseline in simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD) of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 percent (%). The SES-CD score is based on the evaluation of 4 endoscopic components (presence/size of ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface covered by ulcers, proportion of mucosal surface affected by any other lesions, and presence/type of narrowing/strictures) across 5 ileocolonic segments. Each endoscopic component is scored from 0 to 3 for each segment, and a total score is derived from the sum of all the component scores (range, 0 to 60).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a 16 - Point Change From Baseline for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>IBDQ is a 32-item self-report questionnaire for participants with IBD to evaluate the patient-reported outcome(s) (PROs) across 4 dimensions: bowel symptoms (loose stools, abdominal pain), systemic symptoms (fatigue, altered sleep pattern), social function (work attendance, need to cancel social events), and emotional function (anger, depression, irritability).

    <description>Work productivity was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). The WPAI is a validated, self-administered questionnaire that assesses work and activity impairment during the past 7 days. The WPAI produces 4 types of scores: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on the job effectiveness), work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activity impairment. The WPAI outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages, with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, that is, worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>FACIT-F scale is a 13 item fatigue scale with a 7 day recall period. It measures the level of fatigue during the usual daily activities. The level of fatigue is measured on a 4 point Likert scale (0=very much fatigued to 4=not at all fatigued). Total FACIT-F score is the sum of 13 items, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 52 (very much). Higher scores represent better outcomes.</description>

    <description>At Week (Wk) 0, all eligible participants will initiate intravenous (IV) induction treatment with ustekinumab (UST) on a weight-tiered basis at a dose of approximately 6 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg). At Week 8, all participants will receive a 90 milligram (mg) subcutaneous (SC) injection of ustekinumab. At Week 16, participants who do not achieve a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) improvement of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 70 points versus Week 0 (CDAI 70) will leave the study. Remaining participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either one of two arms for open label maintenance treatment up to Week 48: the treat to target arm or the routine care arm. From Week 48, participants will continue ustekinumab treatment in the study extension period, up to Week 104. Dosing frequency will be adjusted in the extension period for the participants failing to meet the treatment target.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the routine care arm, assessment visits will be scheduled according to the timing of maintenance treatment injections up to Week 48, which will be in compliance with the EU SmPC for ustekinumab for the treatment of Crohn's disease, in which dosing every 12 weeks is recommended. At Week 16, (that is, 8 weeks after the first SC dose) participants continuing in the study will have demonstrated a CDAI-70 response. Nonetheless, participants who have not shown adequate response based on the investigator's judgment may receive a second SC dose at Week 16. During the routine care maintenance treatment period, in case of clinical worsening reported by the participant, consistent with disease flare in the investigator's judgment, clinical assessments of disease flare will be performed at the investigator's discretion.</description>

    <description>UST maintenance treatment assignment will be based on centrally-read colonoscopy (at Wk16). Participants with &lt;25% improvement in SES-CD score at Wk16 will be assigned to Q8 (8-weekly) treatment and will receive UST 90mg SC at Wk16. In contrast, participants with &gt;=25% improvement in SES-CD score at Wk16 will be assigned to Q12 treatment and will receive next UST dose (90 mg SC) at Wk20. At assessment visits (from Wk24 for participants assigned to the Q8 regimen or from Wk20 for the Q12 group) UST maintenance treatment (up to Wk 48) will be directed by T2T assessments. Participants meeting target will continue with same UST dosing frequency. The dosing frequency will be optimized for all participants failing to meet the target at assessment visit. Those previously on Q12 regimens will be adjusted to Q8 dosing; those previously on Q8 regimens will be adjusted to Q4 dosing. Participants subsequently failing to meet the target will not be able to adjust further and will leave the study.</description>

    <description>At Week 48, dose de-escalation will be implemented for participants with both endoscopic remission (SES-CD score &lt;=2) and corticosteroid-free clinical remission of at least 16 weeks duration. Participants receiving 12 weekly dosing frequency (Q12) ustekinumab will maintain this dosing frequency. Participants with either clinical remission or endoscopic remission, but not both, at Week 48 will continue with same dosing frequency or de-escalate provided maintenance of corticosteroid-free clinical remission and biomarker remission at 2 consecutive visits. Participants with neither corticosteroid-free clinical remission nor endoscopic remission will escalate dose or leave study if already on 4 weekly dosing frequency (Q4) dose. If neither clinical remission nor biomarker remission is evident at the next visit, participant will leave study. Later in the extension period, only those who achieve corticosteroid-free clinical remission and biomarker remission will undergo dose de-escalation.</description>
