  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We investigated the prevalence of animal allergy and sensitization to animal allergen among
      participants in international symposium of Korean association for laboratory science
      (laboratory animal researchers) and companion animal exhibition (pet owner and pet-related
      industry workers).

      We enrolled participants in international symposium of Korean association for laboratory
      science (laboratory animal researchers) and companion animal exhibition (pet owner and
      pet-related industry workers) after informed consents. They were asked to response to
      questionnaires regarding their age, gender, comorbid allergic disease, family history of
      allergy, contact animal, time and amount of exposure, allergic symptoms and their severity
      and duration after exposure to animals. They underwent skin prick test with animal allergens
      and other inhalant allergens.
