      This is a study protocol for the use of a novel radiopaque embolic agent in the treatment of
      lower urinary tract Symptoms (LUTS) with prostatic artery embolisation (PAE). This study will
      allow us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this embolic in PAE along with giving us a
      better understanding of embolic distribution.

      This is a study protocol for the use of a novel radiopaque embolic agent in the treatment of
      lower urinary tract Symptoms (LUTS) with prostatic artery embolisation (PAE). This study will
      allow us to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this embolic in PAE along with giving us a
      better understanding of embolic distribution. It would also give us answers to:

        -  How does embolic efficacy compare to current available embolic agents?

        -  Does enhancement on rotational CT correlate with embolic distribution?

        -  How does embolic distribution compare with tissue infarction?

        -  Does the density of embolic packing correlate with degree of infarction and volume loss?

        -  How predictable is superselective target embolisation?

        -  Does embolic distribution vary with anatomy and gland size?

        -  Does embolic distribution tally with glandular enhancement/ transitional zone
           vascularity?

        -  If visible, what is the effect and significance of non target embolisation? This is a
           cohort study aiming to recruit 22 patients to power a non-inferiority assessment
           comparing the novel embolic agent against current available embolics.

      Data will be added to our on going local registry of patients who have undergone this
      procedure . This will provide information about how safe and effective it is for patients and
      how it compares to the other established embolic agents such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and
      other spherical agents such as Embospheres and Embozenes.
