  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is used in premature infants receiving mechanical
      ventilation to maintain lungs open and facilitate gas exchange. When ventilation/perfusion
      mismatch is present, areas of the lung that are open for gas exchange do not match up with
      areas of the lung that are receiving blood for gas exchange. This study measures the
      feasibility of enrolling and completing study maneuvers in premature infants for a
      prospective study measuring the responsiveness of V/Q mismatch to changes in the amount (or
      level) of PEEP.
