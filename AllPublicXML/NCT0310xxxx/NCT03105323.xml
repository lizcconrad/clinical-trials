      This study will be conducted at the In vitro fertilization Unit at Ain Shams University
      Maternity Hospital.

      Women will be recruited from the In vitro fertilization Unit who will fulfill the inclusion
      criteria. They will be counseled to be included into the study The study will assess Role of
      Ratio of Progesterone to Number of Follicles as a Prognostic Tool for Intracytoplasmic Sperm
      Injection outcome.

      Blood samples were collected on the day of final oocyte maturation, and serum Progesterone
      levels were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantitative determination of
      the hormone .

      The P/F ratio was calculated according to the equation (P(ng/mL)/number of follicles) and was
      defined by the measurements obtained on the day of final oocyte maturation.

      All ultrasounds were performed at our In vitro fertilization center, and we included the
      number of follicles ≥14mm on the day of final oocyte maturation in the ratio calculation
      Oocytes were retrieved 36 hours after injection and were subsequently fertilized by In vitro
      fertilization or Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection. On day 2 - 5, all embryos were evaluated
      for cell number and morphology.

      Each embryo transferred was evaluated for blastomere size and fragmentation. Embryos were
      graded as follows. Those with equal blastomere size and no fragmentation were considered
      Grade 1; those with blastomeres of equal size with slight fragmentation (&lt;20 %) were Grade
      2;those with blastomeres of unequal size but no fragmentation were Grade 3; those with
      blastomeres of equal or unequal size and moderate fragmentation (20 %-50 %) were Grade 4; and
      those with unrecognizable blastomeres and severe fragmentation (&gt;50 %) were Grade 5.

      The embryos were transferred on postretrieval day (2 - 5). Pregnancy was defined by Human
      chorionic gonadotropin titers within 11 days following Embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy
      was defined by the observation of intrauterine embryo heart motion by 7 weeks gestation.

    <description>All patients were pretreated with Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (decapeptyl®) 0.05 mg/day from 10 days prior to the start of menstruation. The patients'ovaries were stimulated with a recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH, subcutaneous) from day 2 of the menstrual cycle. human chorionic gonadotropin was administered when at least two follicles vary 18-22mm were observed on ultrasonography.Blood samples were collected on the day of final Human chorionic gonadotropin maturation, and serum P levels were measured.Pregnancy was defined by titers within 11 days following Embryo transfer,Clinical pregnancy was defined by the observation of intrauterine embryo heart motion by 7 weeks gestation.</description>
