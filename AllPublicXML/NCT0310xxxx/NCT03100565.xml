  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the third most common genital cancer worldwide. The diagnosis of cervical
      cancer is performed with the cervical biopsy which is guided by the colposcopy. The
      colposcopy guided cervical biopsy creates pain and several methods have been reported to
      overcome the pain related with this procedure. Local anesthetic agent injection into the
      cervix has been studied and found to be effective and also, forced coughing was compared with
      local anesthetic injection and it is found to be more effective. In fact local injections can
      create the pain by itself.However no study compared the effect of forced coughing to local
      anesthetic spray. The study aims to evaluate the comparison of forced coughing with local
      anesthetic spray with respect to perceived pain during colposcopy guided biopsy.
