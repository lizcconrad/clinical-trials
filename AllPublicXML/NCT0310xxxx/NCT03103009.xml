      Somatostatin analogues are a last resort for medical intervention in hyperinsulinemic
      hypoglycemia (HH). The hypoglycemia is very debilitating and can be even life threatening.
      There is limited experience with pasireotide in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (only one
      publication); there is more experience with octreotide, both in adults and children
      successful interventions with octreotide in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have been
      published. Pasireotide via its different somatostatin receptor binding profile has clear
      effects on insulin, glucagon and incretin secretion and can ultimately lead to hyperglycemia.
      This mode of action (especially the effects on insulin and incretin secretion) could be very
      useful in the setting of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia as a complication of gastric bypass surgery has been reported
      to occur between 6 months to 8-10 years after gastric bypass surgery. Although reported as a
      rare complication from surgery, the incidence is likely higher due to the condition being
      missed in many patients or being misdiagnosed as dumping syndrome. Unlike dumping syndrome
      which often presents early in the post-operative course and improves with dietary
      modification, patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia have severe postprandial
      hypoglycemia and sometimes fasting hypoglycemia with symptoms worsening over time despite
      dietary modification. Calcium stimulation testing often localizes the area of the pancreas
      where hyperinsulinemia is occurring due to islet cell dysfunction. The pathophysiology of
      islet cell hypertrophy with Nesidioblastosis is poorly understood. One theory is an increase
      in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration may be responsible for islet cell expansion
      and subsequent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

      Unfortunately, hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia is incapacitating where patients are restricted
      from driving, are unable to work, and must always have someone present with glucagon due to
      the acute severe onset of neuroglycopenia. Surgery to resect the area of the pancreas with
      Nesidioblastosis has a low success rate of about 60% with many patients developing type 1
      diabetes as a result of pancreatic resection. Medical treatment options include calcium
      channel blockers, Diazoxide, and Octreotide yet patients often fail these treatments as well.
      Pasireotide would likely be a better option than the current medical therapy available. With
      Pasireotide, the inhibition of insulin release through inhibiting the somatostatin receptors
      as well as possible GLP-1 inhibition causing hyperglycemia should reduce hypoglycemic
      episodes in these patients.

               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception

                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on
                  the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that

                       other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure
                       rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone
                       contraception.

                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                       suppository

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

         18. If the patient is a sexually active male he is excluded unless he agrees to use a
             condom during intercourse while taking pasireotide and for 3 months after stopping
             pasireotide medication . They should not father a child in this period. A condom is
             required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug
             via seminal fluid
