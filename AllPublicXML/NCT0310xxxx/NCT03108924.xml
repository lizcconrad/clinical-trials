  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of gefapixant (MK-7264) administered
      to participants with varying degrees of renal insufficiency (RI) compared to healthy matched
      controls; and to investigate the extent of MK-7264 removal by hemodialysis in participants
      with end stage renal disease (ESRD), following administration of a single 50 mg dose of
      gefapixant.

             dosing.

          -  Has donated blood or had significant blood loss within 56 days prior to dosing.

          -  Has donated plasma within 7 days prior to dosing.

          -  Has taken gefapixant at any time prior to dosing on the current study.

          -  Has participated in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to dosing based on the
             latest blood collection or dosing.
