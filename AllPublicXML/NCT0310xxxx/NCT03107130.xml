    <textblock>
      This retrospective descriptive study is to determine what proportion of Cincinnati
      Urogynecology Associates patients who underwent surgical management for stress urinary
      incontinence (SUI) would qualify for a basic office exam (BOE) alone, using the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria of the Value of Urodynamic Evaluation (VALUE) trial, and thus could have
      potentially had Urodynamic studies (UDS) omitted from their preoperative workup.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic studies (UDS) are an assessment tool used to evaluate physiologic variables during
      bladder filling, bladder storage, and bladder emptying. They are commonly performed as part
      of the routine preoperative evaluation of women with symptoms of SUI. However, UDS are
      costly, with payments allowed by Medicare quoted at greater than $500, time consuming,
      uncomfortable, and have been shown to increase the risk of urinary tract infection. But most
      concerning is the fact that UDS have not been shown to improve surgical outcomes.

      In 2012, the Value of Urodynamic Evaluation (VALUE) trial evaluated 630 women who underwent a
      basic office exam (BOE) or BOE plus UDS, and concluded that for women with uncomplicated,
      demonstrable SUI a BOE alone was not inferior to evaluation with UDS for outcomes at 1 year.
      This recent publication has resulted in urogynecology practices across the country evaluating
      their own standard of care when it comes to preoperative evaluation of SUI.

      Cincinnati Urogynecology Associates, TriHealth Inc. standard practice is to perform UDS on
      all patients undergoing surgery for SUI. The providers of Cincinnati Urogynecology
      Associates, TriHealth Inc. would be remiss if the providers did not follow this trend and
      evaluate their own personal practice of preoperative UDS in patients presenting with SUI.
