  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired metabolism and the gene apolipoprotein E (ApoE) are independent risk factors for
      cognitive impairment and dementia. In humans, there are three major versions of apoE (E): E2,
      E3, and E4. Some studies suggest that the different versions of apoE have varying effects on
      whole body and brain metabolism. The goal of this project is to better understand the
      relationship between apoE and metabolism. This will help investigators identify new targets
      for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline and dementia.

    <textblock>
      The investigator hopes determine whether a participant's version of ApoE affects their
      metabolic rate at rest and during a cognitive challenge. To determine this, the investigator
      will measure basal (resting) metabolic rates using a technique called indirect calorimetry
      (IC). This is accomplished by wearing a loose-fitting face mask that measures oxygen intake
      and carbon dioxide output.

      To more accurately measure the amount of carbohydrates, fats and proteins that the body is
      metabolizing, participants will be asked to provide two urine samples (one at the beginning,
      and one at the end, of the study).

      To determine what version of ApoE the participant inherited, the investigator will conduct a
      genetic test on DNA isolated from the participant's blood.
