    <textblock>
      This is a combined Single and Multiple Ascending Oral Dose Study. Part 1 is a Single
      Ascending Dose (SAD) and Part 2 is Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD).

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      ascending oral doses of ASP7713 in healthy non-Japanese (Part 1) and Japanese (Part 2) adult
      participants and non-Japanese elderly participants (Part 2).

      This study will also evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple ascending oral
      doses of ASP7713 in non-Japanese (Part1) and Japanese (Part 2) adult participants and
      non-Japanese elderly participants (Part 2) as well as the effect of a single and multiple
      oral dose of ASP7713 on the QT interval using Fridericia's Correction (QTcF).

      In addition, this study will evaluate a potential racial difference in safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of multiple oral doses of ASP7713 in healthy non-Japanese and Japanese
      adult participants (Part 2).

      There will be a residential period for Parts 1 and 2. Part 1: Eligible participants will be
      residential for a single period of 5 days and 4 nights. Participants will be discharged on
      day 4 on the condition that all required assessments have been performed and that there are
      no medical reason for a longer stay in the clinical unit.

      Part 2: Eligible participants will be residential for a single period of 18 days and 17
      nights. Participants will be discharged on day 17 on the condition that there are no medical
      reason for a longer stay in the clinical unit.
