  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on survivorship care for head and neck cancer patients cared for within
      Duke Cancer Center clinics. Standardized survivorship care plans (sSCP) are being implemented
      based on the American Society for Clinical Oncology's criteria. These documents provide a
      summary of treatment received, and list side effects and follow-up information after cancer
      treatment. Taking advantage of this transition, the investigator will study three groups of
      patients: (a) early survivors treated before the sSCP was implemented, (b) early survivors
      treated after the sSCP was implemented, and (c) current patients who will receive an
      individualized enhanced SCP (eSCP), which will include additional information tailored to
      patient preferences. The investigators hypothesize that patients receiving enhanced
      survivorship care plans will increase their knowledge regarding their health care plan and
      wellness trajectory; increase their ability to identify the symptoms they most likely can
      expect as a result of their cancer treatment; and be more likely to engage in conversations
      with their PCP about healthy behaviors and screening guidelines.
