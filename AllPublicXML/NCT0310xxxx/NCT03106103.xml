    <textblock>
      Urodynamic Study (UDS) represents a series of agreed-upon clinical tests and is used to
      evaluate the functional status of the lower urinary tract, providing a pathophysiological
      basis for urinary symptoms. Urodynamic Study involves catheterization of the lower urinary
      tract. The prevalence of urinary tract infection after UDS ranges from 1,5% to 30 %.

      Studies of prophylactic antibiotics for UDSs have offered data of contradictory and limited
      predictive values. Some investigators concluded that prophylactic antibiotics were valuable
      and others have not.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis before UDS
      in women, using different antibiotic regimens.

      This study is randomized, double blind study was carried out in the Department of Gynecology
      at Sao Paulo Federal University from January 2009 to December 2012.

      The patients were randomized in four groups: Group A received 500mg of levofloxacin, group B
      received placebo, group C received 80mg trimethoprim and 400mg sulfamethoxazole (SMZ-TMP) and
      group D received 100mg of nitrofurantoin. The tablets were administered 30 minutes before de
      UDS.

      All patients were instructed to collect midstream urine sample to the microbiology laboratory
      14 days after the UDS. Significant bacteriuria was considered when &gt;1.000.000 organisms/mL of
      a single species was isolated.

      All data were entered into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 16.0 for
      statistical analysis and graphic representation. Likelihood -ratio test and Fisher's exact
      test were used to compare the prevalence of significant bacteriuria after UDS in the
      different groups and Student's t-test and ANOVA test were used to compare continuous
      variables. To compare the groups regarding the BMI variable and parity, the model analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) was used, or if necessary, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test and to
      compare the groups in relation to menopause variable, we used the Chi-square test. A
      significance level of 0.05 was established for statistical analysis.
