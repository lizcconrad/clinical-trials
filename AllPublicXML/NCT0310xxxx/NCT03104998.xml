      To study the effect of coenzyme Q10 on semen parameters in men with idiopathic infertility
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decreased serum CoQ10 concentrations as well as a decrease in the CoQ10H2 to-ubiquinone ratio
      have been demonstrated in diseases associated with OS. A strong correlation among sperm
      count, motility and ubiquinol-10 levels in seminal fluid has also been reported.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether the effects of the exogenous
      administration of ubiquinol in the improvement of semen parameters in Pakistani men
      population.

      Patients who full filled the inclusion criteria and gave informed written consent will be
      included in the trial. Patient will start to take medication and will take it for 26 weeks.

      All men undergo a thorough physical examination, a detail history, serum biochemical and
      hematological laboratory tests and measurement of serum sex and thyroid hormone levels. A
      questionnaire will be used to collect information on demographic characteristics. Two semen
      samples 1 and 2 month apart will be obtained after 3 to 5 days of sexual abstinence and
      process within 1 hour of ejaculation. The mean of the two will be used for statistical
      analysis. Semen analyses will be performed using WHO recommended methods.

      3 ml of blood will be withdrawn from the patient for the serum hormones analysis and total
      amount of semen will required for analysis of semen parameters.

      Sponsor will bear the test cost of patient during the study treatment period.

    <description>200 mg of CoQ10 or placebo daily by mouth from day 1 till 26 weeks. CoQ10 treatment is safe, even at the highest doses cited in the literature. Most clinical trials have not reported significant adverse effects that necessitated stopping therapy. However, gastrointestinal effects such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia have occurred. Allergic rash and headache have also been reported</description>
