  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to investigate
      the immediate effects of spinal manipulation on hip and knee muscle strength and pain-free
      deep squat range of motion in order to answer several conceptual and practical research
      questions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blind, randomized control trial clinical will use a multigroup
      pretest-posttest control design with 1 treatment arm and 1 control arm. Interpreted within
      the biopsychosocial model and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
      Health (ICF) framework, this research will measure the outcomes between patellofemoral pain
      syndrome (PFPS), the health condition, and contextual factors, particularly personal factors.
      It will address personal factors such as gender and age but will not address environmental
      factors. This research includes tests and measures of two of the three levels of human
      functioning, or domains, impairments to body functions and structures and activity
      limitations. Muscle strength testing is an impairment-level measure and pain-free deep squat
      range of morion (ROM) is an activity limitation-level measure.

    <description>• The subject will be placed in sidelying on a treatment table. Facing the subject, the therapist will position the subject's superior thigh in flexion and rotate the subject's upper trunk to the opposite side. The therapist will place his cephalad forearm along the subject's superior lateral trunk and the caudal forearm along the subject's iliac crest and lateral hip. Lastly, the therapist will roll the subject towards himself or herself.</description>

    <description>The subject will be placed in sidelying on a treatment table. Facing the subject, the therapist will position both hips and knees in approximately 45° of flexion. The therapist will place his or her cephalad forearm along the subject's superior lateral trunk and the caudal forearm along the subject's iliac crest and lateral hip. Lastly, the therapist will roll the subject towards himself or herself.</description>
