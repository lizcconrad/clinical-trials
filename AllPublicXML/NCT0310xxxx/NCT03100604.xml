  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to examine the effect of sevoflurane and desflurane, agents used in
      patients who do not have any ear pathology and undergo surgery under general anesthesia, on
      the MEP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies reported that inhalation agents are more likely to have impacts on the middle ear
      pressure compared to intravenous anesthetic agents. Despite numerous studies comparing the
      effects of inhalation agents on the middle ear pressure, this is the first clinical trial in
      which end tidal carbon dioxide and effects of sevoflurane and desflurane, along with other
      anesthetic analgesic agents used, on the middle ear pressure were compared. Our purpose in
      this study was to investigate the effect of sevoflurane and desflurane, inhalation agents
      used in patients who do not have any ear pathology and undergo non-ear surgery under general
      anesthesia, on the middle ear pressure.

    <description>Tympanometric measurements were performed and recorded for each ear preoperatively, at intraoperative 5th, 10th and 15th minutes and postoperative 10th and 30th minutes. Normal middle ear pressure ranges between -200 and +200 decapascals (daPa).
