  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study primarily assesses the safety of MV-CHIK a new Chikungunya vaccine in a
      previously epidemic area in healthy volunteers. Secondarily, immune response and viremia will
      be assessed.

      MV-CHIK will be compared to the commercially available MMR vaccine. 80% of the subjects will
      receive MV-CHIK; 20% will receive MMR vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical study to be conducted under this IND will assess the safety of MV-CHIK in a
      previously epidemic area (Puerto Rico).

      A total of 100 healthy volunteers, 50 of whom are seropositive to Chikungunya at baseline and
      50 of whom are seronegative, will be randomized in a 4:1 ratio to receive either MV-CHIK or
      the commercially available MMR vaccine in a double blinded fashion. Memory aids, to be
      completed by the volunteer at home, and the investigator at scheduled follow-up visits, will
      solicit symptoms of injection site reactions, fever, headache, malaise, joint and muscle
      pain. Acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein and ferritin) will be checked routinely
      throughout the study and at the discretion of the investigator in order to help determine if
      symptoms, particularly those referred to the joints, have an immunological basis.

      This study will also evaluate the immune response in Chikungunya-exposed versus unexposed
      individuals by comparing neutralizing antibody titers at specific time points. Measles
      viremia will also be measured and compared between MV-CHIK and MMR recipients, and at three
      days after the second versus after the first dose. The relationship between measles viremia
      and the immune response to MV-CHIK will be explored.
