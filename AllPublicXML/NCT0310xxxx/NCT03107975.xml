  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is one of the most common congenital (existing at or before birth) disorders
      of childhood.Spastic cerebral palsy causes stiffness and movement difficulties.There is no
      cure for the disease now.

      This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human amniotic epithelial cell
      (hAEC) transplant in the management of children with spastic cerebral palsy. hAEC will be
      intrathecal transplanted. Functional status is determined by Gross Motor Function Measure-66
      and Fine Motor Function Measure. Spasticity is evaluated by using modified Ashworth
      scale(MAS).
