  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project tests the principle hypothesis that stable glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      analogues have specific GLP1R-dependent beneficial effects on vascular endothelial function,
      fibrinolysis and inflammation in obesity that exceed the benefits of weight loss, and that
      genetic or other individual factors that modulate GLP1R sensitivity can modify the effect of
      these analogues on cardiovascular risk.

To assure compliance with the prescribed caloric goal, subjects will meet with the study dietitian every other week for problem solving and review of diet intake logs.</description>
