  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with active moderate-to-severe thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), the
      Intravenous Glucocorticoids (GCs) is the recommended therapy. However, the efficacy of GCs is
      not satisfied. Investigators established a novel classification of TAO for the first time to
      assess more precisely for better personal treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TAO is one of most common extra thyroid manifestation of dysfunctional thyroid disease. Since
      the morbidity of TAO has been increasing rapidly, Investigators' team is intended to verify
      the feasibility of the new type of classification system established by the related
      parameters of orbital MRI scan. Based on classification, investigators compare the efficacy
      of two GCs therapy. According to MRI,investigators measure the optimal T2 signal intensity
      ratio (SIR) for the treatment of TAO, which may help to find a better treatment time for
      therapy.
