  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blinded, randomized, crossover study in healthy females with placebo and single dose
      imipramine 50 mg.

      Primary objective: Does imipramine increase the tone of the external urethral sphincter?
      Urethral Opening Pressure (UOP) is measured with Urethral Pressure Reflectometry (UPR). UOP
      increases correlate with effect in treating stress urinary incontinence. Can imipramine treat
      stress urinary incontinence? Secondary objective: Does imipramine increase the tone of the
      anal sphincter? The opening pressure is measured with Anal Acoustic Reflectometry (AAR). The
      investigators also wish to establish the within-subject standard deviation for AAR to enable
      power calculations in future studies.
