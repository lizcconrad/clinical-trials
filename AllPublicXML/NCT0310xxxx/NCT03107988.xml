  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lorlatinib is a novel inhibitor across ALK variants, including those resistant to crizotinib.
      In this first pediatric phase 1 trial of lorlatinib, the drug will be utilized as a single
      agent and in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory
      neuroblastoma. The dose escalation phase of this study (Cohort A1) uses a traditional Phase I
      3+3 design. Once a recommended phase 2 pediatric dose is identified, an expansion cohort of 6
      patients (Cohort B1), within which ALKi naïve patients will be prioritized, will be
      initiated. Parallel cohorts will be initiated in adults or patients with large BSA (Cohort
      A2) and in combination with chemotherapy upon establishing RP2D (Cohort B2).

      Lorlatinib is a novel inhibitor across ALK variants, including those resistant to crizotinib.
      An adult phase 1 study established an RP2D of 100mg QD for lorlatinib. In this first
      pediatric phase 1 trial of lorlatinib, the drug will be utilized as a single agent and in
      combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma. The dose
      escalation phase of this study (Cohort A1) uses a traditional Phase I 3+3 design. Once a
      recommended phase 2 pediatric dose is identified, an expansion cohort of 6 patients (Cohort
      B1), within which ALKi naïve patients will be prioritized, will be initiated. Parallel
      cohorts will be initiated in adults or patients with large BSA (Cohort A2) and in combination
      with chemotherapy upon establishing RP2D (Cohort B2).

      Lorlatinib will be administered orally via tablets or via oral dispersion if patient is
      unable to swallow tablets whole

      All patients will participate in mandatory pharmacokinetic testing.
