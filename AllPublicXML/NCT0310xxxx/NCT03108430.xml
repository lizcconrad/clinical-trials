  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation pneumonia (PI) is common in clinical practice but is rarely studied. For example,
      there are no data on the incidence of pneumonia after inhalation and risk factors or
      protective factors to develop one since it is known that anyone who inhaled does not
      necessarily develop an IP. There is no data on the benefit of treating inhalation by
      antibiotic therapy pre-emptively although this practice is common. In this context, this
      observational study wishes to take stock of the situation on the subject in order to
      determine what actions to implement to prevent IP.
