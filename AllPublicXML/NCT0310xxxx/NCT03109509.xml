  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, increasing activity was synonymous with exercise; however, it is now thought
      that even much more modest activity levels (e.g., simply walking) or merely decreasing the
      proportion of sedentary time may be sufficient to decrease future morbidity and mortality.
      Some interventions designed to increase activity have shown promise; others have been less
      successful. But even promising interventions are often difficult to generalize to real-life
      clinical settings. One barrier to monitoring the effectiveness of interventions has been the
      lack of availability of accurate, reliable and inexpensive personal activity monitoring
      equipment. The availability of inexpensive pedometers, and, more recently, low cost triaxial
      accelerometers, has now made it much easier to monitor activity levels and provide feedback
      to users. These devices are ideal for capturing activity associated with walking, the most
      popular and acceptable form of exercise, but only if patients actually wear them. Thus, there
      is a need to develop pragmatic approaches that encourage patients to not only wear these
      monitoring devices, but also motivate them to increase their activity.

      In recent years, games have been used in a variety of settings to motivate and change
      behavior. Games not only provide performance feedback to patients, but also provide
      incentives for achieving goals in a context that is fun, intrinsically rewarding, and easy to
      understand. Successful games effectively exploit motivating social factors (e.g.,
      competition, peer support, and entertainment) to maintain interest and engage participants.
      Steps are counted using a commercially available triaxial accelerometer (e.g., a FitBit).
      Pokemon Go is an augmented reality game that encourages players to go outside to search for
      Pokemon creatures.

    <description>Participants randomized to the FB+P group received the same Fitbit Zip activity monitor and text message reminders as the FB group. This group was also shown how to download the Pokémon Go application to their smartphone and were provided brief instructions on how to play the game. Participants were instructed to simply explore the game and play it at their leisure. Participants were not provided any specific goals related to game play or physical activity in general.</description>
