  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound to provide
      real-time assessment of blood flow to the femoral head in infants undergoing surgical
      reduction for developmental dysplasia of the hip.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For children presenting with late-diagnosed developmental dysplasia of the hip, a closed or
      open hip reduction followed by hip spica casting may be indicated if conservative treatment
      fails. Although closed or open reduction and casting is largely successful for relocating a
      hip, iatrogenic avascular necrosis remains a major source of morbidity as a result of the
      surgical procedure.

      Although recent evidence has demonstrated that postoperative gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
      resonance (MR) studies may be useful in assessing perfusion of the hip after surgery, these
      studies are not performed until after the cast is placed and they do not elucidate the
      specific intraoperative steps that increase risk for osteonecrosis. Contrast-enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) may be a reliable and effective alternative.
