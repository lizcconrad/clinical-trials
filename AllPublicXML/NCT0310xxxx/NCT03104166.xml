  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      50 patients will be randomized and treated with MCO or highflux dialysis for six months (24
      weeks) after a run-in phase of 4 weeks Highflux treatment.

      Serum samples will be drawn at baseline, after 4, 8 and 24 weeks.

      Later, calcifiying vascular smooth muscle cells will be incubated with these serum samples
      and calcification will be assessed with Alkaline phosphatase and Alizarin staining.

      Primary endpoint:

      In vitro Calcification of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (Alkaline Phosphatase/ WST8)
      after six months

      Calcifiying vascular smooth muscle cells will be incubated with serum samples obtained after
      six months of MCO/HF dialysis and calcification will be assessed with Alkaline phosphatase
      and WST8.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Aortic Pulse wave velocity after 6 months Calcification propensity after 6 months Physical
      activity level after 6 months

      Cell culture: Incubation of VSMC with serum samples obtained after 6 months

        -  Alizarin staining/WST-8

        -  Measurement of calcification inhibitors Osteopontin and Matrix Gla Protein in
           Supernatants

        -  Apoptosis

      The treatment regimen of the patients will not be altered, hence blood flow, dialysate flow
      as well as dialysis time will remain constant.
