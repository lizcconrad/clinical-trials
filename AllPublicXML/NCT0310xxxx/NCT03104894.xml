  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate whether combined treatment of MGD massage and artificial tears
      will improve signs and symptoms of dry eye compared to artificial tears alone.

      The meibomian glands secrete meibum which is the oily component of the tear film layer. The
      meibum plays a pivotal role in preventing tear evaporation and smoothening the tears film .

      Meibomian gland dysfunction is a common condition that affects 39%-50% of the population. It
      is part of inflammatory disease of the eyelids called blepharitis. Associated syndromes are
      rosacea and dry eye syndrome .

      Sign and symptoms are: irritation, hyperemia, burning sensation, photophobia, epiphora and
      blur.

      Spectrometry analysis shows change it the fatty acids conformation such as increase in levels
      of branched-chain fatty acids and decrease in saturated fatty acids .

      Subsequently the clotted meibum results in glands blockage that can be graded in 0-4 grade
      scale: grade 2- meibum secretion thick and oily, grade 3- meibum secretion
      granular-toothpaste like.

      Although MGD is not often accompanied with inflammatory signs it is a common cause for
      evaporative dry eye.

      In order to investigate the relation between meibomian gland massage outcomes and signs and
      symptoms of dry eye, randomized prospective study will be conducted. Patients, who arrive to
      Barzilai Medical Center out patients' clinic, are diagnosed with MGD 2-3 and signed informed
      consent form shall be included in the trial, then randomized to study group or control group.

      The study group will receive meibomian glands massage and artificial drops PRN, whereas the
      control group will receive sham massage and artificial drops. Each visit at the clinic will
      include dry examinations and questionnaire.

      Follow up examination are due after one week, monthly visits up to 4 months, then after half
      year, 8 months and one year.

      Statistical methods: in order to evaluate to treatment effect T-Test analysis will be
      calculated, significant result is when P&lt;0.05.

      Data will be recorded into to electronic sheets. Subjects' confidentiality will be assured by
      masking any identifying details and a random number will be assigned prior results analysis
      stage
