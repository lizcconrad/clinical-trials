  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurological disorder in the world, affecting more than
      50 million people worldwide.

      Approximately 35% of patients with epilepsy are refractory to all available antiepileptic
      drugs. Focal Hypometabolism on interictal [18F]-FDG PET is a hallmark of the Seizure Onset
      Zone as well as surrounding areas. Using [18F]-FDG PET is thus particularly useful to
      determine the seizure onset zone of epileptic patients and thus to guide surgical treatment
      when antiepileptic drugs fail.

      Interpretation of PET images primarily relies on standard visual analysis, but statistical
      analysis, with the widely used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software improves the
      diagnostic yield of PET. Over the past years, some authors have thus reported that the use of
      SPM can result in greater sensitivity and specificity of PET imaging in patients with partial
      epilepsy.

      In order to perform statistical analysis of PET images to compare brain metabolism of
      epileptic patients and healthy controls, it is necessary to collect a normative database of
      [18F]-FDG PET images in healthy controls.

      The purpose of this study is (i) collect a normative database of [18F]-FDG PET images in
      healthy adults controls to evaluate rigorously the diagnostic value of multimodal imaging for
      non-invasive localization of the EZ and (ii) to evaluate the test-retest reliability of
      [18F]-FDG PET scanning.

    <description>Each subject will have a PET scan at [18F] FDG.The raw imaging data obtained from these controls will be post-processed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software. Schematically, the data of each control will be normalized in the same anatomical space, then smoothed and averaged between the different controls. This will make it possible to constitute the normative database.</description>
