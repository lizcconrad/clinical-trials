  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid hemopathies characterized by ineffective clonal
      haematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias and a predisposition to the occurrence of acute myeloid
      leukemias. Their diagnosis involves a cytological evaluation of the medulla, while their
      prognosis, in addition to extrinsic factors depending on the patient himself (age,
      comorbidities), intrinsic factors. The cytological evaluation is subject to a certain
      subjectivity since qualitative and the diagnosis is sometimes difficult in the absence of
      marker of clonality. More and more studies emphasize the interest of flow cytometry (CMF) in
      the diagnosis of SMD: by looking for qualitative and / or quantitative aberrations of the
      expression of membrane markers, CMF allows to establish scores Diagnosis that we have put in
      place within the laboratory. However, these studies are based on a static model that studies
      the phenotypic characteristics of patients at a given time but does not really reflect
      ineffective hematopoiesis. A dynamic model for in vitro reproduction of hematopoiesis would
      be an innovative tool for the study of SMD. This project aims to develop and standardize a
      system of differentiation in liquid medium of hematopoietic stem cells (CSH) in mature cells
      by studying each stage of the differentiation in terms of proliferation, apoptosis and
      phenotypic expression. HSCs will be obtained by CD34 + sorting from the medullary sample at
      diagnosis: the investigator will study cell proliferation, apoptosis and the acquisition of
      surface markers, in order to identify the quantitative and qualitative abnormalities
      associated with the differentiation of haematopoietic progenitors Smart. This should make it
      possible to identify diagnostic and prognostic factors in terms of response to treatment,
      acutism and survival.
