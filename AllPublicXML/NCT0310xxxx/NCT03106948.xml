  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The narrowing of Dialysis Fistulae or Grafts is a near universal problem in patients with
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires patients to undergo repeated angioplasty or
      mechanical opening of the fistula.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The failure of dialysis accesses remains a leading cause of morbidity and medical costs among
      ESRD subjects. The underlying etiology for dialysis access failure is uniformly due to
      progressive narrowing of the vessel lumen leading to stasis and thrombosis of the access. The
      luminal narrowing of arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) is due to progressive hyperplasia of
      vessel intima and subsequent infiltration of smooth muscle cells into the vessel media. Areas
      of stenosis within AVFs are characterized by dense neointimal hyperplasia, infiltration of
      vascular smooth muscle cells and expansion of extracellular matrix material. Additionally,
      varying types of vascular injury increase the rate of collagen and elastin deposition within
      the medial and serosal areas of the vessel.

    <intervention_model_description>subjects will be assigned in an open labeled manner to Group 1 (Placebo), Group-2 (Ascorbic Acid), or Group-3 (Ascorbic acid &amp; D-penicillamine). Thus, there will be 10 placebo controls, 10 ascorbic acid patients, and 10 ascorbic acid and D-penicillamine patients. Subjects treated with ascorbic acid in combination with D-penicillamine may have the longest periods between serial angioplasties. Moreover, subjects receiving combination therapy may have greater post-angioplasty luminal diameters.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are followed for 12 months and monitored for signs of fistula dysfunction. When the patient's fistula becomes dysfunctional they will be referred for a fistulogram. The time between serial fistulograms will be recorded as a secondary endpoint. Patients who are referred for a repeat fistulogram and having a luminal narrowing of greater than 70% will undergo a second intimal biopsy.</description>
