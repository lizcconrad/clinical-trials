  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV/AIDS among Black men is a US public health crisis, emphasizing the urgency for increased
      research focus and intervention development. The overall objective of this application is to
      achieve a better understanding of the role that dyadic factors play in individual-level HIV
      care engagement outcomes among HIV-positive Black men in romantic relationships. The end goal
      is the development of an intervention that employs innovative mobile technology to target
      partnership dynamics that optimize outcomes in the HIV care continuum.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US, Black men who have sex with men (MSM), once
      diagnosed, are less likely to be optimally engaged in HIV care and treatment. This undermines
      the promise of prevention approaches for reducing the disproportionate effects of HIV/AIDS on
      Black communities, emphasizing the urgency for increased research focus and intervention
      development. Understanding HIV care engagement in the context of the dyad may be part of a
      comprehensive effort to addressing multilevel influences on HIV care engagement that are
      unique to HIV+ Black MSM towards achieving the maximum public health benefit of
      treatment-as-prevention. However, the scarcity of dyad-level research limits our
      understanding of dyadic effects HIV care engagement to inform intervention development.
      Mobile technology-based strategies (mHealth) offer tremendous potential as an acceptable,
      feasible, and effective intervention approach for enhancing HIV care engagement among
      partnered HIV+ Black MSM for several important reasons: (1) Black MSM are likely to report
      having a primary partner and to participate in couple-based HIV interventions; (2)
      couple-based behavior (e.g., daily routines of the couple), within-partnership dynamics
      (e.g., trust, intimacy), and couple serostatus (i.e., serodiscordant and concordant-positive
      relationships) are understudied factors in optimal HIV care engagement among MSM; and (3)
      mHealth has shown feasibility and acceptability in targeting couple-based behavior (e.g.,
      money management, family planning) in the general population. Moreover, mHealth offers
      potential in addressing social and structural barriers often experienced by Black MSM in
      accessing and engaging in HIV care. Therefore, the aims of the study are to: (Aim 1) examine
      mobile technology use and relational factors involved in HIV care engagement within the
      context of couples among HIV+ Black MSM; (Aim 2) synthesize Aim 1 findings to identify
      intervention targets for behavioral change and to derive a framework of an intervention to
      enhance HIV care engagement in a dyadic context; and (Aim 3) develop a novel, mobile
      technology product for enhancing HIV care engagement in the context of couples among HIV+
      Black MSM. The end goal of the application is the development of a novel, theory-based,
      user-centered mHealth product that targets relationship factors and dynamics important in
      optimal HIV care engagement among HIV+ Black men in same-sex relationships. Through these
      aims, I will acquire additional training necessary for my career development in (a) theory
      and research methods (qualitative research methods and dyadic analysis) for conducting
      couple-based research, (b) formative research in intervention development using group model
      building, and (c) mHealth product development. These research and career development
      activities will build the foundation to my becoming an independent, NIH-funded investigator
      with skills to conduct couple-based intervention research using mobile health innovations
      that is part of a comprehensive effort in HIV prevention integrating advances in mobile
      technology and behavioral medicine to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in HIV.
