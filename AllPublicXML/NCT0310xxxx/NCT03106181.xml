  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the commonest cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Treatment centres
      around lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) and typically includes medication (least
      invasive), laser, to surgery (most invasive). The gold-standard glaucoma operation is the
      trabeculectomy. Whilst it is effective at lowering IOP, it is associated with potentially
      devastating complications including bleb leak, hypotonous maculopathy, blebitis and
      endophthalmitis. In recent years, minimally- invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) has become an
      increasingly popular option of treating mild to moderate glaucoma. It is usually performed in
      conjunction with cataract surgery. The iStent (Glaukos Corporation, California, USA) is one
      of the most commonly utilised MIGS devices in the world and one of two Therapeutic Goods
      Administration (TGA)- approved MIGS devices in Australia. The iStent Inject® is the second
      generation iStent device and Australia is one of the first countries in the world to have
      access to this. So far there are no published randomised controlled trials comparing the
      effect of cataract surgery alone to combined cataract surgery with insertion of iStent
      Inject®.

      This study aims to recruit patients of the Glaucoma Investigative and Research Unit (GIRU) of
      Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH) with mild to moderate glaucoma who are due to
      undergo cataract surgery and randomise each to either cataract surgery or combined cataract
      surgery with iStent Inject® insertion. Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none
      of the exclusion criteria will be recruited. The outcomes measures of the study will be a
      comparison of: 1) extent of IOP reduction; 2) reduction in number of topical glaucoma
      medications; 3) patient treatment satisfaction - between the two treatment groups.
