  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      single-dose TD-3504 and single dose 15N2-tofacitinib in healthy subjects and subjects with
      UC. The relative bioavailability of tofacitinib released from TD-3504 compared to
      co-administered oral heavy-labeled tofacitinib (15N2-tofacitinib) will also be evaluated.
