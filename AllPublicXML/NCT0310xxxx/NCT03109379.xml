    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-302-5018, an investigational drug-delivery
      system, is safe and tolerable in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder and urinary
      incontinence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB) (frequency/urgency) with urge urinary
             incontinence or mixed urinary incontinence with a predominant urge component for at
             least 6 months

               -  8 or more voids per 24 hours as recorded in a diary

               -  At least 4 incontinence episodes associated with urgency recorded in a 3-day
                  diary.

                    -  At least 1 episode must occur per each 24 hour day

          2. Inadequate response or limiting side effects with anticholinergics for the treatment
             of OAB

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 years.

          2. OAB caused by neurological condition.

          3. Presence of significant renal dysfunction at screening (Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt;30
             mL/min).

          4. Presence of significant polyuria of any cause at screening (urine output &gt;4,000
             mL/day).

          5. History of pelvic radiation.

             risk of metastasis or death treated with expected curative outcome.

             Screening Visit.

         26. History or presence of any significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             gastrointestinal, gynecological, endocrine, immunological, dermatological,
             neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder that, in the opinion of the

                  are not exclusionary

               -  Renal or ureteral stone disease or instrumentation

               -  Childbirth
