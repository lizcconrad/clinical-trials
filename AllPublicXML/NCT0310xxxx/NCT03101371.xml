  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) complications following catheter use in surgical patients
      remains high. Using an aseptic protocol has been shown to drastically reduce UTI incidence by
      50%. Reducing UTIs will prevent extended hospital stays, readmission, and antibiotic use
      associated with this complication and improve cost-effectiveness of care. The investigators
      hypothesize that they can reduce the incidence of UTIs after catheter placement with the
      implementation of a Quality Improvement (QI) protocol to prevent excess exposure to the
      environment exposure of the catheter before, during and after insertion.
