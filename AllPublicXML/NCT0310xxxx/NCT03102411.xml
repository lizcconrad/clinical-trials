  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This cross-sectional survey study is to determine the prevalence of functional
      gastrointestinal (GI) disorders in the general population and to describe common triggers for
      food-related GI symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional gastrointestinal disorders, involving symptoms such as gas/bloating, diarrhea,
      constipation and abdominal pain, are estimated to impact between 35 and 45 million Americans,
      an overwhelming 15-20% of the population. These symptoms are responsible for upwards of 20
      billion dollars in healthcare costs and extensive loss of quality of life for sufferers.
      Moreover, many patients suffer in silence, with 67% of subjects waiting more than a year
      before treatment, and 11% waiting over 10 years. Irritable bowel syndrome is the most
      prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder, and several recent studies support the idea
      that dietary modifications may be key to alleviating this condition.

      The purpose of this study is to document gastrointestinal symptoms among the US population,
      as well as to ascertain awareness and utilization of dietary treatments that exist.
