  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of Benepali in participants with
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), including participants with
      Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axSpA, following their transition from
      treatment with Enbrel.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to describe clinical characteristics of patients
      transitioned from Enbrel to Benepali in routine practice, to evaluate safety during and
      following the transition from Enbrel to Benepali and to evaluate patient-reported outcomes
      during and following the transition from Enbrel to Benepali.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have been diagnosed with either rheumatoid arthritis or axial spondyloarthritis,
             according to local practice

          -  Transition from Enbrel to Benepali at the physician's (Investigator's) discretion
             prior to enrolment into the study

          -  Must have been treated with the same dose of Enbrel for at least 6 months prior to
             transition to Benepali and have at least 1 efficacy data value including but not
             restricted to DAS-28 or BASDAI during that period

          -  Must have a stable disease throughout the 2 month prior to enrolment based on the
             Investigator's judgement

          -  Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use appropriate contraception to
             avoid becoming pregnant during Benepali therapy and for three weeks after
             discontinuation of therapy

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any medical conditions that precludes administration of Benepali according to
             Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), such as the following:

          -  Hypersensitivity to the Benepali active substance, or to any of the associated
             excipients

          -  Sepsis, or risk of sepsis

          -  Active clinically significant local or chronic viral, bacterial or fungal infection,
             or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with
             parenteral anti-infectives within 2 months prior to enrollment

          -  Show any clinical sign or medical condition not allowing for treatment continuation
             (of etanercept) in the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Treatment with another biologic agent

          -  Are currently receiving or have previously received any therapies that would preclude
             administration of Benepali, such as the following:

          -  Immunizations with live or live-attenuated vaccines within the last 6 months prior to
             transition point and throughout the observation period

          -  Treatment with investigational agents within the last 6 months prior to transition
             point and during the period of observation.

          -  Any other unspecified reasons that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, make the
             patient unsuitable for enrollment.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
