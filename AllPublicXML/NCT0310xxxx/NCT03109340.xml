      Objective: To show the effectiveness of walking with ECE PEDO (Equipment for Clever Exercise)
      comparing supervised treadmill walking corresponding moderate aerobic exercise intensity on
      abdominal obesity and cardiorespiratory capacity.

      Methods: Twenty-eight women with overweight and obesity were assigned to two groups:
      supervised treadmill walking (Group I,n=14) or walking with ECE PEDO (Group II,n=14). Target
      heart rate(HR) corresponding to values of 50-70% VO2max were determined by the submaximal
      treadmill test. Group 1 was instructed walking at their target HR on a treadmill. The number
      of steps taken in a minute corresponding to target HR was determined by a criterion pedometer
      and group 2 was instructed walking in these step range recorded to ECE PEDO giving audible
      feedback. Before and after a 12-week exercise program, participants were evaluated by BMI and
      waist circumference(WC); ultrasonographic visceral fat thickness(VFT) and ergospirometric
      VO2max.

    <description>An exercise prescription was developed for each woman on the basis of the data acquired from the baseline treadmill exercise test. Target HR corresponding to values of 50-70% VO2max (moderate-intensity) was determined by the submaximal treadmill test.The participants were instructed walking exercise at their target HR on a treadmill in Sports Rehabilitation Unit of Pamukkale University. HR was monitored by a Polar HR monitor (Polar Beat, Port Washington, NY).During 12 weeks, 5 days in a week and 30 minutes per day walking program was applied.</description>

    <description>Following a 10-minute rest after treadmill test, the participants were instructed to walk on the treadmill while maintaining their target heart rate. The number of steps taken in a minute was calculated using a criterion pedometer when target HR responses were reached. In this way, we determined the steps per minute required to moderate intensity walking for each participant. Detected individual step numbers were recorded to ECE PEDO for each person. Then participants were given the walking program with ECE PEDO giving audible feedback in case of any deviation from the range of steps per minute.During 12 weeks, 5 days in a week and 30 minutes per day walking program was applied.</description>
