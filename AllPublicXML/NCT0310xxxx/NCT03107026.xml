      A study to evaluate a drug (dasotraline) on the safety, effectiveness and how well the body
      tolerates it, in adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter, outpatient study evaluating
      the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of dasotraline (4 and 6 mg/day) versus placebo over a
      12-week treatment period in adults with BED. This study is projected to randomize
      approximately 480 subjects to 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (4 mg/day dasotraline, 6
      mg/day dasotraline, and placebo).

      Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo for the duration of the treatment period.

      Subjects randomized to 4 mg/day dasotraline will receive 4 mg/day for the duration of the
      treatment period.

      Subjects randomized to 6 mg/day dasotraline will be dosed with 4 mg/day dasotraline for the
      first 2 weeks of the treatment period and will be increased to 6 mg/day at Week 2.

      If, in the judgment of the Investigator, the subject does not tolerate the assigned dose, he
      or she will be discontinued from the study.

      The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 3 weeks), 12-weeks of treatment, and a
      3-week study drug withdrawal period. Subjects who complete the 12-week double-blind treatment
      period in this study may be eligible to enroll and continue treatment for an additional 12
      months in an open-label extension study (Study SEP360-322). Subjects who do not enter the
      extension study will complete the study drug withdrawal period in this study.

             eating episode 6. Subject has a BE- CGI-S score ≥ 4 at screening and baseline. 7.
             Subject has a negative breath alcohol test and a negative UDS for any illicit drug.

             9. Female subject of childbearing potential and male subject with female partner of
             childbearing potential must agree to use an effective and medically acceptable form of
             birth control throughout the study period. Note: Continued use of an effective and
             medically acceptable form of birth control is recommended for 30 days after study
             completion.

             10. Subject must be able to comply with study drug administration and adhere to
             protocol requirements including all study assessments.
