  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the rate and amount of nicotine uptake with 10-minute ad libitum use of four
      different marketed electronic cigarettes. Furthermore, to measure overall product liking by
      subjects to assess potential willingness to seek out the Electronic Cigarette (EC) again in
      the future.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, randomized, open-label, parallel study during which up to 140
      healthy adult subjects, consisting of 35 subjects per marketed EC product, will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be evaluated for plasma nicotine uptake, as well as overall product liking. The
      study will involve the use of four (4) marketed EC products in tobacco consumers who are
      exclusive smokers (i.e., naïve EC users) or dual users of cigarettes and ECs (i.e.,
      intermittent EC users).

             hypertension, diabetes, asthma or other lung disease, cardiac disease, neurological
             disease or psychiatric disorders) based on safety assessments such as clinical

             or hormone replacement therapy.

         14. A positive urine drug screen without disclosure of corresponding concomitant
             medication(s) at the Screening Visit or on Study Day 1.

         15. A positive alcohol breathalyzer result at Screening Visit or on Study Day 1.

         16. Employed by a tobacco or nicotine company, the study site, or handles tobacco or
             nicotine-containing products as part of their job.
