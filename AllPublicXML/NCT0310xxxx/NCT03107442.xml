  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) have increased arterial stiffness, which
      leads to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) of arteriosclerotic origin, which are the main cause
      of mortality in these patients. Exercise is a modifiable factor that reduces cardiovascular
      mortality and associated risk factors in the general population. Preliminary studies suggest
      that exercise may improve endothelial function and lipid profile in patients with SLE.
      However, whether meeting the international physical activity guidelines from the American
      College of Sports Medicine (ACSM; i.e. ≥150 min / week of moderate to vigorous intensity
      physical activity) can improve arterial stiffness (subclinical atherosclerosis marker) and
      inflammation is unknown.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effect of an exercise program based on meeting
      the ACSM physical activity guidelines on arterial stiffness and inflammation in patients with
      SLE.

      The secondary aim is to assess the effect of an exercise program based on meeting the ACSM
      physical activity guidelines on endothelial function, oxidative stress, as well as other
      cardiometabolic risk factors, physical fitness, health-related quality of life, and other
      psychosocial outcomes.

      Our hypothesis is that meeting the ACSM guidelines will improve arterial stiffness and
      inflammation in patients with SLE.

      The study is a non-randomized clinical trial. To minimize selection bias, participants in the
      intervention and control groups will be matched by age, BMI, and disease activity (SLEDAI),
      which are important contributors to arterial stiffness.
