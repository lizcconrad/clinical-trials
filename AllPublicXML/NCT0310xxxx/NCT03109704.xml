    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the immediate effects of a supine upper thoracic spine thrust
      manipulation, seated upper thoracic spine thrust manipulation, and sham manipulation for
      individuals with subacromial pain syndrome. The participants were randomized to receive one
      of the three interventions and baseline measures for the dependent variables were repeated
      immediately after the delivery of the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thoracic spine thrust manipulation has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and
      improving function in individuals with subacromial pain syndrome (subacromial impingement).
      It remains unknown if individuals respond differently to different manipulation techniques.
      This study examines the immediate effects of these different thoracic spine thrust
      manipulation techniques on scapular kinematics (upward rotation and posterior tilt,
      specifically), pectoralis minor muscle length, and scapulothoracic muscle force production
      for the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior. Additionally, the
      short-term effects on pain and function were examined through use of the Penn Shoulder Score
      (PSS).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scapular upward rotation active range of motion (ROM)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will start with the involved arm at the side of the body. The investigator will confirm the location of the scapular plane by placing the subject's arm at an angle 40 degrees anterior from the frontal plane as measured with a standard goniometer. The digital inclinometer will be zeroed on a horizontal surface and then placed along the scapular spine of the involved arm. The initial reading from the inclinometer on the scapular spine with the arm at the side of the body will be recorded. The subject will then be instructed to elevate the arm in the scapular plane as high as he/she can go. The final reading from the inclinometer will then be recorded at the end of the subject's maximal arm elevation. The total amount of scapular upward rotation will be calculated as the change score by taking the difference between the final and initial readings. Downward rotation would be recorded as negative values and upward rotation would be recorded as positive values.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scapular posterior tilt active ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The participant will start with the test arm at the side of the body. The digital inclinometer will be zeroed on a vertical surface and then placed vertically along the posterior surface of the medial border of the scapula, using the root of the scapular spine and the inferior angle of the scapula as landmarks as previously described. The initial reading from the inclinometer with the arm at the side of the body will be recorded. The subject will then be instructed to elevate the arm in the scapular plane as high as he/she can go. The final reading from the inclinometer will then be recorded at the end of the subject's maximal arm elevation. The total amount of scapular posterior tilt will be calculated as the change score by taking the difference between the final and initial readings. Anterior tilt would be recorded as negative values and posterior tilt would be recorded as positive values.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scapular upward rotation passive ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements will be made with the subject in standing. The participant will start with the involved arm at the side of the body. The digital inclinometer will be zeroed and positioned as described for the measure of upward rotation active ROM. The initial reading from the inclinometer will be recorded. The examiner can then passively elevate the humerus in the scapular plane to end-range elevation, producing passive upward rotation of the scapula. The examiner will move the subject's arm through the full available elevation ROM passively for two consecutive trials. At the point of maximal passive arm elevation on the second repetition, the inclinometer will again be placed along the scapular spine to obtain a measurement of upward rotation passive ROM. The total amount of scapular upward rotation passive ROM will be calculated as the change score by taking the difference between the final and initial readings.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in scapular posterior tilt passive ROM</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements will be made with the subject standing. The digital inclinometer will be zeroed and positioned as described for the measure of posterior tilt active ROM. The initial reading from the inclinometer will be recorded with the subject's arm at the side of the body. The examiner can then passively elevate the humerus in the scapular plane to end-range elevation, producing passive posterior tilt of the scapula. The examiner will move the subject's arm through the full, available elevation ROM passively for two consecutive trials. At the point of maximal passive arm elevation on the second repetition, the inclinometer will again be placed along the posterior surface of the medial border of the scapula to obtain a measurement of posterior tilt passive ROM. The total amount of scapular posterior tilt passive ROM will be calculated as the change score by taking the difference between the final and initial readings.</description>

    <measure>Change in pectoralis minor muscle length</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Performed as described previously by Borstad. A tape measure will be used to measure the linear distance in cm between the anterior-inferior edge of the 4th rib one finger width lateral to the sternum and the medial-inferior aspect of the coracoid process of the scapula. This measurement will be completed while the subject is standing in their usual resting position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in middle trapezius force production</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A handheld dynamometer (HHD) (Hoggan MicroFET2) will be used to assess force production in standard manual muscle test (MMT) position using a &quot;make test&quot; as previously described. The &quot;make test&quot; will require the examiner to instruct the subject to slowly push into the HHD and increase their force production to a maximal level over a 5-second period of time. Prior to maximal isometric testing, a sub-maximal (50%) effort trial will be performed to minimize learning effects. Two maximal effort trials will be performed with a 30-second rest between trials and the average of the trials (recorded in kg) will be used for data analysis. Additionally, subject body weight in kg will be recorded to allow for normalization of strength measures by dividing by subject body weight.</description>

    <measure>Change in pain</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 1 minute after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS). Participants will be asked to rate their pain on a 0-10 scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst pain imaginable. This pain rating will be obtained during active elevation of the arm in the scapular plane.</description>

    <description>The supine thrust manipulation will target the upper thoracic spine and will be performed as previously described. The patient will be asked to lace his or her fingers behind the neck and bring his or her elbows close together in front of the chest. The therapist will place one hand just below the targeted upper thoracic region (at either the T3 or T4 level) using a pistol grip or loose fist to make contact with both transverse processes of the T3 or T4 vertebrae. The therapist will then use his or her body to push down through the patient's upper arms to provide a high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust in the anterior-to-posterior direction.</description>

    <intervention_name>Seated upper thoracic spine thrust manipulation</intervention_name>
    <description>The seated thrust manipulation will target the cervicothoracic junction with the patient sitting with fingers laced behind the neck. The therapist will stand behind the patient and thread his or her arms through the patient's arms and clasp his or her hands near the C7-T1 level. The therapist will make contact with his or her chest against the patient's upper thoracic region to serve as a fulcrum. The patient will then be instructed to take a deep breath, and upon exhalation the therapist will apply a high-velocity, low-amplitude distraction thrust in a cephalad direction.</description>

    <description>The sham manipulation will be performed with the patient and the examiner positioned in the same manner as for the seated manipulation, however the examiner will apply only minimal pressure to maintain physical contact and &quot;skin lock&quot; with the patient. The examiner will then move the patient through the same range of motion but deliver no manipulative thrust.</description>
