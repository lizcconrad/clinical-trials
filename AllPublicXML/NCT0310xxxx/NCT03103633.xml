  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia-related factors have been linked to poor perioperative outcomes. Our observational
      study suggested that the cumulative duration of a triple-low state (intraoperative low MAP,
      low BIS, and low Ce) was associated with poorer 30-day mortality.This randomized, prospective
      study based on individualized Oxygen dynamics is designed to confirm this association.
