  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Upstate KIDS Study is to track the growth, development and long-term health
      of children given the increasing use of infertility treatment, occurrence of maternal obesity
      and pregnancy complications, and rising maternal age at birth.

      The Upstate KIDS Study aims to determine if there are differences in health measures between
      children conceived by infertility treatment and children conceived naturally. In the first
      phase of the study, the focus was on growth and development through age 3 years. In the
      second phase of the study, the focus is turning to cardiometabolic factors through age 9
      years. Infertility treatments include assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as in
      vitro fertilization (IVF), controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and ovulation induction
      (OI). The study was originally designed as a matched exposure cohort. Specifically,
      singletons whose birth certificates indicated the use of infertility treatment were
      considered 'exposed' singleton infants and subsequently frequency-matched on perinatal region
      of birth at a ratio of 1:3 to 'unexposed' singletons. Twins and higher order multiples were
      invited to participate regardless of mode of conception. Mothers and their newborns were
      recruited approximately 2-4 months postpartum. The first phase of the study was completed in
      2014 and main findings can be found under publications.

      The second phase objectives are:

      To determine whether infertility treatment is associated with differences in growth and
      development from age 6 to 8 years with particular focus on childhood cardio-metabolic
      outcomes by follow-up of children conceived by ART or other infertility treatments and
      children who were conceived without treatment. Secondarily, to assess epigenetic differences
      as measured by DNA methylation using collected biospecimens.
