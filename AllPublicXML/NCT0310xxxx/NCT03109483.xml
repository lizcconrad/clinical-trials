  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of our developed week-treatment
      program GAPP, on strength, balance, speed, functionality and cognition, with the main goal to
      achieve a better independence for activities of daily living (ADL).

      Each day of the week an exercise program of 45 minutes is given assigned to a specific aspect
      of the rehabilitation; strength, balance, speed, functional training and one day is for
      testing or group therapy.

      Participants will be followed for four weeks, with testing on day one, after two weeks and at
      the last day of the four-week program.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of our developed week-treatment
      program GAPP (Geriatric Activation Program Pellenberg), on strength, balance, speed,
      functionality and cognition, with the main goal to achieve a better independence for ADL.

      Each day of the week an exercise program of 45 minutes is given assigned to a specific aspect
      of the rehabilitation.

      Monday: speed and coordination, including as many repetitions as possible in one minute for:
      quick arm movements in standing, quick trunk movements in sitting, quick weight transfers in
      standing, stepping.

      Tuesday: functional training, including walking stairs, transfers, sitting to lying and
      reverse, moving objects in the room, functional fit-o-meter.

      Wednesday: balance, including maximum weight transfers in all directions, exercises with
      reduced base of support, reaching.

      Thursday: strength, including sit to stand with a weight belt, lifting a weight bimanual of
      the table, walking with ankle weights, arm extension with therapy bands.

      Friday: testing or group activity. One week the following test will be taken: Berg Balance
      Scale, 10m walking test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, knee extension and elbow extension
      strength with the microfet2, Basic-ADL and Geriatric Depression Scale.

      The other week there will be a group session, this could be in sitting (like moving on music)
      or standing (like petanque).

      Walking will be practiced every day of the week and individual needs (like specific hand
      rehabilitation or pain problems) will be addressed besides the program when needed.
