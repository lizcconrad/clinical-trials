      This study compares the biological activity of cabazitaxel (6 cycles) to that of docetaxel (6
      cycles) in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with docetaxel
      resistant mCPRC defined as ≥ 5CTCs/7.5ml after 2 cycles of docetaxel.

      Patients with docetaxel resistant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
      based on circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration (patients with ≥ 5CTCs/7.5ml before
      docetaxel chemotherapy and after 2 cycles of docetaxel) will receive either 6 additional
      cycles of docetaxel or 6 additional cycles of cabazitaxel after randomisation.

      A cohort of patients with docetaxel sensitive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) based on circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration (patients ≥ 5CTCs/7.5ml before
      docetaxel chemotherapy and &lt; 5CTCs/7.5ml after 2 cycles of docetaxel) will receive 6
      additional cycles of docetaxel

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent signed prior any study-related procedures

          2. Adult men ≥ 18 years

          3. Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma

          4. Metastatic disease as evidenced by imaging (bone scan, CT scan, MRI and/or
             PET-choline).

          5. Documented progressive disease while receiving continuous hormonal treatment with
             LH-RH agonist or antagonist or after surgical castration (at least one visceral or
             soft tissue metastatic lesion, including a new lesion). Patient with non-measurable
             disease must have documented rising PSA levels or appearance of new lesion

          6. Effective castration assessed by testosterone levels ≤ 50 ng/dl

          7. Patients with a performance status ECOG ≤ 2 (Appendix 1)

          8. Patients affiliated to social security scheme

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer except estramustine &lt; 1 year from
             the end of adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for localized disease &lt; 1 year

             bisphosphonates prior to study entry which should be pursued,

             ulcer disease, erosive esophagitis or gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, pulmonary
             embolism or other uncontrolled thromboembolic event,

         12. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, or laboratory
             abnormally that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk
             associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in the
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this
             study,

         13. Planned vaccination with a live or live-attenuated vaccines,

         14. Participation in another clinical trial and any treatment with any investigational
