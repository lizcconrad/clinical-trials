  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study TRD subjects' resistance to at least 2 different antidepressants, we hypothesize that
      because of their significant depression and treatment resistant status they are most likely
      to exhibit BSMN pathway abnormalities.

      Potential subjects will be identified during clinical visits. If a patient qualifies to
      participate in the study they will have to stop any antidepressants that they are taking to
      prepare for the use of MAOIs. After a two week washout period, subjects will have an fMRI and
      will be started on a MAOI. They will then be followed up for 8 weeks, which is routine and
      considered standard care.

    <measure>Brainstem Structural Connectivity (Sc)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Localize BSMN and measure pathway Sc using diffusion imaging to differentiate between TRD and HC. BSMN can be localized using diffusion imaging, and pathways projecting from BSMN to known targets can be identified. Methods have been developed to localize these nuclei via a combination of diffusion imaging and anatomic imaging. We will identify these nuclei and track their projections to known targets, giving rise to the VTA-NAcc, VTA-AMYG, RN-AM and RN-sgACC pathways. Probabilistic fiber tracking between these nodes will be used to determine a measure of pathway strength.</description>

    <measure>Brainstem Functional Connectivity (Fc)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measure BSMN pathway Fc to differentiate between TRD and HC. BSMN associated with different neuromodulators, e.g. the VTA and RN, will be associated with distinct functional networks which will be abnormal in TRD compared to HCs.</description>
