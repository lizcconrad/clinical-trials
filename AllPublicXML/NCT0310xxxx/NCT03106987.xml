  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OReO study will be a Phase IIIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicentre study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of Olaparib retreatment, versus
      matching placebo, in non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients (including
      patients with primary peritoneal and/or fallopian tube cancer).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The OReO study will investigate the efficacy and safety of Olaparib maintenance re-treatment
      in patients with relapsed non-mucinous EOC, who have had disease progression following
      maintenance therapy with a Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose [poly (ADP ribose)] polymerisation
      inhibitor (PARPi) and a complete or partial radiological response to subsequent treatment
      with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients will be enrolled on the basis of their breast
      cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1, BRCA2) status into one of two cohorts (BRCA1/2 [+ve] and
      BRCA1/2 [-ve]). The BRCA1/2 (+ve) and BRCA1/2 (-ve) cohorts will be randomised separately.
      Within each cohort, patients will be randomised by prospective allocation in a 2:1 ratio
      (Olaparib: matching placebo).
