  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;RUN-CD&quot; is an investigator initiated &quot;Non interventional Trial&quot; on biologics in Crohn´s
      Disease (CD) patients in Germany with a prospective documentation of effectiveness in
      induction and maintenance therapy of biologics, especially of Ustekinumab, with a special
      interest on predictors of long-term responses and favorable disease outcome and documentation
      of severe side effects caused by the therapy with biologics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness and safety of induction and maintenance therapy of Ustekinumab and other
      biologics will be assessed in different relevant subgroups of Crohn`s Disease patients. To
      this end, different confounders have to be considered. Patients followed-up for several years
      will likely receive changing treatments. These changes have to be taken into account.
      Furthermore, the decision to prescribe, to stop or to continue a treatment depends on the
      availability of treatment options and experiences with these alternatives:

        1. Confounding by indication will be taken into account

        2. Patient characteristics which likely influence the risk of developing a particular
           endpoint will be taken into account

        3. The possible influence of co-medication will be considered

        4. Changing risks over time will be considered

        5. Power considerations needs to be conducted prior to the comparison of incidence rates

        6. Appropriate statistical methods will be applied to deal with these challenges

      The principles described above will be followed in a similar manner for the analysis of
      effectiveness and safety endpoints. An appropriate power analysis will be performed before
      each sub-analysis.
