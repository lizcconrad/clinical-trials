  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid polyphenol, has been found to consistently modulate
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) following oral supplementation. Although, this has not resulted in
      subsequent predicted benefits to cognitive performance in young healthy populations. However,
      it is argued that those who suffer a reduction in CBF and cognition, such as aging
      populations, may benefit more from resveratrol administration.

      Hypothesis: The current investigation aimed to employ a mild hypoxia as an experimental model
      of aging in a young healthy population, to assess if resveratrol can attenuate the deficits
      elicited by the reduction in oxygen supply. It was hypothesized resveratrol would module CBF,
      to provide a more efficient supply of oxygen to overcome any associated decreases to
      performance caused by the hypoxic model.

      Design: This repeated measures, double blind, placebo controlled, balanced design assessed
      the cognitive and CBF effects of resveratrol in hypoxia (equivalent to ~2000m above sea
      level) and normoxia (sea level).

      Methods: 24 participants arrived fully fasted (except water) for 12 hrs before completing a
      baseline measure of a cognitive task battery, and taking the treatment for the day. Following
      a 45 min absorption period, participants completed 3 full repetitions of the cognitive test
      battery and, if appropriate, the oxygen level was altered. Changes in CBF were measured by
      near-infrared spectroscopy throughout the full testing session.

    <description>Participants completed a number of tasks to measure cognitive domain performance (Episodic Memory, Speed of Attention, &amp; Accuracy of Attention), as part of a 15 minute cognitive battery. Outcomes were measured in accuracy of responses to each task (% correct), reaction time to respond to each task (in milliseconds (ms), and the number of error responses when completing each task.</description>
