  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies demonstrate that exercise increases the maximal oxygen uptake, peak oxygen
      consumption, reduce effort-induced lactic acid production, and increase skeletal muscle
      oxidative capacity, as well as psychological aspects such as increased self-esteem and
      improvement of the quality of life.

      In the literature there is only one study involving rehabilitation in hospitalized pediatric
      patients with cystic fibrosis. Thus, more information on in-hospital rehabilitation is
      required in adult cystic fibrosis patients.

      The present study aims to evaluate the effects of an early rehabilitation program, based on
      aerobic training and muscle strength training, in adolescent and adult patients with cystic
      fibrosis hospitalized at Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre for exacerbation of lung
      disease.

      After completing the study inclusion criteria, the individual will be invited to participate
      and will receive the consent form for signature.

      The patient will be submitted to the following evaluations: quality of life questionnaire for
      cystic fibrosis, spirometry, Shwachman-Kulczycki score, modified dyspnea questionnaire
      (Modified Medical Research Council), maximum repetition test, six minute walk test and blood
      sample for the determination of inflammatory markers. These evaluations should be performed
      within the first 48 hours of hospitalization, and will be repeated on the last day of
      hospitalization.

      In the period up to 48 hours after hospital admission, patients will be randomized to either
      the intervention group or the control group.
