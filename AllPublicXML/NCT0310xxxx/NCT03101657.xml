      physical violence, situations of harassment, psychotraumatism linked to the series of attacks
      suffered in France), but also and above all, the search for the best possible reparation for

      psychological repercussions and determining ITI. This topic concerns any physician involved
      in the care of victims, whether he is a doctor in primary care or in specialized care.
