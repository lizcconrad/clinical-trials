    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient
      outcome in this population. In the healthy adult, a high protein meal is known to enhance
      glomerular filtration rate and is mediated by an increase in renal blood flow. The
      investigators hypothesized that preoperative oral protein load may precondition the kidneys
      for upcoming insults.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient
      outcome in this population. To date, there is no therapy to prevent AKI. In the healthy
      adult, a high protein meal is known to enhance glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is
      mediated by an increase in renal blood flow. The investigators hypothesized that preoperative
      oral protein load may induce an adaptive response of the kidneys, and precondition the
      kidneys for upcoming insults. In the present study, the investigators aimed to compare the
      prevalence and severity of AKI in patients undergoing oral high protein load to age- and
      gender-matched &quot;controls&quot; who did not receive protein load before cardiac surgery within the
      same period (October 2014-November 2015) at San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.
