    <textblock>
      A pilot study exploring whether individuals receiving usual treatment (CBT) from the
      specialist NHS Tayside Eating Disorders Service and accessing the online self-help &quot;Smart
      Eating&quot; programme have improved treatment outcomes compared to those receiving usual
      treatment only. The study will also explore acceptability of the &quot;Smart Eating&quot; self-help
      programme via a feedback questionnaire.

      This controlled-comparison pilot study will explore whether individuals receiving usual
      treatment (CBT) from the specialist NHS Tayside Eating Disorders Service and accessing the
      online self-help &quot;Smart Eating&quot; programme have improved treatment outcomes compared to those
      receiving usual treatment only. All participants would be involved in the trial for 6 months,
      capturing their motivation for change, eating disorder psychopathology and quality of life at
      four time-points (pre-treatment, mid-treatment, end of treatment, 3-month follow-up). Some
      participants may continue to receive usual treatment after study end, which will be detailed
      in the study analysis. Following trial completion, all participants will be able to access
      the &quot;Smart Eating&quot; programme. The study will also explore acceptability of the &quot;Smart Eating&quot;
      self-help programme via a feedback questionnaire to inform programme adaptations and a
      possible pragmatic randomised controlled trial planned for the future. Currently, no other UK
      study is piloting the use of the &quot;Smart Eating&quot; programme as an adjunct to specialist NHS
      eating disorder treatment.
