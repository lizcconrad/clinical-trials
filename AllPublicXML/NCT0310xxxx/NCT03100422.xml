  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurological patients (e.g., after stroke) need long-term neurorehabilitation therapy of the
      arm with often limited, unsatisfactory outcome. Robots became a promising supplement or even
      alternative for neurorehabilitation training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exoskeleton robot ARMin was further developed and software components adapted accordingly
      to offer a unique intensified and patient-tailored robot-aided training of the arm. The goal
      is to enhance treatment efficacy to an extent that the improvement in motor function is
      meaningful for the individual patient. The study objective is to compare ARMin therapy and a
      form of conventional occupational therapy that involves both arms regarding change in motor
      function.
