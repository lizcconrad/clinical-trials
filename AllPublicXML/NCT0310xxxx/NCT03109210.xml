  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-site randomized clinical trial will investigate and compare three treatments for
      insomnia in patients who have been diagnosed with and treated for sleep apnea: online
      cognitive behavioral therapy (OCBT), therapist-directed cognitive behavioral therapy (TCBT),
      and standard clinical care. 384 patients will be recruited and will attend up to 15 visits
      over 10 months. Visits will include baseline assessment, treatment visits, and post-treatment
      follow-up visits. Visits will involve completion of questionnaires, meeting with therapists,
      and a physical exam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This dual-site randomized clinical trial will use a &quot;SMART&quot; design to test a stepped care
      model relative to standard positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy and determine if (1)
      augmentation of PAP therapy with online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy improves short-term
      outcomes of comorbid obstructive sleep apnea(OSA)/insomnia; and (2) providing a higher
      intensity 2nd-stage cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to patients who show sub-optimal
      short-term outcomes with OCBT+PAP improves short and longer-term outcomes. After completing
      baseline assessment, the 384 comorbid OSA\insomnia patients enrolled will be randomized to a
      1st-stage therapy that includes usual care PAP + OCBT (n=288) or UC (usual care PAP + sleep
      hygiene education; n=96). Insomnia and OSA will be reassessed after 8 weeks. OCBT recipients
      who meet &quot;remission&quot; criteria will continue PAP but be offered no additional insomnia
      intervention and will complete study outcome measures again after an additional 8-weeks and
      at 3 and 6 month follow-ups. OCBT recipients classified as &quot;unremitted&quot; after 8 weeks of
      treatment will be re-randomized to a 2nd-stage treatment consisting of continued, expanded
      engagement in OCBT or a switch to therapist-directed CBT (TCBT). Those receiving the
      2nd-stage intervention as well as the UC group will be reassessed after another 8 weeks and
      at 3- and 6-month follow-up time points.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included participants must &gt; 21 years old and:

          1. have a diagnosis of OSA with an AHI &gt; 5 on a diagnostic polysomnogram;

          2. accept PAP as primary/sole OSA therapy, been given a prescription for PAP and filled
             it within the last 3 months, have had an opportunity to use PAP for at least one
             month, and show mean use of &gt; 1 hour per night;

          3. have a complaint of persistent (i.e., &gt; 3 months) sleep onset or sleep maintenance
             difficulties despite having adequate opportunity for sleep and accompanied by
             significant daytime impairment or distress about poor sleep;

          4. an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score &gt; 10 indicating at least &quot;mild&quot; insomnia; and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. an untreated psychiatric disorder (e.g., major depression) found on structured

             not to offer those treatments;

          2. a lifetime diagnosis of any psychotic or bipolar disorder as sleep restriction for
             insomnia may precipitate hallucinations and mania;

          4. alcohol or drug abuse within the past year;

          5. terminal illness (e.g., cancer), or neurological degenerative disease (e.g.,

          6. current use of medications known to cause insomnia (e.g., stimulants);

          7. comorbid narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, restless legs syndrome (score of &gt;11 in
             the IRLS), periodic limb movement during sleep (known PLMS with arousal &gt; 15 per
             hour), or a circadian rhythm sleep disorder if habitual bedtimes are later than 3:00
             AM or rising times are later than 11:00 AM; or

          8. consuming &gt; 2 alcoholic beverages per day on a regular basis; or

          9. consuming more than 10 caffeinated beverages per day on a regular basis; or

         10. consuming marijuana in any form on a regular basis &gt;1 time per week, or if used after
             4:00 p.m; or

         11. change in thyroid medication dosage or received a new prescription for thyroid
             medication 3 months before the screening visit; or
