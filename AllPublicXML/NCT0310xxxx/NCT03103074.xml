    <textblock>
      Randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot study/proof of concept-study to see if
      intradermal injection with Botulinum toxin B is an effective treatment of Hidradenitis
      suppurativa
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with hidradenitis suppurativa will be enrolled and randomised to treatment
      with either botulinum toxin B or placebo (saline) in affected areas.

      Intervention and recording of data will be performed every three months. After three months,
      all patients will receive active substance. After six months, randomization will revealed.
      Patients with clinical improvement will be given the opportunity to continue treatment for
      additional six months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in need of emergency medical or surgical treatment of hidradenitis will be
             excluded until the disease is in a quiet, controlled phase.
