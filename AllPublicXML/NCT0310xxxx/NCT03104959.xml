  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded study involving healthy non-alcoholic (self-reported) volunteers
      over the age of 21. Consent is obtained prior to participation in the study while the
      participant is sober. Volunteers are recruited from residency programs, hospital employees,
      emergency medical personnel, and friends of the study investigators. If the volunteers choose
      to drink, they can participate in the study the night of ingestion of alcohol. There is no
      amount we ask them to drink, and we allow them to withdraw from the study at any time. We
      never force them to drink alcohol, or even encourage it. The participation is completely
      voluntary, if they would like to participate and if they choose to drink alcohol, we ask them
      to participate in the placebo controlled study in the safety of their own home. Then
      materials for the study are given out prior to their participation. An envelope is given with
      the questionnaire, and a small packet containing 3 pills of either NAC or placebo, and a
      small smear of Vicks vapor rub concealed in a small packet. At the end of their alcohol
      ingestion, the volunteer is asked to estimate the number roof drinks consumed and take 1
      capsule per 3 drinks consumed of either 600 mg N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine or placebo capsules. In
      the morning, each participant fills out a Hangover Symptom Score questionnaire . A random
      number generator is used to determine placebo or NAC first, then the participant is given the
      other treatment at their subsequent encounter. Then study is being conducted over a series of
      many months, and data can be analyzed by the hangover symptoms scale data when using NAC
      compared to placebo. The data will be analyzed using the numerical values of each category
      for hangover classification and compare the placebo data to the control data.
