      This is a prospective randomized open-label blinded endpoint (PROBE) The study will be
      conducted in Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital. The patients with dual-antipletlet who need
      dental procedure between Febuary 2017 until Febuary 2018 will be included in the study.
      Baseline characteristics of the enrolled patients including bleeding complication will be
      collected in each patient. To compare rate of significant bleeding from dental procedure
      between patient who need two antiplatelet and who stop P2Y12 inhibitors before procedure.

      Treatment of coronary artery disease is re-open the occluded artery by many ways such as
      removed clot and coronary stenting. Which needed two antiplatelet after the procedure at
      least a month to a year. Some patient must have life long period to prevent the stent occlude
      and stenosis. But dental problem is commonly found in real life practice. Many people
      suffered from toothache and have to wait until a year, just to prevent bleeding. Physicians
      often be consulted with this dilemma. To continue there are some risk to bleed but
      discontinue antipletlet can cause recurrent myocardial ischemia. Which the highest risk
      factor of stent thrombosis is early stop anti platelet. Since there is no clinical practice
      guideline in Thailand, this study is to compare rate of dental bleeding between patient who
      continue two antoplatelet and who stop only P2Y12 inhibitor. The study include immediate
      bleeding, 24 hour and a week after procedure, follow up for major cardiovascular event such
      as myocardial ischemia, stroke and death. In order to create further clinical practice for
      this specific group.
