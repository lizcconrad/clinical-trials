  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and dose-response of ASP4070
      vaccinated in patients with cedar pollinosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be vaccinated with ASP4070 or placebo at 2 week intervals. Clinical symptoms
      will be evaluated after cedar pollen exposure in a chamber at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the
      last vaccination to identify the timing of the onset of therapeutic effect.
