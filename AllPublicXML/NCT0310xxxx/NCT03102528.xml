  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately one-third of patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery (CS), and represents one of the most significant negative predictors of patient
      outcome in this population. The investigators sought to examine the prevalence of AKI, renal
      recovery and development of de-novo chronic kidney disease in all patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery at San Bortolo Hospital, Italy 2014-2015.
