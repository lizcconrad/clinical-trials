  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effects of hamate hook removal, microscrew internal fixation and plaster
      fixation on fracture healing, work, life, and exercise recovery in patients with hamate hook
      fractures by retrospective case analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hamate hook fractures are rare, and mainly occur during sports activities. Its projection is
      often obscured by other carpal bone in conventional X-ray plain films, so hamate hook
      fractures are the most easily missed injury in hand surgery. As the incidence of such
      fractures is too small, it brings some difficulties in the clinical choice of correct and
      effective treatment. Currently, treatment programs of hamate hook fractures also are not
      consistent.
