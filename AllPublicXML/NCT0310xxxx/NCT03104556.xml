  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MitraClip-procedure offers an interventional treatment for high risk patients with severe
      symptomatic mitral regurgitation. The number of new cerebral ischemic lesions without
      clinical manifestations is high. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of
      cerebral embolisms and cerebral lesions during the MitraClip-procedure using transcranial
      doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.

    <textblock>
      Mitral regurgitation is the second most common manifestation of valvular heart disease in
      adults. Surgical reconstruction is considered treatment of choice. For some patients the
      surgical risk is to high an operation is refused. For those Patients the MitraClip system
      (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, CA, USA) offers a much less invasive treatment option.
      Occurrence of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is one of the potential
      complications during this procedure. 1% of all patients have an acute stroke. The number of
      new ischemic lesions without clinical manifestations is much higher (up to 85%). The impact
      of these lesions on the global cognitive function is unclear. The aim of this study is to
      determine the frequency of cerebral embolisms related to predefined procedural intervals and
      postprocedural cerebral lesions using Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance
      imaging. Furthermore we want to study the correlation between cerebral embolisms seen as high
      intensity signals in transcranial duplex ultrasound and cerebral lesions seen in the cMRT.
      The results should build a basis for further studies that want to reduce the amount of
      cerebral lesions.

        All patients undergoing the MitraClip between April 2017 December 2019 procedure due to a
        severe mitral regurgitation will be enrolled in our study. All patients will be assigned to
        either a surgical procedure or the MitraClip-procedure by an interdisciplinary heart team
        according to current guidelines irrespective of this study.
