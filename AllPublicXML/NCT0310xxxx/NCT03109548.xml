      The purpose of the project is to associate pre-treatment pain sensitivity level, levels of
      pain catastrophizing and levels of The Subgroups for Targeted Treatment (STarT) Back
      Screening Tool in patients with acute low back pain and patients' progression after 12 weeks
      of treatment by general practitioners.

    <measure>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in the Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMDQ) is one of the most widely used questionnaires for back pain. The RMDQ is a self-administered disability questionnaire consisting of 24 questions. The questions are related specifically to physical functions likely to be affected by low back pain. Each item is qualified with the phrase &quot;because of my back pain&quot; to distinguish back pain disability from disability due to other causes. When completing the RMDQ, the respondents are asked to tick a statement if it applies to them on that particular day.</description>

    <measure>Predicting the Inception of Chronic Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Predicting the Inception of Chronic Pain (PICKUP) questionnaire focuses on pain (&quot;How much low back pain have you had during the past week?&quot;, 1 = none, 2 = very mild, 3 = mild, 4 = moderate, 5 = severe, 6 = very severe), radiating pain to the legs (&quot;Do you have leg pain?&quot; 0 = no, 1 = yes), compensability (&quot;Is your back pain compensable, e.g. through worker's compensation or third party insurance?&quot; 0 = no, 1 = yes), depression (&quot;How much have you been bothered by feeling depressed in the past week (0-10 scale)?&quot; 0 = not at all, 10 = extremely) and the subject's overall evaluation of the risk of chronic pain (&quot;In your view, how large is the risk that your current pain may become persistent (0-10 scale)?&quot; 0 = none, 10 = extreme).</description>

        The subjects will be recruited through general practitioners in The North Denmark Region.
        When a patient with low back pain reports to his/her general practitioner, the doctor will
        present the project to the patient, and in case the patient shows interest, the doctor asks
        him/her to contact the contact person of the study. Thus, the recruitment does not take
        place through advertisements, but through the normal patient flow in the general practice.
