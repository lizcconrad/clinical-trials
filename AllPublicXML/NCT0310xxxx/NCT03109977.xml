  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if an imaging agent called Zr-DFO-pertuzumab that finds
      HER2 proteins can be used to take pictures of HER2-positive cancer.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be monitored closely for evidence of adverse events, including vital signs before and after tracer administration. The day after tracer administration, a physician will screen for any side effects requiring treatment. If a severe adverse effect (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or 4) attributable to 89Zr-DFO-pertuzumab occurs in any patient, then further use of 89Zr-DFO-pertuzumab will be suspended and the protocol reviewed with the MSKCC Data Safety Monitoring Committee.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 years or greater

          -  Any biopsy proven HER2-positive malignancy. ASCO guidelines will be used to define
             HER2-positivity for breast cancer. Similar guidelines will be used for other cancer
             types as appropriate.

          -  At least one malignant lesion on CT, MR, or FDG PET/CT within 60 days of protocol
             enrollment

          -  ECOG performance of 0-2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Patients who cannot undergo PET/CT scanning because of weight limits. PET/CT scanners
             may not be able to function with patients over 450 pounds.
