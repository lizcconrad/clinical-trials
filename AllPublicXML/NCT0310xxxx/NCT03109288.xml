    <textblock>
      Background:

      In people with multiple sclerosis (MS), brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers
      indicate inflammation or disease. Researchers want to see if 4 drugs given alone or combined
      affect MS biomarkers. They want to see if a change in biomarker levels can predict which
      drugs a person with MS might respond to.

      Objective:

      To see if signs of inflammation in CSF help predict a person s response to different drugs.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 75 who:

      Are in protocol 09-N-0032

      Have progressive MS

      Can stand and walk a few steps

      Take an MS drug

      Design:

      Participants will be screened in protocol 09-N-0032.

      Participants will take 1 of the 4 study drugs. Researchers will call after 1 month to see how
      they are doing. Some will start a second drug. They may take each drug or combination for up
      to 18 months.

      Participants will have 2 visits a year for up to 6 years. Visits include:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and heart tests

      X-rays and scans

      Eye exam and tear collection

      Lumbar puncture: A needle inserted between back bones removes some CSF.

      Lymphocytapheresis: Blood is removed through a needle in one arm and run through a machine.
      The blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.

      A sensor on the forehead records blood flow and oxygen use.

      Participants may get a device for testing at home.

      Participants will stop taking the drugs if they have taken 2 drugs together for 18 months or
      if they do not do well on the drugs.

      Participants will be called 3 months later to see how they are doing.

      Objective

      Multiple inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms drive progression of disability in
      fully established multiple sclerosis (MS); therefore, it is unlikely that a single
      therapeutic agent will be curative. Analogous to cardiovascular diseases, effective
      treatments for evolved MS will likely require individualized combination therapies that
      target pathogenic processes active in the particular patient. Ability to reliably measure
      such pathogenic processes in living patients is a pre-requisite for a precision-medicine
      approach to MS. We identified and validated molecular diagnostic tests of MS and its
      progressive stage based on combinatorial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. These
      proteomic tests confirmed results from MS genetic susceptibility studies that selective
      dysregulation of adaptive immunity differentiates MS from healthy and other disease states
      and that this feature is identical between patients with relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and
      progressive (PMS) MS. Instead, PMS subjects have higher central nervous system (CNS) tissue
      damage and higher compartmentalization of immune responses to CNS tissue. We observed that
      FDA-approved disease modifying therapies (DMTs) only partially normalize biomarkers that
      differentiate MS from non-MS, consistent with long-term observations that these therapies are
      generally not curative. We also observed that biomarkers of dysregulated adaptive immunity,
      whether measured at the untreated stage or after treatment with DMTs, do not predict MS
      severity. This is again consistent with genetic data that MS-susceptibility alleles do not
      predict MS phenotype. Instead, statistical modeling of CSF biomarkers against measures of MS
      disease severity identified alternative processes, such as activation of myeloid lineage,
      endothelial cells, astrocytes and remodeling of extracellular matrix in the form of fibrosis
      to influence rate of progression of clinical disability. These processes are only marginally
      affected by present treatments and cannot be measured by current imaging techniques.
      Consequently, the objective of this protocol is: 1. To develop clinical trial methodology
      that allows economical screening of prospective therapeutic agents for their efficacy on
      biological processes related to MS disease severity using CSF biomarkers; 2. To develop
      knowledge base of intrathecal effects of current DMTs and novel treatments targeting varied
      mechanisms of MS progression; and 3. To establish and validate framework for development of
      effective combination therapies for MS via precision-medicine paradigm.

      Study population

      Patients with MS who continue to accumulate clinical disability while untreated (e.g. PMS
      subjects) or on FDA approved immunomodulatory therapies and are able to travel to NIH every 6
      months and undergo serial lumbar punctures (LP).

      Design

      The protocol has an adaptable workflow that allows simultaneous assessments of multiple
      therapeutic agents while maximizing potential therapeutic benefit to the studied subjects and
      providing knowledge necessary for rational development of future combination therapies for
      MS. To start with, we selected four agents, whose mechanism of action (MOA) have the
      potential to inhibit identified processes underlying MS disease severity. Patients will be
      assigned to one of the drugs that are not contra-indicated based on existing comorbidities
      and to which the patient has a therapeutic target (e.g. treatment that inhibits activation of
      myeloid lineage will be assigned only to patients who have elevated CSF biomarkers of myeloid
      lineage). Longitudinal measurements of CSF biomarkers will determine if the applied
      treatment(s) exert the desired pharmacodynamics (PD) effects in the intrathecal compartment.
      While those drugs that do not reproducibly effect CSF biomarkers will be dropped from further
      study (or will be tested in higher dose, if possible), drugs with measurable intrathecal PD
      activity will be combined to evaluate additive or synergistic effects. Safety, tolerability
      and pilot clinical/imaging efficacy data will evaluate surrogacy of the biomarkers and
      collect data for power analysis for future definitive trials. The increased understanding of
      biomarker biology will be utilized to derive process-specific combinatorial biomarkers and
      biomarker signatures predictive of clinical efficacy.

      Outcome measures

      Primary outcome will be the change in Combinatorial Weight adjusted dIsability ScalE
      (CombiWISE) progression at the end of monotherapy + combination therapy period in comparison
      to projected baseline disability progression. The acquired longitudinal data will be used for
      assessment of biomarker surrogacy, for identification and validation of PD markers for
      development of new therapeutic entities and for power analysis of future/definitive clinical
      trials.
