    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, single-site study at Saint Louis University will enroll
      approximately 40 subjects who are healthy, 18 to 49 years old. Subjects will be randomized in
      a 1:1 fashion to receive either licensed trivalent FluMist containing (2010-2011 season
      appropriate), or licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (2010-2011 season
      appropriate) so that approximately 20 subjects will be randomized to receive LAIV, and 20
      will receive TIV.

      This Phase IV, randomized, open-label, single-site study at Saint Louis University will
      enroll approximately 40 subjects who are healthy, 18 to 49 years old. Subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either licensed trivalent FluMist (2010-2011 season
      appropriate), or licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (2010-2011 season
      appropriate) so that approximately 20 subjects will be randomized to receive LAIV, and 20
      will receive TIV. Subjects will receive 1 dose of FluMist or TIV in the Center for Vaccine
      Development on Day 0 and will return to the site on days 7 and 45 to assess immunogenicity.
      Subjects will be asked to report any serious adverse events. Blood samples and nasal washes
      for assessment of immune responses will be obtained at three time points: on Day 0 prior to
      dosing with FluMist or TIV, and at visits conducted 7 and 45-51 days post vaccination. The
      study will be conducted just prior to and during the influenza season. Subjects will receive
      a single dose of FluMist or TIV administered as instructed per package insert. Two contacts
      will be made with subjects, either telephone calls or e-mail, to collect serious adverse
      events only, one at Days 28-35, and one at approximately Days 180-190 to conclude the
      subject's participation. The duration of each subject's participation is approximately 6
      months. The primary immune studies conducted with collected samples will include serum
      hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers, nasal wash influenza-specific secretory
      immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses, peripheral blood interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) ELISPOT assays
      and peripheral blood carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution/intracellular
      cytokine staining flow cytometric assays. In addition, frozen serum and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples will be used in exploratory assays to determine the kinetics
      and nature of innate responses and the detailed molecular signatures of memory T cells
      induced by LAIV and TIV vaccinations. Investigators will be performing genome-wide expression
      studies, but will not perform DNA sequencing and will not send anything other than coded
      samples outside of Saint Louis University.
