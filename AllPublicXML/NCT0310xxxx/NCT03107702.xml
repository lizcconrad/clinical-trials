    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgical procedures are associated with low short-term mortality and may be
      associated with long-term reductions in all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related
      mortality. This surgeries are major surgeries include risk of mortality still.

      Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal gland. Melatonin is an antioxidant,
      antinociceptive, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, anxiolytic, sedative and
      analgesic. Melatonin is neurohormone with the profile of a novel hypnotic-anesthetic agent.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the preoperative, perioperative and postoperative
      melatonin levels in bariatric surgery under general anesthesia and to investigate the
      relationship between melatonin level and analgesia requirement.

      Bariatric surgical procedures are associated with low short-term mortality and may be

      Melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal gland. Melatonin is an antioxidant,
      antinociceptive, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, anxiolytic, sedative and
      analgesic. Irregularity of melatonin secretion causes a sleep irregularities, psychosis in
      intensive care unit and some behavioral disorder. The hypnotic, antinociceptive, and
      anticonvulsant properties of melatonin endow this neurohormone with the profile of a novel
      hypnotic-anesthetic agent.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the preoperative, perioperative and postoperative
      melatonin levels in bariatric surgery under general anesthesia and to investigate the
