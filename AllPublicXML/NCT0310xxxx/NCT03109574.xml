      This is a prospective, multi-center health economic study in Canada. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either the study or control dialysis catheter. The primary
      objective is to evaluate resource utilization in Ontario related to hemodialysis catheter
      placement including tPA usage, catheter exchange rates, catheter patency, and missed dialysis
      days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is indicated for a dialysis catheter for the purpose of attaining long-term vascular
             access for hemodialysis. Long-term vascular access is defined by physician anticipated
             duration of hemodialysis for three months or longer.

          -  Is ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Is indicated to receive dialysis treatment at a location where dialysis treatment data
             will be accessible by the study team.

          -  Is able to comprehend and have signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) to participate
             in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has known or suspected presence of other device-related infection, bacteremia, or
             septicemia or has been treated with antibiotics for documented or suspected infection
             within prior 45 days.

          -  Is receiving prophylactic anti-coagulation or anti-platelet pharmacotherapy for the
             purpose of CVC patency (anti-coagulation or anti-platelet pharmacotherapy for
             therapeutic indications do not exclude the patient from the study).

          -  Has severe chronic obstructive lung disease.

          -  Had past radiation therapy at the prospective insertion site.

          -  Had previous episodes of venous thrombosis or vascular surgical procedures at the
             prospective insertion site.

          -  Has local tissue factors that will prevent proper device stabilization and/or access.

          -  Has a stent placed in the vessel where the catheter will be placed

          -  Is pregnant

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse in the past 12 months obtained from patient record
             and/or interview

          -  Subjects who weigh ≤ 30 kg.

          -  Has been previously enrolled in this clinical study, or is participating in another
             clinical study that is contraindicative to the treatment or outcomes of this
             investigation.
