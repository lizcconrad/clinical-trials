  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. It is caused by damage to
      the optic nerve between the back of the eye and the brain leading to progressive blindness.
      The cause is poorly understood but ageing, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and genetics
      are all likely to play a role. There is no cure for glaucoma but treatments are available
      which slow progression. Because vision cannot be restored once lost, early detection,
      monitoring and early treatment are all essential to preserve visual function.

      The condition is diagnosed using a combination of the appearance of the optic nerve on
      clinical examination or photograph and visual field testing (perimetry). Measurement of IOP
      and measurement of the thickness of the retinal layers at the back of the eye complement
      diagnostic decisions.

      The Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA) study does not
      include perimetry in the series of tests carried out on all participants but does include
      photography of the optic nerve, measurement of IOP and measurement of retinal thickness.
      Therefore we propose to invite back participants of the NICOLA study who have abnormal optic
      discs and high eye pressure to return for perimetry to confirm a diagnosis of glaucoma.
      Calling back participants for perimetry is essential to make the diagnosis not only for
      estimating prevalence but also for identifying participant's ill-health.

      The primary aim of this study is to quantify the number of participants in the NICOLA study
      who have glaucoma and report its risk factors. This will allow an estimate of the number of
      people in the whole of NI with glaucoma. We will also perform a series of novel tests using
      state-of-the-art technologies to assess if they are better than current tests at diagnosing
      glaucoma. This may enable better informed decisions about policy decisions in eyecare.

      Purpose and design: This study will answer the following research questions:

        1. What is the prevalence of glaucoma within the NICOLA cohort and which systemic and
           socioeconomic factors influence its prevalence?

        2. What is the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of Retinal Nerve Fibre
           Layer (RNFL) thickness measurements in the diagnosis of glaucoma?

        3. What is the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of macular thickness
           analysis in the diagnosis of glaucoma?

        4. What is the agreement between intraocular pressure measurement by Ocular Response
           Analyser (ORA) and Goldmann tonometry?

        5. What is the correlation between structural (circumpapillary RNFL or macular Ganglion
           Cell Complex thickness) or functional measurements (retinal oximetry or perimetry) and
           Optical Coherence Tomography angiography parameters (% vessel density and vessel
           calibre) in the assessment of glaucoma?
