  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder characterized by a symptom triad
      consisting on: tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia . To these symptoms it is often added
      postural alteration that can stand in two different attitudes, such as the camptocormia and
      the syndrome of Pisa . Progressing in its evolution, PD becomes increasingly disabling,
      making it difficult or even impossible daily activities such as washing or dressing.The
      abnormal posture, with alteration of the limbs, the neck and trunk, is a recurring feature in
      PD, with a frequency of about 30%. Between 2% and 12.3% are more severe abnormalities such as
      camptocormia, the syndrome of Pisa and the anterocollis. Several studies disease plug in
      Neuromuscular Taping technique (NMT) among rehabilitative tools in degenerative neurological
      syndromes.

      To the best of our knowledge, no applications were found in PD. Therefore, the current study
      was designed to evaluate quantitatively the effects of the NMT intervention on the trunk
      kinematics during standing position. More specifically, this study aims to compare the trunk
      kinematic variables of patients with PD who were treated with effective NMT versus those of
      the subjects who received only the pharmacological treatment.
