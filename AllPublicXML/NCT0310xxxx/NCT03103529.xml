    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that activity immediately following concussion is detrimental to
      recovery and may lead to long term impairments. The animal model has shown that exercise too
      soon can lead to neurometabolic energy imbalances within the brain. However, there is also
      evidence to suggest that prolonged inactivity has negative consequences that may contribute
      to prolongation of symptoms. Determining the ideal timeframe in which to initiate an active
      rehabilitation protocol for patients who are slow to recovery is an important factor in
      concussion management.
