  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On a daily basis many (prematurely born) newborn are subjected to different urine collecting
      techniques to study biochemical abnormalities. Neonatology nurses and pediatricians are
      looking for a better and less invasive manner to collect urine in these vulnerable patients.
      We hypothesise that the urine collecting device as presented in this protocol is less
      invasive and has good functional abilities to collect urine in these newborns

      Objective of the study:

      Clinical feasibility of the urine collection device, indicated by staff and parents.

      Study design:

      The study will be an open label, clinical feasibility study, of the urine collection device.
      During a period of 6 months, 30 feasibility tests will be performed.

      Study population:

      Prematurely born newborns, admitted to the neonatology unit of the department of pediatrics
      at Rijnstate Hospital Arnhem.
