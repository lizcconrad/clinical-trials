  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of investigational drug nivolumab in
      combination with either gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy, or in combination with another
      investigational agent ipilimumab in patients with advanced unresectable biliary tract cancer.

      Gemcitabine/cisplatin is the standard of care treatment for biliary tract cancer.

      Nivolumab and ipilimumab are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by encouraging the
      body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells. Nivolumab (Opdivo) is FDA approved for
      the treatment of several cancers including metastatic melanoma, advanced lung, kidney, head &amp;
      neck and bladder cancer. The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (Yervoy) is FDA approved
      for metastatic melanoma.

          -  Patients must have a pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract

             for curative resection, transplantation, or ablative therapies.

          -  Patients may have received prior radiation, chemoembolization, radioembolization or
             other local ablative therapies or hepatic resection if completed ≥ 4 weeks prior to

          -  Patients must have radiographically measurable disease in at least one site not
             previously treated with radiation or liver directed therapy (including bland, chemo-
             or radio-embolization, or ablation) either within the liver or in a metastatic site.

             permitted to enroll.

          -  Participants with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids
             (&gt;10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
