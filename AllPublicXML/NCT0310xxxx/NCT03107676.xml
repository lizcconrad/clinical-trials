  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      College students from physical therapy department will be assigned into four groups.
      Participants will be tested for trunk extensors endurance and will be given endurance
      training program to do at home for 6 to 8 weeks. Spinal mobility and lower extremity mobility
      will be measured. Isokinetic outcome measures for extension and flexion at two different
      speeds will also be measured at baseline, after 6 and 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Active physical therapy students who are healthy and free from any significant pain at the
      spine will be recruited to participate in intervention endurance training. Participants will
      be assigned into four equal groups; doing trunk extension form lying on stomach while
      breathing normally and arching trunk backwards as long as tolerated. Group one will have arms
      above head, group two will have hands behind head, group three will have hands parallel to
      the trunk, and group four will receive instructions only and will act as control group.
      Spinal mobility of forward bending, backwards bending, right and left side bending will be
      taken. Straight leg raising and quadriceps flexibility will also be taken. Isokinetic
      measurements including peak torque, peak torque/body weight, average peak torque, work and
      average power will be taken at baseline, 6 and 8 weeks. Participants will have a training
      volume of 2 sets of 10 repetitions, 2 minutes rest in between, 2x/day for 6 to 8 weeks.
      Endurance timing will be measured in seconds using stop watch. If participant managed to
      maintain the trunk extension position for 4 minutes, time is recorded and it is considered as
      ceiling time.
