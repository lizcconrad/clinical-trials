  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PHASTT Study is focused on understanding of facilitators and barriers to mHealth use
      among young Black men who have sex with men (MSM), and testing a novel mobile app to increase
      HIV/STI testing and PrEP uptake.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Sex Pro mobile application (app) being tested facilitates home HIV-testing, home sexually
      transmitted infection (STI) test self-collection, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake.
      The app integrates a personalized HIV risk assessment with home HIV and STI testing options
      for young, Black MSM.
