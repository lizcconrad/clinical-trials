  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects must be scheduled to undergo an orthopedic surgical procedure. Subjects in the
      non-control group must have previously received an MRI with MultiHance or ProHance with at
      least 1 month between the last administration and the scheduled surgery. Subjects who have
      never received MultiHance or ProHance or any other gadolinium agent will also be enrolled.
      Subjects must have a test of their kidney function (SCr) at the time of the last MRI
      examination or at the time of enrollment if they never received gadolinium.

      A sample of bone and skin will be collected from the scheduled surgery and tested for the
      amount of gadolinium. An additional sample of skin will be collected for testing the presence
      of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each subject enrolled will already be scheduled to undergo a hip, shoulder or knee
      replacement, limb amputations or other orthopedic surgical procedures and each subject
      enrolled in the non-control group will have retrospectively undergone one or more
      administrations of MultiHance or PROHANCE with the last dose administered at least 1 month
      before their scheduled surgery. In order to classify the subjects' renal status, the serum
      creatinine (SCr) value and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of last
      MRI with MultiHance or ProHance must be available and collected. The control subjects'
      documented SCr values will be collected prior to enrollment in the study.

      The bone and skin tissue sample(s) collected (during the subjects surgery) will be blinded to
      gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure and sent to a central laboratory where they
      will be tested for gadolinium (Gd) and other analytes including calcium, phosphorous, sodium,
      iron, zinc, and potassium. The Gd deposition of the resected bone and skin tissue will be
      analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The bone and skin tissue
      will also be analyzed for other analytes using ICP-MS. These sample(s) will be stored at the
      central laboratory.

      A separate sample of the skin tissue collected (during the subjects' surgery) will also be
      sent to a central dermatopathologist who will be blinded to GBCA exposure and test for any
      possible NSF related abnormalities. These skin tissue sample(s) will be stored with the
      central dermatopathology laboratory.
