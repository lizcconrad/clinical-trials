  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-efficacy refers to the perceived belief to cope effectively, by personal efforts, with
      challenging situations and problems (Bandura, 1977). Basic research has shown that increases
      in perceived self-efficacy can enhance the extinction of fear (Zlomuzica et al., 2015). This
      study is aimed at translating these findings into a useful clinical application to augment
      exposure-based treatment outcome.

      In this study, the effects of self-efficacy enhancement on treatment outcome in patients with
      height phobia will be investigated.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: i) virtual reality
      exposure + self-efficacy enhancement; ii) virtual reality exposure + control intervention;
      iii) virtual reality exposure only. The amount of exposure is identical across groups (i.e.
      maximum of 1 hour of exposure). The self-efficacy and the control intervention involve the
      retrieval of the exposure session with or without a focus on personal mastery
      experiences/achievements, respectively.

      Treatment-induced changes as well as the effects of self-efficacy enhancement will be
      measured on the subjective level (i.e. in-vivo Behavioral Approach Tests, BATs; church
      tower), physiological level (heart rate during the BATs), and subjective level (subjective
      fear during the BATs as well as height-phobia related questionnaires) at each of the three
      assessments (i.e. pretreatment, after which the exposure will conducted on the same day, i.e.
      day 1; posttreatment, which is scheduled approximately 2-3 days after exposure, and follow-up
      assessment, which will take place 1-month after exposure).
