      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a
      single dose of a recombinant live-attenuated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine in
      RSV-seronegative infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.

      This study is a companion study to CIR 313.

    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      will evaluate the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSV
      D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII, a recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, in RSV-seronegative
      infants and children 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the
      D46/NS2/N/ΔM2-2-HindIII vaccine or placebo at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants will be enrolled in the study outside of RSV season, i.e., between April 1 and
      October 14 for most sites or—for sites with local RSV seasons that start earlier—as specified
      on a site-by-site basis in the MOP. All participants will remain on study until they complete
      the post-RSV season visit between April 1 and April 30 in the calendar year following
      enrollment. Participants' total study duration will be between 6 and 13 months, depending on
      when they enroll in the study. Participants will attend several study visits throughout the
      study, which may include physical examinations, blood collection, and nasal washes.
      Participants' parents or guardians will be contacted by study staff at various times during
      the study to monitor participants' health.
