  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if cobimetinib and atezolizumab can help to
      control advanced rare tumors. The safety of the drugs will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Atezolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of metastatic (has spread) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cobimetinib is
      FDA approved in combination with another drug called vemurafenib for the treatment of
      metastatic melanoma.

      It is investigational to use atezolizumab and cobimetinib to treat advanced rare tumors.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      You will take cobimetinib tablets by mouth 1 time a day on Days 1-21 of each cycle. Each dose
      should be taken at about the same time each day, with or without a meal. Do not crush, cut,
      or chew the tablets.

      On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive atezolizumab by vein over about 60 minutes.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest.
      You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable
      side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      It is expected that your participation in this study may last about 12 months.

      Your participation in this study will be over after follow-up.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, if not done within the previous 7 days:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for genetic research to learn how your DNA
           (genetic information) relates to your response to the study drugs, the disease, and your
           immune system.

      On Day 15 of all cycles, blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and
      genetic research.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and genetic research.

        -  During Cycles 2 and 3 only, urine will be collected for routine testing.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 5, 8, 11, and 15 and every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 19, 23, 27, and
      so on), you will have an ECHO or MUGA to check your heart function.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2 and every 3 cycles after that (Cycles 5, 8, 11, and so on), you will have
      an eye exam.

      Between Days 22-28 of Cycle 2, you will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing and to
      check the status of the disease.

      Every 8 weeks, you will have an MRI or CT scan.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      Within 2 weeks after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and genetic research.

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests

        -  You will have an ECHO or MUGA.

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan.

        -  If the disease appears to have gotten worse and the doctor thinks it is safe to do so,
           you will have a tumor biopsy for biomarker testing.

      Follow-Up:

      You will be contacted every 3 months to ask how you are doing. This may be done by phone or
      at a routine clinic visit. If you are called, it should last about 5-10 minutes. These calls
      will continue until the study closes, you withdraw from the study, or you can no longer be
      contacted.
