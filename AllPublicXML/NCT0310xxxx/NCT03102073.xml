      The &quot;Radner Reading Charts&quot; have been developed on the basis of the concept of &quot;sentence
      optotypes&quot; for the standardized examination of reading acuity and reading speed. Print sizes
      are logarithmically scaled (LogRAD) to permit statistical analysis, and the results obtained
      can be compared to other logarithmically scaled vision systems (e.g., LogMAR). To guarantee
      accurate, reproducible and standardized measurements of reading acuity and reading speed at
      every viewing distance, &quot;sentence optotypes&quot; have been created to minimize the variations
      between the test items and to keep the geometric proportions as constant as possible at all
      distances. Through interdisciplinary cooperation, a series of test sentences were developed
      that are highly comparable in terms of the number of words (14 words), as well as the word
      length, number of syllables, position of words, lexical difficulty and syntactical
      complexity. The most similar sentences were statistically selected for the Radner Reading
      Charts.

    <description>The A5 reading booklet is held by the subject
The subject is instructed to read sentence by sentence, by turning consecutively the pages of the booklet (on the first side is the number of sentence and the backward side contains the sentence)
The subject is instructed to read the sentences aloud as quickly and accurately as possible to the end, and to not correct reading errors.
One assessor is writing the reading time and records any reading errors on the scoring sheet while the second assessor is audio recording the operation
Stop criterion: reading time longer than 20 seconds or severe errors.</description>
