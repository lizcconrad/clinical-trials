      This cross-sectional study will try to give answers to the following project aims:

        -  To provide an overview of the prevalence of health products' use among Belgian pregnant
           women (prescription and OTC medication, vitamin supplements, phyto-therapeutics,
           dermatologic products), including where pregnant women buy or get their health products
           (online web survey).

        -  To document women's beliefs about medication during pregnancy and their information
           desire (online web survey).

        -  To determine the current vitamin status among pregnant women and to reveal clinical
           targets for supplementing deficiencies in this population (blood sample analysis).

      The study will be performed at the obstetrics department of the University Hospitals of
      Leuven (campus Gasthuisberg).

      We aim to include 300 pregnant women (100 per trimester), of which 150 women will be asked to
      determine their vitamin status (50 per trimester).
