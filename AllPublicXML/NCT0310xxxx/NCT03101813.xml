  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Doctors and other medical scientists want learn about the biology of DIPG and to develop
      better ways to diagnose and treat patients with DIPG. To do this, they need more information
      about the characteristics of DIPG tumors. Therefore, they want to establish a central
      location for clinical information and tumor tissue collected from DIPG patients.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To enroll patients diagnosed with DIPG in the International DIPG Registry and
           Repository.

        -  To provide a central location for clinical information, scans, and tissue samples from
           patients with DIPG enrolled in the registry.

        -  To collect tissue samples in order to study how DIPG works on the molecular level.
           Researchers may use the tissue samples to study molecules such as proteins and DNA.
           Proteins are needed for the body to function properly and DNA is the molecule that
           carries our genetic information. Other researchers will be able to use the stored
           samples in the future to learn more about DIPG. The information researchers get from the
           research studies will be kept in the registry along with the clinical information.

        -  To help DIPG investigators around the world to work together to make more consistent
           diagnosis and better design of future research studies. We hope this will lead to better
           treatments for DIPG in the future.

    <textblock>
      There are limited data regarding the biology of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG).
      This project provides the infrastructure for acquisition of biological specimens, imaging,
      and correlative clinical data to facilitate biology studies in this group of patients. The
      goal of the DIPG registry is to promote collaborations amongst investigators to allow timely
      data and/or specimen dissemination for future research studies and to develop classification
      systems, uniform standards of diagnosis, assessment and response, ultimately leading to the
      development of effective therapies for children with DIPG.

      This registry will collect clinical, demographic, radiological and pathological data and
      specimens (if available) from patients with DIPG, both prospectively (in newly diagnosed or
      currently living patients), as well as retrospectively (in patients who are deceased). Cases
      are identified through:

        1. Existing clinical and/or cancer registry databases

        2. Referrals from clinicians, surgeons, or pathologists

        3. Families initiating contact with Registry staff directly

      The following data/materials will be collected:

      Clinical: Demographic data, date of diagnosis, signs and symptoms at diagnosis, laboratory
      data, detailed treatment data (e.g. types and dates of surgeries (if any), chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy), best response to treatment, dates of progression, types of progression (local
      or metastatic), and follow-up data.

      Imaging: All radiographic imaging obtained since diagnosis will be requested at the time of
      study entry.

      Pathology Central Review: If glass slides (stained or unstained) or paraffin blocks of tumor
      tissue (from biopsy or autopsy) are available, they will be requested at the time of registry
      entry but are not mandatory for enrollment.

      Bioinfomatics repository: Collection of existing molecular and/or genomic data or analysis
      that has been performed as well as prospective analysis of tissue from the registry will be
      submitted to a central bioinformatics repository and may be linked to clinical data housed in
      the DIPG registry.

      Tissue Collection and Storage for Future Research: If available, participants' frozen tissue
      may be submitted for banking and future research.

      Data stored in the Registry may be used to provide statistical data for scientific
      presentations and for preparation of peer-reviewed manuscripts. No personal data can be
      traced to the study manuscripts or presentations. Data and specimens will be released for
      research proposals upon approval from the International DIPG Registry Committee.

      The International DIPG Registry and Repository is not associated with any oncology group
      cooperative study or treatment trial.
