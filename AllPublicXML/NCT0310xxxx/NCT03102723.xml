  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There remains a clinical need to improve health outcomes in patients with ischemic heart
      disease (IHD) the leading cause of death and disability in Singapore and worldwide. One
      neglected therapeutic target is 'myocardial reperfusion injury' in ST-segment elevation
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PPCI). This results in microvascular obstruction (MVO) and cardiomyocyte death and
      contributes upto 50% of the final myocardial infarct (MI) size. Cangrelor, a potent
      intravenous platelet P2Y12 inhibitor with rapid onset and offset of action, has been
      demonstrated in experimental animal studies to reduce MI size when administered prior to
      reperfusion. Whether Cangrelor given together with Ticagrelor would be more effective at
      reducing MI size in STEMI patients treated by PPCI is not known and is investigated in the
      Platelet Inhibition to Target Reperfusion Injury (PITRI) trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PITRI proof-of-concept clinical trial will randomise 210 STEMI patients to receive either
      Cangrelor (single intravenous bolus followed by a 120-minute infusion) or matching
      normal/saline placebo, initiated prior to PPCI on top of conventional oral dual antiplatelet
      therapy (Aspirin + Ticagrelor).

      The primary endpoint will be acute MI size by cardiac MRI at day 3. Secondary endpoints will
      include incidence and extent of MVO by cardiac MRI; and chronic MI size, left ventricular
      size and ejection fraction by cardiac MRI at 6 months.
