  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the rate of post-operative trachomatous
      trichiasis differs significantly between bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery with an incision
      height of 3mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation surgery with an incision height of 5 mm, and Trabut
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this trial the investigators will randomize 3,972 individuals with previously unoperated
      trichiasis on a 1:1:1 basis to bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision
      height of 3mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision height of 5mm,
      or Trabut surgery. Participants will receive trichiasis surgery then will be followed at 2
      weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 months after surgery. The primary outcome is development of
      post-operative trachomatous trichiasis (PTT) within 12 months after surgery. Logistic
      regression analyses will be performed to compare the rates of PTT in the 3 versus 5 mm
      incision BLTR groups, in the 3 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, and in the 5 mm BLTR versus
      Trabut group, adjusting for demographic characteristics and pre-operative trichiasis
      severity.

    <description>Presence of post-operative trichiasis is defined as 1+ trichiatic eyelashes or evidence of recent epilation. Any eyelashes touching the eye with the eye in primary gaze are considered to be trichiatic. Outcomes will be evaluated at 6 weeks and 12 months. The first date of post-operative trichiasis will be used as the outcome.</description>

    <description>Severity of post-operative trichiasis will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on number of eyelashes touching globe and number of eyelashes epilated.
Definitions for trichiasis severity are: Mild: 1-4 Eyelashes touching globe, no epilation OR 1-10 Eyelashes epilated, no eyelashes touching globe; Moderate: 5-9 Eyelashes touching globe, no epilation OR 1-4 Eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated; Severe: 5-9 Eyelashes touching globe and 1-10 eyelashes epilated OR 10+ Eyelashes touching globe, regardless of epilation status OR 11-20 Eyelashes epilated, regardless of eyelashes touching globe OR Entire eyelid epilated</description>

    <measure>Number of Eyes with Presence of Eyelid Contour Abnormalities at 6 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will grade the presence of abnormality using a standardized definition. The field grade will serve as the primary grade for this measure. Presence or absence of eyelid contour abnormalities will be based on field gradings of mild, moderate, and severe abnormalities. Mild will be combined with &quot;no abnormality&quot; and moderate and severe will be combined to form the &quot;moderate/severe contour abnormality&quot; group.
Definitions for abnormality are: Mild: Vertical deviation from the natural contour, 1 mm in height (less than half the pupil height in daylight) and affecting 1/3 of horizontal eyelid length; Moderate: Vertical deviation from the natural contour 1-2 mm in height (about the pupil height in daylight) or affecting 1/3-2/3 of horizontal eyelid length; Severe: Vertical deviation from the natural contour 2 mm in height (more than the pupil height in daylight) or a defect &gt;2/3 of the horizontal eyelid length</description>
