  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boston Medical Center provides care to cancer patients on oral cancer medications through the
      use of Boston Medical Center Specialty Pharmacy (BMC SP). The use of oral medications in
      cancer treatments is relatively new and unfortunately, very little is known about adherence
      in cancer patients. This study will evaluate the influence of a pharmacist-driven medication
      management program on adherence and persistence rates. Boston Medical Center's Specialty
      Pharmacy Adherence Program (B-SPAP), will utilize a high-touch counseling model involving
      clinical pharmacist that will focus on educating patients about their oral cancer treatments.
      The program will require face-to-face counseling with a pharmacist, through the use of a
      proven patient teaching tool, prior to initiating treatment with oral oncolytic treatments
      and, periodically thereafter, based on protocol. This study will help improve our
      understanding of the role of the pharmacist in cancer patients. In addition, the study will
      help identify independent factors that may contribute or impact adherence. The outcomes of
      this program will be compared to a historical control group of patients that have already
      received treatment for their cancer through the BMC Specialty Pharmacy.

      Boston Medical Center's Specialty Pharmacy Adherence Program (B-SPAP) will focus on improving
      adherence and persistence through the implementation of a high-touch program. In order to be
      eligible for the program, patients must be initiated on oral chemotherapy or targeted therapy
      with a life expectancy &gt;6 months. All patients will be administered a Patient Activation
      Measure (PAM) 13 survey prior to consultation. Patients eligible for our program will receive
      a 30-60 minute pharmacist consultation prior to initiation of treatment. The pharmacy
      consultation includes, but is not limited to the dissemination of medical information
      utilizing a standardized counseling checklist, supplying of patient education materials,
      pharmacist-led interventions, and/or the use of other materials or devices that may improve
      patient adherence. All counseling checklists and monitoring will be standardized and approved
      by a multidisciplinary oncology team. At week 1, 2, and 4, patients will be contacted by the
      pharmacist for an assessment of treatment goals; monthly contacts will continue thereafter by
      either a specialty pharmacist or certified pharmacy technician. Scheduled follow up visits
      with the consulting pharmacist will be made at months 3, 6 and 12. Prior to the scheduled
      pharmacist consultation, patients will be administered the PAM 13 survey. Patients with a
      treatment gap &gt;37 days will be referred to the consulting pharmacist for follow up. The
      consulting pharmacist will attempt to contact the patient via telephone for an assessment of
      adherence and adverse drug-related events. If patients experience a treatment gap &gt;45, then
      the patient will be contacted and scheduled for a pharmacist consultation, additionally, the
      prescribing provider will be notified. All consultations and interventions will be documented
      in the hospital's electronic medical record system, EPICÂ®.
