  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia commonly complicates stroke and has a profound impact on clinical outcomes.
      Accurate and timely diagnosis of pneumonia complicating stroke remains a major challenge as
      several issues potentially confound diagnosis. Chest X-ray (CXR), a central component in the
      diagnostic work-up, may have limited utility in the early stages as they are often of
      suboptimal quality, and infrequently confirm typical diagnostic infiltrates. Blood biomarkers
      of the stress-immune response have received considerable attention, but interpretation has
      been limited by differing methodologies, including definition of pneumonia. Bacterial
      organisms in the oral cavity may also be of relevance as biomarkers of post-stroke pneumonia.
      Major challenges facing frontline clinicians are therefore whether to initiate antibiotics;
      if so, when and for how long. These issues have antibiotic stewardship implications for
      clinicians in terms of potential for under-treatment or over-treatment with antibiotics based
      on CXR appearances.

      Pulmonary Computed Tomography (CT) could be of value as a radiological reference standard
      when pneumonia is suspected after stroke, and enable more rigorous evaluation of the
      diagnostic performance of CXR (and other candidate biomarkers) to inform decision-making when
      pneumonia is suspected.

      The overall primary aim is therefore to investigate the feasibility and reliability of using
      pulmonary CT as a radiological reference standard for evaluating suspected pneumonia
      complicating stroke. The secondary aims are to explore the diagnostic accuracy of CXR and
      blood biomarkers (index tests) when pneumonia is suspected during hospital admission after
      stroke using pulmonary CT as a reference standard.

    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is a frequent complication of stroke, particularly within the first few days. The
      risk of pneumonia is increased in patients who are older, have a more severe stroke and in
      those who have swallowing problems as a result of their stroke. Patients who develop
      pneumonia have a higher risk of death and longer hospital stay. The diagnosis of pneumonia is
      not always easy, but it is important to identify pneumonia early in order to begin the most
      appropriate treatment in a timely fashion and avoid giving antibiotics unnecessarily. Chest
      x-ray, the standard test undertaken when pneumonia is suspected, infrequently shows changes
      and is of limited value.

      Pulmonary Computed Tomography (CT) scans can be used to image the lungs in more detail than a
      standard chest xray. The Investigators plan to assess if it is feasible to perform pulmonary
      CT imaging in stroke patients within 48 hours of symptoms and who may be acutely unwell. The
      Investigators will also investigate how reliable CT is at diagnosing pneumonia by asking
      different x-ray doctors to review the scans. Comparing the result of the pulmonary CT imaging
      to the chest x-ray will allow assessment of their utility for the diagnosis of pneumonia. The
      Investigators will also record whether the CT informs clinical management e.g. stopping
      antibiotics if pneumonia is excluded.

      Blood samples will be collected for measurement of inflammatory markers and mouth swabs will
      measure types of bacteria. The analysis will be conducted at Salford Royal NHS Foundation
      Trust (SRFT) and using new cutting-edge techniques performed by collaborators at ThermoFisher
      and Manchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research. The Investigators will assess
      how useful these inflammatory proteins are in pneumonia diagnosis compared to the pulmonary
      CT scans. This research will help the Investigating team design larger studies to diagnose
      pneumonia earlier and more accurately, enabling more effective use of antibiotics.
