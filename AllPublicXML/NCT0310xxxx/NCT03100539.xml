  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the modest effectiveness of current treatments and the burden chronic neck pain places
      on Veterans, the investigators' research proposal is significant in several regards. First,
      Trial Outcomes for Massage: Caregiver-Assisted vs. Therapist-Treated (TOMCATT) Study directly
      addresses a high priority area for the VA and is well aligned with the VHA Pain Management
      Strategy and VHA Pain Management Directive 2009-053. Second, because previous massage studies
      have included relatively small sample sizes, this trial will provide information vital to
      fill an evidence vacuum regarding effectiveness of two different massage treatments for
      chronic neck pain. Third, TOMCATT will extend the current understanding of
      non-pharmacological treatments. Fourth, if the study hypotheses are corroborated massage may
      emerge as an effective, safe, affordable, sustainable, and accessible treatment for Veterans.

      Background: Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability in the US, after back pain,
      depression, and joint pain, and accounts for more than 10 million medical visits per year.
      Conventional treatments (medications, physical therapy) are widely used for chronic neck
      pain, yet have modest effectiveness and may carry risks, such as the toxicities associated
      with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. As a result many patients
      live with chronic, often debilitating, pain. Patients unable to find relief frequently turn
      to complementary health approaches. Complementary therapies are exceptionally popular among
      Veterans; 82% reported use of at least one complementary therapy and nearly all (99%) were
      willing to try massage for pain relief. Neck pain is the second most common reason for using
      a complementary therapy, with massage used for neck pain more commonly than all other
      complementary therapies except chiropractic care. Of all complementary approaches, massage
      was the most preferred by Veterans. In a national survey, almost two-thirds (61%) of
      individuals with neck pain who used both complementary and conventional treatments perceived
      complementary to be more helpful, whereas only 6% perceived conventional treatments to be
      better.

      Objectives: The Trial Outcomes for Massage: Caregiver-Assisted vs. Therapist-Treated
      (TOMCATT) Study is a 3-arm, parallel group, randomized clinical trial that will last 6
      months. The TOMCATT Study will target 468 Veterans with chronic neck pain and will compare
      caregiver-assisted massage and therapist-treated massage to a waitlist control arm on
      primary, secondary, and exploratory outcomes.

      Methods: This study sample will include 468 Veterans with chronic neck pain. Patients from
      the 5 primary care clinics at the Roudebush VA Medical Center (RVAMC) and 3 community based
      outpatient clinics (Terre Haute, Martinsville, and Bloomington) will be recruited to
      participate. The Trial Outcomes for Massage: Caregiver-Assisted vs. Therapist-Treated
      (TOMCATT) Study will be a 3-arm, parallel group, randomized clinical trial. Eligible
      participants will be randomized to one of three study arms: 1) The caregiver-assisted (CA-M)
      arm will involve a standardized 3-month, massage routine; and 2) Patients in the
      therapist-treated arm will receive 3 months of twice weekly massage delivered by certified
      massage therapists. The third and comparator arm will be a waitlist control. The trial will
      last 6 months and compare caregiver-assisted and therapist-delivered massage to control on
      neck pain outcomes. The investigators will compare changes in pain-related disability
      (primary outcome) between the three groups (Aim 1) and examine secondary outcomes: pain
      severity, quality of life, depression, anxiety, and stress (Aim 2) as well as exploratory
      outcomes. To examine the implementation potential of both interventions, including
      facilitators and barriers, the investigators will conduct post-study, in-depth qualitative
      interviews of a subsample of study participants (Veteran patients and caregivers) from both
      massage groups (Aim 3). Lastly, the investigators will assess treatment fidelity and compare
      the relative intervention costs and budget impact for both interventions. The intervention
      period will last for 3 months, after which time Veterans will be followed for an additional 3
      months.

      Innovation: The TOMCATT Study is a novel extension of the investigators' prior work, has
      strong implementation potential, and innovates by placing caregivers in a treatment delivery
      role that has the potential to reach a greater number of Veterans with chronic neck pain
      while also producing substantial cost-savings. Although studies have shown that massage is
      effective for pain, caregiver-delivered strategies have not been tested or implemented in any
      systematic way across VA.

    <description>The NDI is the standard instrument for measuring self-rated disability due to neck pain. The NDI was developed as a modification of the well-validated Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. The NDI consists of 10-items that assess pain and functioning. All items are framed as a &quot;problem right now&quot; and are scored on a 6-point numeric rating scores of 0 to 5, with 5 being &quot;worst.&quot; The total score ranges from 0 to 50, with higher scores representing greater disability from chronic neck pain. The NDI has strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.80) and construct validity. Scoring of the NDI involves: 1) summing the score for each item (raw score); or 2) raw score can be multiplied by 2 to produce a percentage score. The following scoring intervals aid interpretation: 0 - 4 = no disability; 5 - 14 = mild; 15 - 24 = moderate; 25 - 34 = severe; and &gt; 34 = complete disability. At least a 5-point change is defined as &quot;clinically meaningful.&quot;</description>
