    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, prospective, observational study designed to subjects
      presenting with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndromes requiring treatment of de
      novo lesions.

      Eligible subjects will have BVS scaffold implant using a high pressure post-scaffold
      implantation ballooning, designed to specifically address the issue of incomplete BVS
      expansion. OCT ( optical coherence tomography ) will be used to evaluate the change in the
      intraluminal scaffold volume and the prevalence of scaffold embedding from post-scaffold
      implantation to post-dilation high pressure (16-20 atm), non-compliant ballooning in relation
      to the underlying plaque.

      This study is a single-center, prospective, observational study designed to enroll 50
      subjects presenting with stable angina pectoris or acute coronary syndromes requiring
      treatment of de novo lesions. Consented subjects are to undergo PCI and have a lesion without
      angiographic calcification.

      Eligible subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria for BVS scaffold implant will
      have a BVS-specific implantation protocol with high pressure post-scaffold implantation
      ballooning, designed to specifically address the issue of incomplete BVS expansion. Because
      the scaffold is compliant, a perfectly embedded scaffold is sometimes observed in a lesion
      with soft plaque, resulting in a smaller intra-luminal scaffold volume that may reduce the
      event rate. Enrolled subjects will have OCT ( optical coherence tomography ) pre and post BVS
      implantation to assess the change in the intraluminal scaffold volume and the prevalence of
      scaffold embedding from post-scaffold implantation (using the moderate pressure of 12 atm) to
      post-dilation high pressure (16-20 atm), non-compliant ballooning in relation to the
      underlying plaque.

    <description>Percentage of embedded scaffold strut is defined as the ratio of the number of embedded strut to the total number of analyzed strut per lesion. (% of embedded scaffold struts = No. of embedded struts / total No. of analyzed struts) The analysis will be done for both OCT images 1) after initial bioresorbable scaffold implantation using moderate pressure and 2) after post-dilatation using high pressure non-compliant balloon, and the change in percentage of embedded scaffold strut from initial bioresorbable scaffold implantation to post-dilation will be calculated.
