      This pilot clinical trial studies how will metformin hydrochloride works in mitigating the
      side effects of radioactive iodine treatment in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer.
      Metformin hydrochloride may reduce the metabolic activity of cancer cell and of surrounding
      supportive tissues.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if treatment with metformin hydrochloride (metformin) inhibits radioactive
      iodine (RAI)-induced myelosuppression and induces faster recovery of white blood cell count
      to baseline values, the blood counts will be compared in the pre- and post-treatment samples.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety and tolerability of metformin treatment in subjects undergoing RAI treatment
      for differentiated thyroid cancer.

      II. To determine the effect of metformin treatment on symptoms of xerostomia, xerophthalmia
      and dysgeusia as assessed by the Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ), the modified Vanderbilt Head
      and Neck Cancer Symposium Survey (version 2.0), University of Washington Quality of Life
      Questionnaire, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire (EORTCQLQ)-Head and Neck (H&amp;N)35.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer who have undergone total or
             near-total thyroidectomy and are candidates for iodine I-131 (I-131) treatment at
             Thomas Jefferson University Hospital (TJUH) are eligible to participate

          -  Subjects must be diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer

          -  Patients must have previously undergone or plan to undergo thyroidectomy; for those
             patients who have previously undergone surgery, pre-operative labs, including complete

             done as part of pre-admission testing prior to surgery (within 14 days of study
             enrollment).

          -  All subjects must be able to comprehend and sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have received iodinated contrast dye. Metformin treatment can be started
             the day after subjects complete iodinated contrast treatment. If a CT scan with
             contrast is scheduled after screening and consent, the metformin treatment should be
             stopped the day before iodinated contrast administration. Metformin can be resumed on
             the day after last iodinated contrast was administered to the subject.

          -  Patients with history of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease and abnormal liver
             function tests (previously documented alanine aminotransferase greater than 40 IU/dL
             and/or plasma aspartate aminotransferase greater than 45 IU/d); patients who have a
             history of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease but whose most recent liver function
             tests have been documented as normal will be eligible to participate

          -  Patients with plasma creatinine level greater than 1.3 mg/dL

          -  Patients with plasma alkaline phosphatase greater than 190 IU/dL

             defined in accordance with CDC definition as more than 8 drinks per week for women and
             more than 15 drinks per week for men. A standard drink contains .6 ounces of pure
             alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in 12-ounces of beer,
             8-ounces of malt liquor, 5-ounces of wine, 1.5-ounces or a &quot;shot&quot; of 80-proof
             distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, or whiskey). While on study,
             patients should limit their alcohol consumption to no more than 8 drinks per week for
             women and no more than 15 drinks per week for men. Patients who feel they cannot
