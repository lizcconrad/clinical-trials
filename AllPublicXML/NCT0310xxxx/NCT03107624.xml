  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of preinfarction angina in AMI patients and test
      the hypothesis that different clinical presentations before AMI onset can affect coronary
      plaque morphologies in AMI patients .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with AMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention（PCI） and optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) examination is expected to be included in this study.Data about
      history were prospectively collected by a standard questionaire ,especially regarding the
      detail information about preinfarction angina.The basic clinical characteristics,angiographic
      and OCT findings are compared between patients with and without preinfarction angina.

    <description>Plaque rupture was defined by the presence of a cavity formation in the plaque with a discontinuity of the fibrous cap. TCFA was defined as a lipid-rich plaque with a thin fibrous cap thickness of ≤ 65 um.Thrombus was identified by OCT as an irregular mass ≧0.25 mm in diameter protruding into the vessel lumen or attached to the surface of the vessel wall.Culprit lesion features in patients with PIA show a lower incidence of plaque rupture and TCFA compared to those without PIA.</description>

    <description>Infarct size was measured as the peak cardiac troponin I (cTnI) level.PIA is associated with lower infarct size and lower in-hospital mortality.</description>
