  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical trial investigating the role of hyperspectral imaging in the management of patients
      undergoing standard clinical treatment for naive neovascular choroidal membranes in
      age-related macular degeneration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational trial of patients with choroidal neovascular membranes treated with Lucentis.
      Exploration and validation of a new form of retinal imaging called hyperspectral imaging.

      Inclusion: Patients meet eligibility criteria other than FFA diagnosis and who are diagnosed
      with suspected exudative CNV on the OCT. (n=100 eyes) Procedure: Monthly doses of Lucentis.
      OCT scans will be taken prior to each injection. HSI image taken at baseline and at the
      9-month time point.

      Time frame: 6 months recruitment + 12 months follow-up + 6 months analysis.

      All recruited patients will receive monthly doses of Lucentis as per the CMBS-approved
      protocol to allow comparison with other published studies. Lucentis will be administered in
      accordance with published standards of practice.

      OCT scans will be taken prior to each injection. HSI image will be taken at baseline, three
      months and 9-month time points

    <description>Patients recruited to the study will be patients who meet the Australian MBS criteria for treatment of exudative CNV with Lucentis. For the duration of the study, the patients will have standard induction and monthly dosing of Lucentis (Ranibizumab; intravitreal; 0.5 mg) to allow comparison with published studies. The only extra intervention for the study is the acquisition of hyperspectral mages with the hyperspectral camera and the acquisition of additional fundus autofluorescence images to the clinical norm.</description>
