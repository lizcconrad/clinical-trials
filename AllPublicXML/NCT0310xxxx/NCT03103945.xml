  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates peri-procedural results of the Niobe™ Remote Magnetic
      Navigation (RMN) ES system using the contact detection system (CDS) in patients undergoing
      standard of care radiofrequency ablation of cardiac arrhythmias.

      The objective of this observational study is to confirm system performance of the CDS and
      that it does not alter pacing, electrocardiograms, or mapping during RF ablation procedures.

    <description>Patients with cardiac arrhythmias will be undergoing RF ablation using the Niobe Remote Magnetic Navigation System with CDS as their standard of care. System performance data will only be collected during the RF ablation procedure. Outcome measures will be evaluated with the CDS connected and without the CDS connected within all patients.</description>

    <intervention_name>CDS box connection of the Niobe™ Remote Magnetic Navigation System</intervention_name>
    <description>For all subjects included in the study, the ablation procedure will be started per standard of care. First mapping, pacing and electrocardiograms of the right atrium will be evaluated without the CDS box connected. Second the CDS box will be connected to the catheter and mapping, pacing and electrocardiograms will be recorded again. Next, ablation will be conducted per standard of care.</description>
