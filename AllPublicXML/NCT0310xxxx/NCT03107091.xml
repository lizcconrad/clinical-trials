  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-dose continuous infusion of terlipressin will be administered to six cirrhotic patients
      with refractory ascites.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Terlipressin continuous infusion will be adminstered via an ambulatory pump initially for 7
      days in a clinical pharmacology unit. Serial blood draws for pharmacokinetic analysis will be
      performed to determine steady state concentration of both terlipressin and
      8-lysine-vasopressin during infusion. After establishing safety and tolerance of infusion for
      7 days, patients will be transitioned to an outpatient setting where they will be treated
      with terlipressin continuous infusion for an additional 21 days, monitored daily by home care
      nurses.

      A total of 6 patients will be treated. Monitoring will include successful management of
      ascites, with reduction in paracentesis procedures and decreased ascites fluid volume,
      further supported by improvement in renal function.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who required 3 or more large volume (4
             liters and more) paracenteses in the previous 60 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Ascites with causes other than cirrhosis such as nephrogenic ascites or malignant
             ascites due to peritoneal carcinomatosis

          -  Total bilirubin &gt; 5 mg/dL

             including acute viral hepatitis, drugs, medications (e.g., acetaminophen), or other
             toxins (e.g., mushroom [Amanita] poisoning)
