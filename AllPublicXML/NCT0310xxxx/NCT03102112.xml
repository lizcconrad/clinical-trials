  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are the most common and deadly primary brain tumors in adults. The clinical
      outcome of patients with glioblastoma depends on key molecular genetic alteration.
      Specifically, Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Gene Mutation, an independent favorable prognostic
      factor, serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers of glioma. Thus, accurate grading of a
      glioma is fundamental in order to determine the treatment strategy. Amide proton transfer
      (APT) imaging is a noninvasive molecular MRI technique based on chemical exchange saturation
      transfer mechanism that detects endogenous mobile proteins and peptides in biological
      tissues. Preliminary studies have shown that APT-weighted (APTw) signal intensity could serve
      as a new imaging biomarker, by revealing significantly higher signal intensities in the
      high-grade gliomas compared with the low-grade gliomas. The purpose of this study was to
      investigate the value of amide proton transfer imaging (APT) in the noninvasive evaluation of
      isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene status in glioma.

      Materials and Methods:

      The whole brain MRI examinations were performed on a 3.0-T MRI system (Discovery MR750,
      General Electric Medical System, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an eight-channel head coil (General
      Electric Medical System). Conventional MRI, contrast-enhanced MRI, DWI and amide proton
      transferimaging were performed in regular sequence during the same examination. Finally,
      contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin echo sequence was acquired in the transverse, sagittal,
      and coronal planes after intravenous administration of 0.01 mmol/kg gadodiamide (Omniscan; GE
      Healthcare, Co. Cork, Ireland).

      MRI data processing and image analysis:

      All data were transferred to a workstation (Advantage Workstation 4.6, General Electric
      Medical System, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) for processing.The MR imaging of all the patients
      were assessed independently by two experienced neuroradiologist (HYC and YLF, who have 12 and
      6 years of experience, respectively, in neurologic-oncologic imaging) who were blinded to the
      patient's information. Next, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn manually on the solid part
      of the tumor with the relatively higher signal intensity on APT image.

      Statistical analysis:

      Categorical data obtained from image were calculated using the Fisher's exact test.
      Quantitative data were denoted as the mean and standard deviation. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov
      (K-S) test was used to assess the normality of data distribution.APT-weighted (APTw) signal
      intensity were tested for differences between the IDH mutation and the IDH wild-type by using
      independent sample t test.
