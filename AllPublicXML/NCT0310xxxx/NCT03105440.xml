    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects and validate news physiotherapy techniques:
      robotic rehabilitation, virtual reality, vibration therapy, canoeing and hand cycling in the
      secondary clinical complications of the breast cancer, through the Biomedical
      Instrumentation. It will be realized the double-blind longitudinal clinical study. Will
      participate in the study 100 women post breast cancer surgery, the volunteers will be
      allocated in the respective modalities treatment; and 20 healthy volunteers, will be only the
      control group. The volunteers conducted 10 physiotherapy session, and it will be evaluated
      after, during and before of the treatment, to evaluated myoelectric activity, scapular and
      hand muscle strength, range of motion, circumference of the upper limbs and quality of life.
      Expected to Positive Results With regard to the minimization of pain intensity and
      lymphedema, favoring the improvement of range of motion of the shoulder joint, myoelectric
      activity, increased muscle strength, and consequently improves the quality of life.

      The brest cancer is considered a public health problem worldwide. In Brazil, there was
      increased survival due to advances in early diagnosis and the therapeutic approaches each
      more accurate and effective, however these women require care and attention for short and
      long time, due to the consequences physical and psychosocial, que undertake their quality of
      life. The innovative techniques physiotherapy treatment can contribute to the prevention and
      treatment of complications, with the intention to facilitate the early return of women to
      their daily activities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects and validate news
      physiotherapy techniques: robotic rehabilitation, virtual reality, vibration therapy,
      canoeing and hand cycling in the secondary clinical complications of the breast cancer,
      through the Biomedical Instrumentation. It will be realized the double-blind longitudinal
      clinical study. Will participate in the study 100 women post breast cancer surgery, the
      volunteers will be allocated in the respective modalities treatment; and 20 healthy
      volunteers, will be only the control group. The volunteers conducted 10 physiotherapy
      session, and it will be evaluated after, during and before of the treatment, to evaluated
      myoelectric activity, scapular and hand muscle strength, range of motion, circumference of
      the upper limbs and quality of life. Expected to Positive Results With regard to the
      minimization of pain intensity and lymphedema, favoring the improvement of range of motion of
      the shoulder joint, myoelectric activity, increased muscle strength, and consequently
      improves the quality of life.

    <description>The software used in this study was developed by the members of the Laboratory of Sensory and Motor Engineering Rehabilitation Together with Federal University of Uberlândia. This virtual reality of projection software, which uses Kinact®, captures the patient's picture and transfers to the monitor. The exercises provided by game are similar to those performed in conventional therapy; however, in a more entertaining form.
Comprised 8 exercises to upper limbs and trunk. The patient should reach the red circle until it becomes green.</description>
