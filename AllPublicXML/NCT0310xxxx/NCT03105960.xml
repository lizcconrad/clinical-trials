      the study about herbal mouth wash. it is clinical trial .the investigator will compare
      between chlorhexidine mouthwash and garlic with lime juice mouthwash.and show their effect on
      gingival bleeding and strepococcus bacteria present in saliva and plaque.

        1. Preparation of garlic with lime juice will occur under aseptic condition.and give it to
           the first group.

           provide chlorhexidine to the second group.

        2. Collection of plaque and saliva samples will be obtained from children who fulfilled the
           inclusion criteria.

        3. Asses gingival condition by asking patient.

        4. Subjects will be instructed to rinse for 14 days, twice daily.

        5. Morning after breakfast and night before going to bed.

        6. With 10 ml (undiluted) of the assigned mouthwash for 30 s and then expectorate the
           rinse.

        7. Again after 14 days, the saliva and plaque samples will be taken and inoculated on blood
           agar plates to determine the colony count and the gingival index by loe and illness will
           be assessed.

    <description>garlic with lime juice mouthwash is herbal antimicrobial .children were instructed to rinse for 14 days, twice daily, ,10 ml (undiluted) for 30 second and then expectorate .
To prepare garlic with lime mouth rinse, 100 g of fresh, washed garlic cloves was macerated in a sterile, ceramic mortar and water was added to obtain a homogenate which was then filtered off with a sterile muslin cloth. the final concentration of the solution was determined to be 1 g/100 ml. About 100 ml of lime juice was extracted from fresh lemons using a juice extractor and added to the garlic extract.</description>
