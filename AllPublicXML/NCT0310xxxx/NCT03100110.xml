  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals suffering from tetraplegia as a result of cervical spinal cord injury, brainstem
      stroke, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cannot independently perform tasks of daily
      living. In many cases, these conditions do not have effective therapies and the only
      intervention is the provision of assistive devices to increase independence and quality of
      life. However, currently available devices suffer from usability issues and are limiting for
      both the patient and caregiver. One of the most progressive alternative strategies for
      assistive devices is the use of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology to translate
      intention signals directly from sensors in the brain into computer or device action.
      Preclinical primate research and recent human clinical pilot studies have demonstrated
      success in restoring function to disabled individuals using sensors implanted directly in
      motor regions of the brain. Other preclinical primate research has demonstrated effective
      intention translation from sensors implemented in cognitive regions of the brain and that
      this information complements information from the motor regions. The current proposal seeks
      to build on these studies and to test the safety aspects related to implanting two sensors,
      each a microelectrode array, into both the motor and cognitive regions of the brain in motor
      impaired humans. Secondary objectives include feasibility evaluation of the complementary
      sensors in their ability to support effective assistive communication.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of most experimental sessions, the participant will have time to operate the NCC to control augmentative and assistive communication (AAC) technologies such as robotic arms or spellers. We will measure the percentage of allotted time that the participant spends operating each AAC technology, or choosing not to operate any AAC technology. The data will be aggregated across all AAC sessions with time allotted to AAC operation.</description>

    <measure>Information transfer rate (measured in bits per second) achieved by each participant calculated during closed-loop operation of the neuroprosthetic device, aggregated across trials within a task.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will perform repeated trials of experimental tasks designed to activate recorded brain regions. Task progression will be modulated by neuronal activity. Successful completion of the task will require volitional modulation of neuronal activity. Task performance will be quantified by the information transfer rate which is calculated from the number of bits of information communicated by each trial's selection(s) and the amount of time it took to complete a trial.</description>

    <measure>Coefficients of neuronal activity covariance matrix and their dependence on task performance.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuronal activity time series covary across neurons within a brain region and across brain regions. The degree of covariance will be recorded in the coefficients of the covariance matrix, scaled from -1 to +1. The covariance matrix will be recorded under different task conditions.</description>
