  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that incisional hernia incidence after laparotomy can be safely
      reduced with the addition of a mesh to the conventional closure of the abdominal wall. There
      still some debate about which is the best position to place this mesh: onlay or sublay. In
      Europe we have now meshes with CEE approval to be used as reinforcement of abdominal wall
      closure. The investigators have planned to include 200 patients in a multi center study using
      an onlay PDVF mesh that can be tracked by magnetic resonance. The patients included will be
      patients with risk factors for the development of an incisional hernia. The incidence of
      incisional hernia will be assessed clinically and radiologically after 1 and 2 years
      follow-up. The incidence of surgical sites occurrences and pain will be also assessed.
