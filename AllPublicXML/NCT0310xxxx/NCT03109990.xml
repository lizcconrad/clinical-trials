  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is widely used as an anaesthetic for general anesthesia during surgery.
      Previous studies in cells and animals show that dexmedetomidine may promote cancer growth.
      The purpose of present study is to examine whether utilization of dexmedetomidine in patients
      undergoing surgery for primary breast cancer increases breast cancer recurrence and
      metastasis, and to investigate its effects on the patients' immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia will
      be randomly allocated to dexmedetomidine group or control group. Patients from both groups
      will receive midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, remifentanil and CIS atracurium for total
      intravenous anesthesia. BIS value will be controlled between 40-60 during surgery. Patients
      of dexmedetomidine group will receive a loading does of 1ug/kg dexmedetomidine since 15 mins
      before induction, and receive another 1ug/kg of dexmedetomidine at a rate of 0.5ug/kg/h for 2
      continuous hours during surgery. Patients of control group will receive same amount of normal
      saline. Patients will be followed up for 36 months to measure the incidence of cancer
      recurrence and metastasis. Serum form patients of both groups will be collected at 24 h after
      surgery. The number of CD3+ , CD4+, CD8+ cells and NK cells in the serum will be compared
      between the two groups. Serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-12，IL-4 and VEGF will also be measured and
      compared.
