      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed.

               -  Male and female adult patient ≥ 18 years old.

               -  Patients with a diagnosis of persistent asthma (GINA 2016) for a period of at
                  least 1 year prior to Visit 1.

               -  Patients who have used medium or high dose ICS plus at least 1 controller for
                  asthma for at least 3 months and at stable dose and regimen for at least 4 weeks
                  prior to Visit 1.

               -  Patients must have ACQ-7 score ≥ 1.5 at Visits 2 and qualify for treatment with
                  high dose ICS/LABA

               -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of ≥ 50% and ≤ 85% of the predicted normal value for the
                  patient after withholding bronchodilators at Visit 2.

                  o Repeating is allowed once only. Repeating of percentage predicted FEV1 should
                  be done in an ad-hoc visit to be scheduled on a date that would provide
                  sufficient time to receive confirmation from the spirometry data central reviewer
                  of the validity of the assessment before Visit 99.

               -  Patients must demonstrate reversibility defined as an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12%
                  and 200 mL within 15 to 30 minutes after administration of 400 µg of salbutamol
                  at Visit 2. Spacer devices are permitted during reversibility testing only. The
                  Investigator or delegate may decide whether or not to use a spacer for the
                  reversibility testing.

                    -  If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2, patients may be permitted to
                       enter the study with historical evidence of reversibility that was performed
                       within 5 years prior to Visit 1.

                    -  Alternatively, patients may be permitted to enter the study with a
                       historical positive bronchoprovocation test (defined as a provoked fall in
                       FEV1 of 20% by bronchoconstriction agent e.g., methacholine, histamine) or
                       equivalent test (e.g., astography) that was performed within 5 years prior
                       to Visit 1.

                    -  If reversibility is not proven at Visit 2 and historical data is not
                       available, reversibility should be repeated once in an ad-hoc visit
                       scheduled as close as possible from the first attempt (but not on the same
                       day).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or
             hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6 weeks of Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have ever required intubation for a severe asthma attack/exacerbation.

          -  Patients who have a clinical condition which is likely to be worsened by ICS
             administration (e.g. glaucoma, cataract and fragility fractures) who are according to
             investigator's medical judgment at risk participating in the study.

          -  Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening as determined
             by investigator within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 or between Visit 1 and Visit 99.
             Patients may be re-screened 4 weeks after recovery from their respiratory tract
             infection or asthma worsening.

          -  Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma, including (but not
             limited to) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sarcoidosis, interstitial lung
             disease, cystic fibrosis, clinically significant bronchiectasis and active
             tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women

          -  Women of child-bearing potential unless they are using highly effective methods of
             contraception during dosing and for 30 days after stopping of investigational
             medication
