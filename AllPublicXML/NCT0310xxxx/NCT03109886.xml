  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this exploratory study is to test the safety and tolerability of milciclib
      when administered orally at 100 mg in patients with recurrent or metastatic Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma. The evaluation of the efficacy profile is a secondary objective of the study.
      Moreover, markers expression in tumor cells and plasma will be studied and described in
      association with the clinical outcome.

      Eligible patients will receive milciclib orally on a daily schedule for 4 consecutive days a
      week in a 4-week cycle (4 days on/3 days off x q4 wks) for a total of 12 weeks (i.e. 3
      cycles) unless patient refusal, consent withdrawal, Investigator's decision, unacceptable
      toxicity or death whichever occurs earlier.

      At the end of Cycle 3, treatment will be stopped, and based on the results of the tumor
      assessment performed on Day 90 (±3 days) from treatment start, patients will be followed as
      here below detailed:

        -  patients with Complete Response (CR)/Partial Response (PR)/Stable Disease (SD) will be
           followed for safety until 30 days from last dose intake (or until a new anticancer
           therapy starts, whichever occurs earlier) and will be assessed for efficacy in the
           follow-up period up to Day 180 from treatment start;

        -  patients with progressive disease will be followed only for safety until 30 days from
           last dose intake (or until a new anticancer therapy starts, whichever occurs earlier).

      After the completion of three cycles, patients who, in the Investigator's judgment, are
      benefiting from treatment with milciclib, will resume treatment and will remain on study up
      to Day 180 from treatment start, unless withdrawal criteria are met earlier.
