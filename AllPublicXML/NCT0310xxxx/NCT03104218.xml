    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), an electrostimulation technique known to
      modulate the motor cortex excitability, has been shown to enhance the effects of
      rehabilitation in populations with neurological injuries. tDCS could similarly be effective
      in individuals with rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, as this pathology is also associated with
      pain and motor control deficits. For the treatment of RC tendinopathy, sensorimotor training
      is effective to reduce pain, increase function and enhance motor control of the shoulder. The
      addition of tDCS during sensorimotor training could enhance motor learning associated with
      sensorimotor training and thus improve treatment outcome. PURPOSE: To compare, in terms of
      symptoms, functional limitations and shoulder control, a group receiving a rehabilitation
      program centered on sensorimotor training combined with tDCS to a group receiving the same
      rehabilitation program combined with sham tDCS in individuals with RC tendinopathy. METHODS:
      Forty adults with RC tendinopathy will take part in the 4 evaluation sessions (0, 3, 6, 12
      weeks) and a 6-week rehabilitation program. Outcome measures will be symptoms and functional
      limitations (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff
      index), as well as acromiohumeral distance ([AHD] ultrasonographic measurement at 0° and 60°
      of elevation arm). The rehabilitation program will include sensorimotor training,
      strengthening and education. tDCS will be apply during sensorimotor training on the motor
      cortex contralateral to the side of pain. A 2-way ANOVA will be used to analyse the effects
      of tDCS on the outcomes.

      BACKGROUND: tDCS is a safe and easy to use technique that has emerged as a promising tool to
      induce plasticity and to facilitate sensorimotor rehabilitation with potential application in
      various clinical populations. tDCS has been shown to induce changes that outlast the duration
      of the stimulation, by modulating neuronal membrane potential of the targeted brain region.
      Depending on the flow of current, tDCS can increase or decrease neuronal excitability; anodal
      tDCS induces membrane depolarization and enhanced excitability of cortical neurons, whereas
      cathodal tDCS induces membrane hyperpolarization and reduced excitability of cortical
      neurons. As such, tDCS has the potential to prime the plastic potential of a given brain
      region, making it more responsive to another intervention. For example, it has been shown
      that five days of anodal tDCS combined with training promotes motor skill acquisition still
      detectable three months later; an effect significantly superior to sham tDCS. These effects
      most likely are due to the augmentation of synaptic plasticity that requires the presence of
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

      Coupled with sensorimotor training, tDCS can lead to subsequent sustained clinical gains.The
      beneficial effects of tDCS combined with sensorimotor training to normalize motor cortical
      activity and to enhance rehabilitation have been shown in populations with neurological
      injuries, such a stroke. In musculoskeletal populations, anodal tDCS over M1 has also been
      shown to lead to significant pain level reduction. Evidence suggests that tDCS over M1 may
      relieve pain through inhibition of thalamic sensory neurons and disinhibition of neurons
      located in the periaqueductal gray matter. In these latter studies, tDCS was specifically
      aimed at reducing pain and was not coupled with sensorimotor training. In fact, evidence on
      the effect of tDCS coupled with sensorimotor training in musculoskeletal populations is
      scarce, and the effect of such intervention has never been evaluated in individuals with RC
      tendinopathy. Considering that RC tendinopathy is associated with impaired motor control and
      that pain can decrease the excitability of the motor cortex and impair motor learning, the
      investigators believe that it is relevant to determine whether tDCS can enhance sensorimotor
      training, and improve outcome.

      PURPOSE - The primary objective of this randomized control trial is to compare, in terms of
      symptoms and functional limitations, a group receiving a rehabilitation program centered on
      sensorimotor training combined with anodal tDCS to a group receiving the same rehabilitation
      program combined with sham tDCS in individuals with RC tendinopathy. A secondary objective is
      to explore the effects of these interventions on shoulder control and corticospinal
      excitability.

      METHODS - Study Design: This triple-blind (patients, therapist &amp; evaluator), parallel-group
      randomized control trial will include four evaluation sessions over 6 months (baseline, week
      3, week 6, 3-month) and a 6-week rehabilitation program.

      Interventions: Each participant will take part in the same 8-week rehabilitation program
      supervised by an independent physiotherapist. This program, previously shown effective,
      targets the deficits described in individuals with RC tendinopathy. It includes sensorimotor
      training, strengthening, and patient education. Each session lasts 40 minutes, with at least
      75% for sensorimotor training. The rest of the session is used to teach and revise home
      exercises. tDCS will be applied during sensorimotor training (30 min),but only during the
      first five sessions, as these sessions will be during the first phase of motor learning,
      characterized by considerable improvement in performance.

      Statistical Analyses - Descriptive statistics will be used for all outcome measures at each
      measurement time to summarise results. Baseline demographic data will be compared
      (independent t-test and Chi-squared tests) to establish the comparability of groups. All data
      will be tested to check the distributional assumptions for the inferential statistical
      analyses. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used in which all participants will be
      analysed in the group to which they were originally assigned. All dropouts and the reason for
      dropping out of the study will be reported. Any harm or unintended effects during the
      programs will be recorded. A 2-way ANOVA (2 tDCS [Real or Sham] x 4 Time [week 0, 3, 6, 12])
      will be used to analyse the effects of tDCS on primary outcome and secondary outcomes.

Thereafter, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups, and then take part in their assigned 6-week intervention.

    <masking_description>A randomisation list will be established prior to the initiation of the study using a random number generator. The randomisation list will be generated by an independent research assistant not involved in data collection. Allocation will be concealed in sealed and opaque envelopes that will be sequentially numbered. Randomisation will be stratified to ensure balance of the treatment groups with respect to sex. A blocked randomisation will also be used to make sure that two equal groups of 20 participants are obtained. Given that it is possible to blind the treating PT, the participants and the evaluators, a triple-blind design will be used. An independent research assistant from the CIRRIS will open the randomisation envelope indicating the participant's assignment. The research assistant will be blind to the baseline evaluation results. The research assistant will be the one who will set-up the parameters on the tDCS before treatment sessions with tDCS (real or sham tDCS).</masking_description>

    <time_frame>US measurement will be performed at week 0 and 6.</time_frame>
    <description>US measurement of supraspinatus tendon will be assessed. Supraspinatus tendon measures will be obtained with the transducer perpendicularly, one centimeter behind to the anterolateral aspect of the surface of the acromion. The thickness of the tendon borders will be defined inferiorly as the first hyperechoic region above the anechoic articular cartilage of the humeral head, and the hyperechoic superior border of the tendon before the anechoic subdeltoid bursa. Three measures will be taken, and the mean tendon thickness measured will be expressed as a percentage of the mean AHD at rest using the following formula: occupation ratio = [(tendon thickness/AHD) x 100].</description>

    <time_frame>Through first tDCS treatment of each participant.</time_frame>
    <description>Corticospinal excitability of the infraspinatus (IS) muscle will be acquired using a stimulator. Stimuli will be applied over grid sites spaced 1 cm apart and positioned over the upper limb area of primary motor cortex (M1). Prior to the experiment, subjects will be asked to perform two IS maximal voluntary contractions (MVC). Maximal value over the two trials will be used to compute electromyographic targets during experimental task. Corticospinal excitability will be evaluated during slight voluntary contraction.The optimal location for stimulation of IS will be determined (hotspot), as well as the active motor threshold (aMT) at this site. aMT will be determined as the minimal intensity of stimulation required to elicit motor evoked potential (MEP) larger than 150 μ Volts in at least 6 out of 12 trials at the hotspot for IS at 5% of MVC. Ten stimulations will be performed at the hotspot at 120% of the threshold for IS.</description>

    <time_frame>US measurement of AHD will be performed at week 0 and 6.</time_frame>
    <description>US measurement of AHD will be performed using an ultrasound scanner with a 7.5-12 Mhz linear array probe. The US measurement of AHD is defined as the tangential distance between the hyperechoic bony landmarks of the humeral head and the inferior edge of the acromion visible on the longitudinal sonogram. Measurement obtained represents the AHD at the anterior outlet of the subacromial space. Measurements will be taken in a sitting position with the arm at rest, and at 45° and 60° of active abduction. For each arm position, two measures will be taken, and the mean AHD will be calculated. These measures are highly reliable (ICC &gt; 0.90).</description>
