  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cadazolid has demonstrated activity against a bacteria named Clostridium difficile in animal
      studies. The results of a first study conducted in adult patients have suggested efficacy of
      the new antibiotic, cadazolid, in the treatment of diarrhea caused by this bacteria. This is
      the first study of cadazolid in children. The overall purpose of this study is to provide
      reassurance on the safety and efficacy of cadazolid in children suffering from infection due
      to Clostridium difficile.

      This multicenter, study will be run into two parts. Both parts will be run in consecutive age
      cohorts, starting from the oldest age categories(12 to &lt; 18 years old) to the youngest (birth
      to &lt; 3 months).

        -  Part A is an open-label, dose finding part to be conducted in at least 24 subjects.

        -  Part B follows a randomized, assessor-blinded, parallel-group design with vancomycin
           used as an active comparator. Part B will be conducted in about 176 children.

      In both parts, the treatment period will be 10 days and will be followed by a Follow-up
      period of 28-32 days.
