  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bile duct stones is a common biliary tract disease, which is characterized by high morbidity
      and frequent recurrence. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an
      effective therapy for common bile duct stones, and endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) which
      associated with recurrent cholangiolithiasis often carried out on difficult intubation or
      extracting stones, probably due to enhanced reflux of intestinal contents that changes the
      microenvironment. Patients with cholangiolithiasis were consecutively recruited and their
      bile was collected intra-operatively for high-throughput experiments. Pyrosequencing of 16S
      ribosomal RNA gene was performed to characterize the microbiota in the bile and other body
      fluids. A liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based method was used to profile bile
      composition. Clinical manifestation, microbiome, and bile composition were compared between
      patients with or without recurrent of bile duct stones. The aim of our study was to identify
      the impact of microbiomes on the recurrent of bile duct stones after ERCP+EST therapy.
