      This dose escalation and dose expansion study is to evaluate and characterize the
      tolerability and safety profile of single agent KN035 in Chinese adult subjects with
      unresectable advanced carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose escalation study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KN035 in advanced and
      metastatic solid tumor. Six dose levels are planned and include: 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 2.5, 5, 10
      mg/kg/dose. Subjects will be assigned to a dose level in the order of study entry. The first
      cohort of 1 subject will receive KN035 at 0.1 mg/kg/dose as a subcutaneous (sc) injection
      every week for a total of 4 injections (Days 1, 8, 15 and 22) in the first 28-day cycle. For
      the first 2 cohorts (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/dose), only one subject will be enrolled in each
      cohort until 1 subject experiences a ≥ Grade 2 drug-related adverse event in the first cycle,
      then 2 additional subjects will be enrolled at this cohort. Thereafter, the study will become
      the traditional 3+3 design with 3 or 6 subjects treated at this dose level and all subsequent
      dose levels depending upon the incidence of DLTs. However, if no ≥ Grade 2 drug-related
      adverse event occurs in the first 2 cohorts, starting with cohort 3, the study will become
      the traditional 3+3 design with 3 or 6 subjects enrolled.

      Dose expansion study is planned to conduct in advanced hepatocellular cancer patients at 2.5
      mg/kg and 5 mg/kg dose level, respectively.
