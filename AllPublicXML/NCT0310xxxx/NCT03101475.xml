  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center early phase II study. This proof of concept
      study will investigate whether the combined use of local tumor ablation/radiation plus
      immunomodulating drugs may induce a significant immune response in patient with incurable
      liver metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) (+/- limited extrahepatic disease) being stable
      or in partial remission after completion of 4-6 months first line systemic therapy.

      The primary objective of the study is to show an overall response rate of lesions not treated
      by ablation/radiotherapy including the extrahepatic lesions (according to iRECIST criteria)
      higher than 10%. With the continuation of first line systemic treatment, no further responses
      are expected.

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  To establish the feasibility and safety of the combined treatment modalities;

        -  To study the impact of the local technique (RFA/Radiotherapy) on the results;

        -  To investigate biomarkers to predict response to the combined treatment

    <description>The statistical design is based on the assumption that the continuation of first line systemic treatment would result in nearly no further response translating into a response rate of 0 to 5% at maximum in the enrolled patient's population. A response rate of 10% in the experimental arm (local treatment + immunotherapy) will be judged too low to justify this combined approach. On the contrary, a response rate of 25% will be judged very promising. An optimal Simon's two-stage design will be used for the rejection of a 10% or less iBOR rate</description>
