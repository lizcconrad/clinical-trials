  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease(DPLD) is a chronic progressive fibrosis lung disease that
      with a highly variable clinical process.Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) is a
      high-molecular-weight glycoprotein, classified as human MUC1 mucin, that is produced mainly
      by regenerating type II pneumocytes.Serum levels of KL-6 have been shown to be elevated in
      patients with DPLD and could predict progress, but unaware of the differential threshold. The
      objective of this study was to perspectively and sequentially monitor serum KL-6 levels in
      patients with different DPLD,then analyze its clinical value and find the differential
      threshold.

      Subjects and Method: Recruiting different DPLD patients in our hospital between 2013 February
      and 2016 October, including polymyositis/dermatomyositis related interstitial lung disease
      (PM/DM-ILD), rheumatoid arthritis related interstitial lung disease (RA - ILD), interstitial
      pneumonia with autoimmune features(IPAF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF), following up
      for enery 3 to 6 months. Once condition deteriorated, patient could return at any time if
      necessary according to our clinical physician judgment. Tumor markers，pulmonary function
      test(PFT); chest thin-section CT examination and CT scores; serum KL-6 levels were acquired
      in all patients at baseline and follow-ups. Serum KL-6 was measured on LUMIPULSE G
      System(FUJIREBIO, JAPAN) by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay. All follow-up patients will
      be respectively divided into improved,stable and deteriotated group according to the official
      ATS/ERS statement.

      Inclusion criteria: (1)patient with PM/DM-ILD, RA-ILD, IPAF, IPF.The diagnosis of patient
      were according to the official ATS/ERS statement and the American College of
      Rheumatology/European League standard;(2)18 to 80 years old.

      Exclusion criteria: (1)conbination with pulmonary tubenculersis,pulmonary
      infection,tumor;(2)no serum KL-6 or pulmonary function test or chest thin-section CT
      examintion ;(3)patient with severe hepatic and renal dysfunction,heart disease or receiving
      hemodialysis treatment;(4)pregnant or plan to be pregnant

    <measure>CT score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>All chest CT was obtained with 1 or 2 mm sequentially throughout the entire lung at baseline and follow-ups.CT scans were reviewed independtly by two thracic radiologists without knowledge of clinical,physiologic,or pathologic parameters,at a window level of -650 H and a window width of 1200 H. Obsevers were also kept unaware of patient diagnose.The whole lung were divided into six areas at the level of the aortic arch and inferior pulmonary vein.Each erea was scored on a scale of 0-10.</description>
