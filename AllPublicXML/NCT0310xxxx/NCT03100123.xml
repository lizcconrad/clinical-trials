    <textblock>
      The APPLE pilot trial is a feasibility study that is a multicentre, open-label, randomized
      controlled trial. Pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and a history of late
      (â‰¥10 weeks gestation) or recurrent early (2 &lt;10 weeks) pregnancy loss will be recruited.

      Eligible and consenting subjects will be assigned to one of two study arms: open-label
      low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) prophylaxis until 37 weeks gestation AND low-dose aspirin
      (ASA) daily until delivery, or open-label low-dose aspirin daily from randomization until
      delivery.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine the feasibility of conducting a multicenter
      randomized full trial evaluating antepartum prophylaxis with ASA versus LMWH/ASA in women
      with confirmed APS and a history of late or recurrent early pregnancy loss.

      Given the large sample size needed to adequately power a large multicenter trial that
      assesses the efficacy of ASA alone versus LMWH/ASA, the investigators first need to determine
      if it is possible to meet minimum recruitment rates needed for a full multicenter trial. If
      the pilot feasibility trial is successful, then the secondary outcomes collected will be used
      in the analysis of the full multicenter trial.
