  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid is a drug that prevents clotted blood from dissolving and hence reduces
      bleeding. It is routinely given intravenously in many surgical situations where there is a
      risk of major bleeding. Concerns regarding possible adverse effects from intravenous use
      prevents a more widespread use, even in smaller surgeries. Topical application - using the
      drug directly on the wound surface- may give a higher concentration at the site of bleeding
      but a lower concentration in the rest of the body, and hence a lower risk of adverse effects.
      Here it will be investigated to what extent a defined dose of the drug is absorbed
      systemically - into the blood stream - when it is applied topically. This will then be
      compared to the concentration in the blood stream when administered intravenously. Blood
      samples will be obtained at defined time intervals after administration from patients
      receiving topical and patients receiving intravenous administration of the same single dose
      of tranexamic acid. Will less of the drug enter the blood stream if it is applied directly to
      the wound?

    <intervention_model_description>12 participants will be included in each of 3 groups: wound moistening group (skin reduction surgery), wound bolus group (after skin reduction surgery), and (for comparison) a group getting usual intravenous tranexamic acid before orthopedic surgery. It is not possible to conduct a formal power calculation, as it is completely unknown which concentrations could be expected after topical use; however, these concentrations are expected to be considerably lower than after intravenous use. Consequently, it is expected that the AUC values in all subjects in the topical (skin reducing surgery) group are far lower than in all subjects in the intravenous (orthopaedic surgery) group. 12 subjects is therefor considered an appropriate number.</intervention_model_description>
