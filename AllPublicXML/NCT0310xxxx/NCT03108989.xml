  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sugammadex has been approved as the first targeted reversal binding agent providing
      predictable and complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium or
      vecuronium, and achieving so with a favourable safety profile.

      Its benefits over traditional acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been widely demonstrated
      in many studies. The scope of such studies has been mostly related to the efficacy of NMB
      reversal and safety. However, the clinical use of sugammadex led some anaesthesiologists to
      observe that following the use of this agent, patients seemed to recover consciousness faster
      and look like they were feeling better. To present, there is little information on the effect
      of sugammadex on awakening from anaesthesia.

      The quality of postoperative recovery focused around patient-oriented endpoints has raised
      new interest as a measure of the quality of anaesthesia and a target towards which
      improvement can be directed.

      On the other hand, there is no single prospective study performed to address a possible
      effect of sugammadex on recovery from anaesthesia.

      The objective of this study was to compare the effect of sugammadex and neostigmine on the
      quality of postoperative recovery using the PQRS in elderly patients undergoing trans pars
      plana vitrectomy with general anesthesia
