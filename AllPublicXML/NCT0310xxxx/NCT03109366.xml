      This project's overall objective is to contribute to knowledge and innovation needed to
      advance ICT-arenas for timely, secure and seamless collaboration between chronically ill
      patients and appropriate levels of care. The investigators will expand an Internet solution
      that has successfully supported online patient-provider communication into a device-
      independent mobile, multifunctional ICT platform, called Connect 2.0, to support individually
      tailored collaborative care between patients and care providers on the continuum of
      primary-specialist care. The results will contribute to Norway's Collaboration Reform.
      Integrating theories from health and ICT related sciences, the project is organized into five
      work packages that focus on two of VERDIKTs research themes: social networking and mobile
      internet. We will summarize (1) the current state of collaborative health care models and
      their utilization of ICT research and innovations; explore challenges related to (2)
      information exchange between devices, platforms and systems; (3) human-computer interaction,
      (4) data security and confidentiality; and (5) factors related to successful adoption and
      implementation of Connect 2.0 patient-provider collaborative care. Finally the investigators
      will explore how Connect 2.0 impacts interactions, communication and organizational processes
      in collaborative &quot;real world&quot; care.

      Specifically this study will:

        1. Summarize the current state of collaborative health care models and their utilization of
           ICT research and innovations.

        2. Explore challenges and propose solutions for adapting a mobile multifunctional ICT
           platform (Connect 2.0) into the technical and organizational infrastructures of
           collaborative health care.

        3. Through user-centred design methods address challenges related to human computer
           interaction and usability of Connect 2.0.

        4. Explore challenges and feasible solutions that safeguard data security and
           confidentiality when connecting an Internet solution with a protected health net while
           ensuring safe and efficient data transfer through heterogeneous networks.

        5. Explore factors related to successful adoption and implementation of Connect 2.0 in real
           world collaborative care. Based on the above: explore impacts of a test version of
           Connect 2.0 on interactions, communication and organizational processes.

      The work expands partnerships between the Centre for research-based innovation (SFI)
      consortium (7 business / research partners) called Troms√∏ Telemedicine Laboratory (TTL), the
      Norwegian Telemedicine Center (NST), the Center for Shared Decision Making and Nursing
      Research (CSDM) at Oslo University Hospital, the Department of Computer Science, University
      of Oslo, the University Hospital of Northern Norway (UNN), Balsfjord Municipality, the
      Biomedical Information Research Center at the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, and the
      Department of Biomedical informatics at Columbia University in New York.
