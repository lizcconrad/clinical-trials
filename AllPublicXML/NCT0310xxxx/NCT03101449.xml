      This research aims to evaluate the effects of vocal conditioning through two semioccluded
      vocal tract exercises (SOVTE) - Finnish tube and phonation in high strength straw - in vocal
      parameters, vocal extension profile and maximum phonation time for a period of four months in
      a group of singers. acoustic analysis will be performed of the average parameters of the
      fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer and glottal to Noise Excitation (GNE) by
      VoxMetria program and perceptual analysis through Consensus Assessment Perceptual Hearing the
      Voice Protocol (CAPE-V) three times: before the vocal conditioning, after the last meeting of
      the technical realization and a week after the vocal conditioning period.

    <description>20 individuals of Coral UFCSPA without voice problems carry out the exercise with Finnish tube before choir practice once a week for a period of 14 weeks. The exercise will be carried out with blowing set to sound at regular frequency, with frequency variation and with the melody of &quot;Happy Birthday&quot;; each sequence will be held for 2 minutes with 1 minute interval between them.</description>
