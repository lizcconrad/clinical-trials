  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of the International Dental Federation (FDI) criteria,
      compared to CARS (Caries Associated with Restorations or Sealants) detection criteria for
      evaluation of caries lesions around restorations in permanent teeth, in the outcomes related
      to oral health of adults, in a randomized clinical trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of a randomized controlled trial of two parallel groups. One group
      will correspond to adults who will receive the diagnosis and indication of treatment
      according to FDI criteria (control group). And the other group will receive a diagnosis and
      treatment decision according to the detection criteria &quot;Caries Associated with Restorations
      or Sealants&quot; (CARS) - ICCMS (International Caries Classification and Management System) -
      experimental group). Patient evaluations will be performed after 12 and 24 months. The
      primary outcome will be the number of surfaces restored with the need for new interventions.
      Secondary outcomes will be: impact of oral health on quality of life and cost-effectiveness.

    <time_frame>12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint will be the number of surfaces restored requiring intervention, which is composed of the sum of components with different levels of severity: number of surfaces with new caries lesions, number of surfaces restored in need of repair, replacement, teeth with episodes of pain, teeth requiring endodontic treatment or extraction.</description>

    <measure>Cost-effectiveness measured by a scale</measure>

    <description>Effectiveness will be measured through the number of restored surfaces without intervention. The cost-effectiveness ratio will be expressed by the cost ratio of the FDI and CARS criteria and effectiveness (number of surfaces without the need for new interventions)</description>
