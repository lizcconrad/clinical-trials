  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to optimize the success of external
      cephalic version (turning the baby from the outside). Attempting to turn babies in-utero is
      recommended because it may decrease the risk of needing a cesarean section for abnormal
      presentation. While the study team knows that this procedure can be effective, the study team
      still has some un-answered questions as to the best way to perform this procedure to increase
      the chance of success. Many prior studies have shown that using spinal anesthesia (a shot of
      medication placed in your back to numb and relax the abdomen) can increase the success rate
      of a version. This ultimately has led to the finding that using this anesthesia can decrease
      the rate of cesarean section. However, there have been only a small number of studies
      assessing the success rate if spinal anesthesia is used only in the event that without it
      fails. Therefore the study team is going to compare patients who receive spinal anesthesia
      with those who only receive spinal anesthesia if the procedure to turn the baby (ECV) fails
      without it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breech presentation occurs in approximately 3-4% of term pregnancies and leads to one of the
      most common indications for cesarean delivery. Attempting an external cephalic version (ECV)
      significantly increases the chance of cephalic presentation at time of delivery and reduces
      the chance of cesarean section. Since ECV does in fact reduce the rate of cesarean section,
      many studies have sought to determine the best method to perform the procedure to optimize
      the chance of success. A recent meta-analysis concluded that administration of neuraxial
      analgesia significantly increases the success rate of ECV and also increases the incidence of
      vaginal delivery. However, there have been only 2 prospective studies and no randomized
      trials that evaluated the success of ECV using neuraxial analgesia only when initial attempt
      without it has failed. Therefore, the study team designed a randomized controlled trial with
      two groups: Group 1- patients receiving spinal anesthesia immediately versus Group 2-
      patients attempting ECV without spinal anesthesia with reattempt using a spinal if first
      attempt fails. This study will be conducted on labor and delivery at Mount Sinai West
      hospital. Patients who present to labor and delivery at term for ECV will be approached for
      enrollment and those who consent to be part of the study would be randomized into a group.
      ECV will then be attempted and delivery and neonatal outcomes will be collected. Patients
      will likely be enrolled in the study from time of version (approximately 37 weeks) until
      postpartum. This study will take approximately 1-2 years given the ECV rate.

    <description>The patient will have a spinal administered by the on call anesthesiologist using standard protocol (intrathecal bupivacaine 7.5 mg). The patient will then be administered 0.25 mg Terbutaline subcutaneously and the ECV will be attempted. Under ultrasound guidance the provider will attempt to lift the breech upward from the pelvis with one hand and guide the head with the other hand to produce a forward roll. If forward roll fails, a backward roll somersault may be attempted. ECV attempt will be abandoned if there is significant fetal bradycardia, discomfort to the patient, or if the procedure cannot be completed easily with these maneuvers. Once attempt is complete, whether successful or not, the patient will be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes, and will be discharged once they are able to walk, void, and tolerate PO intake, only if fetal and maternal status is reassuring.</description>
