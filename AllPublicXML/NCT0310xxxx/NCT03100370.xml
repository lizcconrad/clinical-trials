    <textblock>
      This study will compare different polarities of transcutaneous spinal direct current
      stimulation combined with robotic-assisted arm training in adults with acquired brain injury
      (ABI). Participants will receive 20 minutes of 2.5 milliamps (mA) anodal, cathodal, and sham
      transpinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) over cervical spine combined with high
      intensity robotic-assisted arm training, five days a week, for 2 consecutive weeks.

    <textblock>
      Acquired brain injury (ABI) is the leading cause of neurological disability in the United
      States and accounts for the poor physical health and the social dysfunction evident in
      survivors. Hemiparesis due to acquired brain injury is the primary cause of disability and
      arm paresis is perceived as the primary cause of disability by individuals who have suffered
      ABI because of the limitations it creates in performing activities of daily living (ADL).
      Rehabilitation of the impaired limb is essential for improving motor function after ABI, yet
      only 31% of ABI survivors receive outpatient rehabilitation. Therefore, effective therapy for
      upper-limb paresis must be addressed. Approximately 80% of all ABI survivors suffer from
      upper limb paresis and only 18% of these individuals gain full motor recovery with
      conventional treatments in the year following ABI.

      The study will use cross-over, randomized, sham controlled, double-blinded design in which 10
      participants with subacute or chronic ABI will be assigned to receive either active anodal
      spinal stimulation, cathodal spinal stimulation, and sham spinal stimulation experiments for
      the same duration in a random order. In all the experiments participants will receive robotic
      assisted training for duration of 1.5 hours. The first 20 minutes of training will be coupled
      with spinal stimulation. Treatment will be administered at an intensity of 5 sessions per
      week for 2 weeks.
