      Demonstrate and compare the 3D morphology of the bladder wall in full and drained states with
      2 different kinds of bladder catheters in place. (Foley Catheter vs. Cystosure Catheter)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Foley catheter has been the mainstay of bladder drainage for many decades. There has been
      little design change despite risks associated with Foley catheter use including cather
      associated Urinary Tract Infections(UTIs). However, recent incentives and penalties related
      to iatrogenic bladder infections have encouraged healthcare providers to search for ways to
      decrease catheter-associated infections. Data suggests that the design of the traditional
      Foley catheter may be responsible for bladder mucosal injury due to contact with the drainage
      tip, which in turn contribute to bladder infections associated with long term indwelling
      Foley catheter usage. The Cystosure catheter is an FDA approved bladder drainage device, with
      a shortened drainage port, designed to avoid contact with the bladder mucosa. It is
      postulated that the lack of contact with the mucosa would decrease mucosal injury, possibly
      leading to decreased incidence of catheter related bladder infections. Early sheep bladder
      microscopy studies have suggested that the Cystosure catheter produces significantly less
      mucosal injury compared to the Foley catheter following a short period of indwelling bladder
      catheterization. The present study is designed to compare bladder wall geometry around the
      drainage balloon in the Foley versus the Cystosure drainage catheters in living women. It is
      hypothesized that the &quot;tip-less&quot; cystosure catheter will have a smoother, more continuous
      bladder contour around the drainage port, compared to the traditional Foley catheter tip.

    <intervention_model_description>Female patients seen at the Pelvic Floor Institute will be offered participation in the study. The study will consist of a pelvic floor MRI at no cost to them or their payors. Women who agree to participate will undergo a standard high resolution, thin slice pelvic floor static/dynamic MRI study, first with a full bladder, and after the bladder is emptied. Bladder filling and drainage will be performed sequentially, using each of the 2 catheter types (A and B above) in sequence. During bladder emptying, a cine video scan will be taken at the midsagittal plane to show the dynamics of the bladder fluid and walls during emptying. Each subject will serve as their own control.</intervention_model_description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pelvic Floor Institute patients aged between 21 and 70 years of age, who are able to
             speak and understand English, who are not currently pregnant, or had a pregnancy in
             the previous 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with claustrophobia or any contraindication to undergoing an MRI scan will be
             excluded. Similarly, women with hip, knee, or shoulder replacements will be excluded
             because of the need for urethral catheterization. Women with significant mitral valve
             prolapse will also be excluded for the same reason. Women with history of 3 or more
             culture-documented UTIs over the last 12 months will be excluded. Women who are unable
             or unwilling to give informed consent will also be excluded. Women who are unable to
             tolerate 300 cc of fluid in the bladder will be excluded. Women with a
             nitrite-positive urinalysis at the time of study enrollment will be excluded until
             they can demonstrate a negative urine culture.
