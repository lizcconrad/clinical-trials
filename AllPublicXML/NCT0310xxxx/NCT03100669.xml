  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MIRP (Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus) as surgical correction of pectus excavatum or
      carinatum is performed to achieve physiological, cosmetic, and psychological benefits for the
      patient. Surgery is often associated with severe postoperative pain. In this study the
      researchers want to registrate pain, sleep, nausea/vomiting, and daily activities in short
      and long term follow up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to provide pain patients with an individualized approach to their pain problem after
      MIRP we developed an electronic medical record coupled to a set of telemetric medical-grade
      devices. Appi@Home (Antwerp Personalized Pain Initiative) supports an innovative approach to
      (sub)acute conditions by offering a platform for continuous follow-up. Patients are provided
      with a toolbox and an app that continuously collects objective outcome data (i.e. pain
      intensity, sleep quality, physical activity). The integrated system allows the care givers to
      respond very quickly to changing clinical conditions of the patient, making a very adaptive
      and individualized follow-up possible for these patients. In addition, the patient becomes an
      active participant in the global therapeutic approach.

      Patients receive the toolbox two week prior to surgery with access to the internet platform
      for questionnaires fill-in procedure. Up to ten week after surgery pain intensity, sleep
      quality and physical activity will be monitored subjectively by a scoring table (0-10, 0 no
      pain-bad sleeping quality-no activity, 10 maximum of pain-excellent sleeping quality- a lot
      of activity) and objectively by blood pressure device, oxygen saturation monitoring, activity
      tracker and sleep registration tool.
