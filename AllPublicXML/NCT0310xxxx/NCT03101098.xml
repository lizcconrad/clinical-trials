    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic hysterectomy is one of the most common gynecologic surgeries worldwide.
      Generally, in total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH), uterine arteries are coagulated or
      transected close to the uterus, alongside the cervix, like surgical technique of a
      conventional total abdominal hysterectomy. Recently, several studies showed that ligation of
      uterine artery where it originates from the internal iliac artery during TLH (so-called
      &quot;retroperitoneal TLH&quot;) is effective for reducing blood loss. However, the application of this
      technique to clinical practice have not been well investigated in terms of its efficacy and
      safety. Moreover, most of the previous studies on retroperitoneal TLH were small case series
      or retrospective comparative studies with conventional TLH. Therefore, the investigators
      conducted this randomized trial to investigate the role of retroperitoneal TLH in enlarge
      uterus.
