  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open label, interventional study evaluating adoptive
      cell therapy (ACT) with autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) infusion (LN-145)
      followed by IL-2 after a non-myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion preparative regimen for the
      treatment of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing
      process, as originally developed by the NCI, for the treatment of patients with recurrent,
      metastatic, or persistent cervical carcinoma. The cell transfer therapy used in this study
      involves patients receiving a NMA lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen, followed by
      infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of a regimen of IL-2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be greater than 18 years of age at the time of consent.

          -  Must have metastatic, recurrent or persistent squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous
             carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix, which is not amenable to curative treatment
             with surgery and/or radiation therapy.

          -  Must have had at least 1 prior systemic immunotherapy or chemotherapeutic treatment
             for cervical carcinoma. Patients must have either progressive disease or no response
             (i.e., no PR or CR) while receiving or after the completion of the most recent prior
             treatment.

          -  Any prior therapy directed at the malignant tumor, including radiation therapy,
             chemotherapy, biologic/targeted agents and immunologic agents must be discontinued at
             least 28 days prior to tumor resection.

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Patients must be seronegative for the HIV antibody, hepatitis B antigen, and hepatitis
             C antibody or antigen.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice an approved method of
             birth control starting at the time of informed consent and for 1 year after the
             completion of the study treatment regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received prior cell transfer therapy, which includes
             non-myeloablative or myeloablative chemotherapy regimen.

             equivalent daily).

          -  Patients who currently have prior therapy-related toxicities greater than Grade 1
             according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03; except for peripheral neuropathy, alopecia or vitiligo
             prior to enrollment/resection.

          -  Patients with documented Grade 2 or greater diarrhea or colitis as a result of
             previous immunotherapy within six months from screening.

          -  Patients with history of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to
             cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, IL-2, or aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin or
             streptomycin).

          -  Patients with active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major
             medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system.

          -  Patients with symptomatic and/or untreated brain metastases (of any size and any
             number).

          -  Have any form of primary immunodeficiency, such as severe combined immunodeficiency
             disease or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

          -  Diagnosis of end-stage renal disorder requiring hemodialysis.

          -  Patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 45%.

          -  Patients who have a FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) of less than or
             equal to 60% of normal.
