      The aim of this study is to evaluate adjuvant effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in
      periodontal treatment and salivary status of type 1 diabetes patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is a risk factor for periodontal disease increasing its prevalence,
      extension and severity. Periodontal disease is considered the sixth complication of diabetes.
      There is a global epidemic of diabetes, including an increase of type 1 diabetes incidence in
      younger patients. Adjuvant treatments to scaling and root planing as antimicrobial
      photodynamic therapy show improved clinical outcomes. Thus, the aim of this randomized
      clinical trial is to evaluate adjuvant effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in
      periodontal treatment and salivary status of type 1 diabetes patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) measured by a periodontal probe and classified according to severity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Severe periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with clinical attachment level (CAL) ≥ 6mm and ≥1 interproximal site with periodontal probing depth (PPD) ≥5mm. Moderate periodontitis was defined by the presence of ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with CAL ≥ 4mm or ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with PPD ≥5mm. Mild periodontitis was defined as ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 3 mm CAL and ≥ 2 interproximal sites in different teeth with ≥ 4 mm PPD or at least 1 site with PPD ≥ 5 mm (20,21). Gingivitis was determined as follows: Subjects were considered healthy if presented PPD ≤3mm/Bleeding on probing (BOP) extent scores &lt; 10% and with gingivitis if presented PPD ≤3mm/ BOP extent scores &gt;10%.</description>

    <measure>Salivary glucose - collection of stimulated saliva in 10 minutes and measured with a colorimetric kit</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary glucose is measured by a colorimetric kit and the values are converted and presented as mg/dL. There are no reference value for this measurement. The analysis is done by means of correlation to blood glucose levels in mg/dL.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary pH and buffering Capacity - collection of stimulated saliva in 10 minutes and measurement of acidity with a pHmeter</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Normal Salivary pH = 6 to 7. Buffering capacity: ≥ 5.6 were considered as ''high'', ranging from 4.1 to 5.5 were labelled as ''medium'' and those ≤4 were defined as ''low''.</description>
