  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are currently being managed with Basal
      Insulin (BI). However, there is little evidence to support guidelines on dosing adjustments
      in the preoperative period. The Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia does not advise a reduction
      in the dose of BI preoperatively, unless there is a specific history of hypoglycemia. The
      Endocrine Society suggests a 50% reduction in BI dose the evening before surgery. The authors
      hypothesized that a 25% reduction in BI dose the evening before surgery will result in better
      perioperative blood glucose control compared with our institutional 50% decrease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 subjects diagnosed with T2DM taking once-daily evening BI, scheduled to undergo
      elective surgery under general anesthesia will be consented and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      received either 50% or 25% reduction of their regular evening BI dose on the evening before
      surgery. Blood glucose levels (BGL) will be recorded perioperatively according to
      institutional guidelines.
