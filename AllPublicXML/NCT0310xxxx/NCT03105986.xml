    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple-dose administration of
      probenecid on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-63549109 and JNJ-64167896 after a single dose of
      JNJ-64041575 in healthy adult participants.

             history of peptic ulcer disease, or other contra-indications for the use of probenecid

          -  Participants has any condition for which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (eg, compromise the
             well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified
             assessments

          -  Participants with a history of clinically significant drug allergy such as, but not
             limited to, sulfonamides and penicillins, or drug allergy diagnosed in previous
