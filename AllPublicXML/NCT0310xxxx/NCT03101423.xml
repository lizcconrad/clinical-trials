  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the only way to cure thalassemia, one of
      its main obstacles is the rejection after transplantation, chimerism continued to decline,
      which eventually lead to transplant failure. chimerism is a key indicator of the succession
      of immune response, which is a key indicator for predicting the failure of hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation and provides an important basis for early detection of rejection.
      Transplantation of continuous chimerism can detect early unstable chimeras and rejection.The
      chimerism rates after transplantation were continuously monitored using fluorescence labeled
      multiplex PCR amplification of short tandem repeats (STR-PCR)

      ,and then follow our STR different rates for early interventional therapy to prevent further
      reduction in chimerism leading to lead to graft failure.

    <description>β thalassemia major patients underwent reduced chimerism rate after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were collected and the chimerism rates after transplantation were continuously monitored using fluorescence labeled multiplex PCR amplification of short tandem repeats (STR-PCR).Monitoring once every 20-30 days after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.For patients with reduced chimerism, the results were grouped.We monitor STR-PCR once every 20-30 days after different treatment.</description>
