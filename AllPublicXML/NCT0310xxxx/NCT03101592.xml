  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded cluster-randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of two strategies
      for scripting/dispensing of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on retention, virologic suppression,
      and cost compared to the standard of care. The study will be conducted in Malawi and Zambia
      among approximately 8,200 HIV-1-infected adults (18 years or older) who are stable on ART.
      Clusters will be randomized to one of three study arms: (1) standard of care (SOC) ART
      scripting (varies by country, region, clinic, and/or provider), (2) three-month ART
      scripting, and (3) six-month ART scripting. 30 clusters will be selected for the study, 15 in
      Malawi and 15 in Zambia, and will be randomized to a study arm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted among approximately 8,200 HIV-infected individuals age 18 years
      or older who are stable on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 30 clusters in Malawi and Zambia.
      Individuals will be screened at routine clinic visits and enrolled if they meet inclusion
      criteria. Enrolled individuals will receive standard of care at their site with the exception
      of their ART dispensing interval based on the assigned randomization. Outcomes will be
      assessed after 12 months, but all participants will be under observational follow-up for 36
      months, with annual re-assessment of retention, virologic suppression, and
      cost-effectiveness.

      There will be no contact with study participants during the period of follow-up.

      Endpoints will be determined by chart review after the primary endpoint is reached (12
      months) and will be re-assessed after the 24-month endpoint and again after the 36-month
      endpoint. Endpoint data collection will include:

        1. Retention in care on strategy

        2. Suppressed viral load of &lt;1,000 copies done as part of standard of care viral load
           monitoring

      In a subset of participants in Malawi (n=1,500), we will perform a review of participants'
      health passports, a record of patient clinic visits, general health information, and
      medications that is possessed by patients in Malawi, after the 12-, 24-, and 36-month
      endpoints have been completed. Data will be collected on interim clinic visits, such as
      reason for visit/services received (sick, family planning, non-communicable disease
      treatment), frequency of visits, and location of clinic services.

      In a subset of participants (~240), we will perform a post intervention study visit after the
      12-month endpoint is completed and also after the 36-month endpoint is completed. Qualitative
      interviews will be performed with a subset of participants and will focus on patient
      experience with assigned dispensing interval, including challenges/barriers and facilitators
      towards adherence and retention. Focused questions around endpoints (if default, reasons; if
      virologic failure, reasons including adherence) will also be addressed in the
      post-intervention visit.

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be a cluster randomized trial comparing three different antiretroviral therapy (ART) dispensing strategies. Clusters will be comprised of individual clinics in Malawi and Zambia. Enrolled individuals will receive standard of care at their site with the exception of the ART dispensing interval based on the assigned randomization. Outcomes will be assessed after 12 months, but all patients will be followed for 36 months.</intervention_model_description>
