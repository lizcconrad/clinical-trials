  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EC-18 in subjects with
      relapsing or advanced breast cancer whose risk level for febrile neutropenia is low and who
      are receiving second line or higher chemotherapy that incorporates
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.

      Part 2 will evaluate the MTD in the same subject population.

      Part 1 of this study will utilize a non-randomized, open-label 3 + 3 dose escalation design
      in which subjects will receive 500 mg, 1000 mg, 1500 mg, and 2000 mg of EC-18. A total of 12
      subjects are planned for enrollment. After 21 days of EC-18 treatment with starting
      administration of doxobubicin and cyclophosphamide (Day 1), all subjects will be followed for
      a 4-week safety assessment.

      Part 2 is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-expansion study. subjects will
      received the maximum tolerated dose identified in Part 1. Subjects will be treated for 3
      weeks and followed for safety for 4 weeks. sixty five subjects are planned for Part 2
