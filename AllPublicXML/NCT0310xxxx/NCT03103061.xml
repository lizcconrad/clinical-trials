  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and image
      quality of low-radiation, dynamic perfusion CT of the heart in patients with suspected
      ischemic chest pain and a moderate or severe stenosis seen on coronary CTA. Secondary aims
      include the assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of CT perfusion imaging compared to either
      SPECT or invasive angiography.

             undergone clinically indicated SPECT with positive or equivocal findings OR subject
             must have undergone clinically indicated SPECT with prior cardiac CT angiography that
             showed moderate or severe stenosis.

          3. Subject must be 18 - 85 years of age.

          4. Subject must provide written informed consent prior to any study-related procedures
             being performed.
