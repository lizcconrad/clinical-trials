  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if a lower limb robotic device can be used in a community setting
      to increase the amount of physical activity that individuals undertake following stroke and
      consequently improve biomechanical, physiological and health outcomes, in patients with
      stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in technology have helped to develop robotic devices to aid gait training in
      order to develop more normal movement patterns, strengthen the quadriceps and improve quality
      of gait. Lower limb robotic devices have been shown to increase functional mobility, walking
      speed, step length, balance and endurance within a clinical setting. The purpose of this
      study is to see if a lower limb robotic device leg can be used in a community setting to
      improve biomechanical (gait, balance, lower-limb strength), physiological (vascular health)
      and performance outcomes (aerobic fitness, strength) in patients with chronic stroke
