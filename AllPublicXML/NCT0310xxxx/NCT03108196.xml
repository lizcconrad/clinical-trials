    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is a common malignant tumor of the urinary system, radical resection plus
      urinary diversion is the first choice of treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer.
      Urinary diversion of surgical options related to patient' survival and quality of life.

      In 1988, Hautmann firstly reported an orthotopic urinary diversion method: Hautmann
      neobladder. As the urine can be controlled from the original urethra, the patient's quality
      of life has been greatly improved, so the new bladder surgery gradually accepted and welcomed
      by urologists and patients. However, in order to achieve low-pressure and large-volume
      storage capacity of the urine reservoir, the 40-70cm long interception of terminal ileum need
      to be detubularized. Only after split, folded, re-stitched and a series of treatment, the
      intestinal can be used. Such complicated procedures make so many urologists give it up. In
      addition, the interception of the long ileum may lead to reduced absorption of vitamin B12
      which caused anemia, metabolic acidosis, intestinal dysfunction. Not only that, as time goes
      by, this kind of neobladder will be unlimited expansion and resulting in a serious increase
      in residual urine volume, hydronephrosis, or even the occurrence of neobladder spontaneous
      rupture.

      In 2000, professor Chunxiao Liu invented &quot;detaenial sigmoid neobladder&quot;, this surgical method
      overset the traditional intestinal detubularization approach, which detached the serosal
      layer with smooth muscle from the bowel without split it. This kind of neobladder is easier
      to construct and have less impact on intestinal function. So far, it has been implemented for
      more than 600 cases in Zhujiang hospital, the age of patients range from 9 months (bladder
      rhabdomyosarcoma) to 84 years old.

      So far as now, no multicenter prospective clinical study on orthotopic urinary diversion has
      been performed worldwide, neither the head-to-head studies on detaenial sigmoid neobladder
      and ileal neobladder.

      Our project is going to perform a multicenter randomized controlled trial for these two
      neobladder methods and look forward to assess the safety and efficacy of these two procedures
      which provide an objective basis for the patients undergoing orthotopic urinary diversion in
      the future.

      Surgical technique for Hautmann ileal neobladder: A 70-cm portion of terminal ileum is
      selected and incised on the antimesenteric border. The ileum is arranged into an M or W
      configuration with the four limbs sutured to one another. After a buttonhole of ileum is
      removed on an antimesenteric portion of the ileum, the urethral anastomosis is performed. The
      ureteral anastomoses are performed using a Le Duc technique or direct implantation, are
      stented, and the reservoir is then closed in a side-to-side manner. As an alternative, the
      two ends of the W may be left slightly longer as a short chimney on either side for
      implantation of the ureters.

      Surgical technique for detaenial sigmoid neobladder: After radical cystectomy, the sigmoid
      was brought out from a midline incision in the lower abdomen and a 15 to 25 cm segment was
      isolated. Intestinal continuity was restored using a circular stapler. Omental and free
      taeniae, and the serosal layer were incised deeply as far as the submucosal layer until the
      plane between smooth muscle and the submucosal layer could be identified clearly by scalpel
      dissection. The serosal layer with smooth muscle was then detached from the submucosal layer
      and removed continuously without difficulty. During this time, the operator could insert the
      finger in the sigmoid lumen and lift the sigmoid wall up for accurate dissection. Only the
      mucosal and submucosal layers were preserved. Approximately 2 to 3 cm of the taeniae and
      serosal layer were preserved to strengthen the urethra-neobladder anastomosis at the central
      portion of the isolated sigmoid and at the two ends for the ureter-neobladder anastomosis.
      The detaenial sigmoid was irrigated repeatedly by dilute iodine solution to eliminate
      impurities. Its capacity for enlargement and leak tightness were assessed at the end by
      filling with 300 to 400 ml iodine solution. Residual taeniae were identified and incised
      during this filling phase. The ureters were subsequently implanted in antirefluxing fashion
      in a submucosal tunnel with 4-zero poly glactin at the two ends of sigmoid. The
      ureter-neobladder anastomoses were protected with a 6Fr Single JÂ® stent. Each stent was
      passed through the sigmoid wall and exteriorized. The two ends of the sigmoid were closed by
      2-zero polyglactin with the embedded seromuscular layer. The central portion of the sigmoid
      was incised and a 22Fr 3-way catheter was inserted in neobladder. The neobladder was
      anastomosed to the urethra with 2-zero polyglactin.

      Followup: Each patient was evaluated at 3-month intervals for 1 year, at 6-month intervals
      for 2 to 5 years. Renal ultrasound, biochemical examination and urine culture were done every
      3 to 6 months. Pelvic computerized tomography and retro-cystogram were performed 6 months
      postoperatively and annually thereafter. Urodynamic investigation and cystoscopic examination
      were done annually.

      Postoperative complications were classified as early (90 days or less) and late (greater than
      90 days). Early and late complications were subdivided into those related and not related to
      the neobladder. Complication grade was classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system.
      Major complications were defined as grade III or higher. Daytime and nighttime continence
      levels were recorded postoperatively at patient interview. Continence was defined as complete
      if the patient was dry without a pad, satisfactory if no more than 1 pad was required and
      poor if the patient used more than 1 pad during the day or night.

      End points: The primary end point was change in renal function from baseline to 3 years.
      Secondary end points included changes in renal function from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 months,
      reduction in eGFR 10 ml/minute/1.73 m2 or greater, early (less than 90 days) and late (90
      days to 3 years) complications, urinary tract infection that was symptomatic or was treated,
      any surgical re-intervention or urinary diversion related surgical re-intervention defined as
      an open or endoscopic procedure under anesthesia, cancer recurrence and overall survival.
      Renal function was assessed using the CKD-EPI equation. Complications were analyzed and
      graded by a blinded adjudicator using the modified Clavien complication grading system.

    <description>The isolated 70 cm terminal ileum segment is arranged in either an M or W shape and is opened along the antimesenteric border except for a 5 cm section where the incision is curved to make a U-shaped ï¬ap. The four limbs of the M or W are then sutured to one another with a running absorbable suture. A small full-thickness segment of bowel is excised for the urethral anastomosis. Once the ileal neobladder is situated and the urethral sutures are tied, the ureters are implanted from inside the neobladder through a small incision in the ileum. The remaining portion of the anterior wall is then closed with a running absorbable suture. Ureteroileal anastomosis were performed with a freely refluxing, open end-to-side method at each end of the W.</description>
