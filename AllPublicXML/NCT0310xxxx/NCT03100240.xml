  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NF-κB pathway activation-induced endometrial insulin resistance was one of the causes of
      infertility patients with PCOS and insulin resistance whose endometrial receptivity is
      declined .The investigators' previous findings indicated that the use of modified utral-long
      protocols ( GnRH-a was used twice in mid-luteal phaes) can improve clinical outcomes by
      improving endometrial receptivity in patients with PCOS , but the mechanism was not clear.
      Previous research also found that GnRH-a reduced the activity of NF-κB pathway in endometrial
      stromal cells and depended the dose and time.Thus, The investigators' subject will try to
      applicate GnRH-a to explore the influence of NF-κB pathway activity 、the state of insulin
      resistance and embryo implantation rate ;then we will investgate GnRH-a whether reduce NF-κB
      pathway activity-induced insulin resistance and ultimately improve endometrial receptivity by
      using GnRH-a in infertility patients with PCOS and insulin resistance.The investigators'
      research attempt to provide ideas for seeking inflammatory medication target in assisted
      reproductive technology in patients with PCOS by exploring the immune mechanism of GnRHa on
      improving the endometrial receptivity .

      The endometrial biopsy was performed in the previous cycle of the protocol. According to the
      expression of NF-κB in the endometrium random group. The difference of NF - κB expression in
      patients with different protocol were compared.
