      The purpose of this study is to figure out the best way to help veterans do advance care
      planning. This study will examine the effects of two theory based behavior interventions by
      randomizing veteran into 4 groups to see which veterans will complete the 4 step process of
      advance care planning.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two theory-based behavior
      interventions on engagement of Veterans in advance care planning (ACP) by means of the
      following specific aim:

      Primary Aim: To conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of: a) usual
      care; b) computer-tailored intervention (CTI); c) motivational enhancement therapy (MET); d)
      CTI + MET on the proportion of middle-age and older Veterans receiving primary care at the VA
      who complete the process of ACP, defined as completing a total of 4 key ACP behaviors,
      including selecting a health care proxy, communicating with the proxy about goals of care,
      communicating with the clinician about goals of care, and documenting proxy selection and
      goals.

      Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of Veterans completing ACP will be higher among those in
      each of the intervention groups compared to Veterans receiving usual care.

      All of 4 groups will receive their assessments and, if, their interventions, by telephone
      and/or mail. The veterans will from the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. Participants will
      be identified through a data query of the Regional Data Warehouse who have had a primary care
      visit in the past 12 months. We will then be able to oversample female and minority Veterans.

    <description>CTI will receive telephone contact at three time points: baseline, two, and four months. Each contact consists of an integrated assessment and intervention feedback report, using an expert system. Participants are assessed for four different behaviors that together represent complete ACP engagement: communication with loved ones about views on quality of life versus quantity of life, communication with clinicians about views on quality of life versus quantity of life, assignment of a health care surrogate, and completion of a living will. The system takes the results of the assessment and results in an individualized feedback report.</description>

    <description>MET will receive telephone contact at three time points: baseline, two, and four months. They will undergo the assessment as described above receive and they will receive a second a telephone contact within two weeks of the assessment, which will consist of an MET session. If the surrogate has been enrolled in the study, the MET will be conducted with both the Veteran and the surrogate in a dyadic telephone interview. The goal of the interview is to strengthen commitment to engage in ACP and promote self-efficacy. The interviewer will also help the Veteran to reflect on the pros and cons of ACP engagement as elicited in the assessment process, to understand how to build on ACP behaviors already engaged in, and, if appropriate, to help the Veteran create a change plan for further ACP engagement.</description>
