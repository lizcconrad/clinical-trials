  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non interventional, multicenter clinical trial, in adult patients receiving
      Tecfidera per approved SmPC and routine clinical practice. The primary objective of this
      study is to evaluate the total societal costs to the healthcare system related to the use of
      Tecfidera in RRMS patients. The study will capture data in a simple matter that can be easily
      interpreted providing an advantage in a country where efforts in the market access arena are
      in their infancy. For the aforementioned reasons, the proposed study may prove quite valuable
      in supporting DMF as a cost‐effective therapy, valuable not only for patients but for the
      public health care system as well, providing all the necessary information for the evaluation
      that need to be examined regarding the positive reimbursement list and future decisions.

      The study will take place in Greece. Investigators will participate from a broad geographical
      distribution in order to ensure a proper representation from all areas of Greece.
      Investigator's decision to prescribe DMF (Tecfidera®) (according to the indication for
      treatment as defined in the summary of product characteristics, SmPC and the current clinical
      practice), should precede entry into the study.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the total cost, at the end of the study, of treatment, of the utilization of healthcare services, and of personal expenses associated with RRMS in patients receiving Dimethyl Fumarate.</description>

    <description>The non-interventional design allows the observation of patients in a broad range of settings reflecting routine clinical practice. All decisions on therapeutic or diagnostic procedures, treatments, management of the disease, or resource utilisation will be at the full discretion of the treating physician without interference by a sponsor or study protocol. All treatment decisions will follow the real-life treatment behaviour.</description>

        400 previously DMF-naïve adult patients who have been diagnosed with RRMS and will initiate
        treatment with Dimethyl Fumarate up to 1 week before study enrolment will be included

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons aged 18-65 years.

          -  Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of RRMS.

          -  Patients for whom the decision to prescribe therapy with Tecfidera®, according to the
             locally approved product's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) has already been
             taken prior to their enrolment in the study. The assignment of a patient to this
             therapeutic strategy is not decided in advance, but falls within current practice,
             while the prescription of Tecfidera® is clearly separated from the physician's
             decision to include the patient in the current study.

          -  Patients must have signed an informed consent document.

          -  Patients must be able to read, understand and complete the study specific
             questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having other forms of MS, like Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) or
             progressive forms.

          -  Patients who have initiated treatment with Tecfidera® more than 7 days before study
             enrolment or have received DMF at any different time prior to this period.

          -  Patients that meet any of the contraindications to the administration of the study
             drug according to the approved SmPC.

          -  Receipt of any investigational agent within 30 days or 5 half-lives of the
             investigational agent (whichever is longer) before the commencement of therapy with
             Tecfidera®.
