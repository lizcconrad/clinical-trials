  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this work is to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of preservative containing
      0.0015% tafluprost and preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost. Both preservative containing and
      preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost will reduce intraocular pressure significantly. In
      addition, preservative-free 0.0015% tafluprost might improve tolerability of glaucoma
      patients.

    <description>Corneal erosion scales were scored according to the area of erosion. Little to no erosion was &quot;0&quot;, erosion on 1/3 of the area of the entire cornea was &quot;1&quot;, erosion on 2/3 of the area of the entire cornea was &quot;2&quot;, and erosion on the entire cornea was &quot;3&quot;</description>

    <intervention_name>Benzalkonium chloride (BAK)</intervention_name>
    <description>Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is the most used preservative and is excellent for safety and stability of drug. However, it causes dry eye, corneal oedema, corneal erosion, and corneal toxicities, thus lowering the long-term tolerability for patients. A critical component when managing glaucoma patients is ensuring compliance.</description>

    <description>Tafluprost (trade names Taflotan or Taflotan-S by Santen Pharmaceutical) is a prostaglandin analogue. It is used topically (as eye drops) to control the progression of open-angle glaucoma and in the management of ocular hypertension. In this study, tafluprost was used in all experimental group with equally concentration(0.0015%), only measured whether BAK was included or not.</description>

             neuroretinal rim and or retinal nerve fiber defects characteristics of glaucoma, and
             visual field defect(i.e., a glaucoma hemi-filed test result outside normal limits, a
             pattern standard deviation probability of &lt;5%, or a cluster of three or more non-edge
             points in location typical of glaucoma, all of which were depressed on a pattern
             deviation plot at a P level of &lt;5%, and at least one of which was depressed at a P
             level of &lt;1% on two consecutive visual field tests).

          -  3. Normal tension glaucoma included criteria: repeated measurements of untreated IOP
             values of &lt; 21mmHg. Primary open angle glaucoma included criteria: repeated
             measurements of untreated IOP values of ≥ 22mmHg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Phakic and pseudophakic eyes.

          -  2. eyes that had been taken vitrectomy, trabeculectomy, or surgery influenced IOP
