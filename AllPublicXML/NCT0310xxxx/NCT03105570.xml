  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To balance the oncological safety and cosmetic outcome is the basic principle of modern
      breast surgery. To preserve the nipple-areolar complex shows attractive cosmetic advantage
      but concerns regarding local recurrence make the oncological safety of nipple sparing
      mastectomy a controversial issue. Since the involvement of areolar pigmented skin by cancer
      is rare compared to that of nipple, we designed the current study to investigate the
      oncological safety and cosmetic outcome of Areola Sparing Mastectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary breast cancer originated from areolae is rare. We hypothesized that nipple and areola
      are two separate anatomy tissue and have different oncological impact on the treatment of
      breast cancer. Areola Sparing Mastectomy (ASM) is a innovative procedure that involves of
      removal of nipple and preservation of areola the pigmented skin of which would improve the
      cosmetic outcome of mastectomy and lead to a illusion of congenital crater nipple in some
      patients.

    <description>A small circular incision would be made to separate nipple from breast and an additional incision directly extended from nipple or located at other part of breast such as infra-mammary fold and subaxillary area would be made to remove the total mammary parenchyma. Routine implant based or flap base reconstruction would be performed subsequentially. Nipple reconstruction is optional.</description>
