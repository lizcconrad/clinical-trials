  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 26 million Americans with many more at
      risk for disease development. Elevated serum phosphorus (P) and related abnormalities in P
      homeostasis due to progressive loss of kidney function are primary driving forces behind
      cardiovascular dysfunction and mortality in CKD patients. Intestinal P absorption is an
      critical aspect in P homeostasis but has been understudied, particularly in the early stages
      of CKD progression. This study aims to determine P absorption in patients with moderate CKD
      compared to healthy adults.

P-33 activity from serial serum and urine collections will be determined by scintillation counting, and fractional phosphorus absorption calculated by kinetic modeling.</description>
