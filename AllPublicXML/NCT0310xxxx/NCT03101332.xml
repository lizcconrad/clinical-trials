  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA) is associated with considerable personal distress,
      functional disability and societal costs. A large number of studies have shown that Cognitive
      Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for PDA. However, the CBT-protocols
      proven to be most effective involves repeated exposure to the particular environments the
      agoraphobic patient fears such as trains, tunnels, lifts and shops. This cause great
      practical problems for health care services as such therapeutic efforts involves spending
      considerable time outside the clinic. For primary care services this is particularly
      challenging due to the large number of patients expected to be seen. Normally clinicians meet
      up to 7 patients daily which makes it almost practically impossible to offer 2-hour sessions,
      which is necessary to carry out the relevant exposure tasks. Hence, the treatment proven to
      be most effective, which primary care services are commissioned to deliver, is too
      comprehensive and time consuming to be applied in real practice.

      The investigators believe that a possible solution to the above problem is to provide
      evidence-based CBT but with the exposure components carried out through Virtual Reality (VR)
      rather than in vivo. Some research has already been done with virtual reality and exposure
      therapy for anxiety disorders with promising results. The aim of this pilot study is to treat
      patients with agoraphobia with or with a history of panic disorder with a standardized
      exposure-based CBT-protocol through VR. The virtual environments that are used for the study
      are live sequences filmed in 360Â°. The investigators hypothesize that CBT with VR will be
      effective and lead to improvements on measures of panic disorder and agoraphobia.
