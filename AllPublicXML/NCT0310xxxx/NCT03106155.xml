      [Study Design] This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of vistusertib
      monotherapy in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) harboring RICTOR
      amplification. Patients will receive vistusertib monotherapy (50 mg BID per os every 12
      hours) until they demonstrate objective disease progression or they meet any other
      discontinuation criteria.

      [Primary Objective] To investigate the efficacy of vistusertib monotherapy in patients with
      relapsed SCLC patients harboring RICTOR amplification as 2nd or 3rd line therapy
