  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled study will be performed to compare the benefits and risks
      associated with the administration of misoprostol with or without the use of a transcervical
      balloon catheter to terminate pregnancy in the second trimester (defined as gestational age
      between 14 and 28 weeks of gestation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at Ain Shams Maternity Hospital. An open-label, parallel-arm,
      randomized controlled trial between two groups; each consisting of 54 women, undergoing
      termination of pregnancy during the second trimester for various medical reasons. The first
      group will receive the standard misoprostol protocol for termination of second trimester
      pregnancy currently practiced at Ain Shams Maternity Hospital; 400 micrograms of misoprostol
      administered vaginally for the first dose, followed after 6 hours by 400 micrograms
      administered orally, repeated every 6 hours till complete expulsion of the uterine contents
      or surgical interference is decided. The second group will receive the exact same regimen,
      but will have in addition a transcervical balloon (Foleys') catheter that will be inflated
      with 30 ml. of fluid; and will have weighted traction applied to the catheter through using a
      1000 ml fluid-filled bag in order to apply continuous pressure to the cervix. The target
      sample size was calculated to be 108 cases; randomization will be in a ratio of 1:1 using a
      computer-generated random sequence. Allocation will be concealed using sealed, opaque
      consecutively-numbered envelopes. Women are counseled about the procedure, consenting women
      will thus be randomly assigned to one of the groups.
