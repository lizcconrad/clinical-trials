    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect on the &quot;wearing-off&quot; phenomenon of 3
      different doses of nebicapone (NEB 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg), compared with entacapone and
      placebo when dministered concomitantly with existing treatment with levodopa plus a dopa
      decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI: carbidopa or benserazide).

    <textblock>
      The study was conducted in 40 sites in Europe and South America: Argentina (6); Austria (2);
      Brazil (5); France (1); Hungary (4); Poland (7); Portugal (2); Romania (7); and Ukraine (6).

      Multicentre study with a screening visit (Visit V1), a single-blind placebo run-in period of
      1 or 2 weeks (Period 1, Visits V2 to V3), and an 8-week randomised, double-blind, activeand
      placebo-controlled, parallel-group (5 groups) treatment period (Period 2, Visits V3 to V7).
      In Hungary only: a 1-week tapering-off period was added by amendment #1HU. The dosage of
      nebicapone was to be tapered off stepwise during 6 days. This period was to end with a
      follow-up Visit V8.
