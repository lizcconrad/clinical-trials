      The goal of the proposed research is multi-step, through a series of sub-studies that build
      on each other as part of a comprehensive line of investigation into the use of interactive
      mobile games as interventions and/or data collection tools around smoking and tobacco
      products in teens.

    <description>The specific questions that will be used to assess &quot;change of intention to initiate smoking&quot; are adapted from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey. The questions incorporate a Likert-type scale, in which participants are asked if they plan to use different tobacco products in the next year and if they would accept offers of different tobacco products from friends and/or family members. For all these questions, participants can choose from four possible responses: definitely not, probably not, probably yes, and definitely yes.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self-efficacy for refusing offers of cigarettes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Research assistants will individually administer in-person questionnaires to participants at baseline and again at 12-weeks. The specific questions that will be used to assess &quot;change in self-efficacy for refusing offers of cigarettes&quot; are adapted from the PlayForward Self-Efficacy Assessment (Fiellin et al., 2016). The questions incorporate a Likert-type scale, in which participants are asked how sure they are they could refuse offers for cigarettes, and can choose from four possible responses: not sure at all, not very sure, pretty sure, definitely sure. This assessment was originally developed using Carpenter et al.'s &quot;Development of a Drug Use Resistance Self-efficacy (DURSE) Scale (2009).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in percieved social norms related to smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Research assistants will individually administer in-person questionnaires to participants at baseline and again at 12-weeks. The specific questions that will be used to assess &quot;changes in perceived social norms related to smoking&quot; are adapted from &quot;Psychosocial Factors Associated with Adolescent Electronic Cigarette and Cigarette Use&quot; (Barrington-Trimis et al, 2015) and the Global Youth Tobacco Survey. The questions either take the form of &quot;How many of your 4 closest friends use these products?&quot; or incorporate a Likert-type scale, in which participants indicate how their friends would act towards them if they used these products, choosing from four possible responses: very unfriendly, unfriendly, friendly, or very friendly.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in attitudes about smoking</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Research assistants will individually administer in-person questionnaires to participants at baseline and again at 12-weeks. The specific questions that will be used to assess &quot;changes in attitudes about smoking&quot; are adapted from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey and the National Youth Tobacco Survey. The questions incorporate Likert-type scales. For example, for some of these questions, participants indicate how harmful they believe smoking products are, choosing from four possible responses: no harm, little harm, some h arm, a lot of harm. In other questions, participants indicate where they stand on statements about these products, choosing from four possible responses: strongly agree, agree, disagree, or strongly agree.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in smoking behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking behavior will be defined as the quantity and frequency with which an individual uses cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, little cigars, any electronic cigarette products, or any other form of a tobacco product.
Research assistants will individually administer in-person questionnaires to participants at baseline and again at 12-weeks. The specific questions that will be used to assess &quot;changes in smoking behavior&quot; are adapted from questions on the National Youth Tobacco Survey. Participants are asked to indicate which, if any, products they've used in their lives, in the past 30 days, how often, and in what quantity.</description>
