  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Polyvagal Theory focuses on how function and structure changed in the vertebrate
      autonomic nervous system during evolution. The theory is named for the vagus, a major cranial
      nerve that regulates bodily state. As a function of evolution, humans and other mammals have
      a &quot;new&quot; vagal pathway that links the regulation of bodily state to the control of the muscles
      of the face and head including the middle ear muscles. These pathways regulating body state,
      facial gesture, listening (i.e., middle ear muscles), and vocal communication collectively
      function as a Social Engagement System (SES). Because the Social Engagement System is an
      integrated system, interventions influencing one component of this system (e.g., middle ear
      muscles) may impact on the other components.

      Individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) exhibit many behaviors that are consistent with
      a compromised Social Engagement System. Atypical function of the Social Engagement System
      results in problems associated with state regulation (e.g., impulsivity, tantrums, and
      difficulty with change in routine), ingestion (e.g., difficulties in sucking at birth,
      hyperphagia), coordination of suck/swallow/breathe, intonation of vocalizations, auditory
      processing and hypersensitivity, and socialization. We propose to confirm that several
      features of the behavioral phenotype of PWS may be explained within the context of a
      dysfunctional SES (Specific Aim I), which may be partially rehabilitated via an intervention
      designed as a 'neural exercise' of the SES (Specific Aim II).

      Specific Aims:

      Aim I: To demonstrate that children with PWS have atypical regulation of the SES. We
      hypothesize these effects will be manifested by dampened vagal regulation of the heart (low
      parasympathetic tone); poor middle ear muscle regulation resulting in auditory
      hypersensitivities and poor auditory processing; lack of voice intonation (prosody), and
      difficulties in accurately detecting the emotions of others.

      Aim II: To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Listening Project Protocol (LPP) in
      decreasing the atypical features of the SES in adolescents with PWS. We hypothesize that
      individuals who complete the LPP will have improved vagal regulation of the heart, improved
      middle ear muscle regulation, increased voice intonation and improved ability to accurately
      detect the emotions of others.

    <description>The filtered music intervention will consist of listening to computer-altered acoustic stimulation, designed to modulate the frequency band of vocal music passed to the participant. The frequency characteristics of the acoustic stimulation are selected to emphasize the relative importance of specific frequencies in conveying the information embedded in human speech Modulation of the acoustic energy within the frequencies of human voice, similar to an exaggerated vocal prosody, are hypothesized to recruit and modulate the neural regulation of the middle ear muscles and to functionally reduce sound hypersensitivities and improve auditory processing.</description>
