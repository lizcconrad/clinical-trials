  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to test the magnitude and duration of analgesia provided by single dose
      multi-drug analgesia administered for perianal block, and compare with standard solution
      (Marcaine &amp; Lidocaine in 1:1 mixture - Total 60 ml), at post-operative period and also to
      compare with the standard solution including their respective post-operative opioid or
      non-opioid oral analgesic requirement. Local anesthesia via a perianal block using multi-drug
      analgesia or standard solution will be compared using the Numeric pain rating scale on
      Post-operative day 1, 3 and during follow up visit on day 7. The investigators hope to find a
      better control of post-operative analgesia which will lead to better functional outcomes.
      Possible decrease consumption of opioids in the post-operative period will perhaps decrease
      the cost and chances of addiction and will increase patient comfort and compliance.

    <textblock>
      Post-operative analgesia after anorectal surgery still poses a significant problem. Technical
      or operator dependent factors have been proposed for causing severe pain post operatively.
      Many factors such as height of anastomosis, incorporation of smooth muscle, size of doughnut,
      and inclusion of squamous epithelium were considered to cause pain specially after
      hemorrhoidectomy. However, in spite of standardizing the techniques, patients still
      experience moderate to severe pain after anorectal surgery. Effective post-surgical pain
      control is critical to patient recovery, and can contribute to improved healing, faster
      patient mobilization, reduced hospital stays and health care costs. Effective multimodal
      techniques have been devised to maximize pain relief, lower the risk of adverse events, and
      improve patient outcomes. These techniques (wound infiltration with local anesthetic being
      most common) is short lived, maximum up to 12 hours. Post-operative pain usually lasts for 72
      hours and thus the systemic opioids remain the mainstay pain control post-operatively.
      Although effective analgesics, they are associated with unwanted and potentially adverse
      events, such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, sedation, cognitive impairment, urinary
      retention, sleep disturbances, and respiratory depression. Also, narcotic addiction remains a
      concern for surgical patients. Some patients would like to have effective analgesia and thus
      also avoid narcotics.Multi-drug analgesic combinations are used in orthopedic surgery
      (Ropivacaine, Ketorolac, and Morphine, with adrenaline) and during hemorrhoidectomy
      (extended-release liposome Bupivacaine) which showed decrease in post-operative analgesia
      requirement. However, no studies that used multi-drug analgesia show any effect on the pain
      medication consumption after discharge for ambulatory surgery. The investigators have
      designed a novel multi-drug anesthetic formulation to achieve long-acting postoperative
      analgesia with single-dose administration intra-operative via perianal block and wound
      infiltration.
