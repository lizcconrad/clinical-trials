  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a sunitinib administration schedule
      2/1 (2 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week without) compared to a schedule 4/2 (4 weeks of
      treatment followed by 2 weeks without) on cardiopulmonary function in subjects with renal
      cell carcinoma. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to one of two arms: 4/2 schedule of sunitinib
      administration or 2/1 schedule of sunitinib administration. Cardiopulmonary function will be
      assessed at baseline, week 4 (4/2 schedule only), week 5 (2/1 schedule only) and week 12. The
      investigators hypothesize that schedule 2/1 of sunitinib is not only better tolerated but
      will be associated with less fatigue and functional cardiovascular/muscular toxicity than the
      4/2 schedule.

             Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a
             tubal ligation or hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth
             control pills, patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom
             or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD).
             Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected
             sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. If you do become pregnant during this
             study or if you have unprotected sex, you must inform your study physician
             immediately.

         13. For men who are sexually active, must agree to use a two medically acceptable forms of
             birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier method of
             contraception) in order to be in this study. Medically acceptable contraceptives
             include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a vasectomy), or (2) a condom used with a
             spermicide. Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after
             unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. Men must also agree to
             inform their partner of the potential for harm to an unborn child. She should know
             that if pregnancy occurs, the subject will need to report it to the study doctor, and
             she should promptly notify her doctor. The study doctor will ask if the subject's
             partner is willing to provide updates on the progress of the pregnancy and its
             outcome. If the subject's partner agrees, this information will be provided to Pfizer,
             Inc. for safety monitoring follow-up.
