  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study develop safety checklists for patients to use before, under and after in-hospital
      surgery. Patients and Healthcare personnel experiences and risk assesment are used to develop
      the checklists. The checklist intervention will be sequentially rolled out in a randomized
      order.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Focus group interviews of surgical patients and Healthcare personnel are used to reveal risk
      factors and to develop Patients Safety Checklists. Development will follow the steps in the
      Healthcare Failure Mode and Effects Analysis.

      The checklist intervention will be pilot tested and validated before is is rolled out.
      Patients safety checklists for patients to use are intended to enhance and increase patient
      involvement in surgical treatment. Further, using the checklists could contribute to reduced
      complications associated to surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  In study 1 and 2 the investigators include surgical patients with experience from
             included surgical departments in the two hospitals. Patients must be at age over 18
             years old, use Norwegian language, and have been operated 2-4 weeks before the focus
             group interview. The studies 1 and 2 includes a strategic sample consisting of gender
             mix, variation in age and in surgical procedures. For healthcare personnel the studies
             also require variation in clinical experience from the included surgical clusters.In
             study 3 the inclusion consists of surgical patients undergoing elective surgery.
             Inclusion criteria are reiterated from study 1 and 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In study 1 and 2 the investigators exclude patients that are less than 18 years of
             age, do not speak Norwegian, have low cognitive function. Patients must be able to
             consent for participation in focus group interviews. In study 3 the exclusion criteria
             patients not undergoing surgery. Exclusion criteria are reiterated from study 1 and 2.
