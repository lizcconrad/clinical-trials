  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle atrophy and insulin resistance are common after bed rest in healthy older adults.
      Metformin treatment has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and attenuate muscle loss
      in insulin resistance adults though the mechanisms are not fully known. Metformin used as a
      preventive strategy to maintain muscle and metabolic health in bed ridden older adults has
      not been investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalizations for disease, injury, and/or surgery in older adults are likely to impair
      physical mobility and, therefore, the older adults capacity to be physically active both
      during hospitalization and beyond. The resulting sedentary lifestyle is likely to be accepted
      as the &quot;new normal&quot;, ultimately increasing the risk of skeletal muscle and metabolic
      dysfunction (e.g. insulin resistance and sarcopenia).

      Muscle atrophy and insulin resistance are an unfortunate consequence with disuse in older
      adults. We have observed with our bed rest studies in healthy older adults that in addition
      to muscle and metabolic changes, we notice increased skeletal muscle inflammation, impaired
      glucose uptake signaling and an upregulation of enzymes related to de novo ceramide
      biosynthesis. The accumulation of ceramide, a toxic lipid intermediate, can disrupt glucose
      homeostasis and impair muscle growth. Metformin treatment has been shown to improve insulin
      sensitivity and attenuate muscle loss in insulin resistant adults through a mechanism that
      may involve ceramide synthesis. Metformin used as a preventive strategy to maintain muscle
      and metabolic health during a period of physical inactivity in older adults has not been
      investigated.

      Therefore, we have proposed to conduct a clinical study in older adults to test whether
      metformin treatment during bed rest will attenuate insulin resistance, muscle loss and
      accumulation of ceramides. These findings will be foundational for future development of
      treatments to prevent insulin resistance and muscle atrophy in inactive older adults.
