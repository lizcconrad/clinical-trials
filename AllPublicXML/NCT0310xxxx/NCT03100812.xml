  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention is part of a multi-year year grant awarded to the NYU Center for
      the Study of Asian American Health by to the National Institutes of Health/National Center
      for Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIH/NCMHD). The funding mechanism is specifically
      the NCMHD Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Initiative in Reducing and
      Eliminating Health Disparities: Intervention Research Phase (R24).

      The objective of this study is to implement and assess the efficacy of a Community Health
      worker (CHW) intervention to improve hypertension management and access to care among
      Filipino Americans living in New York and New Jersey. It is believed that when compared to
      individuals receiving the less intensive CHW intervention, Filipino Americans receiving the
      more intensive CHW intervention will:

      H1: Exhibit greater compliance with appointment keeping. H2: Exhibit greater compliance with
      medication taking H3: Show greater reductions in mean systolic and mean diastolic blood
      pressure. H4: Be more likely to exhibit controlled blood pressure
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Filipino Americans exhibit high rates of hypertension and are therefore at high risk for
      cardiovascular disease and stroke. However, few interventions have been developed and
      implemented for this population to address these concerns. A CHW intervention, developed with
      community input to ensure its cultural and linguistic appropriateness, has the potential to
      prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke by helping Filipino Americans control their blood
      pressure. This study has the overall goal of improving health access and cardiovascular
      health status, particularly hypertension, in the Filipino American community living in New
      York City and New Jersey through the use of Community Health Workers (CHW).

    <description>Group A participants will attend 4 monthly 90 minute group health education sessions that provide the tools and strategies to promote heart health to Filipino American individuals, families, and communities on high blood pressure and CVD. The CHWs will lead these sessions utilizing NHLBI's Healthy Heart Healthy Family, A CHW's Manual for the Filipino Community. Each of the group health education sessions will discuss different content related to CVD, hypertension, and other CVD risk factors. The first session focuses on assessing heart disease risk and recognition of heart attack signs. The second session focuses on physical activity and weight management and blood pressure control. The third session addresses control of cholesterol, and diabetes. The final 4th session teaches participants about nutrition and living smoke free.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The population of interest is Filipino American men and women residing in New York
             City. An individual is eligible for the CHW intervention if he/she is

               1. of Filipino descent,

               2. an English or Tagalog-speaker

               3. a resident of New York City.

               4. identified as hypertensive based on

          -  The average of the 2nd and 3rd readings from both arms (right arm) with at least 1
             high systolic BP (&gt;140mmHg) or 1 high diastolic BP reading (&gt;90mmHg) for nondiabetics,
             or 1 high systolic BP (&gt;130mmHg) or 1 high diastolic BP reading (&gt;80mmHg) for
             diabetics at point of screening for this study.

          -  Or if participant reports to be taking antihypertensive medication. Therefore this
             study will include individuals with untreated hypertension (not taking
             antihypertensive medication), uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. elevated blood pressure
             despite taking antihypertensive medication), and controlled hypertension (i.e. taking
             antihypertensive medication but BP is under control). Individuals presenting with
             untreated high blood pressure will be referred to a physician to confirm diagnosis of
             hypertension.

             treatment is beyond the scope of this CHW intervention

          5. has a blood pressure average below 140/90 for non-diabetics and not taking
             antihypertensive medication, and an average of 130/80 for diabetics not taking
