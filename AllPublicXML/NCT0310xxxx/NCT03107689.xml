  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the case characteristics of patients who receive
      intravenous lipid emulsion therapy. Previous literature to date has focused on animal studies
      or has been primarily limited to case reports or small case series. This prospectively
      collected data set will permit a much more detailed description of the use of lipid, its
      potential benefits, and potential harms.

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the case characteristics of patients who receive
      intravenous lipid emulsion therapy. A secondary objective is to determine the mortality in
      this critically ill population of individuals.

      Previous literature to date has focused on animal studies or has been primarily limited to
      case reports or small case series. This prospectively collected data set will permit a much
