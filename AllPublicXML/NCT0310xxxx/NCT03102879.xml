  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the dental survival in a period of 2 years of mature permanent teeth with apical
      lesion following the administration of encapsulated Mesenchymal Stem Cells under a
      regenerative endodontic procedure and a conventional root canal treatment.

      This is a controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the survival of mature permanent
      teeth with apical lesion treated with regenerative endodontic procedure (REP) based on
      encapsulated Mesenchymal Stem Cells in a biological scaffold. The REP will be compared to the
      conventional endodontic therapy. The REP is based on the use of umbilical cord-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in a plasma-derived biomaterial . The study group will
      use the disinfection protocol, indicated in the clinical considerations for regenerative
      procedures as recommended by the American Association of Endodontics, using a paste of
      calcium hydroxide prepared with double-distilled water as intracanal medication, and will be
      operated with REP using allogeneic stem cells in a scaffold, while the control group will be
      operated with conventional endodontic therapy alone. This clinical trial pretends to
      determine the dental survival of the tooth with mature apex and apical lesion, over a period
      of 2 years.

    <description>• Survival (period 2 years): The primary outcome measure for this study is to evaluate the survival of the tooth through the retention of the tooth in the mouth. This parameter will be evaluated 24 months after the intervention is completed.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>• Change in pulpal response (period 2 years) will be assessed through sensitivity tests (cold, heat and electricity), and laser doppler flow cytometry. The pulp status will be evaluated 1 week after intervention is completed, then at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.</description>

    <measure>Change in apical lesion size</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>• Change in apical lesion size will be evaluated by standardized periapical radiography at 6,12, 18 and 24 months after intervention is completed. It will also be evaluated by Cone Beam 12 months after the procedure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>• Change in symptoms will be evaluated with percussion of the tooth. This will be monitored 1 week after the operation is completed, then at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tooth color</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 months, 24 months.</time_frame>
    <description>This will be evaluated comparing the color and translucency differences, between teeth with REP and the standard procedure. This will be normalized with the corresponding control teeth from each patient. This will be monitored 12 and 24 months after the operation is completed.</description>
