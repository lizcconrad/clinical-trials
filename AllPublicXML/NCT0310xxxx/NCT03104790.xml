      LAIV shedding studies in children could be an important way to confirm whether impediments to
      viral replication do indeed explain these observed reductions in vaccine effectiveness(VE),
      whether prior vaccination has any influence on replication and what future implications (if
      any) this might have for the UK paediatric LAIV programme. LAIV virus replication in children
      will be dependent on virological and host factors. The virus factors include replicative
      fitness of individual strains and the susceptibility to inhibition by other replicating
      strains (ability to compete). Host factors which may influence this include pre-existing
      specific immunity as a result of prior infection or previous vaccination (with either LAIV or
      IIV), and innate immune factors including mucosal immunity. Understanding the relative
      importance of different factors over two seasons when the strain composition of the
      A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV virus will change and by comparing previously unvaccinated and highly
      vaccinated groups (with both LAIV and IIV), can potentially give unique insights into their
      contribution to the US LAIV observations.

      With the change of the A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain in 2017/18, demonstrating improved
      performance (in terms of VE, virus shedding and immunogenicity) and what contribution prior
      vaccination might make will be key evidence for both the UK, but also the US. Information
      presented at the ACIP in June 2018 from the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons will be key to inform
      US future decisions around use of LAIV.

      This is a parallel group, non randomised study which will enrol at least 400 children. Both
      written informed consent from parent/ guardian and written assent from the child will be in
      place prior to any study procedure. The two groups will be defined by previous influenza
      vaccination history, with around half the children naïve to any influenza vaccination (LAIV
      or IIV) and half having had at least three doses of LAIV with or without IIV. All will follow
      the same schedule of vaccination and oral fluid collection at day 0 (by the nurse in the home
      or at the GP surgery); nasal swab collection (by the parent at home on days 1,3,6); day 21
      oral fluid collection (by nurse or parent at home or at GP surgery).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States of America (USA) has a long-standing paediatric influenza vaccination
      programme, including use of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Following evidence of
      lack effectiveness of LAIV in 2015/16, the USA suspended use in the 2016/17 season. The UK
      introduced LAIV for children in 2013/14 and has since been closely monitoring programme
      performance. In 2015/16, the UK - in contrast to the USA - found evidence of significant
      effectiveness of LAIV against laboratory confirmed influenza in both primary and secondary
      care including against A/H1N1pdm09. The UK results concord with those from several other
      geographical settings, although several studies report relatively lower effectiveness of LAIV
      against A/H1N1pdm09 infection compared to inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). The reasons
      for these apparent differences in effectiveness are currently unclear.

      The USA has indicated that for the Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practice (ACIP) to
      rescind their decision to suspend use of LAIV, they will require an understanding of the
      likely underlying mechanism for the apparent reduction in LAIV A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine
      effectiveness (VE) measured in observational studies in the USA and then evidence that the
      problem has been resolved.

      Several hypotheses are emerging to explain the apparent reduction in A/H1N1pdm09 quadrivalent
      LAIV effectiveness in the USA last season and their discordance with findings elsewhere
      including the UK together with the possible lower effectiveness of LAIV against A/H1N1pdm09
      compared to IIV. These include one or more of the following:

        1. Center for Disease Control (CDC)/ Department of Defense (DoD) specific finding - related
           to chance, methodology, programmatic issues

        2. Reduced replicative fitness of the current A/H1N1pdm09 strain.

        3. Viral interference/competition between A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain and other vaccine
           viruses in multivalent formulation;

        4. Prior vaccination with LAIV or IIV resulting in specific immunological interference with
           H1N1pdm09 vaccine virus replication;

        5. Repeat LAIV vaccination resulting in broader, longer term immunological changes
           affecting all viruses (mimicking adult response);

        6. Combinations of the above Based upon in vitro studies, the manufacturer of LAIV
           (MedImmune) have stated that reduced replicative fitness of the A/H1N1pdm09 strain is
           likely to be the important root cause. However, this factor alone cannot explain the
           difference in effectiveness observed between the USA and sites elsewhere including the
           UK. This suggests that there is an important additional factor(s) involved. The US
           programme has been running for many more years than the UK - and in addition children 6
           months to 24 months of age are offered IIV, unlike the UK. These prior vaccine exposures
           are potential contributory factors.

      LAIV shedding studies in children could be an important way to confirm whether impediments to
      viral replication do indeed explain these observed reductions in VE, whether prior
      vaccination has any influence on replication and what future implications (if any) this might
      have for the UK paediatric LAIV programme. LAIV virus replication in children will be
      dependent on virological and host factors. The virus factors include replicative fitness of
      individual strains and the susceptibility to inhibition by other replicating strains (ability
      to compete). Host factors which may influence this include pre-existing specific immunity as
      a result of prior infection or previous vaccination (with either LAIV or IIV), and innate
      immune factors including mucosal immunity. Understanding the relative importance of different
      factors over two seasons when the strain composition of the A/H1N1pdm09 LAIV virus will
      change and by comparing previously unvaccinated and highly vaccinated groups (with both LAIV
      and IIV), can potentially give unique insights into their contribution to the US LAIV
      observations.

      With the change of the A/H1N1pdm09 vaccine strain in 2017/18, demonstrating improved
      performance (in terms of VE, virus shedding and immunogenicity) and what contribution prior
      vaccination might make will be key evidence for both the UK, but also the US. Information
      presented at the ACIP in June 2018 from the 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons will be key to inform
      US future decisions around use of LAIV.

      This is a parallel group, non randomised study which will enrol at least 400 children. Both
      written informed consent from parent/ guardian and written assent from the child will be in
      place prior to any study procedure. The two groups will be defined by previous influenza

             [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england/series/immunisation
             -against-infectious-disease-the-green-book]

          -  Written informed consent given by parent/ guardian and assent from child (both must be
             in place to proceed)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children may not be included in the study if any of the following apply:

          1. Admission to Paediatric ntensice care unit (PICU) for invasive ventilation due to a
             respiratory illness in the preceding 2 years.

               1. Hypersensitivity to the active ingredients, gelatin or gentamicin (a possible
                  trace residue)

               2. Previous systemic allergic reaction to LAIV

               3. Previous allergic reaction to an influenza vaccine (not LAIV) is a relative
                  contra-indication, which must be discussed with the CI to confirm patient
                  suitability

               4. Children/adolescents who are clinically immunodeficient due to conditions or
                  immunosuppressive therapy such as: acute and chronic leukaemias; lymphoma;
                  symptomatic HIV infection; cellular immune deficiencies; and high-dose
                  corticosteroids*.

                  *High-dose steroids is defined as a treatment course for at least one month,
                  equivalent to a dose greater than 20mg prednisolone per day (any age), or for
                  children under 20kg, a dose greater than 1mg/kg/day.

                  NB: LAIV is not contraindicated for use in individuals with asymptomatic HIV
                  infection; or individuals who are receiving topical/inhaled/low-dose oral
                  systemic corticosteroids or those receiving corticosteroids as replacement
                  therapy, e.g. for adrenal insufficiency.

               5. Children / adolescents younger than 18 years of age receiving salicylate therapy
                  because of the association of Reye's syndrome with salicylates and wild-type
                  influenza infection.

               6. Pregnancy

          3. Contraindications to vaccination on that occasion, e.g. due to child being acutely
             unwell:

               1. Febrile ≥38.0oC in last 72 hours

               2. **Acute wheeze in last 72 hours requiring treatment beyond that normally
                  prescribed for regular use by the child's treating healthcare professional

               3. **Recent admission to hospital in last 2 weeks for acute asthma

               4. **Current oral steroid for asthma exacerbation or course completed within last 2
                  weeks

               5. Any other significant condition or circumstance which, in the opinion of the
                  investigator, may either put the participant at risk because of participation in
                  the study, or may influence the result of the study, or the participant's ability
                  to participate in the study.

                    -  Items 3b-3d are relative contra-indications: Many children with
                       &quot;difficult-to-control&quot; symptoms fail to meet these criteria on a routine
                       basis. Where these are present, the CI is able to authorise participation on
                       a case-by-case basis, after assessing the child at the time of enrolment.

        Administration of another live vaccine (e.g. MMR) within the previous 4 weeks is no longer
        a contra-indication to LAIV administration, according to updated UK Department of Health
        guidelines.

        NB: See Summary of Product Characteristics for full details of contra-indications to LAIV.
