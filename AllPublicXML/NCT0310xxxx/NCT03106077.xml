  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if mirvetuximab soravtansine can help to
      control either newly diagnosed or metastatic (has spread) triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC).

      Mirvetuximab soravtansine is designed to stop cell growth by blocking certain proteins in the
      cancer cells related to the mineral folate. This is believed to cause the cancer cells to
      die.

      There are 2 cohorts in this study. If participant has metastatic TNBC, participant will be in
      Cohort A. If participant has newly diagnosed TNBC, participant will be in Cohort B.

      Study Drug Administration:

      On Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, participant will receive mirvetuximab soravtansine by vein
      over about 2-3 hours. If participant cannot tolerate the study drug, participant's dose may
      be lowered or stopped.

      Length of Study:

      If participant is in Cohort A, participant may receive mirvetuximab soravtansine for as long
      as the study doctor thinks it is in participant's best interest. If participant is in Cohort
      B, participant may receive mirvetuximab soravtansine for up to 4 cycles. After 4 cycles,
      participant will have surgery as part of participant's standard care.

      Participant will no longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if participant is unable to follow study directions.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine will
           be collected for a pregnancy test.

      Participant will come back to the clinic on Day 2 of Cycles 1-3. At these visits,
      participant's vital signs will be collected and the study doctor or study staff will check on
      participant's health.

      On Days 8 and 15 of Cycles 1-3, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      During even-numbered cycles (Cycles 2, 4, 6, and so on):

        -  Participant will have imaging scans. The study doctor will tell participant what type of
           scans participant will have.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after participant's last cycle of study drug:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, participant will have an eye exam.

        -  Participant will have imaging scans.

        -  If participant is in Cohort B, participant will have a core tumor biopsy to check the
           status of the disease.

      If participant is in Cohort B, participant will have surgery as part of participant's
      standard treatment.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days after participant's last dose of study drug:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If participant did not have them performed at the end-of-treatment visit, participant
           will have imaging scans.

        -  If participant can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample or urine will
           be collected for a pregnancy test.

      Participant will continue to have imaging scans every 12 weeks for up to 1 year after
      participant's first dose of study drug. If the disease gets worse or participant starts a new
      anti-cancer therapy, these scans will stop.

      This is an investigational study. Mirvetuximab soravtansine is not FDA approved or
      commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain more and answer questions for how the study drug is designed to
      work.

      Up to 57 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

             HER2 0-1+ by IHC or 2+, FISH &lt; 2, gene copy number &lt; 4.

          4. (For Cohort A) - Archived tissue available at pre-screening to confirm FR alpha+
             breast cancer.

          5. (For Cohort A) Archived tissue available pre-screening to confirm FR alpha+ breast
             cancer. (For Cohort B) Confirmed FRalpha+ breast cancer defined as high FRalpha
             expression: =/&gt;75% of cells having =/&gt;1+ expression, or moderate FRalpha expression:
             25%-74% of cells with =/&gt;1+ expression.

          6. (For Cohort A) Measurable disease per RECIST. (For cohort B) Clinical or radiologic
             primary tumor size of at least 1.5cm prior to enrollment onto protocol 2014-0185
             (ARTEMIS). Primary tumor of at least 1.0 cm or evidence of continued lymphnode
             involvement by imaging (ultrasound or MRI) after Adriamycin-based neoadjuvant therapy.

          7. (For cohort B): primary tumor sample collected before NACT started (on ARTEMIS) and
             underwent molecular testing for integral biomarkers including immunohistochemical
             assessment of FRalpha.

          8. (For cohort A): no limit on prior therapies for metastatic disease. (Relapse of
             disease within 6 months of adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is considered 1 line
             of therapy for metastatic disease). (For cohort B): received at least one dose of an
             anthracycline-based NACT. Patients are eligible if therapy was discontinued due to
             disease progression or therapy intolerance. Patients with disease progression on
             anthracycline-based therapy should be evaluated by the surgical team. If the patient
             is deemed inoperable at the time of evaluation, the patient may continue to undergo
             protocol therapy with a goal of reduction in tumor size to become operable. If the
             patient is deemed at high risk of becoming inoperable by the surgical team based upon
             tumor size or location, the patient will be considered ineligible for study and will
             be recommended to go to surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating women.

          2. Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered
