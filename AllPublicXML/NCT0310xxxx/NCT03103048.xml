  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be featured as a randomized controlled. As the dependent variable, was
      considered isometric grip manual force. As independent variable, the presence or absence of
      forearm bandage in the fist flexor region of the volunteers.

      This study is directed to the population of students at the University of Mogi das Cruzes
      (UMC), and will take part of this study forty volunteers, twenty men and twenty women, aged
      from eighteen and thirty-eight years old. Will be selected and included volunteers who do not
      do physical professional activity with upper members, which have no symptom of pain skeletal
      muscle in the upper members, which have not undergone any type of surgery in the region of
      the forearm and hand of both members. Will be excluded the volunteers who have injuries,
      joint injuries, neuromuscular disorder or those who have knowledge of own vestibular or
      neurological changes. Will also be excluded from study volunteers who do not agree to
      participate after reading and understanding of informed consent in accordance with resolution
      466/12 of the National Ethics Committee and Research. The data acquisition interface will be
      acquired by an electromyography e a standard of strentgh will maintened in forty Newtons
      assured by an electronic dynamometer for tests of palmar prehension without and with
      bandages. The volunteers will not know what kind of intervention will pass. After each
      application before testing, their both forearms will be covered with a protection. The
      researcher and the volunteers will not know the tests order.
