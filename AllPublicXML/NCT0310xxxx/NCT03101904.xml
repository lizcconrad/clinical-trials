    <textblock>
      The study will aim to describe and evaluate the effect of chronic beetroot juice
      supplementation on acute mountain sickness symptoms and exercise in a hypoxic environment. It
      is hypothesized that beetroot supplementation will decrease acute mountain sickness and
      increase exercise performance.

    <measure>Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS-C) as assessed by the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on the fifth day of supplementation with a six-hour exposure to hypoxia</time_frame>
    <description>Acute Cerebral Mountain Sickness score (AMS-C) calculated from the 11-item Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire (ESQ; Sampson et al., 1994). Participants rate the severity of each item from one to five, and the ratings were multiplied by their factorial loadings and summed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypoxic Exercise Performance as assessed by time to exhaustion at 80% of hypoxic V̇O2max reserve.</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on the sixth day of supplementation</time_frame>
    <description>On day six of each supplementation protocol, participants complet a time to exhaustion test at 80% of their hypoxic V̇O2max reserve in acute hypoxia (FiO2 14.1%, equivalent 3225 m). Maximal exercise performance is defined as time to exhaustion (TTE) determined by the time from onset of test to task failure (volitional exhaustion or inability to maintain treadmill speed).</description>
