      An early feasibility study to investigate the safety and feasibility of the Lungpacer
      Diaphragm Pacing Therapy System (DPTS) as a therapy to recondition and strengthen the
      diaphragm of patients who have been intubated and invasively mechanically ventilated for &gt; or
      = 7 days, have failed two or more spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and were not
      hypervolemic during the latest SBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation (MV) is a life saving technology but can also cause damage to the
      lungs and diaphragm such as ventilator induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Research has
      shown that after being on mandatory MV and sedated the diaphragm begins to atrophy within as
      little as 18 hours. The DPTS is a temporary therapy that consists of the Lungpacer
      IntraVenous Electrode Catheter (LIVE Catheter) and the lungpacer Control Unit (LCU) system.
      The LIVE Catheter is a proprietary central venous catheter that incorporates pacing
      electrodes in strategic areas that align with the left and right phrenic nerves in order to
      stimulate the nerves to recruit the diaphragm. The LIVE Catheter can also be used for fluid
      delivery like any other central venous catheter. This early feasibility trial will
      investigate the safety and feasibility of the DPTS as a therapy to recondition and strengthen
      the diaphragm by stimulating the diaphragm through daily sessions so the patient may be more
      quickly liberated from MV. The patient population includes those who have been mechanically
      ventilated for &gt; or = to 7 days, have failed two or more SBTs, and were not hypervolemic
      during the latest SBT. Patients must have resolution of the initial indication for placement
      on MV before entering the trial.
