  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects with
      moderately to severely active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) who have an inadequate response or
      are intolerant to conventional disease-modifying therapy. A total of approximately 124
      subjects will be randomized to one of 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio: oral filgotinib
      tablets q.d. or matching placebo tablets q.d. The Screening visit will occur within 28 days
      before study drug administration. At Day 1 (Baseline), eligible subjects will be randomized
      to treatment for a duration of 16 weeks. The study is concluded with a Follow-up period
      lasting until 4 weeks after the last dose. Consequently, each subject will stay in the study
      for a maximum of 24 weeks (from Screening visit to Follow-up visit).
