  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 100 (50 from TMU Hospital and 50 from Wellcome Clinic) current smokers will be
      recruited who contact smoke cession clinics in teaching hospitals of Taipei Medical
      University (TMU) and Wellcome Clinic. They will be randomly assigned either to Usual Care
      (UC) or Usual Care plus 3M4Chan Intervention group (IG). A randomized comparative
      effectiveness trial will be conducted. Patient will enroll from September 2017 to May 2018.
      In UC group, the physician provides a brief advice to quit during first consultation, a quit
      plan template, and medication prescription (Varenicline, Bupropion, Champix, Nicotinell
      TTS20) as decided by the physician. IG group includes UC plus a mobile App that is programmed
      to push tailored messages for health concern and readiness to quit, tips for sustaining
      abstinence, use of interactive self-assessments, helpful cessation information. This group of
      smokers will benefit from tailored cessation interventions with integrated body weight
      management elements that take into consideration the prevailing local and cultural influences
      on diet and levels of physical activity. IG will be continued even after stopping of the UC.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking cessation rate at two months</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking cessation rate will be measured as the ratio of the total number of patients who relapsed with total number of patients in their group. Patients will be considered to have relapsed if they fail at least one of their urine cotinine and carbon monoxide tests.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking cessation rate at four months</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking cessation rate will be measured as the ratio of the total number of patients who relapsed with total number of patients in their group. Patients will be considered to have relapsed if they fail at least one of their urine cotinine and carbon monoxide tests.</description>

    <measure>Smoking cessation rate at six months</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking cessation rate will be measured as the ratio of the total number of patients who relapsed with total number of patients in their group. Patients will be considered to have relapsed if they fail at least one of their urine cotinine and carbon monoxide tests.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User engagement at an individual level</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Engagement at individual level will be assessed based on the rate of read messages by the patients. This is calculated as the quotient between the messages the patients have read, and the total number of messages the system has sent to the patients. This metric will be assessed throughout the observation until its end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement at aggregated level - Mobile application rolling retention</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of users still active N days after installation. This is a ratio of the number of users whose last day of activity is past day N to the number of users who could have been active on day N. This metric will be assessed throughout the observation until its end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement at aggregated level - Mobile application session length distribution</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The session length is defined as the length of time between the start of the application event and the end of the application event. The session length determines the engagement as it is relevant to know how much time patients spend in the app per session. This metric will be assessed throughout the observation until its end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement at aggregated level - Mobile application session frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The session frequency is a measure of how often each unique patient used the app within a given time interval. This metric will be assessed throughout the observation until its end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement at aggregated level - Mobile application sessions per user</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A session is one use of the mobile application by a patient. This begins when the application is launched and ends when the application is terminated. This metric will be assessed throughout the observation until its end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Engagement at aggregated level - Mobile application return rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Return rate measures the percentage of patients who return to the app on a specific time after installation. It is measured by cohort group - that is, based on when patients first opened the app. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of users active on a given period to the size of the cohort. This metric will be assessed throughout the observation until its end.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User quitting attempts</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
