    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a topical nanoparticle paclitaxel ointment (SOR007) for the treatment of
      cutaneous metastases from non-melanoma cancer in adults. Three concentrations of SOR007 will
      be evaluated in dose-rising cohorts of three. An expanded cohort will treat additional
      subjects at the maximum tolerated dose.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-rising study evaluating the safety, tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of three concentrations of SOR007 (Uncoated Nanoparticle Paclitaxel)
      Ointment (0.15%, 1.0%, and 2.0%) applied to non-ulcerated, non-melanoma cutaneous metastases.
      A treatment area of 50 cm2 will be selected by the Investigator. Using a gloved hand,
      subjects will apply one Finger Tip Unit (FTU) of SOR007 to the 50 cm2 treatment area twice
      daily at approximately the same time each day for 28 days. At each visit (Days 1, 8, 15, 29,
      and 43), at least two color photographs of the treatment area will be taken (with a ruler for
      scale). All eligible lesions within the treatment area will be measured using ImageJ and the
      photographs taken at each visit. Eligible lesions will be determined at baseline by the
      RECIST definition of measurable tumors (≥ 10mm in its longest diameter). The study will
      include a dose escalation phase and a dose expansion phase.

      In the dose escalation phase, formal safety reviews will be conducted after the last subject
      in each cohort of three subjects completes 15 days of treatment. The next dose level will
      enroll upon a finding of safety and tolerability. The top dose or the maximum tolerated dose
      (if DLT occurs) will be taken into the dose expansion phase and additional subjects will be
      enrolled to reach a maximum of 12 subjects at that dose.

    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-rising trial of three concentrations of SOR007 (0.15%, 1.0%, 2.0%).
During the dose escalation phase, the study will follow a standard 3+3 dose-ascending design. If a single dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is identified in one of three subjects in the cohort, a further three subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level. If one or more DLT occur in the three additional subjects enrolled in the cohort, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be regarded as the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and taken forward into the dose expansion phase. If no further DLT are identified, dose escalation will continue, until either a DLT is identified at a higher dose or the top dose of 2% is reached.
In the dose expansion phase, additional subjects will be enrolled up to a maximum of 12 subjects at the dose determined to be the MTD (or the top dose, 2.0% SOR007).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Efficacy will be determined by the difference in the total area of eligible lesion(s) in the treatment area between baseline and Day 43 using analysis of photographs (taken at baseline and on Day 43) with a calibrated grid measurement system (ImageJ freeware) provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

    <description>Objective Clinical Response (Complete Clinical Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) is defined as the percentage of study subjects who achieve complete clinical response or partial response 14 days after last treatment (Day 43).
Complete clinical response (CR) is defined as absence of any detectable residual disease in the treatment area; partial response (PR) as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of eligible lesion(s) within the treatment area compared to baseline; progressive disease (PD) as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of eligible lesion(s) within the treatment area, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm); and stable disease (SD) as between that defined as PR or PD. Eligible lesions will be determined at baseline by the RECIST definition of measurable tumors (≥ 10mm in its longest diameter).</description>
