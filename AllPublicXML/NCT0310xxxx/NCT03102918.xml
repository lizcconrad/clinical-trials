      Investigators aim to determine Epidiolex's promise as a pharmacotherapy for cannabis use
      disorder. Investigators hypothesize that Epidiolex, when added to medical management, will
      result in greater reductions in marijuana use compared to placebo as measured by the 2
      primary outcome measures: 1) quantitative THC levels and 2) self-report by Timeline Follow
      Back. Secondary outcome measures will include treatment retention, patient satisfaction,
      cannabis withdrawal, cannabis craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, , compliance,
      and cigarette use.

      Investigators will conduct a Stage 1 pilot feasibility study at McLean Hospital to begin to
      evaluate Epidiolex as a pharmacotherapy for adults with cannabis use disorder. In this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, cannabis-dependent subjects ages 18-65
      will receive medical management over a 6-week period, with half receiving Epidiolex treatment
      and half receiving placebo. Participants will receive either up to 800 mg Epidiolex or
      placebo over a 6-week treatment period. Following treatment completion, participants will
      have a follow-up visits at 10 and 14 weeks. Primary outcomes will include self-report of
      cannabis smoking and results of quantitative urine drug screens for cannabis. Secondary
      outcome measures will include treatment retention, patient satisfaction, cannabis withdrawal,
      cannabis craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, compliance, and cigarette use.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age range 18-65 years
