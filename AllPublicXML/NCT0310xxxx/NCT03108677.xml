  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether the profile of RNA from circulating exosomes
      can be used as a biomarker for lung metastases of primary high-grade osteosarcoma.
      Circulating exosomes plays roles in metastases in many kinds of cancer including
      osteosarcoma. By RNA profiling researchers may find lung metastases earlier than conventional
      work-up and predict the oncological outcomes.

      Investigators have performed a 4 patients pilot study under the oversight of hospital's
      ethics committee, and investigator found that the levels and mutations of circulating exosome
      RNA from patients with or without lung metastasis have significant differences. Then
      investigators wish to register this study to do a further research, in order to reveal the
      roles of circulating exosome RNA in metastases of osteosarcoma.
