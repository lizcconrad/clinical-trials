  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Mokhuri intensive
      treatment program regarding pain and function before and after treatment between a group
      receiving the Mokhuri intensive treatment program (Chuna, acupuncture, and patient education)
      for five weeks and another group receiving non-surgical conventional standard treatment
      (drugs for pain relief, epidural steroid injection treatment, and physical therapy).

      The trial will be conducted through international cooperation between Mayo Clinic in the
      United States and Mokhuri Oriental Medicine Hospital in Korea. All subjects in Korea and the
      US will be selected based on the same inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. All subjects
      in the treatment arm will receive the same treatment in Korea and the US. In collaboration
      and with the support of Mayo Clinic's Department of Integrative Medicine and Health, and to
      ensure treatment consistency between Korea and the US, an acupuncturist from the USA will
      travel to Korea and train on-site for one month in Mokhuri hospital.

      The trial subjects who agree to participate in the clinical trial after providing informed
      consent will receive the required examinations and tests according to the clinical trial
      plan. If they are appropriate for this clinical trial and eligible based on the Inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, they will be randomly assigned to the group that will undergo the focused
      Mokhuri intensive treatment program and to the group that will receive non-surgical
      conventional treatment on their second visit. All the subjects in this study will be educated
      regarding the study procedure and scheduled visits and will participate in the allocated
      treatments for five weeks. Afterwards, clinical outcomes of both groups will be evaluated
      after end of the treatments from between a week and five weeks (within +7 days). The clinical
      trial ends after the follow-up evaluations that will take place 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 48 weeks,
      and 96 weeks after the end of the treatment evaluation.
