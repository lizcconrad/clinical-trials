  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To look for the replication of HHV6 by PCR in the skin, in these patients with haemopathies
      presenting an exanthema. This will make it possible to evaluate the prevalence of the
      positivity of this PCR in the skin. Then the investigator can investigate whether there is an
      association between the positivity of HHV6 PCR in the blood and / or skin and the viral
      etiology of the exanthema. If this association exists, it will make it possible to improve
      the diagnosis in the context of the exanthema and thus to improve the therapeutic management
      of these patients.
