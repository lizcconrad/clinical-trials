  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale : ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) has been extensively studied in adults,
      however, few data exist regarding VAP in the paediatric intensive care population. The
      Centers for Disease Control (CDC) definition for VAP is regularly updated trying to
      homogenised practice, and the last version for paediatrics has been published in 2015.
      According to the latest CDC definition, the investigators aim to study incidence of VAP in
      different paediatric intensive care units (PICUs), diagnostic methods of identifying VAP,
      microbiology of VAP, and utilisation of empirical antimicrobial therapy.

      Methods and population : a prospective multicentre observational study will be conducted in
      European PICUs for one year. All patients admitted to PICU aged more than 28 days and &lt; 18
      years, mechanically ventilated either by endotracheal or tracheostomy tube are included.
      Clinical data, ventilation settings, and risk factors for VAP are inserted daily in an
      electronic database on the internet. The investigators are going to identify patients, who
      presented one or more episodes of VAP during PICUs stay, analysing onset circumstances,
      diagnostic methods, bacteria pathogens identified, and antibiotic treatment. VAP incidence
      will be reported as number of events per 1,000 ventilator-days. Risk factors associated to
      VAP will be identified by univariate and multivariate analysis.

      Results and perspective : the investigators aim to define for the first time the incidence of
      VAP among European PICUs with a prospective and multicentre study. The identification of risk
      factors, diagnostic methods, epidemiology, treatment strategies will define the basis to
      start prevention manoeuvres and improve the clinical strategies for VAP in paediatric
      intensive care population.
