  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with sickle cell disease may be at risk for acute kidney injury during sickle cell
      crisis (pain or acute chest syndrome). This study will evaluate blood and urine biomarkers of
      kidney injury during an admission for crisis and during well clinic follow-up.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients admitted to the hospital for acute chest syndrome or vaso-occlusive pain events may
      consent to participate in this study. Patients will consent to daily blood and urine
      collection during their hospitalization and during well clinic visits.

      Each AM, participants will have blood and urine collected, processed, and strored for future
      analysis of biomarkers of injury. Patients will also have strict urine output recorded. Acute
      kidney injury (AKI) will be defined by the current KDIGO definition based on either a rise in
      serum creatinine or decline in urine output. Patient medical course will be reviewed to
      determine interventions and outcomes of their admission based on the development of AKI.

    <description>Evaluate the incidence of KDIGO defined AKI among patients admitted for pain or acute chest syndrome. AKI is defined by KDIGO as an increase in SCr by 50% or â‰¥0.3mg/dL from baseline, or UOP &lt;0.5mL/kg/hr for 12 hrs</description>

    <measure>Impact of Acute Kidney Injury during Pain or Acute Chest Syndrome Hospitalizations on the Development of Chronic Kidney Disease as defined by KDIGO.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>We will evaluate the impact of AKI on eGFR. To evaluate this impact, we will compare the change in eGFR, as measured by cystatin C, obtained from each patient during their non-acute clinic visit both immediately prior to their AKI events and after AKI events.</description>

    <measure>Impact of free heme and endothelin on development of AKI</measure>
    <time_frame>two years</time_frame>
    <description>We will test the hypothesis that free heme and endothelin are elevated in patients that develop AKI as compared to patients without AKI.</description>
