  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of new CE-labelled Phonak Hearing Systems is intended to be conducted
      on hard of participants with a hearing loss to grant quality control prior to product launch.
      The aim of the investigation series is to ensure zero-defect overall performance of the new
      hearing systems as well as maximum benefit for the participant with the devices in comparison
      to previously outstanding Phonak Hearing Systems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials in the way as planned for
      this study (&quot;phase of final inspection&quot;). This will be a controlled, single blinded and
      randomised active comparator clinical evaluation which will be conducted mono centric at
      Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

    <measure>Speech intelligibility in noise as signal to noise ratio in dB (dB SNR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as primary outcomes are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in noise will be assessed with the aid of the german Oldenburg sentence test. The result is the signal to noise ratio in dB (dB SNR). Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech intelligibility in percent in a quiet listening situation</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as secondary outcomes are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in quiet will be assessed with the aid of the german rhyme test &quot;Einsilber-Reimtest nach von Wallenberg und Kollmeier&quot; (WaKo). The result is the speech intelligibility in percent. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Zero-defect performance in daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>Three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as secondary outcomes are collected in a series of home trials taking place between the lab trial appointments. The zero-defect performance in daily life (that means: no interruptions, distortions, artefacts, feedback, system noise or other malfunctions) will be assessed with the aid of quantitative questionnaires. The results are &quot;Yes/No&quot; replies and open-ended.</description>
