  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer is concurrent chemo-radiotherapy.
      This treatment is associated with long term side effects in around half of patients with up
      to 10% suffering from grade 3-4 toxicity.

      The development of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows for shaping of radiotherapy
      fields to reduce the doses delivered to organs at risk (OARs). This does appear to reduce the
      risk of long and short term toxicity (although there is little randomized evidence). However
      pelvic organ position varies both between and even during radiotherapy fractions; this means
      that radiotherapy margins must be generous to allow adequate coverage of the clinical target
      volume (CTV) but this also increases dose to OARs.

      There have been a number of studies evaluating pelvic organ motion in cervical cancer as well
      as assessing different adaptive radiotherapy strategies. These have included individualized
      margins, plan of the day and adaptive techniques. Most of these studies have been carried out
      using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging which is often poor quality with limited
      soft tissue contrast. MR offers better visualization of the tumour and OARs and is used for
      imaged guided brachytherapy treatment.

      This study will explore the role of MR imaging in adaptive radiotherapy for cervical cancer
      with development of a number of theoretical treatment strategies.

      Patients will undergo standard treatment during the study with five weeks of external beam
      radiotherapy (25 fractions) followed by a MR guided brachytherapy boost or external beam
      boost (further 10 fractions.) They will be treated with weekly cisplatin 40mg/m2 if
      clinically appropriate.

      As part of standard treatment patients have a staging MR scan at diagnosis, a radiotherapy
      planning CT and an MR scan in the 4th week of treatment. Cone beam imaging will also be
      performed. Response will be assessed as standard with a MR scan at 3 months.

      As part of the study patients will undergo 3 additional MR scans. These will take place in
      the 1st, 2nd and 5th weeks of treatment. Extra sequences will be added to the clinical
      mid-point scan in the 4th week of treatment. These MR scans will include anatomical images -
      with full and empty bladder as well as cine data (with a scan every minute for 10 minutes) to
      assess intra fraction motion. They will also include a DWI sequence, which will be used to
      assess if early prediction of response is possible. The frequency of cone beam imaging will
      be increased from approximately 10 scans as standard of care to 25 scans to allow for daily
      imaging.

      The 1st MR scan will be contoured to outline clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs. A
      variety of planning strategies will be developed including standard planning target volume
      (PTV) margins, a plan of the day (POTD) approach, a POTD+ as well as an online adaptation
      model. These models will be used to assess coverage of CTV and PTV as well as dose to OARs
      using the scans obtained during the radiotherapy treatment. The practicality of each approach
      will also be assessed. Inter and intra fraction organ motion will also be analysed in order
      to develop patient specific models.
