      This is a prospective, single-site, randomized, then open-label study designed to develop a
      detailed transcriptional and epigenetic profile of the immune response to pneumococcal
      vaccination with conjugated and non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines in the senescent
      immune system of older adults.

      In this study, 40 healthy adults ages 65 and older that have never received pneumococcal
      vaccination, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar-13 (Pfizer), a conjugated
      13-valent vaccine or Pneumovax 23 (Merck), a non-conjugated 23-valent vaccine. Following
      randomized assignment of vaccine, the study will be open-label.

      Six (6) study visits will occur over about 70 days, with an optional 7th visit for
      participants to receive a second vaccination with the other pneumococcal vaccine one to two
      years after randomization. Participants will provide blood samples for transcriptional,
      epigenetic and biological analyses pre- and post-vaccination.

      This prospective, single-site, randomized, then open-label study is designed to develop a
      detailed transcriptional and epigenetic profile of the immune response to pneumococcal
      vaccination with conjugated and non-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines in the senescent
      immune system of older adults. This knowledge may lead to development of more effective
      vaccines through increased understanding of the effects of immunosenescence on mechanisms of
      immune response to pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly.

      Forty (40) healthy adults ages 65 and older that have never received pneumococcal
      vaccination, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive Prevnar-13 (Pfizer), a conjugated
      13-valent vaccine or Pneumovax 23 (Merck), a non-conjugated 23-valent vaccine. Following
      randomized assignment of vaccine, the study will be open-label.The study sample will be drawn
      from the population of healthy elderly in the catchment area of UConn Health in Farmington,
      CT.

      The first six (6) study visits are planned to occur over 67 days at Days -7, 0, 1, 10, 28 (±3
      d) and 60 (± 5d). Participants will provide blood samples for transcriptional, epigenetic and
      biological analyses pre- and post-vaccination.

      One to two years after receiving the randomly-assigned vaccination, participants may opt to
      receive administration of a second pneumococcal vaccine with the vaccine that they did not
      receive by random assignment at Visit 2 (Day 0). This second vaccine will be provided at no
      charge to the participant. Administration of this vaccine will occur at an optional Visit 7
      for participants who choose to receive the second vaccine and will be scheduled at the
      participant's convenience one-two years after receiving the first pneumococcal vaccine.

      If the participant opts to receive the second vaccine within the study and attends optional
      Visit 7, blood samples for genomic and biologic analysis will be collected at the visit.

    <ipd_description>Participants will provide or decline consent within the ICF for sharing of their randomly recoded (new code that is different than the study code) genomic data in public and/or controlled access scientific databases. The study database will include a field for whether consent for genomic data sharing was provided or declined by the participant and if consent provided was for public and/or limited access databases. This information will be included in the dataset so that it can be provided to dbGAP (NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes) at the conclusion of the study to ensure that the wishes of the participant regarding use of their data and samples are respected.
Participants will provide or decline consent for sharing of coded samples that remain after study analysis is completed with other researchers and to be used in other studies. This information will be included as a variable in the coded dataset provided for analysis.</ipd_description>
