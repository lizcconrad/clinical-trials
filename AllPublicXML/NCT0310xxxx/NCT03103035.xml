      Participants randomised to the experimental group are exposed to one blog post each week for
      a period of 6 months. Blog posts focus on the improvement of fruits and vegetables
      consumption targeting four main determinants of the behavior: (1) knowledge; (2) attitude;
      (3) self-efficacy; and (4) motivation/goals. Each post included a step-by-step recipe
      developed by the research team and featuring fruits and vegetables. Recipes were described
      textually and also using pictures and/or video. Twenty-six posts were created over the
      six-month intervention. Participants randomised to the control group are not exposed to the
      healthy eating blog. Feasibility (compliance, dropout and participation rates) and
      acceptability (satisfaction) of the study were assessed.
