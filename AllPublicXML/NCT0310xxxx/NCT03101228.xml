  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most important objective of this randomized controlled trial in subjects with increased
      cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is to investigate whether only reduced daily
      sitting improves human cardiovascular and metabolic health during a six-month intervention.
      It is hypothesized and expected that only reduced sitting, without formal physical activity
      or exercise training, affects favorably cardiovascular and metabolic health.

    <description>Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) will be determined by cycle ergometry with direct respiratory measurements. Exercise intensity will be started at 50 W and the intensity will be increased by 25 W at every two minutes until the criteria used to establish the VO2peak are met. The criteria used to establish the VO2peak are a plateau in VO2 despite of an increase in intensity and a respiratory quotient greater than 1.1. or volitional fatigue.</description>
