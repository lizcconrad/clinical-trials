      To assess the incidence, risk factors and clinical courses of cystic macular lesions (CMLs)
      after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and evaluate the efficacy of topical NSAIDs on the
      prevention of pseudophakic cystic macular lesions
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      344 Patients undergoing uncomplicated standard phacoemulsification at Kyungpook National
      University Hospital from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. CMLs, which is any cystic fluid
      collections after cataract surgery, were confirmed by preoperative and postoperative optical
      coherence tomography(OCT) on preoperative, postoperative 1month and 3months examinations.
      CMLs were classified into two groups: cystic macular edema(CME) and microcystic macular
      edema(MME).
