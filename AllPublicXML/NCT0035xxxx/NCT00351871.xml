    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to better understand the influence of insulin resistance upon
      treatment response in hepatitis C virus treated with PEG Intron and Rebetol.

    <textblock>
      The relationship between HCV and IR is an evolving one. This study will allow a more formal
      evaluation of this relationship. Four hundred patients will be treated using weight based Peg
      Intron and Rebetol. Clinical and biochemical data related to IR will be collected to
      determine if any such factors can predict who will have a sustained virological response. To
      evaluate patients for insulin resistance, the HOMA score (the product of the fasting insulin
      level and blood glucose level), waist circumference, and body mass index will be measured.
