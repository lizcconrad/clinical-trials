  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving PDX101 together with
      17-AAG in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors or lymphoma. PDX101
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth
      and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving PXD101
      together with 17-AAG may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PXD101 and 17-AAG administered to patients with
      refractory solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose of PXD101 and
      17-AAG in patients with refractory solid tumor malignancies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of PXD101 and 17-AAG in patients receiving this
      combination.

      II. To evaluate the antitumor activity of this combination, per tumor measurements using the
      RECIST criteria.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of treatment with PXD101 and 17-AAG on the transcriptional
      upregulation of targeted genes in tumor and surrogate tissue (PBMCs) by means of RTPCR and
      incorporation of the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

      II. To evaluate the effect of this combination treatment on the post translational
      modification of histones from tumor and surrogate tissue (PBMCs).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 2 hours on days 1,
      4, 8, and 11 and PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG and PDX101 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Up to 12 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      Patients undergo blood collection on days 1 and 4 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.

          -  Patients may have received prior treatment with either any HDAC inhibitor therapy or
             17AAG, as long as they did not experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) with these
             prior treatments; DLTs include

               -  Toxicity: neutrophils; DLT: grade 4 toxicity (&lt; 500/μL) for &gt;= 7 days

               -  Toxicity: febrile neutropenia; DLT: ANC &lt; 1000/μL of any duration accompanied by
                  fever &gt;= 38.5ºC

               -  Toxicity: non-hematologic; DLT: &gt;= grade 3 as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria
                  for Adverse Events, Version 3.0** (except alopecia); ** for nausea and vomiting,
                  grade 3 toxicity with maximal anti-emetic treatment will be considered
                  dose-limiting; grade 3 diarrhea in spite of maximal anti-diarrheal therapy will
                  be considered dose-limiting; hypersensitivity reactions to 17AAG will not be
                  considered a DLT; asymptomatic grade 3 hypophosphatemia will not be considered a
                  DLT

               -  Toxicity: cardiac; DLT: ≥ grade 3 QTc prolongation

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) =&lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Eligibility of patients receiving any medications or substances known to affect or
             with the potential to affect the activity or pharmacokinetics of PXD101 or 17AAG will
             be determined following review of their case by the Principal Investigator or Study
             Chair; efforts should be made to switch patients who are taking enzyme-inducing
             anticonvulsant agents to other medications

          -  The effects of PXD101 and 17AAG on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this
             reason and because HDAC inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this
             trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
             she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Within 4 weeks of first treatment: Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% per
             nuclear cardiac imaging or echocardiography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered (≤ grade 1) from clinically significant adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to PXD101; there are no known allergic reactions attributed to compounds
             of similar chemical or biological composition to 17AAG; patients with known egg
             allergy should be excluded as the agent is diluted in EPL diluent

          -  Patients should not have taken valproic acid, another histone deacetylase inhibitor,
             for at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PXD101 is an HDAC inhibitor with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with PXD101, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             PXD101; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PXD101; in addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  History of allergic reactions to eggs

          -  Patients who have significant cardiac disease including heart failure that meets New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) class III and IV definitions, history of myocardial
             infarction within 12 months of study entry, ischemic or severs valvular heart disease,
             uncontrolled dysrhythmias, uncontrolled hypertension, a condition requiring
             anti-arrhythmic therapy, or poorly controlled or unstable angina pectoris

          -  Patients who have a history of serious ventricular arrhythmia (VT or VF, &gt;= 3 beats in
             a row) or QTc &gt;= 450 msec for men and 470 msec for women or a history of long QT
             Syndrome

          -  Patients taking concomitant medications that prolong or may prolong QTc or may cause
