  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether levocetirizine 5 mg relieves nasal and
      ocular symptoms of persistent allergic rhinitis and reduces increased airway resistance and
      sleep impairment due to this condition.

      Levocetirizine 5 mg is well established as the treatment of seasonal and perennial
      rhinoconjunctivitis. This study has been designed, to investigate its efficacy in patients
      suffering from persistent allergic rhinitis as defined by the ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its
      Impact on Asthma) working group of the WHO.

      The study is divided in an 8 ± 2 day screening and a 56 ± 3 day treatment phase. During both
      periods patients keep a diary reporting on the severity of their nasal and ocular complaints,
      the use of rescue medication (cromoglycate eye drops and nasal spray), other concomitant
      medication and adverse events. They apply a 0 to 3 point score (0 = no, 1= mild, 2 =
      moderate, 3 = severe symptoms) to rate nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing
      and ocular symptoms in regard to their experience during the preceding 24 hours. During the
      treatment period they additionally report the time of intake of study medication and their
      assessments of their nasal peak inspiratory flow (NPIF). NPIF is measured every evening
      before symptom scoring and additionally before each intake of rescue nasal spray. A device
      similar to the peak flow meters employed for monitoring bronchial asthma is used. Before the
      treatment period in its middle and at its end patients undergo a polysomnography. Furthermore
      2 weeks after the start of treatment and at its end patients and investigators employ a
      5-step scale (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = moderate, 4 = poor, 5= not at all effective) to
      assess the efficacy of the study medication.

      Efficacy is to be established by comparison of a levocetirizine and a placebo treated group.
