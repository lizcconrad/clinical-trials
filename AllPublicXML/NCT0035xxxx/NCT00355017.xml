      HF is associated with repeated hospitalisations and poor prognosis.The aim of this study is
      to investigate whether BNP-guided care (BGC) in addition to multidisciplinary management(MM)
      improves outcome compared to HNC alone or usual care (UC) for decompensated HF patients after
      discharge.

      Patients hospitalised with cardiac decompensation in 9 Viennese hospitals are randomised to
      BGC, MM alone, or UC. MM includes 2 consultations of a heart failure (HF) specialist 10 days
      and 2 months after discharge for recommending medical optimisation and care by a specialised
      HF nurse including 4 home visits and telephone contact. In addition, BGC includes intensified
      increase of medical treatment during repeated follow-up visits in a HF clinic in patients
      with an Nt-BNP level above 2200pg/ml at discharge.
