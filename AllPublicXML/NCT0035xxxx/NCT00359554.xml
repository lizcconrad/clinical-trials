  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that influenza vaccination of nursing home
      workers is an effective intervention for reducing mortality of elderly people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes will be randomized within each pair in two arms “incentive to vaccinate”, and
      “do-nothing”. In the arm “incentive to vaccinate”, vaccination campaigns will be carried out
      with face-to-face interviews of nursing home workers in order to achieve more than 80% of
      vaccination coverage. In the “do-nothing”, nursing home workers will be vaccinated as usual.

      The main endpoint criterion is all-cause mortality of residents. Population sets will be all
      residents who will be present at start of the influenza season (-2 weeks) or who will be
      admitted during the influenza season (+ 2 weeks). Onset and end of influenza season will be
      given by regional influenza surveillance system. Secondary criteria are hospitalizations of
      residents, morbidity of nursing home workers. A cost-effectiveness ratio of influenza
      vaccination will be calculated.

        Criteria for nursing home:

          -  Nursing home whose representative physicians agree to participate, with 50 to 200
             residents, located in Paris area, and where the vaccination coverage of nursing home
             workers was lower than 40% during the previous influenza season (2005).

        Criteria for residents:

          -  All residents who will be present at start of the influenza season (-2 weeks) or who
             will be admitted during the influenza season (+ 2 weeks).

          -  People before 60 years Not presences in the EHPAD at the time of the beginning of the
             study (at the moment of the beginning of the epidemic - 2 weeks) or not allowed before
             the end of the study (before the end of the epidemic + 4, weeks)
