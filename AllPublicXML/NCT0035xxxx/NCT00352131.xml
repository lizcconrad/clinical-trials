      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as maytansinoid DM4-conjugated humanized monoclonal
      antibody huC242, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor
      cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing
      substances to them.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of maytansinoid
      DM4-conjugated humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 in treating patients with solid tumors
      that cannot be removed by surgery or have spread to other parts of the body.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of maytansinoid
           DM4-conjugated humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 in patients with inoperable or
           metastatic colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, or other solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this drug in these patients.

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Describe any antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive maytansinoid DM4-conjugated humanized monoclonal antibody huC242 IV over 4-5
      hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of maytansinoid DM4-conjugated humanized
      monoclonal antibody huC242 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting
      toxicity. Up to 15 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and periodically during study for
      pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
