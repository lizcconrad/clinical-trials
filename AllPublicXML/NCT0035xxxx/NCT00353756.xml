  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether C326, a new inhibitor of IL-6, is safe in
      patients with Crohn's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determination of safety is the most important goal of this first study with C326. Other goals
      of the study are to examine:

        -  pharmacokinetics (change in serum concentrations over time),

        -  biological activity (change in blood markers relecting activity of Crohn's Disease),

        -  effects on symptoms of Crohn's disease.

      Participants may receive either a single or several intravenous infusions of C326 or matching
      placebo.
