  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will hope to show that by relieving the participant's nasal symptoms of seasonal
      allergies using mometasone furoate nasal spray, the participant will obtain a better quality
      of night-time sleep, which in turn, causes less daytime sleepiness so that he/she can
      function productively during the day.

    <measure>Mean Change of the AM-PRIOR-reflective (Participant's Status Over the Previous 12 Hours) Total Nasal Symptoms Severity Score (TNSS) Averaged Over the Last 7 Days of Treatment From the Baseline Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Average of the last 7 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS score included the sum of nasal congestion/stuffiness, rhinorrhea/nasal discharge, sneezing, and nasal itching, each scored on a scale of 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. The TNSS score could range from 0 to 12.
NOTE: Least square means and standard errors were obtained from an ANCOVA model with the treatment effect and the variable specific Baseline as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (Day 1/Visit 3) in the Sleep Problems Index II (SLP9) Score From the Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale (MOS-SS) at the Day 29 Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>29 days</time_frame>
    <description>Following Visit 2 (Screening), at Baseline, Day 15, and Day 29 visits, participants needed to complete the MOS-SS questionnaire with scores from 1 = all of the time to 6 = none of the time, according to their frequency of occurrence during the previous week. The analysis endpoint MOS-SS Sleep Problems Index II (SLP9) score was derived from MOS-SS questionnaire and scaled from 0 = none of the time to 100 = all of the time.
NOTE: Least squares means and standard errors were obtained from an ANCOVA model with the treatment effect and the variable specific Baseline as a covariate.</description>

        <description>The TNSS score included the sum of nasal congestion/stuffiness, rhinorrhea/nasal discharge, sneezing, and nasal itching, each scored on a scale of 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. The TNSS score could range from 0 to 12.

        <description>Following Visit 2 (Screening), at Baseline, Day 15, and Day 29 visits, participants needed to complete the MOS-SS questionnaire with scores from 1 = all of the time to 6 = none of the time, according to their frequency of occurrence during the previous week. The analysis endpoint MOS-SS Sleep Problems Index II (SLP9) score was derived from MOS-SS questionnaire and scaled from 0 = none of the time to 100 = all of the time.
