    <textblock>
      In view of spreading antimalarial drug resistance there is an urgent need for new combination
      treatments for a disease that kills more than one million people every year. Azithromycin is
      a macrolide antibiotic that is particularly attractive due to its safety in children and
      experience with use in pregnancy. Recent trials suggest that azithromycin has a strong
      potential as an antimalarial. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of
      azithromycin combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in
      Bangladesh.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute symptomatic falciparum malaria infection with a parasite density of 100 to
             100,000 asexual parasites/uL as determined on the screening smear with fever (defined
             as ≥37.5ºC), or reported history of fever within the last 48 hours.

          2. Age: 8-65 years old

          3. Males or females. All females over the age of 12 are required to have a negative human
             chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test (urine). All females of childbearing
             potential (not surgically sterile, or less than two years menopausal) are required to
             use an acceptable method of contraception, such as implant, injectable, oral
             contraceptive(s) with additional barrier contraception, intrauterine device, sexual
             abstinence, or vasectomized partner, throughout the study

          4. Written informed consent obtained

          5. Willing to stay under close medical supervision for the study duration

          6. Otherwise healthy outpatients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential who do not use an
             acceptable method of contraception (as described in Inclusion Criteria, #3)

          2. Mixed malaria infection on admission by malaria smear

          3. A previous history of intolerance or hypersensitivity to the study drugs artesunate,
             azithromycin, or lumefantrine or to drugs with similar chemical structures

          4. Malaria drug therapy administered in the past 30 days by history

          5. Previous participation in this trial, or participation in any other studies involving
             investigational or marketed products, concomitantly or within 30 days prior to entry
             in the study

          6. History of significant cardiovascular, liver or renal functional abnormality or any
             other clinically significant illness, which in the opinion of the investigator would
             place them at increased risk.

          7. Symptoms of severe vomiting (no food or inability to take food during the previous 8
             hours).

          8. Signs or symptoms of severe malaria (as defined by WHO 2003)

          9. Unable and/or unlikely to comprehend and/or follow the protocol
