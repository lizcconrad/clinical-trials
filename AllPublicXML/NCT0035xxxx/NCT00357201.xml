    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month (± 14 days) dietary supplementation period with T1675,
      a per os omega 3 and omega 6 polyunsaturated essential fatty acid dietary formulation, versus
      placebo in patients with bilateral treated moderate dry eye syndrome

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month (± 14 days) dietary
      supplementation period with T1675 versus placebo in patients with bilateral moderate dry eye
      syndrome already treated with tear substitutes, and to point out, through several parameters,
      the best efficacy parameter that could be used for a future clinical phase III study.
