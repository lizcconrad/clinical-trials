    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study conducted in Spain to estimate the
      effectiveness of palifermin administered at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day IV for 3 consecutive days
      before the start of the conditioning regimen and for 3 consecutive days after autologous
      PBSCT for treating oral mucositis in patients with NHL and MM who have received high-dose
      conditioning chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) subjects scheduled to receive BEAM conditioning
             chemotherapy followed by autologous PBSCT, or multiple myeloma (MM) subjects scheduled
             to receive high-dose Melphalan (200 mg/m2) conditioning chemotherapy, in a one or
             two-day schedule, followed by autologous PBSCT

          -  ≥Age 18 years

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;= 2. In the MM group, ECOG status &gt;2 will be accepted
             provided that it is exclusively due to MM (e.g. pathological fracture)

          -  Adequate pulmonary function as measured by a corrected carbon monoxide (CO) diffusing
             capacity (DLCO) ≥ 60% of predicted

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%

          -  Minimum of 1.5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg for autologous transplantation

          -  Adequate haematological function (ANC ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelet count ≥ 100 x
             10^9/L)

          -  Serum creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL

          -  Total bilirubin &lt;= 2 mg/dL

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;= 4.0 x IULN

          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential within 14
             days prior to enrolment

          -  Each subject must give informed consent directly or through a legally acceptable
             representative before participating in any study specific procedure, or receiving any
             study medication. Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or concurrent cancer other than NHL or MM

          -  Prior treatment with palifermin, or other keratinocyte growth factors (eg, KGF-2)-
             Prior autologous or allogeneic transplants

          -  Oral abnormalities defined as baseline oral assessment of WHO grade &gt;0

          -  Other investigational procedures are excluded

          -  Subject currently is enrolled in or has not yet completed at least 30 days since
             ending other investigational device or drug study(s), or subject is receiving other
             investigational agent(s)

          -  Subject of child-bearing potential is evidently pregnant (eg, positive HCG test) or is
             breast feeding

          -  Subject is not using adequate contraceptive precautions

          -  Known to be sero-positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus
             (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV)

          -  Subject has known sensitivity to any of the products to be administered during dosing,
             including E coli-derived products

          -  Subject has previously been treated on this study or with other keratinocyte growth
             factors

          -  Unwilling or unable to complete the patient-reported outcome questionnaires

          -  Subject has any kind of disorder that compromises the ability of the subject to give
             written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures.
