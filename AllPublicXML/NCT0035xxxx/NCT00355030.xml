  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized trial was initially intended to study the benefits of a combined
      treatment with growth hormone (GH) and a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for
      pubertal children with idiopathic short stature. However, treatments were stopped in January
      2012 at the request of the French drug agency. Therefore, a protocol amendment divided the
      study in two study periods.

      Study Period 1 involved combined treatment with somatropin and leuprorelin or treatment with
      somatropin alone. Participants from France who participated in this Period 1 of the study
      were asked to participate in a long term safety follow up defined as a Period 2 of the study.
      Participants from the Netherlands were offered participation in Genetics and
      Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS, clinicaltrials.gov
      Identifier: NCT01088412) for long term safety follow up independent of this study.

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Drug-related Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through End of Study (up to 9 years)</time_frame>
    <description>A drug-related AE was an AE that occurred postdose or was present predose and became more severe postdose and was considered to be related to study treatment. A summary of other nonserious AEs, and all SAE's, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adult Height Standard Deviation Score (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through End of Study (up to 9 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The height of the participants were measured barefoot using a standard wall-mounted Harpenden stadiometer. SDS report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS is derived by subtracting the population mean from individual's height value and then dividing that difference by the population standard deviation. Greater height SDS values indicate greater height.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Height Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through End of Study (up to 9 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Height velocity is the difference between 2 height measurements, divided by years elapsed between measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference Between Adult Height SDS and Target Height SDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through End of Study (up to 9 years)</time_frame>
    <description>This is the difference between the gender, age and country matched standard deviation score of adult height and standard deviation score of target height [calculated as (mother's height (SDS) + father's height (SDS))/2] for particular participant.
The height of the participants were measured barefoot using a standard wall-mounted Harpenden stadiometer. SDS report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS is derived by subtracting the population mean from individual's height value and then dividing that difference by the population standard deviation. Greater height SDS values indicate greater height.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference Between Adult Height SDS and Baseline Predicted Height SDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through End up Study (up to 9 years)</time_frame>
    <description>This is the difference between the gender, age and country matched standard deviation score of adult height and standard deviation score of baseline predicted height [calculated using the Bayley-Pinneau method based on height and bone age] for particular participant.
The height of the participants were measured barefoot using a standard wall-mounted Harpenden stadiometer. SDS report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS is derived by subtracting the population mean from individual's height value and then dividing that difference by the population standard deviation.

        <title>Difference Between Adult Height SDS and Target Height SDS</title>
        <description>This is the difference between the gender, age and country matched standard deviation score of adult height and standard deviation score of target height [calculated as (mother’s height (SDS) + father’s height (SDS))/2] for particular participant.
The height of the participants were measured barefoot using a standard wall-mounted Harpenden stadiometer. SDS report the number of standard deviations from the mean for age and sex for an individual measurement (normal range: -2 to +2 SDS). Height SDS is derived by subtracting the population mean from individual's height value and then dividing that difference by the population standard deviation. Greater height SDS values indicate greater height.</description>
