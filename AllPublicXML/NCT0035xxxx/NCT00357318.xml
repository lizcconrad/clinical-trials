  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bevacizumab and sunitinib in
      treating patients with solid tumors. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block
      tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Sunitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Bevacizumab and sunitinib may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood
      flow to the tumor. Giving bevacizumab together with sunitinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bevacizumab in combination with sunitinib malate
      (SU11248) in patients with solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the objective response rate, time to disease progression, and overall survival of
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and oral sunitinib
      malate (SU11248) once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab and SU11248 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 10 patients are treated
      at the MTD.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 30 days.
