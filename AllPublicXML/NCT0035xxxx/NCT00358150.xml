  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a genetic disease that results in a deficiency of an enzyme acid
      beta-glucosidase, also known as glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is needed to digest a
      substrate (lipid) called glucosylceramide and, to a lesser degree, glucosylsphingosine. In
      participants with Gaucher disease, the liver, spleen, bone marrow and brain show increases in
      lipid concentration, specifically in cells derived from the monocyte/macrophage system.

      Eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638) is an oral drug that may regulate the Gaucher disease
      process by decreasing the synthesis of glucosylceramide. The primary objective of this study
      is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eliglustat tartrate,
      administered as an oral dose of either 50 milligram (mg) twice daily (BID) or 100 mg BID, to
      men and women with Gaucher disease Type 1 for 52 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of several phases: screening (-28 to -1 days), dose adjustment/treatment
      (Day 1 [treatment baseline] to Day 30), initial steady-state treatment (post-Day 30 through
      Week 52 post-baseline), a treatment interruption period (Week 52 through approximately Week
      54), long-term steady-state treatment (approximately Week 54 through study completion), and
      safety follow-up (30 to 37 days after a participant withdraws from or completes the study).
      The Primary Analysis Period is from baseline through Week 52. The Extension Period is from
      Week 52 through study completion (that is, participant withdrawal, the study is terminated,
      eliglustat tartrate becomes commercially available, or where applicable, specific regulatory
      requirements have been met).

    <description>The SF-36 questionnaire, version 2, investigates the participant's health-related quality of life (HRQL). It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting best health-related quality of life. Two summary scale scores were computed from the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. Score range for both summary scale ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting best health-related quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Demonstrating A Meaningful Clinical Response</title>
        <description>A meaningful clinical response was defined as an improvement in at least 2 of the 3 main efficacy parameters: a) an increase in hemoglobin of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.5 gram/deciliter from baseline, b) an increase in platelets of &gt;=15 percent (%) from baseline, c) reduction in total spleen volume of &gt;= 15% from baseline. As hemoglobin, platelets, total spleen volume were abnormal at baseline, within each participant, only those parameters were used in the evaluation of meaningful clinical response which were abnormal at baseline.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Demonstrating A Meaningful Clinical Response</title>
          <description>A meaningful clinical response was defined as an improvement in at least 2 of the 3 main efficacy parameters: a) an increase in hemoglobin of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 0.5 gram/deciliter from baseline, b) an increase in platelets of &gt;=15 percent (%) from baseline, c) reduction in total spleen volume of &gt;= 15% from baseline. As hemoglobin, platelets, total spleen volume were abnormal at baseline, within each participant, only those parameters were used in the evaluation of meaningful clinical response which were abnormal at baseline.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 questionnaire, version 2, investigates the participant’s health-related quality of life (HRQL). It is a 36-item questionnaire measuring 8 domains (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health). Each domain score ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting best health-related quality of life. Two summary scale scores were computed from the 8 domain scores: the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. Score range for both summary scale ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores reflecting best health-related quality of life.</description>

After primary completion date (Week 52) participants underwent treatment interruption period of approximately 2 weeks before continuing the same treatment up to Year 9. Participant receiving 100 mg BID could be considered for a further dose increase to 150 mg BID at Week 24 if they met certain criteria (for example, had been on treatment for at least 24 months, had not reached therapeutic goals established for participants receiving Cerezyme, and if all other causes for lack of treatment effect had been evaluated and ruled out).</description>

        <description>The FSS is an instrument consisting of 9 self-administered questions that measures the impact of severity of fatigue symptoms on everyday functioning, based on the recall over the past week. Score range for each question ranges from 1 (minimum) to 7 (maximum), where higher score indicates greater severity. FSS total score was calculated by averaging the results of all questions. Total FSS score ranges from 9 (minimum) to 63 (maximum), where higher scores indicates greater severity.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With No Bone Crisis at Baseline, Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, Year 4, Year 5, Year 6, Year 7, Year 8, Year 9 and at End of Study</title>
        <description>Bone crisis was assessed as a part of Gaucher disease assessment in participants. Acute, excruciating episodic bone pain is characteristic of Gaucher bone crisis, which typically causes debilitation lasting several days or longer and requires treatment with immobilization, hydration, and opioid analgesics. Participants were categorized as 0= no bone crisis, 1= 1 bone crisis, and 2= 2 bone crises during the assessment period. In this outcome, number of participants with 0= no bone crises levels at specified time points were reported.</description>

After primary completion date (Week 52) participants underwent treatment interruption period of approximately 2 weeks before continuing the same treatment up to Year 9. Participant receiving 100 mg BID could be considered for a further dose increase to 150 mg BID at Week 24 if they met certain criteria (for example, had been on treatment for at least 24 months, had not reached therapeutic goals established for participants receiving Cerezyme, and if all other causes for lack of treatment effect had been evaluated and ruled out).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With No Bone Crisis at Baseline, Year 1, Year 2, Year 3, Year 4, Year 5, Year 6, Year 7, Year 8, Year 9 and at End of Study</title>
          <description>Bone crisis was assessed as a part of Gaucher disease assessment in participants. Acute, excruciating episodic bone pain is characteristic of Gaucher bone crisis, which typically causes debilitation lasting several days or longer and requires treatment with immobilization, hydration, and opioid analgesics. Participants were categorized as 0= no bone crisis, 1= 1 bone crisis, and 2= 2 bone crises during the assessment period. In this outcome, number of participants with 0= no bone crises levels at specified time points were reported.</description>

        <description>Bone marrow infiltration assessments were designed to evaluate improvements in dark marrow using MRI. Each MRI assessment was performed for both femurs and consisted of reviewing 6 different zones (the femoral head, greater trochanter, intertrochanteric region, shaft, distal metaphysis, and condyles). MRI images recorded dark marrow for each zone as either present or not present at baseline. In this outcome, number of participants (for whom dark marrow was present at baseline) with improvement from baseline in dark marrow at each specified time point were reported.</description>
