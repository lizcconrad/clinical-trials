  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to examine whether adding greater physical activity to standard
      family-based behavioral pediatric obesity treatment decreases the amount of visceral fat
      among treated overweight children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult studies suggest that greater visceral fat confers more health risk than peripheral fat
      accumulation and that physical activity interventions (as part of general weight control
      interventions) are efficacious in reducing adults' visceral fat. There are few studies
      examining the impact of physical activity and/or general weight loss on children's visceral
      fat accumulation. The present study compares standard family-based behavioral weight control
      treatment for pediatric obesity (STANDARD) with standard treatment plus added emphasis on
      participants attaining high levels of physical activity (ADDED). Both conditions receive the
      same behavioral dietary intervention and therapeutic contact and attention. The ADDED
      condition receives the recommendation and goal to be active at least 90 minutes per day, with
      behavioral strategies targeting increasing and sustaining these high levels of physical
      activity.
