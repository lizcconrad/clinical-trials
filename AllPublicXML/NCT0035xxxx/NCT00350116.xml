      Objective: To test the efficacy and tolerability of a vitamin B12 cream for the treatment of
      chronic plaque psoriasis.

      Design: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: ambulatory
      patients in research or referral centers. Patients: Volunteer sample of 51 patients with
      chronic plaque psoriasis. Interventions: All Patients applied vitamin B12 cream twice daily
      for 8 weeks to one side of the body and placebo to the other.

      Main outcome measures: Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6
      and 8. Thickness and density of 3 references plaques determined by 20 MHz sonography.
      Assessment of efficiency and tolerability by patients and investigators.
