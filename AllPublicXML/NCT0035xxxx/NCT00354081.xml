      PURPOSE OF STUDY Observational studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of plasma total
      homocysteine is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this trial is to
      evaluate the clinical effects of homocysteine lowering treatment with B vitamins during 3-5
      years follow-up of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for suspected coronary artery
      disease (CAD). Special attention will be given to complication rates among patients needing
      subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCI) or coronary artery by-pass
      grafting (CABG).

      HYPOTHESIS The primary hypothesis of this study is that, among patients with CAD, a daily
      supplement with B vitamins will reduce the risk for cardiovascular mortality and serious
      cardiovascular events with at least 20%. The secondary hypothesis of this study is that,
      among patients with CAD, a daily supplement with B vitamins will reduce the risk for total
      mortality, coronary events, cerebrovascular events and other cardiovascular events. The
      hypothesis will be tested for an effect of any of the treatments (folic acid / vitamin B12 or
      B6), and the effect will be evaluated according to initial total homocysteine levels and B
      vitamin levels as well as to the change in these levels after 1 and 6 months. The sample size
      has been calculated to 3088 patients using a two-sided chi-square test with significance 0.05
      and at an 80% power level, presumed event rate of 22% over 4 years, and event rate reduction
      of 20%, adjusted for non-compliance/drop-out of 20%.

      STUDY DESIGN This is a controlled, double-blind two-centre trial with 3090 included men and
      women who underwent coronary angiography at Haukeland University Hospital or Stavanger
      University Hospital between April 1999 and April 2004. At baseline about 1300 patients
      underwent PCI and 600 underwent CABG. The patients were randomized into 4 groups in a 2 x 2
      factorial design to receive one of the following four treatments: A, folic acid 0.8 mg plus
      vitamin B12 0.4 mg and vitamin B6 40 mg per day; B, folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg
      per day; C, vitamin B6 40 mg per day; D, placebo. The active drug and the placebo tablets had
      identical appearance and taste. Treatment was started as soon as the patients were randomized
      after the coronary angiography procedure. The patients have been undergoing interviews,
      clinical examination and blood-sampling at baseline, at follow-up after 1 month and 1 year,
      and at a final study visit. In addition, information on dietary habits was obtained from 2400
      patients at baseline. Among 350 patients that have undergone PCI at baseline, a full clinical
      examination, blood sampling and repeat coronary angiography to assess re-stenosis has been
      performed about 9 (6-12) months after the PCI procedure. For these patients, angiograms
      suitable for quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analysis have been obtained at the
      baseline and follow-up invasive procedures.

      The follow-up was terminated ahead of schedule in October 2005 due to lack of compliance of
      the participants caused by media reports from the NORVIT study (NCT00266487) on potential
      increased cancer risk associated by B vitamin supplementation. The patients had then been
      followed for 1.5 - 5 years.

      STUDY END POINTS Primary clinical endpoints during follow-up are all cause death, non-fatal
      acute myocardial infarction, acute hospitalization for unstable angina and non-fatal
      thromboembolic stroke (infarction). Secondary endpoints are fatal and non-fatal acute
      myocardial infarction (including procedure related myocardial infarction), acute
      hospitalization for angina, stable angina with angiographic verified progression, myocardial
      revascularization, fatal and non-fatal thromboembolic stroke.

      BACKGROUND Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of our common diseases, and despite the
      decline in mortality from acute coronary syndromes in the Western world, CAD remains the most
      important cause of death in Norway.

      HOMOCYSTEINE Homocysteine (Hcy) is an amino acid and total homocysteine (tHcy) is the sum of
      several different forms of Hcy that is present in blood, usually measured in serum or plasma.
      A population-based study of plasma tHcy in 18,043 individuals in Hordaland, Norway
      demonstrated that plasma tHcy usually is between 5 and 15 micromol/L, is higher in men than
      in women and increases with age [Nygård, et al., 1995].

      FOLIC ACID The most common cause of elevated tHcy is low intake of folic acid (a B vitamin)
      that occurs in many fruits, vegetables, liver products, milk, and bread. Vitamin supplements
      that are sold without prescription commonly contain folic acid (0.1 or 0.2 mg in Norway, 0.4
      or 0.8 mg in other countries). In the United States and United Kingdom many food products are
      fortified with folic acid. The Food and Drug administration in the United States has made
      fortification with folic acid mandatory for some products from 1998. The rationale for this
      policy is to reduce the occurrence of neural tube defects, a class of serious congenital
      malformations. Several studies have also shown a direct relation between serum folic acid and
      coronary heart disease.

      MODERATELY ELEVATED tHcy AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE More than twenty retrospective and three
      prospective studies, including two Norwegian [Nygård, et al., 1997], over the past twenty
      years have demonstrated a relation between tHcy measured in serum or plasma and coronary
      heart disease, peripheral artery disease or stroke [Boushey, et al., 1995, Ueland, et al.,
      1992]. The meta-analysis performed by Boushey et al [Boushey, et al., 1995] estimated that a
      5 micromol/L difference in tHcy increase the risk of coronary artery disease with 60%. Common
      causes of moderately elevated tHcy include nutritional deficiency of folic acid, vitamin B6
      and B12, genetic variation in genes coding key enzymes of the Hcy metabolism (e.g.,
      thermolabile MTHFR) and, as demonstrated in the Hordaland Homocysteine Study [Nygård, et al.,
      1995], life-style factors as smoking, coffee drinking and exercise.

      VITAMIN THERAPY A common feature of most individuals with elevated tHcy is responsiveness to
      folic acid therapy. One exception is vitamin B12 deficiency that needs to be corrected with
      appropriate therapy. A recent meta-analysis shows that the mean tHcy lowering effect of folic
      acid at doses 0.5-5.0 mg/day is 25% at tHcy levels of 12 micromol/L [Homocysteine Lowering
      Trialists' Collaboration, 1998 #1892]. The study further shows that the absolute and
      percentage reduction in tHcy is higher in subjects with higher tHcy levels and particular low
      folic acid concentrations. Moreover, additional daily oral therapy with 0,5 mg B12 seems to
      have a small but significant additional tHcy lowering effect whereas vitamin B6 at a mean
      dose of 16,5 mg daily has no effect on basal tHcy levels.

      RANDOMIZED TRIALS WITH FOLIC ACID There is solid evidence that tHcy is associated with
      cardiovascular disease. We know that tHcy is easily lowered by folic acid in most patients,
      but we cannot know that folic acid will prevent cardiovascular disease or complications of
      such disease until randomized double-blind trials are carried out. The only possible problem
      with folic acid is that it may correct the anemia, but not the neuropathy, of vitamin B12
      deficiency. This necessitates careful screening for B12 deficiency or combining folic acid
      with B12 in a sufficient oral dose to treat an occasional pernicious anemia.

      RANDOMIZED TRIALS WITH VITAMIN B6 Data from several studies show that inappropriate vitamin
      B6 status is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease and that this increased risk
      probably is independent of tHcy levels. Thus, commonly applied tHcy lowering regimens
      combining folic acid and vitamin B6 can not be applied to test the homocysteine theory of
      atherosclerosis.

      HOMOCYSTEINE AND VITAMIN MEASUREMENTS Determination of tHcy and associated amino acids and B
      vitamins will be performed at the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Bergen.
      These analyses will be done on all patients at randomization and at follow-up after 1 month
      and 1 year, and will both serve as monitoring of compliance and also give the possibility to
      relate clinical events to, for example, the amount of reduction in plasma tHcy.
