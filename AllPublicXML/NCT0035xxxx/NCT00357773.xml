      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of T1225 1.5% eye drops
      administered BID for 3 days in comparison to reference antibiotic eye drops, tobramycin, for
      the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis. The study was conducted as a Phase III,
      multicentre, international, investigator-masked, randomised, parallel-group, non-inferiority
      study in newborns, children, and adults.
