  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 3500
      individuals. Half of people with NF1 inherit the condition from a parent, and half have a new
      occurrence of the condition. The manifestation of NF1 is highly variable and multiple organ
      systems are typically affected. Some of the more common symptoms include benign
      neurofibromas, caf√© au lait spots, Lisch nodules (tan spots on the iris of the eye). Some
      individuals with NF1 also exhibit more severe associated conditions, such as optic pathway
      tumors (gliomas) or bones bending or curving. Neurocognitive deficits and specific learning
      disabilities occur in approximately 30 to 50% of individuals with NF1 and are regarded by
      some observers and sufferers to be among the most troubling features of a disease. The most
      commonly reported findings are deficits in visuoperceptual ability, motor coordination,
      expressive and receptive language, and executive functioning, which requires intact
      short-term memory and attention. Patients with NF1 also show a slight depression in mean IQ
      scores compared to healthy adults without the disorder.

      While cognitive deficits are now a widely-recognized feature of Neurofibromatosis Type 1
      (NF1), the precise cause of these deficits still remain to be determined. Dr. Alcino Silva, a
      co- investigator on this study, has developed an animal model of NF1 in which mice have a
      specific mutation of the *NF1* gene. These mice are physically normal but show specific
      learning impairments. Dr. Silva's lab found that treatment with a medication called
      lovastatin, a drug typically used for high cholesterol, reversed some of the spatial deficits
      seen in these animals. Lovastatin is a medication commonly used to treat high cholesterol and
      has been proven to be relatively safe and tolerable in humans.

      The investigators are now conducting a randomized, double-blinded, placebo- controlled, trial
      of lovastatin in patients with NF1. Participants will be randomly assigned to lovastatin or
      placebo and treated for approximately 14 weeks with baseline and follow-up assessments to
      evaluate safety and any effects on neurocognitive test performance.
