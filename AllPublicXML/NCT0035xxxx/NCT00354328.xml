  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the relationship between certain measures of heart function and
      exercise capacity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

      Patients who participated in NHLBI studies 01-H-0006 (&quot;Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Study
      of Pirfenidone - A Novel Anti-Fibrotic Drug - in Symptomatic Patients with Hypertrophic
      Cardiomyopathy Associated with Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction&quot;) and 96-H-0144
      (&quot;Double Blind Placebo-Controlled Study of Long-Term Effects of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme
      Inhibition (Enalapril) and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockade (Losartan) on Genetically-Induced
      Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction&quot;) are eligible for this study. Data from
      echocardiograms and measures of left ventricular pressure obtained from patients in those
      studies will be analyzed in the current study to assess their influence on exercise capacity.
      No additional tests, treatments or other procedures are required.

      Information from this study may help in the development of improved drug treatments for HCM.

      NIH Protocols 01-H-0066, Double Blind Placebo Controlled Study of Pirfenidone A Novel
      Anti-Fibrotic Drug in Symptomatic patients with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Associated
      with left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction and 96-H-0144, Double Blind Placebo-Controlled
      Study of Long-Term Effects of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition (Enalapril) and
      Angiotensin II Receptor Blockade (Losartan) On Genetically-Induced Left Ventricular Diastolic
      Dysfunction were undertaken to assess the effect of therapeutic interventions on left
      ventricular (LV) diastolic function. The relationship between baseline measures of diastolic
      function as assessed by noninvasive modalities such as Doppler echocardiography and
      radionuclide angiography, and qualitative and objective measures of functional capacity in
      patients without LV outflow tract obstruction has not been reported. In this protocol we will
      look at measures of LV geometry, relaxation and novel indices of ventricular compliance as
      they may influence measures of exercise capacity. In all cases, we will use pre-existing
      baseline data obtained with informed consent as part of the above protocols.
