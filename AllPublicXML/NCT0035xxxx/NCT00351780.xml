      Study purpose: To evaluate fractional flow reserve-guided side branch intervention strategy
      Method: Provisional side branch intervention if jailed side branch FFR&lt;0.75

      Patients with de novo, coronary bifurcation lesions with jailed side branches after
      successful drug-eluting stent implantation at the main branches will be prospectively and
      consecutively enrolled. Control group patients will be selected from the database.

      Jailed side branches need to have an ostial stenosis &gt;50%, vessel size &gt;2 mm, vessel length
      &gt;40 mm and lesion length &lt;10 mm by visual estimation.

      Study procedure Coronary stenting of the main branch should be performed with standard
      interventional techniques using drug-eluting stents. In the FFR group, pressure measurement
      would be performed using a 0.014 inch pressure guide wire (PressureWire, Radi Medical
      Systems, Uppsala, Sweden)Lesions with an FFR &lt;0.75 are considered to have functionally
      significant stenosis and side branch balloon dilatation is allowed only for these lesions. It
      is recommended to use a smaller balloon than the side branch vessel diameter. After kissing
      balloon inflation, FFR will be measured again at the same site and further intervention is
      only recommended when FFR was &lt;0.75 after kissing balloon dilatation. In the conventional
      group, the decision to treat the side branch lesion and the method of intervention are all up
      to the operators' discretion.
