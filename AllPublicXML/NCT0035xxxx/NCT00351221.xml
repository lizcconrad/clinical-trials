  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will investigate the treatment of growth failure in children with Noonan syndrome.
      Abnormalities in the growth hormone (GH) – insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) axis
      resulting in low IGF-I levels have been suggested as a possible cause of short stature seen
      in Noonan syndrome children. Administration of our investigational product is intended to
      bypass the abnormalities in the GH-IGF axis, and hopefully improve body growth.
