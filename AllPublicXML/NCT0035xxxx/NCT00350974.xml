    <textblock>
      Asymmetric dimethylarginine, ADMA, in plasma, is significantly elevated in patients with
      renal disease and associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We found that whole
      blood (WB) possesses the metabolic pathways required for both the generation and elimination
      of ADMA and we have developed ex vivo methods to assess the WB accumulation of ADMA in
      humans. The over-arching hypothesis is that dysregulation of ADMA metabolic pathways leads to
      greater ADMA whole blood content and greater capacity to accumulate ADMA, which 1) is not
      reflected by plasma levels and 2) is a better predictor of cardiovascular outcome than plasma
      levels in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The following specific aims will be pursued to
      characterize whole blood ADMA in ESRD:

        1. Compare and contrast baseline free plasma ADMA and total whole blood (free plus
           protein-incorporated) ADMA concentrations in ESRD patients, matched hypertensive
           controls and a normal population.

        2. Determine the capacity of WB to accumulate (the net balance of generation and
           elimination) ADMA in ESRD patients, matched hypertensive controls and a normal
           population.

      We will use state-of-the-art, high performance liquid chromatography techniques to measure
      ADMA levels in plasma and whole blood. Samples for ADMA measurements will be obtained from
      subjects with end-stage renal disease immediately before their dialysis treatments. Samples
      will also be obtained from volunteers without kidney disease. This group will be matched to
      the end-stage renal volunteers by age, gender and ethnicity. These volunteers will also be
      matched for the presence of hypertension and diabetes. The third group will consist of a
      normal population to measure the normal levels of ADMA and compare to the other two groups.

      There is growing evidence to support a pathological role of ADMA in humans. These experiments
      will enhance our understanding of how ADMA is processed in the human body and how it is
      associated with kidney disease. Potentially, these results will lay the groundwork for new
      insights into the link between ADMA and the high cardiovascular disease burden in patients
      with kidney disease.
