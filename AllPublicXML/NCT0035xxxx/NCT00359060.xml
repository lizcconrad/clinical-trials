  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose of the SHAPE study is to examine the effects of an 1-year exercise programme on
      endogenous hormone levels associated with breast cancer among sedentary postmenopausal women
      and whether a decrease in intra-abdominal fat is associated with a lowering of these hormone
      levels.

    <textblock>
      Physical activity has been associated with a decreased risk for breast cancer. The biological
      mechanism(s) underlying the association between physical activity and breast cancer is not
      clear. Most prominent hypothesis is that physical activity may protect against breast cancer
      through reduced lifetime exposure to endogenous hormones. Another hypothesis is that physical
      activity prevents overweight and abdominal adiposity.

      In this intervention study, 189 sedentary postmenopausal women who are aged 50-69 years are
      randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group. The intervention consists of an
      1-year moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic and strength training exercise programme.
      Participants allocated to the control group are requested to retain their habitual exercise
      pattern. Primary study parameters measured at baseline, at four months and at 12 months are:
      serum concentrations of endogenous estrogens, endogenous androgens, sex hormone binding
      globulin and insulin. Other study parameters include: amount of total and abdominal fat,
      weight, BMI, body fat distribution, physical fitness, blood pressure and lifestyle factors.

      This study will contribute to the body of evidence relating physical activity and breast
      cancer risk and will provide insight into possible mechanisms through which physical activity
      might be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
