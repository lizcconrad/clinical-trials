    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the local adaptation of existing stroke
      prevention tools into practice. A stroke prevention program is a collection of materials
      including written materials like pamphlets and brochures, videotapes and training guides for
      stroke survivors and evidence based guidelines for the doctors that provide care for them.
      Other tools that may be used in a stroke prevention program include devices that help
      patients monitor medical symptoms at home like home blood pressure machines or blood sugar
      monitors and messaging devices that allow reporting symptoms from home to a health care
      provider.

      We hypothesized Veterans with stroke who receive the Veteran Stroke Prevention Program would
      engage in better medication compliance and stroke specific quality of life compared to those
      who did not receive the program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke affects at least 15,000 veterans each year, and this number will likely increase as
      the veteran population ages. According to the American Heart Association, the prevalence of
      stroke is expected to double by 2020 with the increased proportion of older adults
      nationwide. Our preliminary Quality Enhancement Research Initiative work indicates that
      stroke risk factors are often undermanaged in the Veterans Health Administration.

      This proposed study of a stroke risk factor management program may benefit the Veteran Health
      System in several ways. First, it offers a systematic program for reduction in stroke risk
      factors leading to better health for our veterans and a reduction in inpatient and outpatient
      rehabilitation and home health services for these events. Second, the Veteran Stroke
      Prevention Program takes into account the varied resources and services offered in VAMCs
      across the nation, allowing the program to be tailored both to a given facility and to the
      individual veteran's needs and readiness to change. Importantly, the program could allow all
      VA facilities to offer guideline-concurrent stroke risk reduction programs and therefore
      increase compliance with VA/Department of Defense, American Heart Association, and the Joint
      Commission stroke care guidelines and improve their quality of stroke care.

      Comparison(s): We will compare two regionally matched facilities on rates of secondary stroke
      prevention guideline care during the course of the study at the intervention sites.

Self reported survey by LS Williams Weinberger M, Clark, D, Harris L, Biller J. Development of a stroke specific quality of life scale. Stroke, 1999;30:1362-1369.
Contains 12 domains and 49 items Scored on a 5 pt Likert response format with lower score indicating worse function/lower ability on that item or domain. Domain scores were calculated as an unweighted average of item scores in that domain. Overall Total Score was calculated as an unweighted average of domain scores.
We hypothesized the intervention group would report significantly greater stroke specific quality of life than the control group. The level of significance was set to 0.05.</description>

          <title>Stroke Specific, Health-Related Quality of Life</title>
          <description>Stroke, specific, health-related quality of life (SSQoL) is a self-reported survey by LS Williams et al Stroke. 1999;30:1362-1369. Includes 12 domains and 49 items which are scored on a 5pt Likert response format with lower score indicating worse function/lower ability on that item or domain. Domain scores were calculated as an unweighted average of item scores in that domain. Overall Total Score was calculated as an unweighted average of domain scores. Each Domain Score and the Overall Total Score all range from 1-5 with 1 being worst and 5 best best.</description>

          <description>This scale is modified from the Arthitis Self-Efficacy scale and is designed to measure Confidence to Manage Stroke Symptoms. The items measure the confidence to manage symptoms and health post stroke on a 1-10 scale where 10 denotes a lot of confidence and a 1 denotes no confidence. The scale score is the average score of the items.</description>

Medication Possession Ratios are the % of days in follow up period of 6 months with possession of hypertension drugs (range = 0-100%)
Compliance is defined as Medication Possession Ratio for Hypertension drugs dichotomized as greater than and equal to 80%.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
        <population>We hypothesized the intervention group would report significantly greater medication compliance than the control group. The level of significance was set to 0.05. The number of participants were set per protocol and we used intention to treat in our protocol and analyses.</population>
