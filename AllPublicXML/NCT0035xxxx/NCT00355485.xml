      The purpose of this research project is to study the effect of micordermabrasion to try to
      improve the appearance of facial acne. The microdermabrasion machine is a hand-held device
      that directs pressurized aluminum oxide crystals at its target accompanied by a suction
      device. It is not yet clear how much improvement can be seen with these treatments or exactly
      how the skin's response causes these improvements. In this study, we are interested in
      learning how well microdermabrasion works to improve the symptoms of acne.

      Acne vulgaris remains among the most common cutaneous disorders, impacting the vast majority
      of people at some point during their lives. It is associated with significant psychosocial
      morbidity, and there remains the need for efficacious and low risk therapeutic options.

      Microdermabrasion is a technique combining abrasion and negative pressure used primarily in
      the treatment of aging skin. It has also been proposed to improve acne presumably through a
      comedolytic effect. Negative pressure and abrasion may remove debris from follicular orifices
      that act as a nidus for acne lesions. Many physicians and spas use micordermabrasion as a
      treatment for acne, however, there has never been a randomized controlled trial to
      substantiate this practice.

      We propose to evaluate the efficacy of microdermabrasion in the treatment of inflammatory
      acne. We will use the Bellamed microdermabrasion system produced by Bella products or the
      Altair Diamondtome System.
