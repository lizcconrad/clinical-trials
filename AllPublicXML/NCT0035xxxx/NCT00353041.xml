  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the effect of time on the effectiveness of topical anesthetics in the
      mouth. The Null Hypothesis is: Regardless of the time of application over a 10-minute period,
      there is no difference in the clinical effectiveness of the topical anesthetic 5% lidocaine
      on (a) the pain of needle stick insertion and (b) the pain of local anaesthetic
      administration.

    <textblock>
      The study design will be a double blind randomized controlled split-mouth clinical trial. It
      is proposed to compare the effectiveness of the standard topical anesthetic 5% lidocaine with
      a placebo over the time period of 2, 5 and 10 minutes after application. The topical will be
      placed on the palatal soft tissue where the perception of pain is the highest in the oral
      cavity. Both the pain of needle insertion and the pain of local anesthetic injection will be
      compared.
