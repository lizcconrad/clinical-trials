  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with asthma may have asthma worsening when they have an upper respiratory infection
      due to a virus or a common cold. Leukotrienes are increased in nasal secretions from children
      with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and lung washings during times of acute lung
      inflammation. Experimental virus exposure in adults is also associated with increases in
      nasal leukotrienes.

      The degree to which leukotrienes play a role in asthma worsening is unknown.There is
      information linking leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic inflammation, and asthma
      exacerbation.This information supports the hypothesis that virus-induced leukotrienes
      contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible individuals, lead to
      lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use montelukast in an
      experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.

      Viral infections are important causes of wheezing illnesses throughout childhood and in
      adults with asthma. There has been progress in identifying mechanisms and risk factors for
      severe respiratory symptoms, and in particular, wheezing. Given this close relationship, it
      would be attractive to apply antiviral strategies to the prevention and treatment of asthma,
      and both RV and RSV are obvious targets. Unfortunately, attempts at developing an RSV vaccine
      have so far been unsuccessful, and vaccination to prevent RV infection does not seem to be
      feasible due to the large number of serotypes. Antiviral medications have been tested in
      clinical trials, however one problem with this approach is that once the clinical signs and
      symptoms appear, viral replication is well underway.

      The other potential therapeutic approach for respiratory viral infections would be to
      selectively inhibit pro-inflammatory immune responses induced by the virus. The beneficial
      effects of systemic glucocorticoids indicate that this approach is valid; the challenge will
      be to develop treatments with greater efficacy and a reduced potential for adverse effects.
      The large body of information linking cysteinyl leukotrienes to viral infections, allergic
      inflammation, and asthma exacerbations, strongly supports the hypothesis that virus-induced
      leukotrienes contribute to the severity of respiratory infections and in susceptible
      individuals, lead to lower airway obstruction and exacerbations of asthma. We propose to use
      montelukast in an experimental viral challenge model to explore this hypothesis.

    <measure>Mean Asthma Symptom Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptom scores were assessed twice per day with subjects completing a validated daytime diary card before bed and a nocturnal diary card on awakening. Subjects answered 4 questions about their asthma symptoms (0, none of the time; 6, all of the time). Daily score were calculated as the average of the 4 questions and an overall score for the week was assessed as the average of the daily scores. Time frame measurement was Day 7.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peak Viral Shedding</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Viral shedding was measured in both groups. Viral titers from nasal lavage were calculated after 4 tissue culture tubes containing WI38 cells (human lung diploid cells) were inoculated for each serial 10-fold dilution of samples and incubated while rolling at 33 degrees Celsius for 10 days (measurement for analysis was taken at baseline and 7 days). Tubes were read at baseline and 7 days later. TCID50 was calculated as the concentration that was capable of infecting 50% of the tubes. Viral titers are expressed as TCID50 per milliliter. Time frame measurement was at baseline and 7 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sputum Eosinophil Count</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sputum was collected from both groups over 14 days after inoculation with the cold virus. Cell counts and differentials were made from sputum samples after treatment with 0.1% dithiothreitol. Eosinophils were counted and are expressed as as percentage of cells (percent of the total number counted) at the 14 day timepoint.</description>

        <title>Peak Viral Shedding</title>
        <description>Viral shedding was measured in both groups. Viral titers from nasal lavage were calculated after 4 tissue culture tubes containing WI38 cells (human lung diploid cells) were inoculated for each serial 10-fold dilution of samples and incubated while rolling at 33 degrees Celsius for 10 days (measurement for analysis was taken at baseline and 7 days). Tubes were read at baseline and 7 days later. TCID50 was calculated as the concentration that was capable of infecting 50% of the tubes. Viral titers are expressed as TCID50 per milliliter. Time frame measurement was at baseline and 7 days.</description>

Cell counts and differentials were made from sputum samples after treatment with 0.1% dithiothreitol.
