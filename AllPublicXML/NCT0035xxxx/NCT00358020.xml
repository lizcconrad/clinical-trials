    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the association of
      Melphalan/Prednisone/Thalidomide/VELCADE (MPTV) as salvage treatment in advanced and
      refractory myeloma patients. This association might further increase the response rate
      achieved by the standard oral MP regimen.

      In Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients, the conventional treatment is the oral combination
      melphalan and prednisone (MP). thalidomide has been widely used in myeloma, it has been
      proved clinical effective in refractory myeloma patients, it acts sinergistically in
      association with dexamethasone. In newly diagnosed patients, the combination oral MP plus
      thalidomide increased the partial and complete response rate.Bortezomib represents a novel
      class of anti-cancer drugs, it is active in patient with multiple myeloma who are refractory
      to conventional chemotherapy. In a preliminary report, the combination of VELCADE and
      Thalidomide induced a remarkable 60% PR rate in advanced refractory myeloma patients. This
      study will evaluate the safety and the efficacy of the association of Melphalan/
      Prednisone/Thalidomide/VELCADE (MPTV) as salvage treatment in advanced and refractory myeloma
      patients. This association might further increase the response rate achieved by the standard
      oral MP regimen.

             medical care.

          -  Female patient is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine
