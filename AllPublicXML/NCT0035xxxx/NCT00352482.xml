  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease that affects an individual's
      ability to breathe. Currently, no medications can reverse the damage to the lungs caused by
      IPF, but individuals are encouraged to engage in moderate exercise to strengthen lung
      function. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil at improving exercise
      tolerance and breathing difficulties in individuals with IPF.

      IPF is a disease that damages the air sacs in the lungs and leads to widespread and permanent
      scarring of lung tissue. Individuals with IPF may experience breathing difficulties, cough,
      chest pain, and a decreased exercise capacity. There is no cure for this disease, and
      individuals usually die within 3 to 5 years. It is recommended that individuals with IPF
      engage in moderate exercise, as this can help maintain strength and improve lung function.
      Many individuals with IPF also suffer from pulmonary hypertension, which is high blood
      pressure in the arteries leading to the lungs. Sildenafil, a medication currently used to
      treat pulmonary hypertension, increases blood flow to the lungs and enhances gas exchange
      within the lungs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of sildenafil at
      improving exercise tolerance and breathing difficulties in individuals with IPF and pulmonary
      hypertension.

      This 3-week study will enroll individuals with IPF and pulmonary hypertension. Study visits
      will occur at baseline, and Weeks 1 and 2. At the baseline visit, participants will perform a
      6-minute walk test, which will measure the distance walked in a 6-minute period. Oxygen
      levels will be measured prior to and during the test, and standardized questionnaires will be
      completed to assess breathing difficulties. A second 6-minute walk test will be performed 1
      hour following the first test. At the Week 1 visit, participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive a single dose of either 50 mg of sildenafil or placebo. One hour after receiving the
      medication, they will complete another 6-minute walk test. The Week 2 visit will be identical
      to the Week 1 visit, except participants who received sildenafil at Week 1 will receive
      placebo at Week 2, and vice versa.
