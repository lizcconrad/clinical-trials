      This is a repeat insult patch test study. On treatment days, the investigational product
      PEP005 Topical Gel (0.01% concentration) and vehicle control will be applied under open
      conditions to sites on the infrascapular region of the back 3 times weekly for 3 weeks (9
      applications in total) during the induction phase. Following a rest period of approximatley
      10-14 days, a single challenge application will be performed. Local tolerability will be
      assessed visually using an ordinal scoring system. If a cutaneous response observed in the
      challenge phase indicates possible sensitisation, or at the discretion of the investigator, a
      rechallenge will occur

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. are healthy males or females (to be confirmed by medical history);

          3. have Fitzpatick skin type I, II, III, or IV

          4. are willing to wait 6 hours after product application to shower;

          5. in the case of females of childbearing potential, are using an acceptable form of
             birth control (oral/implant/injectable/transdermal contraceptives, intrauterine
             device, condom with spermicide, diaphragm, or abstinence), have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at Screening, and submit to a pregnancy test prior to the challenge
             application;

          6. are free of any systemic or dermatologic disorder, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase the risk of adverse
             events;

          7. have acceptable vital signs (ie oral body temperature, blood pressure (systolic and
             diastolic), and pulse rate) taken and are willing to have them taken at the end of
             study (EOS, within 7 days of the initial challenge evaluation);

          8. complete a medical screening procedure; and

          9. read, understand and provide signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. have any visible skin disease at the application site which, in the opinion of the
             investigative personnel, will interfere with the evaluation of the test site reaction;

          2. have Fitzpatrick skin type V or VI;

          3. have excessive hair on their back;

          4. current drug or alcohol abuse;

          6. are not willing to refrain from using topical/systemic analgesics such as aspirin,
             Aleve, Motrin, Advil, or Nuprin within 72 hours prior to and during the study
             (occasional use of Tylenol will be permitted);

          7. based on the investigator's initial examination should not participate in the study
             (ie, non compliance, inability to understand the study and give adequate informed
             consent)

          8. are using systemic/locally-acting medications which might counter or influence the
             study aim during the study and within 2 weeks prior to the beginning of the study (eg,
             antihistamines, or topical glucocorticosteroids);

          9. are using systemic/locally-acting anti-inflammitories which might counter or influence
             the study aim during the study and within 72 hours prior to the beginning of the
             study;

         10. are females who are pregnant, plan to become pregnant during the study, or are nursing
             a child;

         11. have a known sensitivity or allergy to constituents present in the material being
             evaluated; and/or

         12. have participated in any clinical testing of an investigational drug within 28-days or
             any clinical patch study within 14-days prior to or are currently participating in any
             clinical testing.
