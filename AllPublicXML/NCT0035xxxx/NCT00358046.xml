  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, dose-ranging, efficacy and tolerability study in chronic kidney disease
      patients with hyperphosphatemia on hemodialysis. Patient participation in the study is
      approximately 10 weeks in duration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperphosphatemia is associated with abnormally high blood concentrations of phosphorus.
      Normally, phosphorus in the body is excreted into urine via the kidneys, but this process is
      impaired when renal function is reduced. Hyperphosphatemia occurs in many patients with renal
      insufficiency, especially those on dialysis. High blood phosphorus concentrations trigger
      various complications caused by phosphorous interaction with blood calcium or parathyroid
      hormones, and makes patients more prone to calcium deposition in soft tissues such as the
      coronary arteries, increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease. ILY101 is a non-absorbed,
      metal-free polymer that binds phosphorus in the gastrointestinal tract, allowing for
      excretion of phosphorus. It is therefore anticipated to ameliorate hyperphosphatemia by
      reducing the absorption of phosphorus from the gastrointestinal tract.
