      To prove the combination of L-citrulline with simvastatin leads to greater improvement in the
      symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) than simvastatin alone by evaluating oral L-
      citrulline or placebo against simvastatin for improvement in treadmill walking distance in
      patients, 40–75 years of age, who have PAD with intermittent claudication.

      The primary objective of this study is to prove the combination of L-citrulline with
      simvastatin leads to greater improvement in the symptoms of PAD than simvastatin alone. This
      will be accomplished by evaluating efficacy of orally administered L-citrulline or placebo
      against background therapy with simvastatin for improvement in treadmill absolute
      claudication walking distance (ACWD) in patients, 40–75 years of age, who have PAD with
      intermittent claudication in Fontaine stage II and symptom-limited treadmill walking
      distance.

      Secondary objectives include comparing the combination therapy to simvastatin alone for
      improvement in treadmill pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and ischemic window.

      Other secondary objectives include evaluating the safety and tolerability of L-citrulline
      alone or combined with simvastatin in this patient population and assessing the effects of
      treatment on quality of life (QOL) as measured by two QOL instruments.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 40–75 years of age

          2. If female, post-menopausal for the past year, surgically sterile (i.e., tubal
             ligation, hysterectomy), or using an adequate method of birth control (i.e., oral
             contraceptives, double barrier method, IUD cover, sterilized partner, or other method
             deemed appropriate by Investigator)

          3. If male capable of fathering children, using an adequate method of birth control
             (i.e., condom or partner using adequate method of birth control)

          4. Peripheral arterial disease with stable, reproducible, intermittent claudication and
             symptom-limited treadmill walking distance of at least 6 months duration

          5. Rest ankle-brachial index (ABI) ≤0.90 and 10 mm Hg decrease in ankle pressure 1 minute
             after completing the ETT

          6. ACWD on a standardized (Skinner-Gardner protocol) ETT ≥50 m (164 feet) but ≤300 m (984
             feet) determined by the average result on two consecutive ETTs performed at least 7
             days apart during the screening phase (Fontaine stage II)

          7. ACWD variability &lt;25% between two consecutive ETTs performed at least 7 days apart
             during the screening phase. The percent variability is calculated by the difference of
             the two walking distances divided by the greater of the two walking distances
             multiplied by 100%. If the variability exceeds 25% a third ETT may be performed and
             the variability between the second and third test used to determine baseline and
             inclusion criteria
