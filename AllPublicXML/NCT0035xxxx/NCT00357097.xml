  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ropinirole has shown to improve mood in depressed patients as well as to improve the symptoms
      of Restless Legs Syndrome. Up to 40% of RLS patients suffer from mild depression, therefore
      it would be important for decisions no therapy to know whether a drug could improve both
      depressive and RLS symptoms.
