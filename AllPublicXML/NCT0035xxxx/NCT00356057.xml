    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of biventricular
      pacing over conventional right ventricular pacing in patients with persistent or permanent,
      symptomatic atrial fibrillation undergoing atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and permanent
      pacing therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, blinded trial. The study will consist
      of approximately 265 patients who require treatment of persistent or permanent, symptomatic
      atrial fibrillation by atrioventricular (AV) node ablation and permanent pacing therapy i.e.
      &quot;Ablate and Pace&quot; therapy. All patients enrolled into the clinical study will be randomly
      assigned to one of three groups using a randomization ratio of 2:2:1. Patients will be
      assigned to receive either biventricular (biV) pacing with CLS-based rate adaptive pacing
      using the legally marketed Protos DR/CLS (Group 1), or biventricular pacing with
      accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 2), or right ventricular
      (RV) pacing with accelerometer-based rate adaptive pacing using the Stratos LV (Group 3).
      Patients in all three groups will be implanted with legally marketed right and left
      ventricular pacing leads. The patients, the core lab used to interpret the echocardiographic
      data and the Clinical Events Committee adjudicating crossover, patient death and congestive
      heart failure (CHF) hospitalizations will be blinded to the randomization assignment.

    <description>Complication-free rate was evaluated in an equivalence (non-inferiority) format compared to a target of 85% minus delta (10%), where delta is the clinically significant difference for establishing equivalence. This endpoint evaluated system-related complications. All Stratos systems (in both the biV and RV pacing arms) were evaluated together as pre-specified in the protocol.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quality Of Life (QOL) Score Over 6 Months Calculated as QOL Score at Baseline - QOL Score at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to six months post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life was evaluated using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire.The questionnaire consists of 21 questions to measure the subjects' perception of how their HF and its treatment affected their ability to live as they wanted during the last month. The questions describe different ways in which some people are affected (i.e. physical, socioeconomic, and psychological impairments). If a question does not apply to a subject or is not related to their HF, then they can answer with a 0. If it does apply to them, then they can rate (from 1 to 5) how much it has affected them. From the 21 questions, the lowest possible total score is 0, and the highest possible total score is 105. A lower score is desirable. This outcome was calculated as QOL score at baseline minus QOL score at 6 months. Therefore, a positive change in QOL score represents an improvement in quality of life, while a negative change in QOL score represents a worsening.</description>

    <description>The purpose is to evaluate the change in the participant's NYHA classification.
There are four NYHA classes:
Class I: Patients with cardiac disease, but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality Of Life (QOL) Score Over 6 Months Calculated as QOL Score at Baseline - QOL Score at 6 Months</title>
        <description>Quality of Life was evaluated using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire.The questionnaire consists of 21 questions to measure the subjects' perception of how their HF and its treatment affected their ability to live as they wanted during the last month. The questions describe different ways in which some people are affected (i.e. physical, socioeconomic, and psychological impairments). If a question does not apply to a subject or is not related to their HF, then they can answer with a 0. If it does apply to them, then they can rate (from 1 to 5) how much it has affected them. From the 21 questions, the lowest possible total score is 0, and the highest possible total score is 105. A lower score is desirable. This outcome was calculated as QOL score at baseline minus QOL score at 6 months. Therefore, a positive change in QOL score represents an improvement in quality of life, while a negative change in QOL score represents a worsening.</description>

          <title>Change in Quality Of Life (QOL) Score Over 6 Months Calculated as QOL Score at Baseline - QOL Score at 6 Months</title>
          <description>Quality of Life was evaluated using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF) Quality of Life (QOL) Questionnaire.The questionnaire consists of 21 questions to measure the subjects' perception of how their HF and its treatment affected their ability to live as they wanted during the last month. The questions describe different ways in which some people are affected (i.e. physical, socioeconomic, and psychological impairments). If a question does not apply to a subject or is not related to their HF, then they can answer with a 0. If it does apply to them, then they can rate (from 1 to 5) how much it has affected them. From the 21 questions, the lowest possible total score is 0, and the highest possible total score is 105. A lower score is desirable. This outcome was calculated as QOL score at baseline minus QOL score at 6 months. Therefore, a positive change in QOL score represents an improvement in quality of life, while a negative change in QOL score represents a worsening.</description>

        <title>Changes in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification</title>
        <description>The purpose is to evaluate the change in the participant's NYHA classification.
There are four NYHA classes:
Class I: Patients with cardiac disease, but without resulting limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class II: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class III: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain.
Class IV: Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency or of anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased.</description>
