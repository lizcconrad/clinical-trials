  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Bronchiolitis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. It is an acute,
      infectious illness of the lower respiratory tract resulting in obstruction of the
      bronchioles. The etiology is viral in the majority of the cases and RSV is the most commonly
      isolated agent. The disease is more common in younger children under 2 years of age. Children
      often receive unnecessary antibiotics and often require hospitalization. An episode of
      bronchiolitis can be followed by recurrent wheezing episodes. RSV bronchiolitis in the first
      year of life is one of the most important risk factors for the subsequent development of
      asthma in both developed and developing countries. Thus, bronchiolitis is a global public
      health problem. Zinc supplementation has been shown to be effective in both preventing and
      treating pneumonia. However, no study has particularly examined the effect of zinc on ARI
      associated with wheezing. This study aims to investigate whether zinc (20 mg/day) reduces1.
      the duration of bronchiolitis in children.2. the severity of bronchiolitis in children.3. the
      rate of hospitalization for bronchiolitis.3. future episodes of wheezing in children.
