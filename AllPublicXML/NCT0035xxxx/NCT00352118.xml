      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with radiation therapy works in treating patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.
      The doctor also wants to find out if patients who receive this treatment need a feeding tube
      1 year after starting treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine feeding tube dependency at 12 months in patients with locally advanced head
           and neck cancer treated with induction chemotherapy comprising docetaxel, cisplatin, and
           fluorouracil followed by cisplatin and reduced-dose radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the progression-free, disease-free, and overall survival of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pattern of failure in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess pre- and post-treatment swallowing ability of patients and the impact on their
           quality of life.

      Tertiary

        -  Quantify salivary flow rates of patients receiving chemotherapy with radiotherapy for
           head and neck malignancy.

        -  Evaluate the quality of saliva by examining total protein concentrations.

        -  Quantify proangiogenic cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8, and vascular
           endothelial growth factor) in the saliva of these patients.

        -  Determine the degree of mucositis and xerostomia of patients receiving chemotherapy with
           radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy.

        -  Compare salivary flow rates with the grade of mucositis and xerostomia of patients
           receiving chemotherapy with radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 1
           hour on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1- 4. Patients also
           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 5-14 or pegfilgrastim SC on day
           5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a partial or clinical complete response
           proceed to chemoradiotherapy 3 weeks later.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats
           every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients also undergo concurrent reduced-dose radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6
           weeks.

        -  Surgery: Approximately 6 to 8 weeks after completing chemoradiotherapy, patients with
           residual neck disease or disease initially staged at N2 or greater undergo neck
           dissection.

      Saliva is collected periodically to measure flow rates and quality; quantify proangiogenic
      cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, IL-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor); and
      examine the grade of mucositis and xerostomia.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before chemoradiotherapy, 1 month after the last
      radiation treatment, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
