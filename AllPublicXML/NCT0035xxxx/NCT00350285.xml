      This behavioral research is an efficacy trial evaluating an intervention called &quot;The Teen
      Marijuana Check-Up&quot; with non-treatment seeking adolescent marijuana users.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three hundred adolescents who smoke marijuana (ages 14-19), recruited in four Seattle-area
      high schools, will be enrolled in the trial. Participants will be recruited either through
      in-class presentations focusing on marijuana or via referrals from school staff. They will
      first be assessed regarding use of marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs, as well as pertinent
      attitudes and goals. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

        -  The experimental intervention is a two-session motivational enhancement treatment. A
           personalized feedback report, containing information from the participant's assessment
           as well as normative comparison data, is reviewed, with the Health Educator employing
           motivational interviewing strategies intended to enhance motivation for reduction or
           cessation of marijuana use. Specific goals for change and behavior change strategies are
           discussed with participants who wish support to change their marijuana use.

        -  The comparison condition involves two educational sessions focusing on the health and
           behavioral effects of marijuana.

        -  The third condition (delayed treatment control) involves a minimal baseline assessment
           followed three months later by a reassessment interview. Those assigned to this
           condition will then be given their choice of either active treatment.

      Following completion of their two intervention sessions, participants in the two active
      treatments will be offered an additional four sessions of cognitive-behavioral skills
      training in which the focus is strategies in quitting marijuana. All participants will be
      reassessed at 3 and 12 months following their initial assessment interviews.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: Individuals who contact the project will be screened according to the
        following inclusion criteria:

          -  age (14-19 years old),

          -  grade level (freshmen through seniors) and

          -  marijuana use (smoked 9 or more days in past 30).

        Exclusion Criteria: Individuals will be excluded if:

          -  they are not fluent in English,

          -  they have a thought disorder that precludes full participation,

          -  they refuse to accept randomization to condition.

        In addition to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, participants who appear to be in
        psychological or physical distress will be assessed further and referred to other services
        as appropriate. The need for other services will not necessarily preempt participation in
        the TMCU unless the individual is incapable or unwilling to complete the protocol. As was
        the case in our Stage 1b trial, all ineligible applicants will be offered a single feedback
        session, and the Strategies That Work booklet will be offered to those who indicate any
        interest in reducing or quitting marijuana use.
