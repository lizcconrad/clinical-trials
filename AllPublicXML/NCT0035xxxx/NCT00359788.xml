    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks treatment with
      tiotropium HandiHaler 18 micrograms (mcg) daily compared to Combivent Metered Dose Inhaler
      (MDI) Chlorofluorocarbon Inhalation Aerosol 2 actuations four times a day in Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients currently prescribed Combivent® MDI.
