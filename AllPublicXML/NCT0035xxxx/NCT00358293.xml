  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nightly administration of 8 mg of a unique sublingual (under the tongue) formulation of
      tizanidine, a known anti-spasticity medication, has been shown in a previous study to improve
      next-day spasticity, about 12 hours following dosing in 20 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
      This improvement was statistically significant when compared to oral tizanidine dosing. The
      current study is being undertaken to see if increasing the dose to 12 mg once nightly will
      result in an even greater improvement, with a longer effect, i.e., next day improvement in
      spasticity both in the morning as well as in the late afternoon.

      Sublingual tizanidine, a novel test formulation of the known effective antispasticity agent,
      has been shown to have a unique pharmacokinetic profile [(i.e., nearly twice the
      bioavailability/AUC), but with little or no increase in peak plasma levels (Cmax) as compared
      to oral tizanidine (Zanaflex)]. When administered nightly to 20 MS patients, at a dose of 8
      mg, it was shown to improve next-day spasticity (statistically significant improvement in
      Ashworth scores) about 12 hours post-dosing), improvement in nighttime (first quartile) sleep
      efficiency (as demonstrated by actigraphic measurement), and no increase in daytime
      somnolence.

      Current study is being undertaken to evaluate if increased dosing (12 mg once nightly) of
      sublingual tizanidine (vs. oral) will show a concomitant increase in clinical effect, i.e.,
      longer improvement, with next-day spasticity score improvement both in AM (as previously) as
      well as at PM (late afternoon) evaluation, with no increase in daytime somnolence.
