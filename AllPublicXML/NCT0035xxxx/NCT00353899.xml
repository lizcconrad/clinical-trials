      This study will examine ways to establish and standardize normal measurements for children,
      specific to gender, age, and body surface, when using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI,
      which was introduced in the 1980s, is being used more frequently for children. In this study,
      researchers seek to understand how a child's heart is different from that of an adult, when
      an MRI is used for tests. More children with congenital heart disease are living longer.
      Researchers are looking for a better way to assess their cardiac anatomy and function, and to
      compare findings with normal function.

      Patients ages 8 to 21 in good health and who do not smoke may be eligible for this study.
      There will be a blood or urine test to check for pregnancy in female volunteers who have
      begun menstruating or who are over age 12. Pregnancy test results must be negative for those
      patients to stay in the study. The MRI technique uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves
      to obtain images of body organs and tissues. For that procedure, patients will lie still on a
      table that slides into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. They will be in the scanner from
      20 to 60 minutes. As the scanner takes pictures, patients will hear knocking or beeping
      sounds, and they will wear earplugs to reduce the noise. Patients will be able to communicate
      with the MRI staff at all times during the scan. At any time, patients or their parents may
      ask that the patients be moved out of the machine. If they would like, patients can bring a
      music CD or listen to a radio station through headphones. Some MRI techniques require
      monitoring while the patient is undergoing the scan. For monitoring of the heart, an
      electrocardiogram (EKG) will be performed to make sure that the heart rhythm is normal and
      that heart disease is not present. Patients may be asked to wear adhesive patches that are
      attached to wires of the EKG machine on their chests. To monitor breathing, patients may be
      asked to wear a rubber belt that stretches as they take a breath. So that the best quality
      images are produced, patients may be asked to hold their breath for about 15 seconds.

      During the MRI scan, patients may experience peripheral nerve stimulation, usually
      experienced as a muscle twitch. It is caused by rapid switching of magnetic fields and is not
      serious. Patients who feel a muscle twitch should report that sensation to the person
      performing the scan. It is possible, though unlikely, for a painful sensation to result from
      nerve stimulation. Patients should immediately report if they have pain so that the scan can
      be stopped.

      A cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scan will be performed on normal children and
      young adult volunteers. These studies will be conducted in the MRI systems located in the NIH
      Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The results will be used to establish the normal
      standard MRI measurements for the pediatric population; including left ventricular mass,
      ejection fractions and other standard cardiac measurements.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any normal volunteer between the ages of 8 and 21 years old, non-smoker who is capable of
        giving assent and has a legal guardian to give informed consent if under 18 years old.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A subject will be excluded if he/she has a contraindication to MR scanning.

          1. Brain aneurysm clip

          2. Implanted neural stimulator

          3. Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator

          4. Cochlear implant

          5. Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings)

          6. Insulin pump

        &lt;TAB&gt;

        To assess whether subjects are indeed normal, the legal guardian will be asked to fill out
        a questionnaire. Subjects also will be excluded for a paralyzed hemidiaphragm, morbid
        obesity (BMI greater than 30%), claustrophobia, smokers, significant asthma (greater than
        one asthma attack per month for the past three months), pregnancy, major medical illness
        requiring regular medications (such as steroids that may alter muscle mass, sickle cell
        disease, thalassemia), history of cardiac disease (requiring SBE prophylaxis when visiting
        the dentist), and/or history of significant previous surgery that may alter cardiac anatomy
        (such as diaphragmatic hernia, tracheoesophageal fistula).

        Females of menstruating age will receive a pregnancy test as part of the screening process
        to participate in this protocol. If they do not wish to be tested, they cannot participate
        in this voluntary protocol.
