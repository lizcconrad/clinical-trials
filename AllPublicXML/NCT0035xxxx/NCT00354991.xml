    <description>Patients took losartan 50 mg /HCTZ 12.5 mg orally once daily for 13 weeks. At Weeks 0, 4 and 8 if the blood pressure goal was not reached then the losartan/HCTZ combination will be titrated upwards according to the following scheme: losartan 50/HCTZ 12.5 to losartan 100/HCTZ 12.5 to losartan 100/HCTZ 25.</description>
