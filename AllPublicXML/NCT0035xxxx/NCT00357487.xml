  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project consists on the realization followed by the clinical validation of two medical
      instruments dedicated to the precise sentinel lymph nodes identification and localization in
      the case of breast cancer: an intra operative probe and an operative mini gamma camera. The
      sentinel lymph node technique, based on the propagation of cancer cells in the lymphatic
      system, allows a better evaluation of tumor staging, prognosis and therapeutic strategy
      determination. The goal of these instruments designed by physicians and physicists is to
      significantly improve the detection efficiency of the technique in order to reduce the false
      negative rate and then the recurrence risk, as well as the operative morbidity.Clinical
      oncologist surgeons and fundamental physics applied to medical imaging researchers are
      involved in this project. The clinical validation of the medical instruments will be
      organized in the Gynaecologic and Obstetric department of the Hospices Civils de Strasbourg
      with a series of 25 patients in the framework of a regular french protocol of clinical
      research.
