      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MRgFUS in the
      treatment of metastatic bone tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bone is the third most common organ involved by metastasic disease behind lung and liver. In
      breast cancer, bone is the second most common site of metastatic spread, and 90% of patients
      dying of breast cancer have bone metastasis. Breast and prostate cancer metastasize to bone
      most frequently, which reflects the high incidence of both these tumors, as well as their
      prolonged clinical courses.

      Post cancer survival has increased with improvement in early detection and treatments. As a
      consequence, the number of patients developing metastatic bone disease during their lifetime
      has also increased. Patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer have an average 2-year
      survival from the time of presentation with their first bone lesion. In patients who die from
      breast, prostate, and lung cancer, autopsy studies have shown that up to 85% have evidence of
      bone metastases at the time of death.

      Current treatments for patients with bone metastases are primarily palliative and include
      localized therapies (radiation and surgery), systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal
      therapy, radiopharmaceutical, and bisphosphanates), and analgesics (opioids and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs). Recently, radiofrequency ablation has been tested as a treatment
      option for bone metastases. The main goals of these treatments are improvement of quality of
      life and functional level. These goals can be further described: 1) Pain relief, 2)
      Preservation and restoration of function, 3) Local tumor control, 4) Skeletal stabilization.

      The study hypothesis is that MRgFUS is a safe and potentially effective non-invasive
      treatment for metastatic bone tumors with a low incidence of co-morbidity. Based on the
      result of this study the Sponsor will initiate a larger study in an effort to approve
      metastatic bone tumors as an indication for its MRgFUS ExAblate device.
