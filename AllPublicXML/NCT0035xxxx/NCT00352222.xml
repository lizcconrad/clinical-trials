      To obtain additional data on safety and efficacy of the Express stent implantation in the
      treatment of stenosed or occlusive atherosclerotic disease (de novo or restenotic lesions) in
      the iliac arteries (common or external).

      This study was conducted to provide additional data on the safety and efficacy of the
      Express™ Vascular LD stent, particularly with regard to the long-term patency in iliac
      arteries. The study would provide data on angiographic endpoints and clinical outcomes at 30
      days, 6 months, and at 12 and 24 months post implantation in atherosclerotic lesions in iliac
      arteries. The data obtained in this study with the use of the Express™ Vascular LD stent was
      compared with historical data obtained from the use of the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent.
      The Palmaz balloon expandable stent has been chosen as the control device because it is
      currently the only FDA-approved balloon-expandable stent for use in the percutaneous
      treatment of atherosclerotic disease in iliac arteries.

      The Palmaz balloon-expandable stent is no longer commercialized in Europe. Therefore a
      randomized study with the Palmaz balloon-expandable stent was not feasible. In addition,
      there are no ongoing or published randomized trials describing performance of a newer version
      of the Palmaz stent in iliac atherosclerotic lesions. In order to adequately compare the
      efficacy data of the ExpressTM Vascular LD stent with the efficacy data of the Palmaz
      balloon-expandable stent, the same efficacy parameter as in the publication on the Palmaz
      balloon-expandable stent was measured in this study: % mean loss of the luminal diameter at 6
      months post-procedure.

      The findings of the longer-term Follow-Up assessments at 12 and 24 months will be presented
      as the results from these assessments become available.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  chronic symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the iliac arteries (Fontaine Class IIa,
             IIb, and III)

          -  atherosclerotic de novo or restenotic lesions in the common and/or external iliac
             artery.

          -  baseline diameter stenosis of &gt; or = 50%

          -  reference vessel diameter &gt; or = 5mm and &lt; or = 10mm

          -  at least one sufficient ipsilateral infrapopliteal run-off

          -  length of diseased segment(s) &lt; or = 10cm and can be treated with maximally two
             overlapping Express Vascular LD Stents.

          -  multiple target lesions of the iliac arteries in the same patient can be included
             provided if each target lesion is compliant with the antiographic inclusion criteria
             and non-compliant with any of the antiographic exclusion criteria, target lesions are
             not located in the same target axis, and all target lesions can be treated during the
             same procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:
