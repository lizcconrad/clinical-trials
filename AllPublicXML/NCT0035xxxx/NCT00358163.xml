  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTK787/ZK 222584 is an inhibitor of VEGFR family tyrosine kinases. The primary objective of
      this study is to assess the safety of daily oral PTK787/ZK 222584 in combination with
      paclitaxel infused every 21 days. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetic assessment of
      the impact of PTK787/ZK 222584 on paclitaxel metabolism and evaluation of tumor response to
      the investigational treatment.

      -  We are looking for the highest dose of Paclitaxel that can be given safely in
           combination with the highest safe dose of Vatalanib. Therefore, not all people will
           receive the same dose of the study drug.

        -  Small groups of people will be enrolled in steps on this trial. This first group will be
           given a certain dose of Paclitaxel and Vatalanib. If they have few or manageable side
           effects, the next small group of people enrolled will receive higher doses of the study
           drugs. This increase in doses will continue until the study doctors find the highest
           dose of the drugs that can be given without causing severe or unmanageable side effects.

        -  In this study, Vatalanib tablets are taken daily, and paclitaxel is given by three-hour
           intravenous infusion once every 21 days.

             excluded at the investigator's discretion if he/she feels that 1) a potential drug
             interaction between PTK787/ZK 222584, paclitaxel and any of the patient's anti-HIV
             medications could influence the efficacy of the anti-HIV medication, or 2) it may
             place the patient at risk due to the pharmacologic activity of PTK787/ZK 222584.
