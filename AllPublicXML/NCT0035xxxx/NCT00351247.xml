      To determine the safety and efficacy of 2 vs 4 cycles of postconditioning method during
      primary PCI and direct stenting in acute MI, and to compared to primary PCI and direct
      stenting without the postconditioning.

      Sample size: 45 subjects

      Site Locations: Sheba medical center

      Patients: Patients presenting with an acute MI with onset of symptoms  6h, and planned to
      undergo primary PCI will be included. The target lesion should be located in the proximal or
      middle segment of a main native coronary artery, and should be suitable for percutaneous
      intervention.

      Primary Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of 2 vs 4 cycles of postconditioning
      method during primary PCI and direct stenting in acute MI, and to compared to primary PCI and
      direct stenting without the postconditioning.

      Primary Endpoint:

        -  ST segment resolution.

        -  Segmental wall motion score, resolution of edema and wall thickness by echocardiography.

        -  Infarct size estimation by cardiac enzymes and cardiac MRI.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) at 30 and 90 days

      Methods:

        -  ECG at baseline, immediately after procedure, 90 and 180 minutes after the procedure and
           6-24 hours after intervention.

        -  Core laboratory angiography measurements of TIMI flow, corrected TIMI Frame count,
           myocardial blush score and left ventricular angiography.

        -  Myocardial enzymes measurements: every 4 hours in the first 24 hours and every 6 hours
           in the following 48 hours.

        -  Left ventricular ejection fraction and wall motion score determined by echocardiography.

        -  Cardiac MRI estimation of infarct size. • Clinical follow-up at 30 and 90 days post
           procedure.

      Follow-up:

        -  Follow up at 30 days: Clinical.

        -  Clinical Follow up &amp; Cardiac MRI at 90 days.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is &gt; 21 years of age and provides informed consent.

          -  Evidence of AMI as indicated by signs and symptoms. Diagnosis of ST-segment elevation
             AMI will be based on chest pain for &gt;30 minutes and ST-segment elevation of &gt;1mV in 2
             limb lead or &gt;2mV in 2 anterior leads contiguous leads on the 12-lead ECG.

          -  Eligible to undergo primary PCI.

          -  Symptom duration is &lt; 6 hours prior to primary PCI.

          -  Angiographic: The target lesion in the infarct related artery (IRA) should be occluded
             (TIMI).

          -  Angiographic: The target lesion in the proximal or middle segment of a native major
             coronary artery (LAD, RCA or dominant CX).

          -  Angiographic: The target lesion should be suitable for PTCA or stenting.

          -  Angiographic: The IRA occlusion will be successfully opened by stenting with TIMI 2-3

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness to participate.

          -  Prior Acute MI

          -  Cardiac arrest or Killip score III-IV

          -  Women with known pregnancy.

          -  Active significant bleeding.

          -  Known allergy for aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel, or heparin.

          -  Chronic renal failure with creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl

          -  Other medical illness associated with limited life expectancy or that may cause the
             patient to be non-compliant with the protocol.

          -  Current participation in other trials using investigational drugs or devices.

          -  Contraindications to MRI including: arrythmias, cardiac pacer, brain aneurysm clips,
             cochlear implants, nerve stimulator.
