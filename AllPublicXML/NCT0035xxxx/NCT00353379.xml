      functional impairments in schizotypal personality disorder.

    <textblock>
      Schizotypal personality disorder is a psychiatric condition that is characterized by
      deficiencies in interpersonal relationships and disturbances in thought patterns, appearance,
      and behavior. This disorder is different from schizophrenia. While some of the symptoms of
      the two disorders are similar, such as the tendency to have unusual beliefs and behaviors,
      people with schizotypal personality disorder do not experience hallucinations and are not
      significantly disconnected from reality, both of which are signature symptoms of
      schizophrenia. Guanfacine is a drug that is often used to treat high blood pressure and
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. There is evidence that guanfacine enhances
      cognition and diminishes impulsivity. This study will determine the effectiveness of
      guanfacine in improving symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder.

      Participants in this 6-week, double-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      guanfacine or placebo. Participants receiving guanfacine will remain on the drug for the
      duration of the study. The other participants will receive placebo for the duration of the
      study. Guanfacine dosages will not exceed 2 mg per day. All participants will report to the
      study site weekly for assessments of vital signs, study compliance, medication side effects,
      and psychological symptoms. Additional cognitive testing will be performed at week 6. Upon
      study completion, patients will return for a follow-up assessment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be male or female

          -  Medically and neurologically healthy (Medically healthy means that the patient does
             not have a major or partially treated medical condition that based on the judgment of
             the research clinician would either put the patient at increased risk and/or affect
             our findings. Common conditions include: high blood pressure, diabetes, uncontrolled
             asthma or COPD, abnormal heart rhythm, chronic viral infections. Neurologically
             healthy means that the patient has not experienced brain injury or head trauma
             associated with prolonged (e.g., &gt; 10 minutes) loss of consciousness, seizures or
             other conditions based on the research clinician's judgment would either put the
             patient at increased risk and/or affect our findings.)

          -  Between 18 and 60 years of age

          -  Patients must also be medication free (at least 2 weeks) while participating in
             guanfacine, except for the following medications: NSAIDS (eg, Advil), Tylenol,
             Levothyroxine (if on stable dose for 1 month, no symptoms of hypothyroidism and normal
             thyroid labs), Non-centrally acting antihistamines, H2 blockers (eg, Zantac), PPIs
             (eg, Prilosec, Prevacid). Research physician will make judgment on case-by-case basis
             based on risk to subject, and potential confounding effect on data validity.

          -  Subjects in the SPD group must meet DSM-IV criteria for Schizotypal Personality
             Disorder.

          -  Subjects in the AvPD group must meet DSM-IV criteria for Avoidant Personality Disorder
             and not meet criteria for schizotypal, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorder. In
             addition, the AvPD group must have fewer than 2 schizotypal traits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may not have a significant medical illness (ie, insulin dependent diabetes,
             gastric/duodenal ulcer), or significant neurological illness (ie epilepsy, CMS, CVA,
             focal neurological lesion).

          -  Any cardiovascular condition that, based on the research clinician's judgment (which
             includes cardiological consultation), would put the participant at increased risk will
             be considered an exclusion criteria. This would certainly include evidence by history
             or exam of heart block, tachyarrhythmia, angina, ventricular hypertrophy, those taking
             antihypertensives. Blood pressure parameters will be a &gt;25% decrease in mean arterial
             systolic blood pressure from baseline, an orthostatic decrease in systolic blood
             pressure of 20 mm Hg and/or in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg, and heart rate
             parameter will be below 55 bpm.

          -  Participants are also excluded if they are more than 40% above ideal body weight. The
             weight limit helps insure that standard doses of guanfacine will not be given to
             patients who are extremely overweight who might then receive a lower concentration of
             these drugs in their central nervous system.

          -  Subjects must also have a corrected or uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better.

          -  All participants meeting DSM IV criteria for any current or past history of sustained
             IV-substance dependence are excluded from the study.

          -  Participants must be free of substance abuse for at least six months.

        Healthy Controls:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy control subjects will be selected according to criteria noted in methods, and
             in age distribution comparable to our patients.

          -  Healthy controls will be matched to patients on gender and parental socioeconomic
             status.

          -  Healthy controls must be male or female between the ages of 18 and 60.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  for medical illness are identical to those of patients

          -  must not meet criteria for a current or lifetime DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder,
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or any Axis II disorder.

          -  a current Axis I or II diagnosis or a family history of psychotic disorder will also
             be excluded. However, to avoid a group of HC's too highly groomed and unrepresentative
             of the general population we will not exclude HC subjects meeting criteria for a past
             Axis I diagnosis, such as adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder
             not otherwise specified, specific phobia, and sleep disorders. In addition subjects
             meeting criteria for a non-IV substance abuse disorder more than 6 months prior to
             enrollment will not be excluded.
