  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to measure the efficacy of varying spinal cord stimulation
      frequencies and pulse-width settings on chronic pain management. The spinal cord stimulator
      settings that are most effective in chronic pain management hope to be revealed for the
      purposes of this study. In this double-blind study, both the patient and the staff will not
      be aware of the spinal cord stimulator settings for each patient each week. The
      representative that will set the settings each week will be blinded to the identity of each
      patient and will set the spinal cord stimulator from another room. While there are few papers
      that show the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation in treating chronic pain, there has yet to
      be a study performed that measures the role of stimulation frequency and pulse-widths. This
      study hopes to be the first.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For a total of 9 weeks, patients will be randomized to 9 stimulation frequency and
      pulse-width setting combinations. The patient will stay with these settings for a week at a
      time. Prior to the patient's first office visit, he/she will be asked to take a chest x-ray.
      The patient will also repeat this chest x-ray at the end of the study. Each patient will be
      asked to provide daily information regarding pain medication usage, spinal cord stimulation
      usage, amplitude settings, and pain ratings. Additionally, patients will fill out the
      Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) and the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) every Monday
      when they come to the office, before he/she is randomized to the new settings for the week.
      The patient will also receive a call from the research assistant to see how he/she is doing
      that week and the patient will be provided with all the pertinent contact information to call
      at any time to ask questions. The patient can withdraw from the study completely at any point
      or drop out of the settings for the week. The patient will have a follow-up visit a month
      from the study's end date to discuss how the patient has been managing his/her pain at
      his/her spinal cord stimulator settings. Each patient will be compensated for completing the
      study. Efficacy will be measured based on the patient's answers to the pain probes, device
      usage, and medication usage.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have SCS implanted for at least 2 months before study start date

          -  The patient must be at least 18 years old

          -  The patient must currently be receiving pain relief from SCS usage

          -  The patient must be willing to participate in a 9-week study

          -  The patient must have at least 20% of battery life remaining in his/her spinal cord
             stimulator

          -  The patient must be able to tolerate Vicodin-Extra Strength as well as Tylenol, but
             can also take their own pain medication if it is not one of the two mentioned

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  The patient by report, and/or by physician assessment, exhibits any or all of the
             following, which might bias reporting of treatment outcome:

        A strong untreated dependency on prescription medication such as benzodiazepines and
        narcotic analgesics.

        A strong potential for secondary gain issues.

        A significant, untreated psychiatric comorbidity.

          -  The patient possesses a coexisting clinically relevant or disabling chronic pain
             problem not treated by SCS

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with unstable angina

          -  The patient receives a Karnofsky's performance score of &lt;60
