  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish and validate a scale/model that can be used to
      evaluate the duration of time and factors between short term hospital treatment and
      subsequent relapse periods in patients with schizoaffective/schizophreniform disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiological (study of the distribution and determinants of health-related
      states or events in defined population), multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites),
      observational (study in which patients are observed), cross-sectional (observation of all
      patients at one specific point in time), prospective (in which the patients are first
      identified and then followed forward as time passes) study. The sources of information in the
      study are units medical short stay psychiatric hospitalization or the acute care of the whole
      country, and clinical data of the patient at discharge. No intervention will be provided in
      this study. The general data (age range, gender, highest level of educational attainment,
      level of family support, substance abuse, events stressors, type of schizophrenia according
      to DSM-IV criteria [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fourth], etc) of approximately 2000
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder / schizophreniform patients will be collected in
      this study. No special tests will be done during the study. The study will collect patients'
      data in electronic data collection workbook and model validation will be used at 6 and 12
      months to confirm no relapse / hospitalization. The study observation period corresponds to
      the 3 years preceding the current relapse and current income (current hospitalization period)
      and 12 months after admission.

    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is used to rate the severity of a patient's psychotic condition on a 7-point scale. It is rated as follows: 1=Normal, not at all ill, 2=Borderline mentally ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly ill, 6=Severely ill, and 7=Among the most extremely ill.
