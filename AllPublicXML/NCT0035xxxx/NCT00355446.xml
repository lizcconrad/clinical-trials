  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assay human aqueous for bimatoprost and the presence of any
      metabolites, especially prostaglandin analogs. Hypothesis:Bimatoprost is not metabolized to a
      prostaglandin F-2-alpha analog in human eyes

        -  Bimatoprost levels in human aqueous peak approximately three hours post dosing

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must:

               1. Be willing and able to provide written Informed Consent.

               2. Be able and willing to follow instructions and likely to complete the entire
                  course of the study.

               3. Be male or female of any race at least 18 years of age.

               4. Have visually significant cataract for which they have elected to undergo
                  cataract surgery..

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No subject may:

             1. Have any contraindication to use of a prostaglandin analog or prostamide
             derivative.

             3. Have any active ocular disease other than glaucoma or ocular hypertension that
             would interfere with study parameters (such as: uveitis, ocular infection, or severe
             dry eye). Patients with mild chronic blepharitis, age-related macular degeneration,
             background diabetic retinopathy may be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.

             4. Have laser or any other intraocular surgery within the past three months. 5.
             Require use of ocular medications (including glaucoma medications), except
             intermittent use of artificial tears. Patients may not have a history of ever having
             used a prostaglandin analog topically.

             6. Have known allergy or sensitivity to the study medications or their components 7.
             Have corneal abnormalities that would interfere with the ability to obtain an adequate
             sample safely or have a shallow anterior which would make obtaining an aqueous sample
             difficult at the time of surgery in the opinion of the investigator.

             8. Be concurrently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or
             participation within the last 30 days in any investigational drug or device study.

             9. Be pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or be of childbearing potential and not
             using a reliable form of contraception (a woman is considered of childbearing
             potential unless she is postmenopausal, has had a uterus and/or both ovaries removed,
             or has had a bilateral tubal ligation).

             10. Have a situation or condition that in the investigator's opinion may put the
             subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with participation in the study.
