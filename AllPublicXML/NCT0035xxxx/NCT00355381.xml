    <textblock>
      Research shows that patient satisfaction with medical care correlates strongly with how
      satisfied they are with the ease of getting information from their providers regarding their
      medical condition. Although the Internet is a wonderful source of information for patients,
      research has shown that, unmediated, it comprises a potential quagmire of information poorly
      matched to users needs. Providers typically do not have enough time to fulfill all of their
      patients' information needs. One strategy to meeting the patient's information needs is to
      introduce librarians trained and experienced in consumer health information services into the
      relationship between the patient and the provider. One recently described tactic is for
      providers to provide information the way they of provide treatment-through an information
      prescription (IRx) filled by a librarian. The librarian fills the prescription by offering
      information services tailored to the needs of individual patients. At Johns Hopkins, we have
      piloted such a tactic, and in this project, extend and evaluate it. The research hypothesis
      is that provision of an IRx will improve patient satisfaction, provider knowledge and
      attitudes regarding patient information needs, and the efficiencies of care.

      The goal of this research is to evaluate IRx, to provide enough data so care organizations
      can decide whether to implement this in their own environment.

      To that end, our specific aims are:

        1. To evaluate the impact of IRx on patients. We are performing a randomized clinical
           trial, comparing IRx with standard provision of information. The primary outcome is
           patient satisfaction.

        2. To evaluate the impact of IRx on providers. As part of the trial, provider perceptions
           and behavior will be assessed.

        3. To evaluate the impact of IRx on the health-care system. As part of the trial, costs
           entailed and resources utilized will be assessed.

        4. To evaluate how IRx generalizes across service environments. The trial will be performed
           in two environments: adult breast cancer and neonatal intensive care.

      At the heart of this proposal are the randomized clinical trials. In each, patients in both
      intervention and control groups will receive standard clinical care in their clinic visits.
      Patients randomized to the intervention group will receive information services from a
      specially trained librarian; patients in the control groups will receive routine, current
      information provision. For Aim 1, immediately after their clinic visits and four weeks later,
      all participants will report their satisfaction on a survey that include measures of
      patient-provider communication. For Aim 2, participating providers are surveyed for their
      perceptions of information needs being met and about patient-provider interaction. For Aim 3,
      costs of care and costs of providing the IRx environment will be tabulated.

    <description>Information services tailored to the needs of individual patients. The information prescription (IRx)or service is defined for this study as a combination of: 1)An evidence-based web site for use by patients and their families; 2) A reference interview and assistance in locating relevant general information in response to patient information needs; 3) Documentation of the questions and the information service provided in response to these in the patient's Electronic Patient Record for review by providers as needed; and, 4) Triage of patient's/parents clinical questions to providers.</description>
