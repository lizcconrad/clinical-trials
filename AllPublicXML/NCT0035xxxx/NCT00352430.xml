      This study will evaluate new treatments for people who have pulmonary hypertension, or high
      blood pressure in the lungs, caused by sickle cell anemia or thalassemia.

      Patients ages 18 and older with a diagnosis of sickle cell disease or thalassemia, who have
      mild to severe pulmonary hypertension, and who are not pregnant or breastfeeding may be
      eligible for this study. There are three stages in the study, with up to 200 participants in
      the screening. Patients will undergo pulmonary function tests, including those for asthma and
      measurement of oxygen levels in the arterial blood. They will have a chest X-ray, computed
      tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, ventilation perfusion lung scan to look for blood clots,
      echocardiogram, test to measure how far patients can walk in 6 minutes, nighttime oxygen
      measurement done while asleep, blood collection, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the
      heart, and exercise test. About 3 to 4 days are needed for the tests, all of which can be
      done while patients are outpatients, except for the sleep study. For the CT scan, patients
      lie on a table while an X-ray beam takes images of the lungs and heart. The lung scan
      involves breathing of a small amount of a radioactive aerosol called Tc99m DTPA while
      pictures are taken of the lungs from various angles. Then an injection of albumin, a protein
      with a small amount of radioactivity, will be given, and more lung pictures will be taken.
      For the MRI scan, patients lie on a table that slides into a machine. A medication called
      gadolinium will be injected, to help improve images made through the scan. After the tests,
      patients will be admitted to the Clinical Center for 1 day. A small plastic catheter, or
      tube, will be placed in the vein of an arm. A longer catheter will go into a deeper vein
      (neck or leg), and a pulmonary artery catheter will be inserted to measure blood pressure in
      the blood vessels. Doctors will guide the catheter into the lung artery. Patients will be
      asked to pedal on a stationary bicycle while heart and lung pressure is measured. If
      pulmonary hypertension is present, patients will proceed to the second stage (up to 50
      participants). While the catheter is still in place, patients will wear a face mask and
      breathe nitric oxide (NO) for 20 minutes. They will take 50 mg of sildenafil by mouth, and
      pressure in the heart and lungs will be monitored for about 4 hours. They will again receive
      NO for another 20 minutes. Blood samples will be taken, and the heart rhythm and pressure in
      the lungs will be monitored. Sildenafil can cause headache, flushing, and indigestion. Side
      effects of the lung scan involve allergic reactions to DTPA and albumin. Patients with an
      allergy to eggs should not have that test.

      Up to 25 patients can enter the third stage. They will breathe NO by using a tank of gas that
      delivers it through tubes to the nose, for a period of 6 weeks. They will continue taking
      sildenafil as previously prescribed and visit the clinic every 2 to 4 weeks for an
      echocardiogram, blood tests, and 6-minute walk test. After 6 weeks, patients will have
      catheterization of the heart again to measure pressure in the heart and lungs. Then NO will
      be stopped, and pressure in the lungs will be checked to see if NO has helped lower the blood
      pressure-and to make sure that the blood pressure does not increase when medication is
      stopped. Patients whose symptoms have improved as a result of breathing NO may wish to
      continue with that therapy.

      Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome
      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.
      Pulmonary hypertension has now been identified as a major cause of death in adults with
      sickle cell disease. Similarly, pulmonary hypertension has been identified as a chronic
      complication of hemolytic disorders such as thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis and
      paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Sildenafil has been proposed as a possible therapy for
      both primary and secondary pulmonary hypertension and recent phase I/II studies from the
      intramural NIH suggest it is well tolerated and efficacious in this population. Furthermore,
      a number of recent studies have suggested that NO based therapies may have a favorable impact
      on sickle red cells at the molecular level and could improve the abnormal microvascular
      perfusion that is characteristic of sickle cell anemia.

      This clinical trial is designed with three major objectives: 1) to assess cardiopulmonary
      function in patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia with and without pulmonary
      hypertension, 2) to determine the relative acute vasodilatory effects of sildenafil, and
      inhaled NO in patients with hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension and 3) to determine
      the chronic effects of the addition of inhaled NO on pulmonary hemodynamics and functional
      capacity in patients with hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension chronically treated
      with sildenafil.
