      This is a randomised controlled clinical trial to compare laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI)
      and primary phacoemulsification with intra-ocular lens implantation (phaco/IOL) in the
      treatment of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG). Following successful medical
      lowering of raised intra-ocular pressure (IOP) and control of intraocular inflammation,
      patients presenting to Singapore National Eye Centre and Singapore General Hospital with
      acute primary angle-closure glaucoma who meet the eligibility are randomised to one of the
      two treatment arms: laser peripheral iridotomy and primary phacoemulsification with
      intra-ocular lens implantation. These patients will be monitored closely for 2 years
      post-operatively.

      AIMS

      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled clinical trial to compare
      LPI and primary phacol/IOL in the treatment of APACG.

      The specific aim is to compare long-term IOP control in patients who undergo LPI with
      patients who undergo primary phaco/IOL. At the same time the following will be studied.

        1. To evaluate the safety of these two techniques for the treatment of APACG

        2. To assess the development of PAS

        3. To establish if LPI and primary phaco/IOL are as effective in preventing the recurrence
           of acute attack in eyes with APACG

      TREATMENT PLAN

      Initial Medical Treatment

      Patients with APACG will be treated initially for the acute attack with medical treatment.
      The initial treatment is standardized to the following:

        1. Intravenous acetazolamide (Diamox) 500 mg stat

        2. Oral acetazolamide 250 mg tid to qid with Span K 1.2 g om

        3. Topical beta-blocker (Timolol 0.5%) bid or Brimonidine bid if beta-blockers are
           contra-indicated.

        4. Topical pilocarpine 4% qid

        5. Topical steroids

        6. Intravenous mannitol 20% at 1-2g/kg at 4 hours after initiation of treatment if IOP is
           not reduced by 20% of initial IOP unless contra-indicated due to systemic disease eg.
           Congestive heart failure.

        7. A second infusion of intravenous mannitol 20% at 2g/kg at 12 hours after initiation of
           treatment if IOP is still not reduced by 20% of initial IOP

      Response to Initial Treatment and Evaluation of Cataract

      Patients are divided into 2 categories based on IOP after 24 hours of initiation of medical
      treatment: (a) APACG with IOP £ 30 mmHg (b) APACG with IOP &gt; 30 mmHg.

      Patients with IOP £ 30 mmHg are evaluated clinically for the presence of cataract and further
      divided into those with cataract and those without cataract. Patients with cataract are
      defined as those with best corrected visual acuity equal or less than 6/15 due to lens
      opacity in the opinion of a consultant grade ophthalmologist.

      Note: Eyes with intumescent cataract (phacomorphic glaucoma), subluxated lens or anterior
      chamber depth differing by more than 0.3 mm are excluded.

      Eligible patients with informed consent are randomised.

      Laser Peripheral Iridotomy

        1. In addition to the consultants, LPI may be performed by registrars, senior registrars
           and fellows who have observed and been taught by the glaucoma consultants and are deemed
           to be able to perform the procedure to a high standard.

        2. LPI is performed when the cornea is sufficiently clear (usually within 72 hours)
           following the lowering of the IOP medically.

        3. Technique for LPI to be standardized to sequential argon-Nd-YAG Laser PI.

        4. LPI should be sited at the superior nasal or superior temporal quadrant.

        5. The size of opening should be ³ 200mm.

        6. Following successful LPI, topical eyedrops are continued for one week after the
           procedure. Oral Diamox is discontinued.

        7. If the initial attempt is unsuccessful, LPI at a second alternative site will be
           attempted. If the second attempt remains unsuccessful, patient will be considered as
           failure .

      Phacoemulsification with Intra-ocular Lens Implantation

        1. All phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation are to be performed by
           consultant surgeons. The panel of surgeons is formed from the group of co-investigators
           of this study.

        2. Phacoemulsification will be carried out between 5 to 7 days following the lowering of
           the IOP. This is to allow for improved corneal clarity and reduction of intra-ocular
           inflammation.

        3. Gutt pilocarpine to be stopped on morning of operation.

        4. Pre-operative intravenous mannitol 20% at 1-2g/kg is given 2 hours before the start of
           operation for those subjects with an IOP persistently raised above 21mmHg.

        5. Clear corneal incision.

        6. Viscoelastic agent to be injected 360 degrees circumferentially in the angles to deepen
           the anterior chamber. There will be no other angle augmentation procedure using surgical
           instruments.

        7. A standard foldable IOL (Type of IOL: Acrysof MA60)

        8. Viscoelastic agent should be removed at the end of operation as far as possible.

        9. Oral Diamox 250 mg to be given stat post-operatively to reduce post-operative IOP spike.

       10. Following successful phacoemulsification with IOL implantation, topical steroids and
           antibiotics are given. Topical pilocarpine, timolol and oral Diamox are stopped.

      IOP Lowering Medication

      With regard to the determination of endpoints IOP evaluation will be considered from
      post-operative week 3 onward. This is to allow for treatment of short-term surgery related
      IOP fluctuation.

      During the follow up period, if a rise of IOP occurs, i.e. IOP is between 22 to 24 mmHg on
      two occasions within one month or IOP ³ 25 mmHg on one occasion, IOP lowering medication will
      be started.

      FOLLOW-UP

      Post operation visit Window period

      1st week ± 2 days 3rd week ± 5 days 6th week ± 7 days 3rd month ± 2 weeks 6th month to 2nd
      year ± 3 weeks

      At the completion of the trial patient will receive normal clinical follow up of 4-6 monthly
      thereafter whilst the data will not be collected for this study.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare IOP control between these two treatment
      groups.

      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      Sample Size Calculation:

      The primary objective of the study is to compare long-term intra-ocular pressure (IOP)
      control between the two groups.

      The proportion of the subjects whose IOP are not successfully controlled in the LPI group can
      be estimated as 60% (Aung T 2001). And the proportion of the subjects whose IOP are not
      successfully controlled in the phacoemulsification with intra-ocular lens implant group is
      about 20% under clinical estimation. Hence, the study needs a sample size of 70 patients
      (Machin, Campbell, Fayers &amp; Pinol, 1997), 35 in each group. This will be sufficient to detect
      a 60% vs. 20% of proportion of the subjects who develop increasing IOP between two groups
      with a two-sided test with a power 90% while the significance level is controlled at 5%.

      Statistical Analysis Plan

      All statistical analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. In the event of
      lost to follow-up, patients will still be included in the analysis for the duration that they
      are observed, and the last IOP which is assessed before lost to follow-up will be used for
      data analysis.

      To compare long-term IOP control between two treatments, Pearson χ2 test or Fisher’s exact
      test will be used. The evaluation of the incidence of recurrence of an acute attack in eyes
      with APACG will be carried out using Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression will be carried
      out to adjust for relevant covariates.

      The time interval for the subsequent increase in IOP to occur after LPI or phacol/IOL is to
      be recorded. Kaplan-Meier life table analysis can be applied to assess the survival time
      (failure being defined as any need for further glaucoma treatment) of two groups, and Log
      rank test will be used to compare the two survival curves. In addition, The Cox regression
      will be used to adjust for covariates where applicable.

      An interim statistical analysis will be carried out after all patients have completed 6
      months follow-up.
