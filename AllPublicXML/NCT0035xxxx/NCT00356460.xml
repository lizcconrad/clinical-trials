    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of GC1008, a human anti-transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) monoclonal
      antibody in previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma or malignant melanoma.

    <textblock>
      Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) is a cytokine which is often over-expressed and
      over-produced by malignancies and has been implicated as an important factor in promoting the
      growth, progression, and metastatic potential of advanced cancers. In preclinical studies,
      TGFβ can act to promote tumor cell migration/invasiveness, influence tumor stroma (by
      increasing extracellular matrix production, cytokine secretion, and angiogenesis), and
      suppress anti-tumor immunity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical use of
      GC1008, a human monoclonal antibody capable of binding and neutralizing all isoforms of TGFβ.

      This is a Phase 1 multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to characterize
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and potential anti-tumor activity
      of GC1008, in patients with histologically confirmed, locally advanced and surgically
      inoperable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or malignant melanoma. Patients with RCC
      must have failed at least 1 prior therapy and patients with renal cell carcinoma must have
      failed either sorafenib or sunitinib. Other qualifying prior therapies includes any medical,
      surgical, radiation or investigational approaches used for potential therapeutic benefit (but
      not for diagnostic purposes) in patients with advanced disease. Patients may receive up to 4
      intravenous infusions of GC1008, and patients with stable disease, with an objective tumor
      response or with clinical benefit may be eligible to receive extended therapy. For part 2 of
      the study, only patients with malignant melanoma will be enrolled.
