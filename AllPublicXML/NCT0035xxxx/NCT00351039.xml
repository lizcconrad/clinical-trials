      This is a Phase I/II trial of elderly patients (&gt; 70 years of age). Patients in this age
      group with previously un-treated Advanced Stage Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC) with Stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) and stage IV disease will be
      enrolled. Therapy consists of three drugs (Premetrexed[Alimta™], Bevacizumab and
      Erlotinib[Tarceva™]) which are given every 28 days.

      This is a Phase I/II trial of elderly patients (&gt; 70 years of age) with previously un-treated
      Advanced Stage Non-Squamous NSCLC with Stage IIIB (with malignant pleural effusion) and stage
      IV disease will be enrolled.

      Treatment Regimen:

      Premetrexed (Alimta™) 500 milligrams(mg)/Meter squared(m20 Intravenous(I.V.) Day 1 and Day
      15; Bevacizumab 10mg/Kilogram(Kg) I. V. Day 1 and Day 15; Erlotinib (Tarceva™) 150mg Per
      Orally(PO) Once Daily(QD) for 7 days starting day 2 and day 15; Repeat cycles every 28 days.

      All three drugs will be continued for two cycles after maximal response. After which patient
      will be maintained only on the Bevacizumab and Erlotinib until progression. If patient has
      stable disease after the first two cycles then patient will be given another two cycles with
      all three drugs before maintenance treatment with Bevacizumab and Erlotinib is initiated.

    <description>The primary objective was to determine the progression free survival (PFS), in newly diagnosed patients with advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) who are treated with a regimen consisting of Bevacizumab(B), pemetrexed(A), and erlotnib(T). This was a Phase I/II study. This trial was halted after the Phase I component was completed. The Phase II component was never initiated.</description>

    <description>Phase I:
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)Criteria was used for Response. Partial Response (PR) is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of Longest Dimention (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>26 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Scales we were intending to use were:
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL): Range of Scale 0 (Best) to 8 (Worst).
Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G): Range of Scores 1(Best) to 18 (Worst).
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L): Range of Scores 0 (Best) to 48 (Worst).
Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI): Range of Scores 0(Best) to 121 (Worst).
Each scale would have been evaluated independently. Since the study was not completed and closed early due to poor accrual, none of the QOL parameters were analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 and Grade 4 Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>26 Months</time_frame>
    <description>By Safety, the intent was to capture, tabulate, list all of the grade 3 and 4 adverse effects seen by this protocol. For each toxicity, we followed the Common Toxicity Criteria(NCI CTC)Version 2.0 Toxicity scale guidelines.</description>
