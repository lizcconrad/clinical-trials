  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect the opinions, understandings and personal health care experiences of
      multiracial persons of African and European ancestry. Understanding multiracial patients'
      beliefs and experiences about their race, ethnicity, ancestral origin and the genetic
      components of diseases can provide important data for developing ways to communicate how
      human genetic variation is related to self-identified race and ethnicity. The study will:

        -  Investigate multiracial individuals' beliefs about biological and genetic differences
           based on race and ethnicity;

        -  Collect stories of identity, ancestry and clinical experiences of multiracial
           individuals with one parent of African ancestry and one parent of European ancestry;

        -  Investigate multiracial patients' experiences regarding family health history and
           communication of genetic risk of disease.

      Persons 21 years of age or older in the Atlanta, Georgia, or Washington, D.C., metropolitan
      areas who are from a multiracial background and have used health care services in the last 2
      years may be eligible for this study. Participants are interviewed one-on-one for about 2
      hours to gather information about their background, family ancestry, self-identity, race and
      ethnicity, health care interactions and genetics and health. Each participant completes a
      short questionnaire before and after the interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The complex relationships between self-identified race, ethnicity, ancestral origin and the
      genetic components of diseases demands a better understanding of patients' conceptions of
      these identifiers and how they impact their health. The lived experiences of multiracial
      individuals can provide valuable perspectives on questions of race and ethnicity, the
      collection of ancestral information in assessing health history and communication of racial
      or ethnic specific disease risk. Understanding patients' beliefs and experiences will provide
      important data for developing ways to communicate how human genetic variation is related to
      self identified race and ethnicity. We aim to conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews
      with adults at least 21 years of age who identify as having a multiracial background with
      African and European ancestry. The study will include participants from the Atlanta, Georgia
      and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas. This preliminary study uses qualitative methods to
      capture the personal stories of identity, ancestry and clinical experiences from a population
      that has not been adequately researched.

        -  EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Individuals will be excluded from the study if they do not have at least one parent that
        self-identifies as Black or has African ancestry and another parent that self identifies as
        White or has European ancestry. Other exclusion criteria include: (1) under 21 years of
        age, (2) not had at least two clinical visits with a health care professional in the last
        year and (3) not more than one individual per family.
