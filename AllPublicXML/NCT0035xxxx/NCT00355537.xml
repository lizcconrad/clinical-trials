    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major cause of peripheral vascular disease(PVD) and is associated with male
      hypogonadism. Diabetes and PVD are both associated with arterial stiffness and intima -media
      thickness which are also related to severity of the clinical syndrome of PVD. Artificially
      induced hypogonadism results in increasing arterial stiffness whilst testosterone is known to
      improve risk factors for vascular disease and act as a vasodilator. The purpose of this pilot
      study is to assess the effect of testosterone treatment on PVD arterial stiffness and
      intima-media thickness in men with type 2 diabetes and hypogonadism,
