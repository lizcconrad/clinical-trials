  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Company's proprietary products are based on Orqis Medical's hypothesis, supported by
      early clinical data, that increasing and maintaining continuous blood flow in the descending
      aorta, known as continuous aortic flow augmentation or CAFA, improves hemodynamics in heart
      failure patients. The clinical impact of the hemodynamic improvement is currently being
      evaluated to determine the effects of CAFA on stopping or reversing the progression of heart
      failure through three physiological effects:

        -  VASCULAR - Reducing systemic vascular resistance

        -  RENAL - Improving renal function

        -  CARDIAC - Reducing cardiac workload

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients hospitalized due to decompensated heart failure who require IV inotropic
             and/or vasodilator and diuretic therapy

          2. Patients receiving appropriate medical therapy for heart failure, defined as ACE
             inhibitors and beta blockers (all unless not tolerated or contraindicated) and
             diuretics, for 1 month prior to study entry

          3. For at least 24 hours prior to inclusion into the study, the patient should be treated
             with a minimum dose of the following: dobutamine 2.5μg/kg/min or milrinone
             0.3μg/kg/min or dopamine 5μg/kg/min. or nesiritide 0.01μg/kg/min or nitroglycerin 0.3
             µg/kg/min or nitroprusside 0.3 µg/kg/min or a combination of any of these agents, with
             diuretic therapy. Doses of the above stated medications should be stable for 6 hours
             prior to inclusion into study. An increase in this dosage within the first 8 hours
             after enrollment is determined by the attending physician to be unlikely and the
             following definition of &quot;not responding adequately to IV inotropic and/or vasodilator
             and diuretic therapy&quot; is exhibited:

               -  PCWP is ≥ 20 mmHg at time of randomization and PCWP was ≥ 18 mmHg continuously
                  for 24 hours or PCWP ≥ 20 mmHg continuously for 12 hours prior to randomization.

               -  Cardiac Index &lt; 2.4 L/min/m2

               -  There is evidence for abnormal renal function and/or diuretic resistance defined
                  as: Serum creatinine &gt; 1.2 mg/dL or Diuretic dosage of intravenous Furosemide ≥
                  120 mg daily, or equivalent

          4. LVEF &lt; 35%

          5. Male or female 18-90 years of age
