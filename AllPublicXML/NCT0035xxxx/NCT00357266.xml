      This study will examine blood cells and other tissue samples from people with uveitis (eye
      inflammation) to try to gain a better understanding of this condition. It will look at 1) the
      differences in cells when uveitis is active and when it is under control; 2) the genes that
      control the functions of these cells during different stages of the condition; and 3) the
      proteins the cells make at these different stages.

      Patients 6 years of age or older with an eye inflammation of at least 8 weeks' duration may
      be eligible for this study. They must currently be enrolled in another NEI protocol for
      evaluation or treatment of uveitis.

      Participants will provide blood and possibly eye tissue samples as follows:

      Blood samples: Blood samples will be drawn, probably from an arm vein, during periods when
      the inflammation is bad and when it is quiet. No more than 60 mL (about 4 tablespoons) will
      be drawn at any visit, and no more than eight samples will be collected in 1 year.

      Tissue samples: For patients who require eye surgery, a sample of tissue or fluid that is
      removed as a routine part of surgery may be provided to investigators in this study for
      research purposes.

      Samples will be collected during patients' visits scheduled as part of their other protocol.
      The samples will be labeled with a special code number to preserve the patient's identity.

      Ocular inflammatory diseases, including uveitis, cause significant visual loss. Previous
      non-human investigations have identified several cell types, receptor systems and metabolic
      intermediates that have led to treatment approaches for human patients. However, information
      on the human genetic expression of these steps in defined inflammatory disease states is
      lacking. This non-intervention study proposes to obtain peripheral blood and tissue specimens
      from patients enrolled in other intramural trials for ocular inflammatory diseases and to
      apply contemporary cDNA microarray technologies for the analysis of differential gene
      expression. Test results will not be reported to participants or used for diagnostic or
      therapeutic purposes.

      The study's primary objective is to identify unique gene expression profiles as well as
      disease relevant genes for patients with ocular inflammatory disease at defined clinical
      stages using cDNA microarray analysis. This will help provide further insight to understand
      the pathological mechanisms and potential targets for treatment. Some 3,000-5,000 genes will
      be examined starting with a selected set associated with interleukin (IL) proteins and their
      receptors, and with tumor necrosis factors (TNF). Purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (or whole blood lysates using RNA isolation procedures) will be used to isolate total RNA
      from these samples. Samples will be taken during periods of active or recurring inflammatory
      disease and again during periods of quiescence after treatment. The microarray tools and
      methods for genetic analysis are now available both at NEI and the collaborating NIA
      laboratories.

      A secondary objective is to analyze the circulating protein profiles in serum or other
      available tissue or fluid specimens from patients with ocular inflammatory disease at the
      same time points as described above. These samples will be analyzed using 2-dimensional
      SDS-PAGE for profiling proteomic differences in patients at defined clinical stages. In-gel
      digestion and subsequent sequence analysis by mass spectroscopy will be performed if
      differentially expressed protein(s) of interest are to be identified. Other methods such as
      flow cytometry analysis and proliferation assays using purified PBMCs will be used to examine
      expression status of cell surface markers of interest (e.g., CD25) as well as responses to
      antigen and mitogens at the peak and trough serum concentrations of daclizumab therapy.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Participant is 6 or more years of age.

               2. Participant has a diagnosis of an ocular inflammatory disease of at least eight
                  weeks' duration prior to enrollment, requiring medical treatment to control the
                  ocular inflammation. This treatment must require using a corticosteroid (e.g.,
                  prednisone or equivalent) or an investigational treatment, or any combination of
                  two or more anti-inflammatory treatments, including for example prednisone,
                  cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil,
                  methotrexate, etc. Participants are anticipated to have, but are not restricted
                  to, the following conditions: scleritis, intermediate or posterior uveitis,
                  intermediate uveitis of the pars planitis subtype, sarcoidosis, the
                  Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, Behcet's disease, juvenile rheumatoid
                  arthritis (JRA), retinal vasculitis or sympathetic ophthalmia.

               3. Participant is currently enrolled in another NEI protocol for one of the above
                  (or related) conditions that requires periodic visits to NIH for treatment and/or
                  evaluation.

               4. Participant is able to understand and sign an informed consent (or applicable
                  assent) and if the participant is younger than the age 18 at enrollment, has a
                  parent or legal guardian who is able to understand and sign a consent form on
                  their behalf.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Participant is under the age of 6 years.

          2. Participant has inadequate vascular access to obtain a routine venous peripheral whole
             blood specimen totaling up to 50 mL at a single visit.

          3. Participants has an inadequate peripheral leukocyte count such that it would be
             unlikely to provide an adequate RNA sample. For this purpose, a total leukocyte count
             below 3 x 10(9)/L will exclude a participant at enrollment. Unless there is a
             recognized medical condition likely to reduce leukocyte counts, blood counts from a
             prior visit up to 5 weeks earlier may be used to determine eligibility for a first or
             subsequent sample collection. (A participant who initially enrolls with an adequate
             leukocyte count may remain enrolled if counts subsequently fall below the limit, but
             will not have blood samples drawn for this protocol until the leukocyte count recovers
             above the limit).
