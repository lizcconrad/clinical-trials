      In a previous study azithromycin proved as efficacious as levofloxacin in the treatment of
      travelers' diarrhea in Mexico. Because the addition of loperamide to some antibiotics (e.g.,
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin) has proven more efficacious than antibiotic
      alone in the treatment of travelers' diarrhea, we decided to study the addition of loperamide
      to azithromycin.

      US adults with acute diarrhea in Guadalajara Mexico were randomized to receive azithromycin
      in two different doses or loperamide plus azithromycin.

      The duration of diarrhea was shorter (11 hours) in the combination-treated group compared to
      the antibiotic-treated groups (34 hours). The percentage of subjects continuing to pass 6 or
      more unformed stools in the first 24 hours was less (1.7%) in the combination-treated group
      than in the antibiotic-treated groups (20%).

      We feel loperamide should routinely be added to an antibiotic to optimize treatment of
      travelers' diarrhea.

      Background. The combination of loperamide and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a
      fluoroquinolone has proven to be more efficacious than the antimicrobial agent alone in the
      treatment of travelers' diarrhea. We set out to prove loperamide plus azithromycin was more
      efficacious that azithromycin alone.

      Methods. During the summers of 2002-3, 176 US adults recently arrived in Guadalajara, Mexico
      were enrolled in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial of the treatment of acute
      diarrhea. Subjects received single doses (1000 mg or 500 mg) of azithromycin or a single 500
      mg dose of azithromycin plus loperamide. Subjects gave a pre and post treatment stool sample
      for analysis and maintained daily diaries of symptoms and passage of stools.

      Results. The MIC90 of azithromycin for all E. coli and Shigella was 0.03 and 4 Âµg/ml with
      eradication rates in day 5 stools of 88% and 100%, respectively. The duration of diarrhea was
      significantly (p=0.0002) shorter following treatment with azithromycin plus loperamide (11 h)
      than with either dose of azithromycin alone (34 h). In the first 24 h the average number of
      unformed stools passed was 3.4 (azithromycin-alone) and 1.2 (combination) for a significant
      (p&lt;0.0001) difference of 2.2 unformed stools. This difference equated with 20% of
      azithromycin-treated subjects continuing to pass 6 or more unformed stools in the first 24 h
      post treatment compared with only 1.7% of combination-treated subjects.

      Conclusions. For the treatment of travelers' diarrhea in an E. coli predominant region of the
      world a single 500 mg dose of azithromycin appeared as effective as a 1000 mg dose.
      Loperamide plus 500 mg azithromycin was safe and more effective than either dose of
      azithromycin. To realize the substantial clinical benefit that accrues to a subset of
      subjects, we feel loperamide should routinely be used in combination with an antimicrobial
      agent to treat travelers' diarrhea.
