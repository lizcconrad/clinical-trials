      The purpose of this study is to check the usability of Virtual Reality (VR) Video Capture
      Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI)and comparing their performance
      to the performance of normally developing children. The trial shall include 15 subjects in
      each group, aged 6-12 years old. ABI subjects are hospitalized at the hospital's Pediatric
      Rehabilitation Department Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The
      subjects in the trial group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during
      a period of a week to 10 days, to check the practice effect.In addition, all subjects will be
      tested in three tests: &quot;PEDI&quot; - to evaluate the functional abilities of daily living
      (dressing, eating...),The &quot;Melbourne Assessment&quot; - to evaluate functional movements of upper
      extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate different attention abilities. Performance
      correlations will be tested between these tests and the performance in the VR first
      experience.

      The purpose of this study is to check the usability of Virtual Reality (VR) Video Capture
      Projected System in children with acquired brain injury(ABI) comparing their performance with
      the performance of normally developing children, matched by age, gender,sector and parents'
      education. subjects' age: 6 - 12 years old. The trial shall include 15 subjects in each
      group. ABI subjects are hospitalized at Sheba Hospital's Pediatric Rehabilitation Department.

      Each subject will experience 3 different virtual environments. The subjects in the trial
      group will practice 3 experiences (3 times in 3 different days) during a period of a week to
      10 days, to check the practice effect. In addition, all subjects will be tested in three
      tests: &quot;PEDI&quot; - to evaluate the functional abilities of daily living (dressing,
      eating...),The &quot;Melbourne Assessment&quot; - to evaluate functional movements of upper
      extremities, and the TEA-ch - to evaluate difference attention abilities.

      Correlations between those tests to the performance in the VR experiences will be checked
      with Pearson's statistical correlation tests. The differences between the trial group (ABI
      children) and the control group will be checked with Independent t-tests.

        The study sample consisted of 33 children, and was divided into study and control groups:
        16 children with ABI from the Pediatric Rehabilitation department at the Sheba Medical
        Center, Tel Hashomer in the study group (mean age = 7.91, S.D. = 1.43, range from 6 to 11.4
        years old), and 17 healthy participants in the control group (mean age = 7.94, S.D. = 1.57,
        range from 6 - 11.33 years).
