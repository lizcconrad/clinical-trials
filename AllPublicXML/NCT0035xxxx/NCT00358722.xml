    <textblock>
      Fermagate is a phosphate binder that absorbs phosphate from food, reducing the amount that
      the body can absorb.

      The purpose of this study it to look at the safety of fermagate over longer periods of time.

    <textblock>
      High levels of phosphate in the blood are linked with serious effects, due to calcium
      imbalances (high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone disease, formation of calcium
      deposits in the body, and blood-vessel disease).

      This study is an open-label, multi-centre, single-group, 24-week study of fermagatebonate.
      Subjects participating in this study are those who took at least one dose of double-blind
      study medication in the IH 001 study and either completed study IH 001 or were withdrawn due
      to reasons other than an adverse event (AE) considered related to study treatment.

          2. Male or female subjects on active haemodialysis, aged 18 years or over

          3. Willing to abstain from taking any phosphate binder or oral magnesium-, aluminium-, or
             iron-containing products and preparations, other than the study medication;
