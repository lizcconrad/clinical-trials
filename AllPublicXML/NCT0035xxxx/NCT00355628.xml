      This study is a Phase II open-label study to investigate, using the continual reassessment
      method procedure by pain intensity and safety as indicators, the recommended conversion ratio
      (oral morphine dose to KW-2246) when switching oral morphine or oxycodone to KW-2246 in
      cancer patients who have been maintained on oral morphine or oral oxycodone for pain and to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of KW-2246.
