    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (tenofovir DF; TDF) plus a genotype-guided optimized background regimen (OBR)
      compared to placebo plus OBR in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
      infected antiretroviral treatment-experienced adolescents with plasma HIV-1 ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) levels greater than or equal to 1000 copies/mL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of the
      safety and efficacy of tenofovir DF as part of an optimized antiretroviral regimen in HIV-1
      infected adolescents (12 years to &lt; 18 years of age) who are failing their current
      antiretroviral regimen and have HIV-1 RNA levels ≥ 1000 copies/mL at screening. Data from
      three consecutive 96-week study extensions have been used to evaluate the long-term efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of open-label tenofovir DF as part of an antiviral regimen,
      providing data for up to 336 weeks of total drug exposure.

      Pretreatment:

      HIV-1 genotyping will be performed as part of the screening assessments to assist in the
      construction of an OBR, defined as at least 3, but no more than 5 antiretroviral agents, not
      including tenofovir DF or placebo.

      Randomized Phase:

      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either tenofovir DF + OBR, or
      placebo + OBR. The majority of efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at each
      clinic visit (Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48). At Week 24, participants who are adherent
      to study drug (in the opinion of the investigator), but do not demonstrate a ≥ 0.5 log10
      copies/mL decrease from baseline in HIV-1 RNA, will be considered to be nonresponders and
      will be unblinded. Nonresponders randomized to the placebo group will be given the option to
      continue on study and receive open-label tenofovir DF with an appropriate background regimen
      determined by the investigator. Nonresponders randomized to the tenofovir DF treatment group
      will be discontinued from the study.

      Extension Phases:

      After completing 48 weeks of double-blind treatment with tenofovir DF or placebo,
      participants who have not reached 18 years of age, and who, in the opinion of the
      investigator, would derive clinical benefit from the use of open-label tenofovir DF, will be
      given the option to continue (or initiate) treatment with open-label tenofovir DF in the
      first of three 96 week study extension periods. Nonresponders who receive open-label
      tenofovir DF after Week 24 will also be considered eligible for the first study extension if
      they met the above criteria at Week 48.

      After completing the first 96 week study extension, participants who have not reached 18
      years of age, and who have shown ongoing clinical benefit from tenofovir DF, will be given
      the option to continue receiving open-label tenofovir DF for an additional 96 weeks or until
      tenofovir DF became commercially available in the country where the participants are
      enrolled, whichever occurs first.

      After completing the second 96 week study extension, participants who have not reached 18
      years of age, and who have shown ongoing clinical benefit from tenofovir DF, will be given
      the option to continue receiving open-label tenofovir DF for an additional 96 weeks or until
      tenofovir DF became commercially available in the country where the participants are
      enrolled, whichever occurs first.

      Presentation of data:

      After the randomized phase of the study, participants randomized to placebo during the
      randomized phase of the study and then switch to open-label tenofovir DF will have their
      baseline reset (defined as open-label baseline), and only outcome data collected after
      (on/after for adverse events (AEs)/concomitant medications) participants receive their first
      dose of open-label tenofovir DF will be included.

    <description>Virologic failure was defined as either nonresponse or viral rebound.
Nonresponse (failure to achieve response). Response was defined as either
A ≥ 0.5 log10 copies/mL decrease in HIV-1 RNA from baseline at 2 consecutive visits, or
HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at 2 consecutive visits.
Viral rebound was defined as either
Participants who achieved a ≥ 0.5 log10 copies/mL decrease from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA at 2 consecutive visits, who then subsequently achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA values ≥ 1.0 log10 copies/mL above their on-study nadir (lowest value) and/or plasma HIV-1 RNA values ≥ the baseline value at 2 consecutive visits, or
Participants who achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt; 400 copies/mL at 2 consecutive visits, and then subsequently had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 1000 copies/mL at 2 consecutive visits.
The virologic failure rate was estimated from Kaplan-Meier product limit method by including all HIV-1 RNA data collected during the double-blind phase.</description>

        <title>Time-weighted Average Change From Baseline Through Week 24 (DAVG24) in Plasma HIV-1 RNA</title>
        <description>DAVG24 was defined as the time-weighted average between the first postbaseline value through the last value up to Week 24 minus the baseline value. DAVG24 was calculated using the trapezoidal rule with all available postbaseline data minus the baseline value.
Data for participants who discontinued the randomized (double-blind) phase of the study early were included up until the point of study discontinuation (missing data not imputed).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Virologic Failure Through Week 48</title>
        <description>Virologic failure was defined as either nonresponse or viral rebound.
Nonresponse (failure to achieve response). Response was defined as either
A ≥ 0.5 log10 copies/mL decrease in HIV-1 RNA from baseline at 2 consecutive visits, or
HIV-1 RNA &lt; 400 copies/mL at 2 consecutive visits.
Viral rebound was defined as either
Participants who achieved a ≥ 0.5 log10 copies/mL decrease from baseline in plasma HIV-1 RNA at 2 consecutive visits, who then subsequently achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA values ≥ 1.0 log10 copies/mL above their on-study nadir (lowest value) and/or plasma HIV-1 RNA values ≥ the baseline value at 2 consecutive visits, or
Participants who achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA levels of &lt; 400 copies/mL at 2 consecutive visits, and then subsequently had plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt; 1000 copies/mL at 2 consecutive visits.
The virologic failure rate was estimated from Kaplan-Meier product limit method by including all HIV-1 RNA data collected during the double-blind phase.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 48 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>ITT Analysis Set. 1 participant without time to respond [6 days of treatment]) was excluded. Nonresponders were counted as failures at time 0. Rebounders were counted as failures on study day of the first of 2 assessments meeting criteria. Otherwise, they were censored at last double-blind HIV measurement.</population>
