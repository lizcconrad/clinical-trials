  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test dihydrotetrabenazine, or 11C-DTBZ, a radioactive tracer, as an imaging
      agent in positron emission tomography (PET). That tracer may have the ability to
      noninvasively measure beta cell, that is, -cell mass (BCM) in humans. For researchers hoping
      to develop new treatments for diabetes mellitus, a method of measuring BCM is very important.
      In this study, researchers will determine if patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus, who have
      almost no BCM, have much less pancreatic uptake of the tracer than do patients without
      diabetes. Patients ages 18 and older may be eligible for this study. Three groups will be
      studied: Participants who have Type 1 diabetes, those without diabetes, and those who have
      been successfully treated with a transplant of the pancreas or pancreas and kidney

      The study involves three sets of tests that can be done as an outpatient or after being
      admitted to the hospital. Patients will undergo a medical history and procedures including
      collection of blood (about 4 teaspoons), pregnancy test for women of childbearing age,
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, PET scan, and tests involving arginine and glucose.
      Arginine is a substance that stimulates insulin release from the -cells. During the
      procedure, two intravenous (IV) lines are placed into the arms, one to administer arginine
      and the other to draw blood (about eight samples during 10 minutes). For the glucose test,
      patients will drink a solution of dextrose, a sugar, and blood samples will be taken over 2
      hours from the IV lines. Some patients experience nausea after drinking the solution. Within
      48 hours of either test or both, patients will be placed in the PET scan machine and given an
      injection of the radioactive material through an IV line. Blood samples of about one-half
      teaspoon will be drawn before the procedure starts and again every 10 seconds for the first 2
      minutes and at several intervals, up to 60 minutes. Finally, patients will also an MRI scan,
      30 to 60 minutes long, of the abdomen. This test will be down within two weeks of the PET
      scan. MRI uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body organs and
      tissues. During the scan, patients will be asked to lie still on a table that slides into the
      tunnel of the scanner. They will be given earplugs, for the machine can be noisy. Patients
      who have metal within their body that is not compatible with the MRI machine will be
      withdrawn from the study.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which pancreatic insulin producing B-cells (located in
      cell clusters called the islets of Langerhans) no longer produce sufficient insulin to
      maintain an individual's blood sugar concentration within the normal range. Insufficient
      B-cell function can be caused by an autoimmune killing of the B-cells in type 1 diabetes
      mellitus (T1DM), or by poorly understood mechanisms in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
      Regardless of the underlying cause, the development of new diabetes treatments is limited by
      our current inability to objectively measure B-cell mass.

      We propose testing a previously used clinical radioligand, dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), as a
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent for its ability to non-invasively measure
      B-cell mass in humans. We will study 30 patients, 10 with T1DM, 10 with normal glucose
      homeostasis, and 5 with a history of T1DM, but successfully restored glucose homeostasis
      following whole pancreas transplantation. Prior to the PET scans, each patient will undergo
      metabolic testing to characterize their glucose homeostasis and insulin producing capacity.
      The pancreas will be initially identified in each patient with high-resolution magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). Then, using anatomical landmarks identified by the MRI, the subject
      will undergo DTBZ-PET imaging. We predict that the radioactivity signal in the pancreas from
      the DTBZ-PET images will be significantly different between control subjects and T1DM
      subjects. Further, we predict that the DTBZ-PET images obtained in individuals with
      functioning pancreas allografts (and such patients have two pancreases- their native pancreas
      and their pancreas allografts) will reveal signal intensities from the two glands that
      correlates closely with each gland's insulin producing capacity. Should these studies suggest
      DTBZ has merit as a beta cell imaging agent, we will expand the study to include patients
      with T2DM.
