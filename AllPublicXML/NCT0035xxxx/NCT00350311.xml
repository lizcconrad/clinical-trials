  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a feasibility study of a multi-component intervention to enhance healthy living
      among young people (18 to 40 years) with psychotic disorders, specifically targeting smoking
      and weight. Smoking is very common amongst people with psychotic disorders (around 70% of
      males, and over 50% of females) and this adds to the overall cardiovascular risk for this
      group. Obesity is also a common problem for people with psychosis, with an estimated 40-60%
      being obese or overweight. Obesity in this population may contribute to adverse medical and
      psychological consequences. For many obese people, targeted pharmacotherapy in addition to
      diet and increased physical activity can assist in both weight reduction and the maintenance
      of gains. Similarly, smoking cessation is enhanced by use of adjunctive medications such as
      nicotine replacement; such strategies continue to produce abstinence rates for up to 10
      years.

      The proposed study will assess the feasibility of a multi-component behavioural intervention
      focussing on smoking cessation/diet/physical activity.

      The primary outcome measures from the feasibility study are smoking cessation and reduction
      in body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes will include tolerability and safety, as well as
      the impact the package has on other cardiovascular risk factors including serum lipids, blood
      sugar levels and depression in young people with psychosis. We will also establish whether
      smoking cessation and reduction in obesity is correlated with gains in terms of body image,
      quality and enjoyment of life and reduction in depression. Based on published data,
      behavioural interventions for smoking cessation and diet and physical activity lead smoking
      cessation in 20% of people at 12 months and to modest weight loss (around 5%).
