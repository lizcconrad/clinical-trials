      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also block blood
      flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving bevacizumab together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells. Diagnostic
      procedures, such as MRI, may help doctors predict a patient's response to treatment and help
      plan the best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with irinotecan
      works in treating patients with recurrent malignant glioma and how well MRI predicts response
      to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Examine the effect of bevacizumab and irinotecan on vascular permeability and blood flow
           in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the reproducibility of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-MRI) in malignant
           gliomas.

        -  Determine the predictive value of DCE-MRI in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas
           treated with bevacizumab and irinotecan.

        -  Describe the activity of the combination of bevacizumab with irinotecan as measured by
           response rate and progression-free survival.

        -  Describe the toxicity associated with the administration of bevacizumab with irinotecan.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV on days 1, 15, and 29 and irinotecan IV on days 2,
      15, and 29 during the first 6-week cycle. After the first cycle, the irinotecan and
      bevacizumab will be given on days 1, 15 and 29. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI 4 times.

    <description>The bevacizumab will be dosed at 10 mg/kg every 14 days (days 1, 15 and 29) and the irinotecan on days 2, 15, and 29 of the first six week schedule. The irinotecan dose will depend on whether the patient is on an enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug (EIAED). If the patient is on an EIAED, the patient will receive 340 mg/m2 on days 2, 15, and 29 of the first six week schedule. If the patient is not on an EIAED, the dose of irinotecan will be 125 mg/m2 on days 2, 15, and 29 of the first six week schedule. After the first cycle, the irinotecan and bevacizumab will be given on days 1, 15 and 29.</description>
