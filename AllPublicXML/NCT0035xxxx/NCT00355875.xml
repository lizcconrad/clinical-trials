  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: In this feasibility study, hyperoxemia, as approximated by transcutaneous
      hemoglobin saturation with oxygen (Sp02), at the time of birth will cause sustained pulmonary
      oxidative stress as demonstrated by elevation of pulmonary protein carbonyl. Furthermore,
      this oxidative stress will be directly proportional to the imposed oxygen-burden during
      resuscitation at the time of birth.

      This study will give us information regarding the magnitude of protein carbonyl elevation in
      the preterm infant. With these results we will be able to 1. establish the technique for the
      running or protein carbonyl assays and 2. calculate an appropriate sample size for a future
      randomized control trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immediately prior to birth, preterm infants (&lt;= 32 weeks gestation) will be randomized to one
      of three groups: 1. Low Oxygen Burden (LOB) - initiation of resuscitation with 21% 02, II.
      Moderate Oxygen Burden (MOB) - initiation of resuscitation with 100% 02 and III. High Oxygen
      Burden (HOB) - 100% 02 used for the entire resuscitation. A pulse oximetry monitor will be
      connected to a probe on the infant's hand to measure the transcutaneous hemoglobin saturation
      with oxygen (Sp02). Adjustments to the inspired oxygen concentration will be made every 15
      seconds for infants in the LOB and MOB groups to achieve a target Sp02 range of 85-92%.
      Resuscitation will otherwise proceed as per standard of care. The intervention will end upon
      arrival in the neonatal intensive care unit.
