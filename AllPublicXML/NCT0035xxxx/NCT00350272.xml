  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elvucitabine is a novel nucleoside analog that is being studied as a treatment for patients
      infected with HIV-1. This Phase II study will enroll 60 HIV-1 naive subjects to assess the
      efficacy and safety of elvucitabine compared to lamivudine in combination with tenofovir and
      efavirenz measured by changes in the patient's HIV-RNA level and CD4 cell count. The study
      treatment will be 12 weeks of blinded study medication followed by an additional 84 weeks of
      open label treatment if the patient's response to treatment meets certain endpoints. Also
      there will be assessment of the pharmacokinetics of elvucitabine during the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty HIV-1-infected, clinically stable, treatment-naïve adults with no acquired
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining events during the 3 months prior to screening will
      be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Subject plasma HIV-1 RNA levels must be
      greater than or equal to 5000 copies/mL and CD4 cell counts must be greater than 200 cells/mL
      and less than 500 cells/mL at Screening. Subjects must be sensitive to elvucitabine,
      lamivudine, and emtricitabine as demonstrated by the absence of the M184V, M184I, and D237E
      mutations by TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit. Subjects must be genotypically sensitive to
      efavirenz (negative for K103 or Y188L mutations) and tenofovir (negative for K65R mutation)
      as demonstrated by TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit. They must have acceptable hematologic and
      chemistry parameters.

      Subjects whose HIV-1 RNA levels have decreased at least 2 logs or to below 400 copies/mL by
      Week 10 may be considered eligible to enter the extension phase of up to 36 weeks of
      additional treatment. Subjects in the extension phase will be evaluated at Weeks 14, 16, and
      every 4 weeks until week 96.

      Once all subjects have completed 12 weeks of treatment, and the data are available for all
      visits through Week 12, the database will be locked and the treatment assignments will be
      unblinded. Any subject who has had less than 48 weeks of treatment will be allowed to
      continue on the same treatment as initially assigned on an open-label basis through 48 weeks.
      All subjects will have 2 post treatment follow-up visits, at 1 and 4 weeks after the end of
      treatment. Concentrations of elvucitabine in plasma will be measured on Day 1, at Weeks 4, 6,
      8, 12, 16, 24, 48, 72, 96, and at Follow-up

      Efficacy will be assessed by measuring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 counts at each study
      visit.

      Safety evaluation will include vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms,
      assessments of adverse events (AEs), measurement of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 counts,
      determination of HIV-1 genotype at Screening, and at Weeks 12, 24, 48 and 96 determination of
      HIV-1 phenotype at Visit 1 and at Weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96 urine and serum pregnancy tests,
      as well as laboratory analyses that include hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis.

      <recruitment_details>HIV-1–infected, treatment-naïve adults with no AIDS-defining events in the 3 months prior to Screening and with plasma HIV-1 RNA levels greater than or equal to 5000 copies/mL and CD4 counts greater than or equal to 200 cells/μL and less than 500 cells/μL and HIV-1 strains absent the M184V, M184I, D237E, K103, Y188L, and K65R mutations at Screen.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 78 were given a treatment assignment. One subject assigned to treatment was ineligible for randomization and did not receive any study drug. An additional subject did not take any of the dispensed study drug. Therefore 76 subjects were treated.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Proportion of subjects having achieved a virologic response for elvucitabine 10 mg/day in combination with efavirenz and tenofovir in HIV-1-infected subjects over 12 weeks compared with the proportion of subjects having achieved a virologic response for lamivudine 300 mg/day in combination with efavirenz and tenofovir.

For this analysis, all subjects who discontinued from the study before Week 12 were considered as NC=F.</population>
