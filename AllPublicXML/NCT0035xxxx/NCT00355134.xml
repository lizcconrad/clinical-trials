    <textblock>
      This study assessed the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two doses of oral fingolimod
      compared to placebo on efficacy parameters in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple
      sclerosis (RRMS).

    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, parallel-group study consisted of 2 phases: a 24-month
      double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study and an
      Extension phase which consisted of a dose-blinded period and an open-label period.

      In the Core phase, patients were randomized to receive a fixed dose of fingolimod (0.5
      mg/day), fingolimod (1.25 mg/day) or placebo for up to 24 months.

      For the Extension phase, patients who were treated with fingolimod during the Core phase
      continued treatment at the assigned dose level, while those previously treated with placebo
      during the Core phase were re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the two doses of
      fingolimod (1.25 mg or 0.5 mg). All patients in the extension received blinded
      investigational drug: fingolimod 1.25 mg and 0.5 mg in capsules for oral administration once
      daily until the decision to discontinue the fingolimod 1.25 mg dose became effective and
      subsequently all patients were switched to open-label fingolimod 0.5 mg.

      With the implementation of Amendment 11, the 1.25 mg dose was discontinued and all patients
      were switched to fingolimod 0.5 mg dose. With the implementation of Amendment 12, all
      patients treated with Placebo in the fingolimod Core phase were switched to treatment with
      0.5 mg fingolimod per day. The Extension phase continued until all patients either
      discontinued or transferred to Study CFTY720D2399 (NCT01201356; initiated in September 2010).

    <measure>Aggregate Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) Estimate up to Month 24</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>ARR is the average number of relapses in a year calculated by negative binomial regression as the sum of confirmed relapses of all patients in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all patients in the group and multiplied by 365.25.
A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5C) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by the Independent Evaluating Physician (examining neurologist).
ARR estimates were calculated from a negative binomial regression model adjusted for treatment, pooled center, number of relapses in the previous 2 years prior to enrollment, and Baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS).</description>

    <time_frame>24 months and end of study (up to approximately 54 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Disability progression was defined using the following criteria: One point increase from baseline in patients with Baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase from Baseline in patients with Baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. A 3-month confirmed disability progression was defined as a 3-month sustained increase from Baseline in EDSS score. The EDSS quantifies disability in multiple sclerosis in 8 functional systems; the score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Progression curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 24 and end of study (up to approximately 54 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure that includes quantitative tests of leg function/ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk), arm function (9-Hole Peg Test), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). The overall MSFC z-score as an average of the three standardized scores derived using baseline data pooled over each treatment arm as reference population. Higher scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Upon entry into the Extension phase, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg or 1.25 mg during the Core phase continued treatment at the same dose, those previously treated with placebo were re-randomized in to receive one of the two doses of fingolimod.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Aggregate Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) Estimate up to Month 24</title>
        <description>ARR is the average number of relapses in a year calculated by negative binomial regression as the sum of confirmed relapses of all patients in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all patients in the group and multiplied by 365.25.
A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5C) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by the Independent Evaluating Physician (examining neurologist).
ARR estimates were calculated from a negative binomial regression model adjusted for treatment, pooled center, number of relapses in the previous 2 years prior to enrollment, and Baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS).</description>

          <title>Aggregate Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) Estimate up to Month 24</title>
          <description>ARR is the average number of relapses in a year calculated by negative binomial regression as the sum of confirmed relapses of all patients in the group divided by the sum of the number of days on study of all patients in the group and multiplied by 365.25.
A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5C) or known infection. A relapse must be confirmed by the Independent Evaluating Physician (examining neurologist).
ARR estimates were calculated from a negative binomial regression model adjusted for treatment, pooled center, number of relapses in the previous 2 years prior to enrollment, and Baseline expanded disability status scale (EDSS).</description>

        <description>Disability progression was defined using the following criteria: One point increase from baseline in patients with Baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase from Baseline in patients with Baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. A 3-month confirmed disability progression was defined as a 3-month sustained increase from Baseline in EDSS score. The EDSS quantifies disability in multiple sclerosis in 8 functional systems; the score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS).

        <title>Percentage of Participants Relapse-free up to End of Study</title>
        <description>Estimates of the percentage of participants relapse-free at end of study were generated from Kaplan-Meier curves of the time to first relapse. A relapse was defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (&lt;37.5C) or infection. A relapse was confirmed by an Independent Evaluating Physician.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Z-score</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a multidimensional clinical outcome measure that includes quantitative tests of leg function/ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk), arm function (9-Hole Peg Test), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). The overall MSFC z-score as an average of the three standardized scores derived using baseline data pooled over each treatment arm as reference population. Higher scores reflect better neurological function and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
