      Objectives.

      To study the feasibility of an expertise-based randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the
      role of traditional surgery (OPEN) versus endovascular repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic
      aneurysms (AAA).

      Study design.

      We will conduct an expertise-based RCT comparing OPEN to EVAR of non-urgent abdominal aortic
      aneurysms in patients referred to vascular surgeons practicing at Hamilton Health Sciences,
      to determine the rate of death and other complications. Quality of life and status at 6
      months will also be recorded. The ultimate goal is to determine the feasibility of conducting
      a pragmatic expertise-based RCT and to inform a future larger study at a national level.

      Background. The prevalence in individuals over 65 years of age is 6% (95% Confidence Interval
      [CI] 5 - 6)(1-4)in men and 1% (95% CI 1 – 2) in women.(5) AAA confers a risk of spontaneous
      rupture and death: the in-hospital mortality rate of ruptured aneurysms in Ontario was
      estimated at 40.8%.(6) Prevention of spontaneous rupture is the rationale for surgical
      intervention. Evidence has established that elective open surgery for AAAs &gt; 5.5cm increases
      survival(7), but the 30-day perioperative mortality for elective open repair of AAA can be as
      high as 8%.(8-17) Phase I and II trials have found that endovascular repair is a ‘viable and
      effective treatment’ for AAA disease (18;19); the theoretical benefits include avoidance of
      laparotomy and no aortic clamping.

      The results of RCTs (DREAM and EVAR-1)(20;21) have left unanswered the indications for
      endovascular repair compared with open surgery because of problems with definition of
      outcomes, lack of statistical power, and surgical expertise (surgeons needed to have done at
      least 20 surgeries with or without supervision). The only studies addressing the issue of
      expertise in this field suggests that 60 EVAR need to be done to achieve less than 10%
      complications (22), and a time interval of less than 10 days between procedures is important
      to maintain competence and reduce complications.(23) In addition the two RCTs used a
      conventional design and we have reported that this has intrinsic pitfalls. We argued that in
      surgery, particularly when a new technique is studied, another approach should be used: the
      expertise based RCT.(24) Conventional RCTs typically randomize participants to one of two
      interventions (A or B) and the same clinician give intervention A to some participants and B
      to others. The expertise based randomized controlled trial, randomizes participants to
      clinicians with expertise in intervention A or clinicians with expertise in intervention B,
      and the clinicians perform only the procedure for which they have expertise.

      Study Design/Participants

      We will conduct an expertise based RCT comparing open repair with EVAR repair of elective
      infrarenal AAAs. This is a pilot to determine the feasibility of a large pragmatic expertise
      based RCT of open versus EVAR repair.

      We will consider all patients with an AAA determined to require non-urgent repair after
      assessment by one of the participating surgeons. The second inclusion criterion is that the
      blinded measurement team must deem a patient to fulfill the anatomic eligibility criteria.

      Location of Investigation

      This pilot study will be conducted at a single institution: Hamilton Health Sciences,
      Hamilton General Hospital. This centre will serve as the coordinating site for the future
      multicentre randomized controlled trial, and based on the high volume practices of the
      surgeons at the Hamilton General Hospital, will likely provide the largest pool of eligible
      patients. Protocols and standard operating procedures for a single site will be developed for
      this pilot, which will become standards for the larger trial. The decision to use a single
      centre for this pilot study is based in the high expected surgical volume that makes our
      recruitment rate realistic, in addition to the cost savings of conducting a trial close to
      investigators and surrounded by known infrastructure.

      Patient Recruitment

      Once a patient is deemed eligible, the study nurse will provide the patient with details of
      the study protocol and explanation of goals of the investigation, and obtain informed
      consent.

      Randomization and Allocation

      The study nurse will be contacted by the surgeons’ offices to screen all patients referred to
      participating vascular surgeons on the first visit to the office and submit a standardized
      electronic form accessible on a secure, encrypted website. This will document baseline
      demographics for referred patients including key eligibility criteria. If these are met, the
      study nurse will contact the patient, explain the study, determine the remaining eligibility
      criteria and obtain consent. The nurse will use the electronic database to randomly allocate
      the patient to open or endovascular repair. We will ensure concealment of allocation through
      the use of a randomization and allocation process housed on an encrypted website monitored by
      a data coordinator external to the study protocol. This process has been successfully
      developed within the St Joseph's Nephrology, Thromboembolism and Vascular research group.
      Randomization using random-sized permuted block technique will ensure balanced distribution
      of patients and concealment of allocation. Once allocation has occurred, the study nurse will
      coordinate patient appointments to the appropriate surgeon. Patients who do not meet
      eligibility requirements will return to their original surgeon for disclosure of results and
      treatment.

      Patient Follow-up

      The study nurse will meet the patient, document baseline characteristics and perform blood
      work at the preoperative clinic visit. The study nurse will see patients daily after surgery,
      arrange daily blood work and document all outcome events using standardized case report forms
      until discharged from hospital. An outcome assessor committee independent of the study and
      blinded to treatment allocation will adjudicate all outcome events. The study nurse will see
      all patients at 3-month intervals for 6 months. The use of a 6-month outcome threshold is for
      purposes of assessing feasibility in this pilot study only. The larger multicentre trial will
      plan to evaluate outcomes up to five years, addressing the long term concerns that have been
      raised in RCTs.

      Evaluation of Pilot Objectives

      We will consider the pilot study a success if we can:

        1. Recruit 30 patients in 40 weeks

        2. Obtain a complete follow-up on 95% of the trial patients

        3. Demonstrate the feasibility of using a web-based system to randomize and follow patients
           in this trial, and for outcome adjudication, and

        4. Document the resources (e.g., personnel time) required to conduct this trial.

      Ethical Considerations

      All patients in this study will provide informed consent prior to participation, and the
      protocol will be reviewed by the Ethics Review Board of Hamilton Health Sciences.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients with an AAA determined to require non-urgent repair after assessment by one of
        the participating surgeons will be considered. Patients must meet two eligibility criteria:
        Medical and Anatomic.

        Medical Fitness for surgery will mean that the patient is a candidate for elective open
        repair, and has none of the exclusion criteria listed below.

        Anatomic Eligibility will be judged by the endovascular measurement team, and will be based
        on a score of &lt; 3 on the following scale. (This scale was developed at our centre and is
        currently being validated.)

          1. Neck Length (20 - 15 mm = 1; 14 – 10 mm = 2)

          2. Quality of Neck (Thrombus 90 -180 º = 1, 181-270 º = 2; calcification 90 -180 º = 1;
             181-270 º = 2)

          3. Presence/absence side branches (IMA or lumbar vessels = 1; IMA and lumbar vessels or
             other = 2)

          4. Landing zone (aneurysmal or occlusive disease = 1; aneurysmal and occlusive disease =
             2;

          5. Degree of calcification of aorta (25 – 50% calcification = 1; &gt; 50% = 2)

          6. Access (stenosis = 1; stenosis and tortuosity =2)

          7. Stenting of accessory renal arteries necessary

          8. Embolization of internal iliac artery necessary

        Definition of Surgical Experts

        Expertise in endovascular surgery will be determined by completion of a vascular residency
        at a credentialed academic centre, a period of study in a formal training programme
        dedicated to acquiring endovascular expertise, and experience with at least 60 previous
        EVAR procedures.30

        Expertise in open aortic repair will require completion of an accredited vascular surgery
        residency programme and demonstration of expertise by having completed at least 100
        consecutive elective AAA repairs in their career.32

        Endovascular Measurement Team The Endovascular Measurement team consists of at least one
        vascular surgeon with expertise in endovascular surgery, at least one vascular fellow in
        his/her first or second year of training and a representative from an endovascular graft
        specialist who is familiar with graft measurement and deployment. This team, blinded to
        patient demographics and surgical fitness, will judge anatomic eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Exclusion due to Medical Risk: Patients with severe cardiac or respiratory disease
             that limits their activities of daily living and would make them ineligible for open
             repair. BMI greater than 45. Any known diagnosis or condition that renders a lift span
             of less than 2 years based on available and tolerable treatments.

          2. Exclusion due to Aneurysm Factors: Patients with ruptured or symptomatic aneurysms
             requiring urgent surgery. Any aneurysm that extends proximal to the renal arteries
             (suprarenal), involves the renal arteries or is less than 15mm distal to the level of
             the lowest renal artery.

          3. Exclusion due to Operative Factors: Patients with multiple previous laparotomies
             making open repair contraindicated due to adhesions (a ‘hostile abdomen’). Any
             patients with stomas or exteriorized bowel. Patients with previous abdominal
             radiation, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis, or history of other conditions that would render open
             operative intervention contraindicated.
