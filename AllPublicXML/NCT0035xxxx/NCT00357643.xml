  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of supplementation with both
      calcium and vitamin D on changes in bone density of the hip in men and women age 65 and
      older.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study 445 men and women age 65 and older were enrolled for three years each. Subjects
      were randomized to treatment with 500 mg of calcium s calcium citrate malate plus 700 IU of
      vitamin D daily or placebo. Subjects came to the research center every six months for
      biochemical and bone mineral density measurements. Changes in these measures over the three
      years were determined in each group and compared.
