  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed is to examine the idea that GW679769 has an effect on three of the
      pathophysiological disturbances reported in patients with Functional Dyspepsia (FD): impaired
      stomach accommodation to a meal, delayed stomach emptying, and visceral hypersensitivity to
      distension.

      An exploratory study to investigate the effects of the NK1 antagonist GW679769, 120 mg once
      daily for 4 days, on gastric accommodation, gastric emptying and gastric distension-induced
      perception and discomfort in adult male and female patients with functional dyspepsia, in a
      single-centre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, two-period crossover study

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Functional dyspepsia as diagnosed according to the Rome II criteria

          -  Must had a one month trial (full dose) of proton pump inhibitor treatment within the
             last 6 months, during a symptomatic period, that produced no lasting response,
             although this may not be required for those patients who have no symptoms of heartburn
             and do not present pain-predominant dyspepsia symptoms. Such decision will be left to
             the Principal Investigator's discretion.

          -  Patients who are non-smokers or smokers who smoke up to 20 cigarettes per day

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Active or history of peptic ulcer disorder

          -  History of major abdominal surgery

          -  History of underlying psychiatric illness, or current active psychiatric morbidity

          -  Pregnant or nursing women
