      assessed in patients with diabetes mellitus and vulvovaginal candidiasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high proportion of vulvovaginal candidiasis is due to C.glabrata that responds poorly to
      fluconazole therapy. We assessed the clinical relief and mycological cure in response to oral
      fluconazole and boric acid suppositories in patients with diabetes mellitus and vulvovaginal
      candidiasis given in a Randomized trial. Fluconazole was given in standard oral single dose
      (150 mg) fluconazole and boric acid vaginal suppositories was given in dose of 600 mg/daily
      for 14 uninterrupted days.
