        <title>Number of Participants Experiencing a Dose-limiting Toxicity at the Indicated Dose</title>
        <description>A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as predefined adverse events or events that prevented participants from receiving 75% of their scheduled doses or from starting their next treatment period. The dose at which no more than 1 out of 6 participants experiences a DLT is defined as the optimally tolerated regimen. The OTR is important because it determines the highest dose combination that can be given without significant toxicity.</description>
