  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Netherlands fortification of food products is not yet mandatory. One of the major
      arguments of the Dutch Health Council to advise against mandatory fortification is the
      possibility of masking of a vitamin B12 deficiency. A possible solution to overcome the
      possibility of masking is: fortification of foods with both folic acid and vitamin B12. In
      this study we want to assess the effects of this fortification strategy on markers of folate
      and vitamin B12 status.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During a 12 week period subjects will consume

        -  bread fortified with folic acid and vitamin B12 or

        -  placebo bread (not fortified)

      Bread consumption has to be at least 3 slices per day, fortification level is 100mcg folic
      acid and 6mcg vitamin B12 per 3 slices.

      We will study the effect of this fortification strategy on markers of folate and vitamin B12
      status.
