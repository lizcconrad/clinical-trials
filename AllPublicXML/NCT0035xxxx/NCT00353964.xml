    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of three concentrations
      of rEV131, a new investigational anti-inflammatory agent, compared to placebo (an inactive
      substance) and an FDA approved anti-inflammatory agent in patients with ocular inflammation
      who have undergone cataract extraction with intra-ocular lens implantation.
