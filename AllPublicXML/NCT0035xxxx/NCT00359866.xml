  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indications for post-hysterectomy radiation therapy (RT) have been well established by
      clinical data. Adjuvant RT has demonstrated local control and survival benefit. In patients
      with nodal disease, adjuvant chemotherapy concurrent with radiation has further improved the
      clinical outcome. The acute hematological and gastrointestinal toxicity of concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy can be quite high, sometimes preventing patients from completed their full
      treatment course, potentially compromising the therapeutic benefit of treatment. Intensity
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced method of delivering external beam
      radiation that may minimize the volume of normal tissue irradiated to high dose and thus
      decrease the risk of normal tissue toxicity. Helical tomotherapy is a novel treatment device
      with sophisticated imaging and treatment delivery features that are optimally suited for
      IMRT. There are retrospective clinical data supporting the use of non-tomotherapy delivered
      IMRT to treat patients with gynecologic cancers. The proposed study will prospectively test
      whether helical tomotherapy is a feasible method for delivering IMRT in post-hysterectomy
      cervical cancer patients receiving adjuvant RT. Here, the question of feasibility is simply
      one of verifying that target volumes are reliably covered by 'sculpted' IMRT high-dose
      regions. Although this is not a treatment effectiveness study, we will also follow the
      clinical outcome of these patients, including toxicity, local control and survival, in
      anticipation that this information will be valuable if the treatment modality is judged
      feasible and will be used for further treatments of this patient population.

      Patients with cervical cancer receiving post-operative radiotherapy (RT) for high risk
      features found on pathologic review will be treated with pelvic intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT). Helical tomotherapy will be used to plan and deliver the radiation treatment.
      Treatment volume will include the upper third of the vagina and para-vaginal tissue and the
      common, external and internal iliac nodal regions. External beam radiation will be delivered
      in 180 cGy daily fractions to a total dose of 5040 cGy. Patients will receive once a day
      treatment five days a week, for approximately 6 weeks. Concurrent chemotherapy and/or
      intracavitary brachytherapy may be included in the treatment plan at the discretion of the
      treating physician, consistent with routine clinical practice.
