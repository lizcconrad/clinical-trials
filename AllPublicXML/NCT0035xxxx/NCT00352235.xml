      Phase I/II trial of KRN7000 in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

      Study objectives: To evaluate and compare the safety and tolerability of 3 ascending doses of
      a-GalCer.

      The primary efficacy parameter: HCV-RNA response at the end of treatment. Secondary efficacy
      parameter: Serum ALT response. Further objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of
      a-GalCer on serum cytokines IFNg and TNFa and on iNKT cells.

      Number of dose levels: 3 Investigational product: KRN7000 Route of administration:
      intravenous Dosages and frequency: 0.1, 1, 10 mcg/kg, monthly injection, 3 times (day 0, day
      28 and day 56)

      Phase I/II trial of KRN7000 in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

      This study is a multicenter double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II
      dose-escalation trial. The protocol is conducted in The Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
      Patients with chronic hepatitis C who met the inclusion criteria are assigned to receive
      a-GalCer (KRN7000 ((2S, 3S,
      4R)-1-O-(a-D-galactopyranosyl)-N-hexacosanoyl-2-amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol), Kirin
      Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Gunma, Japan) or placebo intravenously, thrice with intervals of 4
      weeks. Cohorts of 12 patients are entered at each of the three dose levels (0.1, 1 and 10
      mg/kg body weight). Three patients per dose level are randomized to the placebo arm.

      Dose escalation to the next cohort are decided after evaluation by a safety review board of
      all the safety data collected on all the patients who had completed 3 weeks after the first
      injection in the preceding dose cohort. After completion of 8 weeks of treatment, with
      injections at 0, 4 and 8 weeks, patients are monitored without further therapy for an
      additional 16 weeks.

      Study objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate and compare the safety and
      tolerability of 3 ascending doses of a-GalCer. The primary efficacy parameter is the response
      at the end of treatment, based on serum hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) levels.
      As a secondary efficacy parameter serum ALT levels are evaluated. Further objectives of the
      study are to evaluate the effect of a-GalCer on serum cytokines IFNg and TNFa and on iNKT
      cells.
