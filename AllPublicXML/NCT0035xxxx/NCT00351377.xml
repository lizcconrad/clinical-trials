  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may result in
      gastrointestinal (GI) complications in some patients. This study will 1) determine the
      proportion of patients with autoimmune diseases who are experiencing any GI complaints under
      MMF-based immunosuppressive treatment and 2) assess if a switch from MMF to enteric-coated
      mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) results in improved GI and/or health-related quality of life
      outcomes.

    <measure>Changes in GI Symptom Severity After Conversion From Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 - 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in GI symptom severity was measured by changes in the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) total score from baseline visit to the visit at 6-8 weeks. This total score was calculated as the average of the 15 single items (each ranging from 1-7 score points) and thus also had a range from 1-7 score points. Higher values indicate more unfavorable conditions.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the GI Symptom Severity Subscales After Conversion to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in GI symptom severity was measured by changes in the total scores of 5 subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain and indigestion) of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) from baseline visit to the visit at 6-8 weeks. The GSRS is a 15-item instrument with a mean subscale score ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (very severe discomfort).</description>

    <measure>Changes in GI-related Quality of Life Index (GIQLI), After Patients Are Converted From MMF to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by changes in the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) from Baseline visit to the 6-8 week visit. The GIQLI is a 36-item questionnaire and consists of 5 different subscales. The total score was calculated as the sum of the 36 single items which each ranged from 0-4, leading to a hypothetical range from 0-144 score points (lower scores indicate more unfavorable conditions). The mean change was calculated as (6-8 week visit value) minus (Baseline value).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the GI-related Quality of Life Subscales After Conversion to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 5 different subscales of the GI-related Quality of Life (GIQLI) were analyzed separately by calculating the average value of the items that were included in the respective subscore. Thus, the theoretical range for each of the subscores was the same as for the single items, i.e. 0-4 score points. An increase in the subscale score indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) After Conversion to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGWB consists of 22 single items (each ranging from 0-5) with 7 dimensions (including the total score) to be calculated. Lower scores indicate more unfavorable conditions. The total raw score is calculated by summing up all of the single items and thus has a hypothetical range from 0-110 score points. This raw score is further transformed using the formula: (raw score / 110) x 100 to fit a range from 0-100.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB) Subscales After Conversion to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6-8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to the 6-8 week visit for each of the six subscores (each ranging from 0-5) of the PGWB were analyzed individually. Each of the subscores was transformed to fit a range from 0-100. Lower scores indicate more unfavorable conditions, so an increase in score indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>6-8 week</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed using the Overall Treatment Effects for GI symptoms questionnaire. The question was: &quot;Has there been any change in the participant's GI symptoms since his/her last study visit? Please indicate if there has been any change in his/her symptoms.&quot; The possible answers were: &quot;Improved&quot;, &quot;about the same&quot;, or &quot;worse. The questionnaire was completed by the physician.</description>

        <title>Changes in the GI Symptom Severity Subscales After Conversion to Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium</title>
        <description>Changes in GI symptom severity was measured by changes in the total scores of 5 subscales (reflux, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain and indigestion) of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) from baseline visit to the visit at 6-8 weeks. The GSRS is a 15-item instrument with a mean subscale score ranging from 1 (no discomfort) to 7 (very severe discomfort).</description>

        <description>Assessed by changes in the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) from Baseline visit to the 6-8 week visit. The GIQLI is a 36-item questionnaire and consists of 5 different subscales. The total score was calculated as the sum of the 36 single items which each ranged from 0-4, leading to a hypothetical range from 0-144 score points (lower scores indicate more unfavorable conditions). The mean change was calculated as (6-8 week visit value) minus (Baseline value).</description>
