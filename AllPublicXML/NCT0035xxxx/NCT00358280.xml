    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, duration of motor block until return to
      normal function in the non-operated leg after the start of injection, of ropivacaine 5 mg/ml
      and bupivacaine 5 mg/ml when used for spinal anaesthesia in patients undergoing unilateral
      lower limb surgery.
