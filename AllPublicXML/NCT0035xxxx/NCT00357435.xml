      This study will explore the clinical and hereditary (genetic) features of corneal dystrophy
      and other inherited corneal disease. Corneal dystrophy is clouding of the cornea - the
      transparent part of the eye covering the iris and pupil that passes light to the back of the
      eye. When the cornea becomes cloudy, interfering with the passage of light, vision may be
      impaired or lost. Corneal problems may occur with vision problems alone, or with other
      problems, such as changes in facial appearance or bone or joint problems. A better
      understanding of these genetic conditions may help in the development of better diagnostic
      tests and methods of disease management.

      Patients with corneal dystrophies and related corneal disease and their family members may be
      eligible for this study. Participants will be drawn from patients enrolled in other studies
      of corneal dystrophy at the NEI and collaborating clinics.

      Participants will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical and surgical history

        -  Verification of diagnosis

        -  Construction of a family tree regarding familial vision problems

        -  Complete eye examination, including dilation of the pupils and photography of the
           cornea, tests of color vision, field of vision, and the ability to see in the dark, and
           photographs of the eye.

        -  Blood sample collection to identify the genes responsible for corneal disease and
           ascertain how they cause disease.

      Objective: This project, Clinical and Molecular Studies in Families With Corneal Dystrophy or
      Other Inherited Corneal Diseases will study the inheritance of corneal dystrophy and other
      inherited corneal diseases, both Mendelian and complex in order to identify the genes that,
      when mutated, cause corneal disease and the pathophysiology through which they act.

      Study Population: Families of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. We will study a
      maximum or 2,000 patients and family members.

      Design: The study consists of ascertaining individuals, and especially families with multiple
      individuals, affected by corneal dystrophy and other inherited corneal diseases. These
      patients and their families will undergo detailed ophthalmological examinations to
      characterize their corneal disease and determine their affectation status. A blood sample
      will be collected from each individual for isolation of DNA and in some individuals for
      lymphoblastoid transformation to establish a renewable source of DNA. Linkage analysis,
      physical mapping, and mutational screening will be carried out to identify the specific the
      gene and the mutations in it that are associated with corneal disease in this family. If
      necessary, the gene product will be characterized biochemically. All associate investigators
      will carry out patient ascertainment, diagnosis, and sample referral, and in some cases
      molecular genetic analyses. The study will enroll subjects at NEI and collaborating
      institutions.

      Outcome Measures: Linkage will be determined using the lod score method and mutations in
      specific genes will be assessed using a combination of residue conservation, blosum score,
      and molecular modeling. Biochemical, metabolic, and physiological effects will be
      individualized to the specific assay.
