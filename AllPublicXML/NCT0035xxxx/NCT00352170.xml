    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether calcium supplementation alone or calcium plus vitamin
      D reduces the incidence of fractures, reduces high parathyroid secretory activity, and halts
      bone loss in a population-based sample of women 55+ years of age.

        -  A calcium supplement of 1400 mg/d will significantly reduce the cumulative incidence of
           spine and appendicular fractures over four years for independently living, rural women
           55 years of age and older compared to similar women on their usual diets.

        -  A calcium supplement of 1400 mg/d plus 1100 IU vitamin D/d will significantly reduce the
           cumulative incidence of spine and appendicular fractures compared to a calcium
           supplement only.

      We are conducting a 4-year randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of calcium or
      calcium with vitamin D supplementation. We randomly sampled the population of healthy,
      independent living women 55+ years in nine rural counties. We randomly assigned 1180 women to
      one of three groups: Group 1 receives calcium (1400 mg/d) and vitamin D placebo, Group 2
      receives both calcium (1400 mg/d) and vitamin D (1100 IU/d) and Group 3 receives both
      placebos.

      A full-service market research firm randomly selected telephone numbers from all households
      with listed numbers in the nine-county rural sample area. The firm continued calling until
      1180 women were selected who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were willing to
      participate in a four year prospective study of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The
      participants were enrolled into study between May 2000 and July 2001.

      Participants have study visits every six months. Annually the following are performed: bone
      density scans, height and weight, brief medical history including medicine changes, fracture
      surveillance, and compliance with calcium and vitamin D. At baseline and end of study, spine
      x-rays and dietary recall were obtained.
