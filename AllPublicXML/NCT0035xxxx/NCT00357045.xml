      Objectives:

        1. To determine whether paroxetine can prevent major depression in patients with hepatitis
           C (HCV) who are receiving pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN).

        2. To determine whether paroxetine can prevent subsyndromal increases in depression and
           anxiety in patients with HCV who are receiving Peg-IFN.

        3. To determine whether paroxetine can prevent a significant change in the health related
           quality of life in patients with HCV who are receiving Peg-IFN.

        4. To determine whether paroxetine improves compliance with Peg-IFN therapy for HCV.

        5. To determine whether paroxetine enables patients to complete Peg-IFN therapy for HCV who
           might otherwise require a dose reduction or discontinuation because of neuropsychiatric
           side effects.
