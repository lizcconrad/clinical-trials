  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve or save renal function by optimizing the
      immunosuppressive regimen by reducing the Cyclosporine A dose and the exchange of
      Azathioprine by Mycophenolatmofetile, which is an effective immunosuppressive agent and will
      minimize the risk of acute rejection episodes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The decrease of quality of life in patients after heart transplantation in the long-term is
      determined by an increasing incidence of transplant vasculopathy and by
      immunosuppression-related side effects.Long-term administration of calcineurin inhibitors is
      associated with chronic nephrotoxicity.
