  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to look at the effects of an experimental drug called pegaptanib
      (also called Macugen) for the treatment of swelling in the retina (the light sensitive tissue
      in the back of the eye) that can occur after cataract surgery. Swelling in the retina can
      lead to blurry vision.

      The only treatment available for this condition is eye drops that decrease swelling in the
      back of the eye, but eye drops may not decrease the swelling in everyone. We want to see if
      pegaptanib can decrease swelling in the retina and improve vision in patients with swelling
      after cataract surgery.

      While only 1% to 2% of people following cataract surgery develop visual acuity loss from
      chronic post-surgical cystoid macular edema (CME), this represents approximately 20,000
      individuals in the U.S. each year, and many more throughout the world. No current drug or
      surgical treatment is very effective in the management of chronic post-surgical CME. Topical
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, such as ketorolac drops 4 times a day (qid) for
      3 months, have been shown to reduce the extent of fluorescein leakage on angiography in
      patients with this condition; however, compliance can be difficult, not all cases resolve
      following this treatment, the drop is not approved for this indication, and it is unknown if
      this treatment has an effect that lasts beyond 3 to 6 months. The fluorescein angiographic
      findings and the effects of ketorolac drops suggest that the condition is a result of
      increased permeability from inflammation and might resolve with a therapy that decreases
      abnormal vessel permeability. Recent studies have shown that vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) plays a major role in vessel permeability. Pegaptanib (Macugen) is an
      FDA-approved drug for wet AMD. Pegaptanib is a selective VEGF antagonist that blocks the
      effects of VEGF; therefore,pegaptanib may decrease vessel permeability and possibly decrease
      CME. Pegaptanib has been shown to have some activity in reducing retinal blood vessel leakage
      in diabetic patients with chronic macular edema (Macugen Diabetic Retinopathy Study Group. A
      phase II randomized double-masked trial of pegaptanib, an anti-vascular endothelial growth
      factor aptamer, for diabetic macular edema. Ophthalmology 2005;112:1747-57.), further
      supporting the hypothesis that it might be effective in other causes of chronic macular
      edema. We plan to conduct a pilot study of the effects of pegaptanib (up to 3 treatments of
      pegaptanib given as often as every 6 weeks for up to 12 weeks) in subjects with chronic
      post-surgical CME. If pegaptanib treatment is shown to be beneficial for this condition,
      additional studies could be performed to prove long-term effectiveness in patients with
      chronic CME or even for prophylaxis for patients known to be at high risk of developing CME
      following ocular surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (ages 18 years or older)

          -  Best corrected visual acuity &lt; 20/40 but no worse than 20/800 in the study eye

          -  Best corrected visual acuity better than or equal to 20/200 in the fellow eye

          -  Post-surgical CME in the study eye as documented on OCT (central subfield &gt;/= 250
             microns)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are interested in participating in this study
             will use two effective forms of contraception prior to initiation of pegaptanib and
             then throughout the remainder of the study. For women of childbearing potential,
             results from a urine pregnancy test will be obtained prior to each injection with
             pegaptanib. Urine samples will be disposed of after the test is performed.

             topical therapy for CME after cataract surgery or the other eye,if the best-corrected
             visual acuity has not improved by at least 5 letters and if the center point
             thickening on OCT has not improved by at least 20%. Patients who have been on topical
             ketorolac for greater than 12 weeks are still eligible for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of intravitreal steroid (triamcinolone) injection into the study eye or fellow
             eye within 4 months prior to cataract surgery

          -  CME due to other etiologies such as vein occlusion and diabetes.

          -  Retinal diseases that preclude evaluation of the macula for edema (e.g., macular
             hole).
