      We hypothesized that there's difference between follicular phase and luteal phase of normal
      women in radial pulse waves and tongue figures.

      As comparing with follicular and menstrual phases of the cycle, in women during the luteal
      phase, the heart rate, body temperature, foot skin temperature and body weight were
      significantly increased. Tongue inspection and pulse examination are two methods that Chinese
      medical doctors are used in the diagnosis of patterns. Pulse wave analysis of the radial
      artery is a non-invasive, widely applicable technique for assessing cardiovascular function.
      Radial artery waveforms have been demonstrated being associated with the blood pressure wave
      of ascending and central aorta, the function of left ventricle , the arterial wall properties
      and the endothelial function. Even when measure locally, carries characteristic information
      from the whole arterial system because of reflection of waves at distinct sites of the
      arterial system. Examination of the changes of the arterial pulse wave between follicular
      phase may offer valuable insights into cardiovascular physiologic feature in menstrual cycle.
      The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the cyclic variations in
      hemodynamic and volume parameters during the menstrual cycle among normal healthy women. To
      that end we compared the following parameter of radial pulse contour between late follicular
      and late luteal time point: percussion wave, the difference between dicrotic wave and
      dicrotic notch, and the area of the wave.
