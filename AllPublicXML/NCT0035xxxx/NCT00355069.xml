  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 3-year, multi-site study focuses on the translation of cost-effective methods to bring a
      chronic care model to the care of poor, minority, inner-city children with asthma, at risk of
      the worst outcomes for the leading chronic disease of children.

      The specific aims are to:

        1. Develop a computer support system to deliver peer-driven, patient-linked Guideline
           prompts at the point of care using affordable information technology;

        2. Evaluate the effect of the Guideline prompt system on the process and outcomes (symptom
           control, health-related-quality-of-life, ED and hospitalizations) of asthma care; and

        3. Evaluate the added effect on outcomes of family-focused, supportive education delivered
           by a community health worker.

      The key product of the computer support system is a guideline prompt that serves as the
      mechanism for integrating patient specific data with standards of care. 548 children, ages
      5-18, with physician diagnosed asthma, enrolled in one Medicaid Managed Care Organization in
      CT, and receiving care at one of four Federally Qualified Community Health Centers will be
      recruited. All sites will have access to the computer support system and the to-be-developed,
      Guideline-Driven Clinical Standards of Asthma Care. In Phase I (12 months), the effect of
      prompts delivered at the point of care on patient outcomes will be compared to the effect of
      no-prompt care. In Phase II (6 months), the effect of family-focused, supportive education
      will be assessed in combination with prompted care compared to no-prompt care and compared to
      no education. All patients will receive standard screening and outreach to keep appointments.
      Data will be obtained from medical records, medical and pharmacy claims data as well as
      patient and parent interviews at baseline and quarterly for 18 months.
