    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
             criteria apply:

          -  Subjects in North America ≥18 years of age who

               1. Have successfully completed one of the following parent studies: 101468/205,
                  ROX104805; OR

               2. Have a diagnosis of primary RLS using the International RLS Study Group (IRSSG)
                  Diagnostic Criteria (Appendix 10), experience RLS symptoms during both the
                  evening (before 8 PM) and night-time, and have a total score ≥15 on the IRLS
                  Rating Scale at Baseline. Subjects must have a history of a minimum of 20
                  evenings/nights of RLS episodes per month (e.g., any combination of evenings
                  and/or nights for ≥ 20 days). During Screening/Washout, RLS symptoms must be
                  present for at least 4 of 7 evenings/nights immediately prior to the Baseline
                  Visit (e.g., any combination of evenings and/or nights for ≥ 4 days).

          -  Subjects must give written informed consent prior to any specific study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have any medical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could affect efficacy assessments or clinically significant or unstable medical
             conditions that present a safety concern. These may include, but are not limited to
             the following disorders: diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis,
             fibromyalgia syndrome, symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, severe cardiovascular
             disease, hepatic or renal failure, pleuro-pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Subjects having clinically significant abnormal laboratory or ECG findings not
             resolved at time of baseline examinations. Abnormal 12-lead ECG findings include, but
             are not limited to the following: myocardial ischemia, clinically significant
             conduction abnormalities, or clinically significant arrhythmias.

          -  Subjects with a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110mmHg or ≤ 50mmHg or systolic blood
             pressure ≥ 180mmHg or ≤ 90mmHg at the Screening or Baseline visit.

          -  Subjects with a history of augmentation and/or end-of-dose rebound symptoms.

               -  Augmentation is defined as RLS symptoms that occurred while on treatment and
                  occur ≥ 2 hours earlier than they did before, symptoms which are more severe than
                  when not treated, symptoms which start after less time at rest than they did
                  before treatment, or symptoms which involve other parts of the body, such as the
                  arms or trunk.

               -  End-of-dose rebound is defined as a re-emergence of RLS symptoms in the early
                  morning the day after taking the dose of RLS medication.

          -  Subjects who have exhibited intolerance to ropinirole.

          -  For subjects entering Study 206, certain medications must be discontinued prior to
             entering the study. The following medications are prohibited for the duration of the
             study period which is up to and including the Follow-up visit:

             ·dopamine agonists (including ropinirole immediate release formulation), dopamine
             antagonists (e.g., typical neuroleptics, metoclopramide), levodopa/carbidopa The
             minimum discontinuation period is generally 5 half-lives or 7 consecutive
             evening/nights medication-free, prior to baseline, whichever is the longer period. If
             the subject will require longer than 2 weeks following the Follow-up visit of the
             parent study to complete the washout, GSK must be consulted for further instructions.

          -  Other medications, including those with partial dopaminergic activity (e.g., atypical
             antipsychotics, certain antidepressants such as bupropion, tricyclic antidepressants
             and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) may have additive activity with ropinirole and
             should be used with caution in patients taking ropinirole. For patients on stable
             doses, these agents may be permitted; however, it is recommended that the dose of the
             medication remain stable throughout the duration of the study.

          -  Night workers or any others whose sleeping habits are incompatible with the study
             design, or who would be required to make significant changes to their bedtime during
             the course of the study.

          -  Women who have a positive pregnancy test.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are not practicing a clinically accepted method
             of contraception such as oral contraception, surgical sterilization, IUD, diaphragm in
             conjunction with spermicidal foam and condom on the male partner, or systemic
             contraception (e.g. Norplant).

        The following exclusion criteria must be assessed at Study 206 Screen/Baseline for subjects
        who are not rolling in following completion of Study 101468/205 or ROX104805:

          -  Subjects who suffer from a primary sleep disorder other than RLS that may
             significantly affect the symptoms of RLS (e.g., narcolepsy, sleep terror disorder,
             sleepwalking disorder, breathing related sleep disorder).

          -  Subjects diagnosed with movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease, dyskinesias,
             and dystonias).

          -  Signs of secondary RLS (e.g., end stage renal disease, iron deficient anemia or
             pregnancy at Baseline Visit)

          -  Subjects requiring treatment of daytime RLS symptoms (daytime defined as 7:00 AM until
             5:00 PM).

          -  Subjects with a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the past year.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, would be non-compliant with the
             visit schedule or other study procedures

          -  Participation in any clinical drug or device trial (other than Study 101468/205 or
             ROX104805) in the one month prior to the Baseline Visit
