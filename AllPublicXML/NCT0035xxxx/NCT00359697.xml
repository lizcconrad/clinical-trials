  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to compare the effects of mannitol and hypertonic saline
      on patients with increased intracranial pressure. The hypothesis being tested is that
      hypertonic saline is more effective in controlling increased intracranial pressure than
      mannitol.
