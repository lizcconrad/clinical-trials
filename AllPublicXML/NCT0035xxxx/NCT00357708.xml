  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and decitabine in
      treating patients with relapsed, refractory, or poor-prognosis hematologic cancer or other
      diseases. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving vorinostat together with decitabine may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of
      vorinostat in combination with Decitabine in patients with relapsed/refractory or poor
      prognosis acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) or chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated or blastic phase (CML-BP).

      1.2 To describe the clinical activity of the combination of Decitabine and vorinostat in this
      patient population.

      1.3 To determine the in vivo molecular effects of this combination. This will include
      measuring the effects on DNA methylation, histone H3 and H4 acetylation and changes in gene
      expression.

      1.4 To determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the combination.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and oral vorinostat (SAHA) three times
      daily on days 6-19. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of decitabine and SAHA until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 10 additional
      patients are treated at that dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive
