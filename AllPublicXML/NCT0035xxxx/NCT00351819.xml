  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Naturally occurring opiates (endorphins) decrease testosterone levels by inhibiting the
      synthesis of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and also inhibiting testosterone synthesis
      by the testes. Similarly, men with addiction to narcotics and those on exogenous opioids for
      pain control have decreased serum testosterone levels. Indeed, these men complain of
      decreased libido, erectile dysfunction and impaired quality of life. Animal studies have
      shown that gonadectomy results in a decrease in pain threshold in rats and repletion of
      testosterone elevates that threshold. These observations suggest that testosterone may
      possess analgesic properties. Hence, the investigators hypothesize that hypogonadism
      developing in men on opioids results in an increased sensitivity to pain and requirement of
      higher doses of opioids. In this study, the investigators plan to administer testosterone to
      men with opioid-induced hypogonadism and evaluate their pain perception, pain sensitivity in
      response to noxious stimuli and changes in the requirement of opioids in response to
      testosterone administration.

      Hypothesis:

      Testosterone replacement in men with opioid-induced hypogonadism will improve pain tolerance,
      pain perception and quality of life.

      Specific aims:

        1. To evaluate the effects of testosterone replacement on pain sensitivity, pain tolerance,
           and pain modulation in men with opioid-induced hypogonadism.

        2. To determine the effects of testosterone replacement on health-related quality of life.

        3. To determine whether testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men induces changes in the
           dosage requirements of opioid medications for pain control.

      To accomplish our specific aims, the investigators propose a randomized, double blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel arm study in which hypogonadal men with non-cancer chronic back
      pain syndrome on chronic opioids and low testosterone levels (&lt;300 ng/dl) will be randomized
      to exogenous testosterone replacement therapy vs placebo. Our primary outcome is change in
      pain tolerance using various external painful stimuli. Secondary outcomes are change in pain
      sensitivity and modulation, quality of life and opioid requirements.

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at Week 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Week14 after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>BPI is a self-administered questionnaire that measuring chronic pain. BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score assesses the severity of pain on a continuous scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference, ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10(completely interferes). The total score is the sum of the pain severity score and pain interference score, ranging from 0(no pain) to 20 (severe and completely interfered pain).</description>

    <description>IIEF is a validated, 15-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains of sexual function: erectile function (range 1-30), orgasmic function (range 0-10), sexual desire (range 2-10), intercourse satisfaction (range 0-15), and overall sexual satisfaction (range 2-10). Each question was answered on a 6-point or 5-point scale from 0/1 to 5 (best) with a total possible score (sum of 5 domains) range of 5 to 75 with higher scores representing better function.</description>

    <description>The SF-36 measures 8 domains of the QoL: physical function, bodily pain, vitality, role limitations due to physical problems, general health perceptions, emotional well-being, social function, and role limitations due to emotional problems. Each domain is scored separately from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing better health-related QoL.</description>

    <description>PCS questionnaire measures self-assessment of pain catastrophizing. This questionnaire consists of 13 items on past painful experiences and rate on 5-point scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS yields three subscale scores assessing rumination (range 0-16), magnification (range 0-12), helplessness (range 0-24), and a composite score (sum of three domains, ranging 0-52). Higher score represents worse painful experiences.</description>

          <title>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) questionnaire</title>
          <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) is a self-administered questionnaire that measuring chronic pain. The BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score assesses the severity of pain on a continuous scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference, ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10(completely interferes). The total score (ranging from 0-20) is the sum of the pain severity score and pain interference score. Higher scores represents severer and more interfering pain.</description>

          <title>Sexual Function as assessed by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)</title>
          <description>IIEF is a validated, 15-item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains of sexual function: erectile function (range 1-30), orgasmic function (range 0-10), sexual desire (range 2-10), intercourse satisfaction (range 0-15), and overall sexual satisfaction (range 2-10). Each question was answered on a 6-point or 5-point scale from 0/1 to 5 (best) with a total possible score (sum of 5 domains) range of 5 to 75 with higher scores representing better function.</description>

          <title>Pain catastrophizing scale (PCS)</title>
          <description>PCS questionnaire measures self-assessment of pain catastrophizing. This questionnaire consists of 13 items on past painful experiences and rate on 5-point scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS yields three subscale scores assessing rumination (range 0-16), magnification (range 0-12), helplessness (range 0-24), and a composite score (sum of three domains, ranging 0-52). Higher score represents worse painful experiences.</description>
          <population>Of the completers, 62 men (33 in the testosterone arm and 29 in the placebo arm) had pre and post-intervention data on PCS outcomes.</population>

Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). Scores from the questions are summed to assign a total score ranging from 0 to 28, where higher score represents worse insomnia problem.</description>

        <title>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) at Week 14</title>
        <description>BPI is a self-administered questionnaire that measuring chronic pain. BPI gives two main scores: a pain severity score and a pain interference score. The pain severity score assesses the severity of pain on a continuous scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain). The pain interference score corresponds to the item on pain interference, ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10(completely interferes). The total score is the sum of the pain severity score and pain interference score, ranging from 0(no pain) to 20 (severe and completely interfered pain).</description>

          <description>Cold-pressor tests measure cold-induced pain and its sensation. Time was measured when a participant reached pain tolerance in cold water and after sensation. Higher values of time in Cold pain tolerance and lower values of time in Cold pain after-sensation (30 seconds) represent better tolerance of pain.</description>

        <description>PCS questionnaire measures self-assessment of pain catastrophizing. This questionnaire consists of 13 items on past painful experiences and rate on 5-point scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The PCS yields three subscale scores assessing rumination (range 0-16), magnification (range 0-12), helplessness (range 0-24), and a composite score (sum of three domains, ranging 0-52). Higher score represents worse painful experiences.</description>
