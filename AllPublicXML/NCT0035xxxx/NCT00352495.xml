      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinblastine and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vinblastine when
      given together with carboplatin in treating young patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent
      low-grade glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Estimate the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of vinblastine when
           given in combination with carboplatin in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed or
           recurrent low-grade gliomas.

        -  Define and describe the acute and dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen.

        -  Describe the toxicities associated with repeated courses of the combination chemotherapy
           regimen and the number of treatment modifications required over the course of treatment.

      Secondary

        -  Describe the radiographic responses in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Describe changes in diffusion/perfusion imaging during study therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of vinblastine. Patients are stratified
      according to amount of prior therapy (heavily pretreated vs less heavily pretreated).

      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and vinblastine IV on days 1, 8, 15.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vinblastine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>The MTD of vinblastine in combination with a monthly dose of carboplatin will be determined during the first cycle of therapy. Each 4-week cycle will consist of carboplatin once every 4 weeks on day 1. Vinblastine will be given once a week for 3 weeks followed by a one week break. Doses of carboplatin and vinblastine sulfate will be assigned at study enrollment. Patients may receive eleven additional four week cycles, barring tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The total duration of therapy will be approximately 48 weeks.</description>
