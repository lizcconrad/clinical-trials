    <textblock>
      Pilot multicentre, open label study with the aim to evaluate antitumor activity in term of
      the sum of complete and partial response (O.R.R.) of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and
      fludarabine) and rituximab, followed by zevalin radioimmunotherapy and response duration
      (Time to relapse or progression)and to evaluate the safety of the treatment as acute and late
      toxicity.

      Secondary objective is to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and the event-free survival
      (EFS).

      Test medication:

        -  Yttrium-90 (90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan 0.4 mCi/kg is delivered to patient achieving at
           least a partial remission (PR) after chemotherapy as a single dose for patients with
           baseline platelet counts&gt;150x10^9/L or 0.3 mCi/kg for patients with baseline platelet
           counts of 100 to 149x10^9/L. Rituximab 250mg/sqm is given prior to therapeutic
           radiolabeled antibodies.

        -  Standard dose chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and rituximab
           given every 28 days up to the best response (maximum 6 courses).

        -  A prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii as well as for herpes zoster are needed during
           treatment.

      Main parameters of activity: activity of Yttrium-90 (90Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan after
      cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and rituximab combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a lymphoma refractory to front-line chemotherapy, not including
             fludarabine, or in first relapse after chemotherapy not including fludarabine, not
             suitable for high-dose chemotherapy supported by auto or allogeneic bone marrow
             transplantation.

          -  Histologically-confirmed small lymphocytic (SLL), lymphoplasmacytic (LPL) and marginal
             zone (MZL) lymphomas.

          -  All prior chemotherapy, including corticosteroids, had to have been completed &gt; 4
             weeks before study treatment; &lt; 25% of active bone marrow irradiated previously; no
             prior bone marrow transplantation.

          -  Age: 18-70 years

          -  ECOG- performance status: 0-2.

          -  No allergy to mouse proteins.

          -  Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease with bidimensionally measurable disease in at least
             one site which has not irradiated, including any adenopathy or mass that could be
             measured during a physical examination or that was &gt; 5 cm on a computed tomographic
             scan (CT). In the event of splenomegaly or hepatomegaly, extension 5 cm below the
             costal margin was considered evidence of measurable disease. Osteoblastic bone
             lesions, ascites and pleural effusion are not considered measurable disease.

             &gt;2.5xupper normal limit), abnormal renal function, not disease related (serum
             creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL), active opportunistic infections.

          -  Serum positivity for HIV, HBsAg and HCV except for those with no sign of active viral
             replication, assessed by HCV-RNA and HBV-DNA. This latter group of patients can be
             enrolled in the study, but they will receive lamivudine prophylaxis and bimonthly
             evaluation of HbSAg, HbCAb and HBV-DNA will be provided.
