    <textblock>
      To evaluate azithromycin tear concentrations after instillation of one drop of one of the
      three T1225 concentrations (0.5%, 1% and 1.5%) and to evaluate the ocular safety.

      The aim of the present study was to compare azithromycin tear ocular concentrations after a
      single instillation of three different T1225 concentrations in order to determine early
      azithromycin tear concentration and to assess the T1225 concentration, which allowed having
      the higher azithromycin tear concentration, 24 hours after a single instillation.
