  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of growth hormone and an insulin
      sensitizer drug in pre-diabetic adults with excessive amounts of abdominal fat. Participants
      received a combination of two drugs: (1) recombinant human growth hormone (or its placebo)
      and (2) pioglitazone (or its placebo). We measured the abdominal fat content and blood sugar
      levels of participants before and after 40 weeks of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (GH) has been shown to reduce visceral
      adipose tissue (VAT) and improve insulin sensitivity in normoglycemic adults, but glucose
      levels may rise transiently. Pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug, counters the
      short-term diabetogenic effect of GH in rodents, but combined use of these drugs has not been
      evaluated in humans.

      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of GH and a TZD, alone and in
      combination, on glucose metabolism, visceral adiposity and insulin sensitivity in abdominally
      obese adults with impaired glucose tolerance. The hypothesis that combined treatment
      attenuates GH-induced increases in glucose concentrations, reduces VAT, and improves insulin
      sensitivity over time was tested. Sixty-two adults received GH and pioglitazone for 40 weeks
      in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
