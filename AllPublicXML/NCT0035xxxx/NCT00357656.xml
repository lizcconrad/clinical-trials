    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the hemostatic efficacy and safety of continuous
      infusion versus intermittent bolus infusion in the peri- and post-operative setting,
      employing rAHF-PFM, a recombinant antihemophilic factor manufactured without added human or
      animal proteins, in previously treated patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia A
      (baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 2% of normal) who are undergoing unilateral major orthopedic
      surgery that requires drain placement. The total study period per subject (from consent to
      study completion) will vary from approximately 9 to 26 weeks and will involve clinical and
      laboratory assessments.

    <time_frame>During the first postoperative 24 hours every 8 hours ± 30 minutes the drainage fluid was to be recorded..</time_frame>
    <description>Drainage fluid volume was to be measured cumulatively and recorded every 8 hours ± 30 minutes during the first 24 hours following surgery.
Unit of measure: Tera per Liter is the PRBC concentration in 10^12 units per 1 liter of drainage fluid.</description>

    <time_frame>During the first 24 postoperative hours blood loss was measured every 8 hours ± 30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Drainage fluid volume was to be measured cumulatively and recorded every 8 hours ± 30 minutes during the first 24 hours following surgery. Prior to surgery, the operating surgeon was to predict the estimated duration of surgery and the volume (mL) of the estimated expected blood loss for the surgery in a hemostatically normal individual of the same sex, age, and stature as the study subject 1) for the intraoperative procedure (defined as the time period from incision to application of compressive dressing and release of tourniquet, if applicable), 2) for the first 24 hours postoperatively, and 3) for the postoperative period until drain removal, if drainage continued beyond 24 hours.

    <measure>Actual Postoperative Blood Loss Compared to the Expected Average Blood Loss Until Drain Removal as Predicted Preoperatively by the Surgeon</measure>
    <time_frame>From end of surgery (application of compressive dressing and release of tourniquet, if applicable) until drain removal (up to postoperative day 7).</time_frame>
    <description>The total blood loss for the postoperative period (from end of surgery until drain removal) was adjusted for the expected blood loss by applying a log-transformation of the blood loss data.
The drainage volume was measured every 8 hours +/- 30 minutes during the first 24 hours. If the drainage continued beyond 24 hours, the PRBC volume and hemoglobin was to be measured cumulatively every 24 hours or whenever the drainage bottle was emptied and at the time of drain removal. Prior to surgery, the operating surgeon was to predict the estimated duration of surgery and the volume (mL) of the estimated expected blood loss for the surgery in a hemostatically normal individual of the same sex, age, and stature as the study subject for the first 24 hours postoperatively, and for the postoperative period until drain removal, if drainage continued beyond 24 hours.

    <description>To simplify the results below: Bleeding episodes were reported for 4 subjects (3 subjects on bolus infusion: 2 in Stratum A and 1 in Stratum B, and 1 subject on continuous infusion/Stratum B). The 4 subjects had 1 bleeding episode each. No bleeding episodes were reported for Stratum C.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Enrollment was conducted at 22 clinical sites in 12 countries (US, Austria, Norway, France, Portugal, Netherlands, Spain, Russia, Romania, Hungary, Italy, Poland). Of 85 participants enrolled, 72 participants participated in a PK study in the preoperative period; 63 participants were then randomized to treatment by continuous or bolus infusion.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 85 participants enrolled,15 were screen failures (2 after PK), 4 discontinued on the basis of the PK study in the preoperative period, 1 died, 1 was discontinued by physician decision (imprisonment), and 1 was discontinued per sponsor decision. Eventually, 63 participants were randomized to treatment by continuous (n=32) or bolus infusion (n=31)</pre_assignment_details>
