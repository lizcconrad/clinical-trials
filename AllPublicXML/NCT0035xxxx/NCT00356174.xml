  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the natural course of food allergy, including both
      the development of peanut allergy in infants at high risk for developing this allergy, and
      the resolution of both egg and cow's milk allergy.

      This observational study will investigate the developmental immunology of peanut, egg, and
      milk allergy in a cohort of milk- or egg-allergic children who are at risk for peanut
      allergy. This strategy will help to delineate, compare, and contrast biological markers and
      immunologic changes associated with the development of peanut allergy and loss of egg and
      milk allergy, while simultaneously evaluating important clinical and environmental influences
      likely to account for the recent rise in the prevalence of these allergies. The hallmark of
      food-allergic disease is the production of food-specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies
      that represent an end result of a T helper 2 (Th2) influenced immune response. Currently,
      there is only a limited understanding of the mechanisms involved in the developmental course
      of food allergies. To effectively prevent or reverse the progression of food allergy, immune
      interventions will be needed. Furthermore, it is likely that successful strategies will need
      to be directed to those persons at identifiable risk (e.g., who have biomarkers associated
      with development of peanut allergy).
