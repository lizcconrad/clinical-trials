  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this ecological study we examine the impact of stress from repeated terrorist attacks
      during the second initifada on medical utilization by the Israeli population. We hypothesize
      that in weeks following serious terror attacks there will be an increase in prescriptions for
      psychiatric medications and an increased number of unexplained somatic complaints. We will
      also examine associations with overall medical utlization. We will consider age, gender and
      effects of geographic poximity to location of attacks.
