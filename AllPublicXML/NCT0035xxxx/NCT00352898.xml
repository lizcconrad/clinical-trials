  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and varicella vaccinations are established as routine
      childhood practice and often co-administered during the second year of life, a combined
      measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MeMuRu-OKA) vaccine is fully justified. Such a combined
      vaccine was developed and extensively studied in susceptible children. In countries where
      varicella mass-vaccination is already implemented, a transition period is necessary as
      children who started with separate first-dose vaccinations of MMR and varicella will receive
      a single shot of the combined vaccine as the second dose. To account for those situations,
      this study will evaluate the effect of the combined measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine
      given in place of separate MMR and varicella vaccines as a second dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children must be healthy to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  immunosuppressive (including HIV) conditions, allergic diseases, neurological
             disorders, known anaphylactic reaction to MMR vaccine, and fever (axillary temperature
             ³ 37.5°C at the time of vaccination) are excluding factors. Children must have
             received one dose (but not more) of MMR and of varicella vaccine at least 6 weeks
             before entering the study. They must not receive or have received other non-registered
             drug or vaccine within 30 days prior to study start, or immunosuppressants for more
             than 14 days. Immunoglobulins or any blood products are prohibited during the 6 months
             before and during the study, as well as vaccine other than that foreseen by the
             protocol, 30 days before until 56 days after vaccination. They must not have had
             measles, mumps, rubella or varicella, or have been exposed to those diseases within 30
             days prior to study start. New-born infants (&lt; 5 weeks of age), pregnant women without
             previous exposure to chickenpox, and immunodeficient persons cannot live in the same
             household as the vaccinated child.
