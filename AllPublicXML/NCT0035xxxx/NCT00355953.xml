    <textblock>
      The present research program is proposed deepening some pharmacological effects of the
      genistein therapy in order to individualize alternative treatments to the conventional
      hormonal replacement therapy useful to reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and
      the osteoporotic consequences in postmenopausal women.

      Genistein is a phytoestrogen of the isoflavone family which has been shown to have beneficial
      effects on endothelial function and bone metabolism. On the basis of the so far obtained
      results, aim of our research was to investigate for a two years period the effects of
      genistein on cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial function and oxidative stress markers,
      bone metabolism and finally clarify pathophysiology mechanisms (by dosage of cytokines and
      endothelial markers) by which this molecule could interfere on atherosclerosis and bone mass
      loss progression.

      Particularly, and in extreme synthesis the following parameters have been studied during the
      treatment:

        1. inflammation markers as fibrinogen

        2. lipid profile - total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,
           lipoprotein(a)-

        3. endothelial function markers as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1

        4. oxidative stress by the evaluation of the F(2)-isoprostane

        5. cytokines as IL-6, OPG, RANK and RANKL

        6. bone mineral density, by DEXA, at lumbar spine and femoral neck

        7. Bone turnover markers as B-ALP, PYR, D-PYR

        8. PAP-test, transvaginal uterine ecography and mammography.
