      Primary objective:

      Difference in frequency of subjects with conventionally detected hypoglycemia by the subject
      [at least one measurement smaller/equal 60mg/dl documented in the 8-point profile in the case
      record form (CRF) or documentation of symptomatic hypoglycemia in the CRF through Visits 8/9]
      compared to CGMS detected blood glucose values smaller/equal 60mg/dl during CGMS measurements
      (at least one measurement through Visits 8/9) after eight weeks of treatment with insulin
      glargine.

      Secondary objective:

      Secondary study objectives were to investigate the safety and efficacy of a treatment change
      to insulin glargine in ICT treated subjects in terms of:

        -  Percentage of blood glucose measurements(CGMS data)smaller/equal 60mg/dl [3.3 mmol/l].

        -  Percentage of nocturnal blood glucose measurements(CGMS data)smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3
           mmol/l].

        -  Percentage of daytime blood glucose measurements(CGMS data)smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3
           mmol/l].

        -  Area under the curve (AUC smaller/equal 60)and time(t smaller/equal 60)for blood glucose
           smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3mmol/l], area under the curve (AUC greater/equal 180)and time
           (t greater/equal 180) for blood glucose greater/equal 180mg/dl[10.0mmol/l].

        -  Area under the curve (AUC smaller/equal 60)and time(t smaller/equal 60)for blood glucose
           smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3mmol/l]during the day (AUC 06.00am - 10.00pm)and during the
           night(AUC 10.00pm - 06.00am).

        -  Area under the curve (AUC greater/equal 180)and time(t greater/equal 180)for blood
           glucose greater/equal 180mg/dl[10.0mmol/l]during the day (AUC 06.00am - 10.00pm)and
           during the night(AUC 10.00pm - 06.00am).

        -  Frequency of subjects with nocturnal blood glucose value smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3
           mmol/l].

        -  Frequency of subjects with asymptomatic nocturnal blood glucose smaller/equal
           60mg/dl[3.3 mmol/l].

        -  Frequency of subjects with symptomatic nocturnal blood glucose smaller/equal 60mg/dl
           [3.3 mmol/l].

        -  Frequency of subjects with daytime blood glucose smaller/equal 60mg/dl [3.3 mmol/l].

        -  Frequency of subjects with asymptomatic daytime blood glucose smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3
           mmol/l].

        -  Frequency of subjects with symptomatic daytime blood glucose smaller/equal 60mg/dl[3.3
           mmol/l].

        -  Frequency of subjects with hyperglycemic blood glucose(greater/equal
           180mg/dl,[10.0mmol/l]).

        -  Frequency of subjects with symptomatic hypoglycemia(smaller/equal 60mg/dl [3.3mmol]).

        -  Frequency of subjects with severe hypoglycemia(smaller/equal 36mg/dl [2.0mmol/l]).

        -  Blood glucose values of 8-point profiles.

        -  Mean daytime &amp; mean nocturnal blood glucose of 8-point-profiles.

        -  HbA1c.

        -  Fasting blood glucose (FBG).

        -  Dose of insulin.

        -  Adjustment of insulin.

        -  Body weight, body mass index.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (no history of ketoacidosis)and stable
             treatment with NPH insulin(once or twice daily)and mealtime insulin for at least 3
             months.

          -  HbA1c values smaller/equal 8.0%(measured at screening visit, Visit 1).

          -  Ability and willingness to perform continuous and self monitoring blood glucose
             profiles, using a self monitoring blood glucose meter as well as carrying the
             continuous blood glucose meter at least two times for 72 hours throughout the study at
             home.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All forms of diabetes other than type 2 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Oral antidiabetic drugs(OADs)and/or insulins other than NPH and mealtime insulins,
             except metformin(stable dose for a minimum of 3 months, no dose adjustments during the
             study).

          -  Pregnant(as determined by urine pregnancy test at Visit 1)or breast-feeding.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who did not take adequate contraceptive protection

          -  Likelihood of requiring treatment during the study period with drugs not permitted by
             the study protocol (e.g. systemic corticosteroids).

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the study medication or to drugs with similar chemical
             structures.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drugs in the last month before study entry.

          -  Diabetic retinopathy with surgical treatment (laser photocoagulation or vitrectomy) in
             the 3 months prior to study entry or which required surgical treatment within the
             study.

          -  Clinically relevant cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hepatic, neurological,
             endocrine, hematological or other major systemic diseases making implementation of the
