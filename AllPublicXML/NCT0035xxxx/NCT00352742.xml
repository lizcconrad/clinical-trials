      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and effect of ATN-224 in combination with
      bortezomib (Velcade®) in patients with Multiple Myeloma who are relapsed from or refractory
      to bortezomib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a bone marrow based malignancy of plasma cells that is highly treatable
      but rarely curable. Angiogenesis, defined as the growth of new blood vessels from
      pre-existing vessels, is a requirement for the growth of nearly all tumors. An increase in
      bone marrow angiogenesis is present in Multiple Myeloma and correlates with disease
      progression. Several new therapies that target angiogenic pathways have shown clinical
      efficacy. ATN-224 is a small molecule that has been shown in pre-clinical studies to be
      antiangiogenic.

      Using one agent to overcome resistance of another agent is a treatment regimen used in
      oncology. A preclinical study with the combination of ATN-224 and bortezomib shows that the
      combination is more effective than either single agent in a bortezomib resistant cell line.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed multiple myeloma that has been treated with
             at least one different prior anti-myeloma regimens including one with bortezomib and
             is currently showing evidence of progressive disease

          2. Myeloma that is refractory to the most recent bortezomib-containing regimen as
             demonstrated by progressive disease while on bortezomib or that relapsed within 12
             weeks of the last dose of bortezomib either as a single agent or in combination with
             other agents

          3. Measurable disease defined as a serum M-protein concentration on electrophoresis ≥1
             g/dL of IgG myeloma or ≥0.5 g/dL of IgA myeloma or IgM myeloma or urinary excretion of
             monoclonal light chain ≥200 mg/24 hours

          4. Age &gt;18 years

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          6. ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A)

          7. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/uL

               -  platelets ≥75,000/uL

               -  hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL

               -  total bilirubin ≤2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤3 X ULN

               -  creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min (measured or calculated)

             Patients are allowed to receive blood transfusions before receiving their first dose
             of ATN-224 to bring the hemoglobin level to ≥8 g/dL to meet eligibility criteria.

          8. Use of adequate contraception. The effects of ATN 224 on the developing human fetus at
             the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because
             antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential
             and men with partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation through the follow up visit 28
             days after the last dose of ATN 224.

          9. Willingness to forego taking copper- or zinc-containing vitamins or supplements

         10. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)
             or thalidomide, lenalidomide, dexamethasone, arsenic trioxide, bortezomib, or
             glucocorticosteroids within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of ATN-224 or failure to
             recover from reversible adverse events due to agents administered previously

          2. Patients who cannot tolerate, based on previous experience, the assigned dose of
             bortezomib, including those with ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy

          3. Concurrent administration of any other investigational agents

          4. History of malabsorption syndromes or other gastrointestinal disorders that may affect
             ATN-224 absorption, including bowel obstruction, celiac disease, sprue, cystic
             fibrosis

          5. Ineligible to receive omeprazole (Prilosec® OTC) or other long-acting antacid

          6. Inability to swallow study medication capsules

          7. Not a suitable candidate in the opinion of the investigator for additional bortezomib
             therapy

          8. Other serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or intensive
             treatment

          9. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

         10. Women who are pregnant or lactating

         11. Known history of HIV

         12. History of another prior cancer, except basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix (or if there has been no evidence of recurrence for at least 5 years)
