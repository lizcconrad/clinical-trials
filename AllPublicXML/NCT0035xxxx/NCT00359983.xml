  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating antibody persistence at 1, 3 &amp; 5 years post-fourth dose (i.e., at 2,
      4 &amp; 6 years of age, respectively) in subjects vaccinated in a previous study.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the extension phase at
      years 1, 3 and 5. The objectives &amp; outcome measures of the first four doses are presented in
      a separate protocol posting (NCT00129129).

      This protocol posting has been amended in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act of
      September 26, 2007.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this long-term follow-up study, no new subjects will be recruited. All subjects
      participating in this long-term follow-up study should have already participated in a
      previous study. No vaccine will be administered during the persistence phase of the study.

      This Protocol Posting has been updated following Protocol amendment 3, September 2009.
