  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess whether 400mg/day of lacosamide is effective in
      reducing pain caused by distal diabetic neuropathy. Two dose-escalation schemes for
      lacosamide will be used to further determine the efficacy of the &quot;standard&quot; scheme and to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of a more rapid titration scheme. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of three treatment groups. Subjects in two of the groups will receive
      lacosamide at a dose of 400mg/day, but different dose-escalation schemes will be used to
      reach this final dose. The third group of subjects will receive a placebo. Subjects will have
      a 2 in 3 (66 %) chance of getting lacosamide.

      The maximum lacosamide dose in this trial will be 400mg/day. The maximum treatment duration
      will be 18 weeks, including a two-week Pre-Treatment Phase and a 12 weeks period on a stable
      dose of lacosamide or placebo.
