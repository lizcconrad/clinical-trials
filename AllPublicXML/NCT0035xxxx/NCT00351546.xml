  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes results when the body does not produce enough insulin and/or is unable to
      properly use the insulin it makes (insulin resistance). This study was undertaken to assess
      the effects of vildagliptin on insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes.
