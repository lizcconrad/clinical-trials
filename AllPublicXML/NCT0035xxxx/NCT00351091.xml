  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this pilot study is to estimate the percent change from baseline at
      Week 4, Month 6 in NTX bone turnover marker for a monthly 150mg dose of risedronate
      administered for 6 months and a loading dose regimen of risedronate over a 6 month treatment
      period both compared to a 5 mg daily dose of risedronate for 6 months

      The secondary objectives are :

        -  To estimate the percent change from baseline at specified visits other than Week 4,
           Month 6 in NTX for the monthly 150 mg dose of risedronate administered for 6 months and
           the loading dose regimen of risedronate over a 6 month treatment period both compared to
           the 5 mg daily dose of risedronate.

        -  To estimate the percent change from baseline at all specified visits in serum CTX and
           bone specific alkaline phosphatase for the monthly 150 mg dose of risedronate
           administered for 6 months and the loading dose regimen of risedronate over a 6 month
           treatment period both compared to the 5 mg daily of risedronate.

        -  To estimate the percent change from baseline at Month 6 in lumbar spine BMD for the
           monthly 150 mg dose of risedronate administered for 6 months and the loading dose
           regimen of risedronate over a 6 month treatment period both compared to the 5 mg daily
           dose of risedronate.

        -  To evaluate the safety of the risedronate 150 mg monthly and the loading dose regimen.
