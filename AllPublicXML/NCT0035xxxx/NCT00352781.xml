  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 2 million Ontarians are current smokers. While smoking rates have declined over
      the past 25 years, these rates have remained constant since 2002. The rate of smoking
      cessation in Ontario has not kept up with the rest of Canada. A new strategy is necessary to
      increase the number of smokers making quit attempts and to increase the odds of quitting over
      the long term.

      The overall goal of the Stop Smoking Therapy for Ontario Patients (STOP) Study is to evaluate
      the methods and effectiveness of providing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to Ontario
      smokers. The study will develop an evidence-based protocol for providing NRT, provide faculty
      development on combining pharmacotherapy with behavioural interventions and will provide an
      evaluation framework to inform future coverage models.

      The goal for this phase of the STOP study is to provide faculty development on combining
      pharmacotherapy with behavioural interventions. This will be achieved by partnering with
      Public Health Units across Ontario who have established smoking cessation clinics but do not
      have the finances in place to offer NRT to their clients at a subsidized rate or free of
      charge. Cost has been shown to be a significant barrier to the access and use of NRT in
      individuals trying to quit smoking. However, combining pharmacotherapy with behavioural
      interventions may be more effective than either alone. Therefore, we hypothesize that
      providing NRT free of charge to clients enrolled in a smoking cessation clinic will be more
      effective for smoking cessation than behavioural interventions alone.

      According to the US Surgeon General's Report (1988), there are immediate, intermediate and
      long-term benefits to health from quitting smoking. For example, there is a 50% reduction in
      coronary heart disease risk in 12 months and the risk of a stroke is reduced to that of a
      nonsmoker 5-15 years after quitting. (US Surgeon General's Report, 1990, p.vi).

      In a systematic assessment of the value of clinical preventive services recommended by the US
      Preventive Services Task Force, smoking cessation treatment for adults was one of the
      highest-ranked services in terms of its cost effectiveness and its potential to reduce the
      burden of disease. Most smoking cessation interventions cost less per year of life saved than
      most widely accepted medical practices. For example, cost-effectiveness analysis of the
      implementation of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) guidelines show costs
      of $4,113 per life-year saved, in 2001 prices compared to annual mammography for women aged
      40 to 49 years, which costs $71,751 in 2001 prices, and hypertension screening for men aged
      40 years, which costs $27,117 in 2001 prices. Therefore, smoking cessation services have been
      referred to as the &quot;gold standard&quot; for comparing the cost effectiveness of other healthcare
      interventions. Although some studies have shown high costs from increased healthcare
      utilization in the first year after quitting smoking due to illness (Martinson, 2003), most
      studies demonstrate that smokers who quit eventually have significantly lower healthcare
      utilization than continuing smokers (Fishman, 2003; Warner, 2003) Thus, for healthcare
      organizations such as the Ontario Health Insurance Plan, implementing smoking cessation
      services will likely result in a relatively quick return on investment.

      Both the intensity and duration of behavioural interventions are associated with sustained
      remission in smoking. The addition of pharmacotherapy doubles the odds of quitting
      successfully. However, many smokers face barriers in accessing pharmacotherapy. The provision
      of free pharmacotherapy has the potential to help a substantial number of smokers to quit. A
      study by Curry et al, 1998, evaluated smokers who were willing to sign up for a
      cessation-support program under various degrees of coverage for either the program or
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). 10% of Smokers with full coverage were likely to attempt
      to quit as opposed to 2.5% with partial coverage. Therefore, the United States Health &amp; Human
      Services guidelines call for the coverage of these medications.

      Research has shown that coverage for tobacco dependence treatments can enhance not only the
      rate of quit attempts but also long-term abstinence for smokers (Levy &amp; Friend, 2002;
      Schauffler, McMenamin, Olson, Boyce-Smith, Rideout, &amp; Kamil, 2001). On average, the odds
      ratio of quitting at one year was 1.6 for those given free NRT. Therefore, some insurers,
      both public and private, reimburse patients for stop smoking medications. However, a study by
      Boyle et al 2002, found that simply including the medication in an insurance plan did not
      increase quit rates or utilization of medications. Adequate precautions must be taken to
      ensure that free pharmacotherapy is distributed in conjunction with behavioural interventions
      to be successful and to be used by those smokers most likely to benefit from pharmacotherapy.

      Pharmacotherapy can be very expensive if provided to all smokers. However, not all smokers
      want to quit or require medications to quit (McDonald, 2003). Most smokers use about 2-3
      weeks of pharmacotherapy when not combined with behavioural interventions (Pierce, 2002).
      About 0.05% of smokers looking to quit will seek specialized care. Moreover, if we assume
      that 70% of current tobacco users (Approximately 1.6 million) in Ontario will try to quit in
      a given year and that 10% ( i.e. 169,000) of these individuals would qualify for and seek
      reimbursement for 10 weeks of therapy at $30/week, then the total estimated cost will be
      about $50 million! This is clearly not fundable and therefore a comprehensive strategy
      combined with some rational use of pharmacotherapy is necessary.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The provision of free NRT will increase quit attempts in Ontario smokers

        2. The provision of free NRT will increase long-term quit rates (&gt;/= 6 months) in Ontario
           smokers.

        3. Smokers who quit smoking using NRT will have reduced health care costs after the first
           year of treatment.
