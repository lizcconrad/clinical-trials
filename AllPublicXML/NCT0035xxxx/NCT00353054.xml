  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the effect of calcium/vitamin D supplementation (Caltrate
      600 +D®) on body weight loss during a weight-reducing program
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of a calcium supplementation on body weight loss is inconclusive and some studies
      have suggested that adequate calcium intake can have a favourable effect on some metabolic
      variables. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of (Caltrate 600 + D ®)
      on body composition and various indicators of metabolic health in overweight and obese
      females characterised by a usual low daily calcium intake, on a weight-reducing program.

      The main hypotheses of this study were:

        -  Caltrate 600 +D® increases body weight and fat mass losses of individuals on a
           weight-reducing program.

        -  Caltrate 600 +D® improves the metabolic profile of these subjects, independently of
           variations promoted by body fat loss.
