  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has been designed to comparatively evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      PAS-Port Proximal Anastomosis System and conventional suturing techniques for creation of the
      connection between graft veins and the aorta in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
      graft surgery for treatment of coronary artery disease. Patients in the study will have a
      coronary angiogram approximately 9 months following surgery to determine the patency of vein
      grafts created using either the automated PAS-Port or hand sewn methods. Safety will be
      evaluated by documenting the occurence of adverse clinical events and evealuating possible
      association with either method.

             examinations

          -  Age greater than or equal to 50 years and less than 85 years

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is hemodynamically stable

          -  Open chest reassessment of the revascularization strategy confirms that two vein
             bypass grafts are still intended

          -  Target vessel wall properties that are suitable for performing both a hand-sewn and a
             PAS-Port anastomosis

          -  Target vessel is greater than 1.8 mm in diameter at sites where anastomoses are
             planned

          -  Target vessel at sites where anastomoses will be placed are free from severe
             calcifications or severe atheromas

          -  The length of the vein graft(s) is adequate for both of the planned index graft
             revascularization strategies

          -  Vein outside diameter and double wall thickness are between 4 and 6 mm(inclusive) and
             less than or equal to 1.4 mm, respectively, at the graft site intended for the
             PAS-Port proximal anastomosis

          -  The vein(s) is of suitable quality to be used as a bypass graft conduit
