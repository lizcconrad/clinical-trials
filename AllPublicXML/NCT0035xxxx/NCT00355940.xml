  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to test a navigation system for guidance during insertion of stent
      graft in abdominal aortic aneurysms. The navigation system consists of software developed by
      SINTEF Health, a custom made catheter with a micro position sensor in the tip and an emitter
      than induces an electromagnetic field around the patient. Preoperative CT- and intraoperative
      DynaCT- data are reconstructed into 3 dimensional images. The 3 dimensional images are loaded
      into the navigation system. Then the magnetic field, in which the patient finds himself, is
      calibrated with the 3 dimensional images. When the catheter is inserted into the iliac artery
      and aorta, the position sensor (in the tip of the catheter) is displayed in real time at the
      exact anatomic location in the 3 dimensional image.

      Null hypothesis (H0):

        -  Insertion of stent graft is performed equally satisfactorily with fluoroscopy alone as
           with both fluoroscopy and new navigation technology

      Alternative hypothesis (H2):

        -  Insertion of stent graft is NOT performed equally satisfactorily with fluoroscopy alone
           as with both fluoroscopy and new navigation technology

    <description>Usage of technological methods and devices to improve intravascular navigation during endovascular aortic repair.
In this arm we first use an optical pointer to allocate the femoral artery ramification (point of incision) and the lower renal artery (upper confinement of stent graft). Later we use an electromagnetically tracked catheter to find and enter the opening in the main stent graft before placing the second limb. For both optical and electromagnetic tracking we use a custom made navigation system based on 3 dimensional CT images</description>
