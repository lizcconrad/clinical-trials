      This is a three year follow up of a previous study where researchers at UNSW and UNewc asked

  <detailed_description>

      Between 2001 and 2003, the School of Public Health and Community Medicine at the University
      of New South Wales carried out a large study with the Centre for Mental Health Studies at the
      University of Newcastle. The project asked people with serious mental health problems, who
      also smoked cigarettes, to participate in a 12-month study, which involved completing several
      questionnaires/other assessments over that time with a member of the research team. Around
      half of the participants in this study also received treatment for their smoking from the
      research team. This treatment involved weekly therapy with one member of the research team,
      and covered the relationship between smoking and mental illness, teaching people to cope with
      desires to smoke, how to recognise and avoid high risk situations for smoking, and how to
      plan alternative ways of coping with those situations where smoking usually occurred. In
      addition, nicotine patches were also available to assist people who made the decision to
      reduce their smoking. This study hoped to learn whether this new treatment could assist
      people experiencing mental illness reduce their tobacco smoking.

      After three years, previous participants were invited to participate in another follow-up
      assessment to check-in with their current situation, their mental health and levels of
      smoking.
