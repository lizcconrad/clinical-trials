      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of omega-3 fatty acids in the form of
      fish oil supplementation (approximately 2 grams per day) on the carotid intima-media
      (CIMT)progression (primary objective) and 2)(Secondary objective) lipid markers such as LDL,
      apo-B, and LDL buoyancy, on inflammatory burden as measured by CRP, on oxidative stress as
      measured by urinary isoprostanes, urine microalbumin/creatinine, and serum adiponectin a fat
      derived hormone in subjects with metabolic syndrome.

      This translational pilot study will have a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design.
      We will enroll one hundred subjects who meet at least 3 of the 5 criteria for metabolic
      syndrome as per NCEP guidelines/WHO guidelines and who do not have known cardiovascular
      disease or diabetes. They will receive either placebo or omega-3 fatty acids in the form of
      fish oil capsules for a two-year period. Assessment of, C-IMT, serum lipoprotein profile,
      LDL- buoyancy, adiponectin, CRP, SAA, apolipoprotein B and A-1, fasting glucose, fasting
      insulin levels, and plasma fatty acids will be measured at baseline, one year, and two years.
