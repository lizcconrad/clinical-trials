  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Researchers would like to see if a new test called SELDI (Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption
      Ionization) analysis can predict biopsy results better than PSA tests.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A blood sample of approximately 30 cc will be collected prior to the patients standard of
      care radical prostatectomy surgery. This blood will be used for the SELDI analysis. The
      remainder of the blood sample will be stored and may be used for the PSA test at a later
      date. The patient will have a final blood draw 3 months to 1 year following surgery.

          -  Men with clinically localized prostate cancer (total PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml and clinical T2b
             or less).

          -  Men with organ confined prostate cancer as determined by final pathologic diagnosis.

                  compounds, Proscar or any phytotherapies within the previous 6 months.

          -  Men with non-organ confined prostate cancer.

          -  Men with detectable serum PSA levels more than 1 months following radical
             prostatectomy.
