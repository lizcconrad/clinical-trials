  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK has submitted a registration file for its live attenuated oral human rotavirus (HRV)
      vaccine in several countries. In view of its registration in the Philippines, the present
      study will collect data on the safety of the vaccine in the local target population as per
      the Bureau of Food and Drugs Directive.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol was amended to reflect a change in the prescribing information. The age of the
      infants was changed from 6 - 14 weeks to at least 6 weeks at the time of the first
      vaccination. This protocol posting has been amended in order to comply with FDA AA.
