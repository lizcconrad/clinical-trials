      The objective of this study is to assess the performance of a noninvasive device for the
      early screening of Diabetes Mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 18 million people have Type II diabetes, and of these, an estimated thirty-five
      percent are unaware of their condition. This translates to roughly 6.3 million undiagnosed
      cases worldwide in 2002. Many diagnoses are made years after the onset of the disease. This
      allows progression of the vascular lesions that arise during the time of uncontrolled glucose
      levels. As a result, microvascular retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are on the rise,
      as well as macrovascular complications such as: coronary heart disease, and cerebral vascular
      accidents. The prevalence and trends of diabetes underscore the need for effective and
      widespread screening. Our fluorescence based system under development will noninvasively
      measure skin glycation end products that are known to be strongly correlated with diabetes
      status and complications. Since the test would be painless and require no patient fasting,
      significant obstacles to screening compliance would be mitigated. The system offers hope for
      a screening test that is more sensitive and specific than the invasive tests currently used
      for diabetes screening (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and the Fasting Plasma Glucose
      (FPG) test).
