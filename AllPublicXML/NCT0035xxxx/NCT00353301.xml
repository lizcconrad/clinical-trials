      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of the combination of erlotinib
      hydrochloride (Tarceva™) and sirolimus (Rapamune™) in the treatment of patients with
      metastatic kidney cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances metastatic renal cell carcinoma remains an incurable condition.
      Currently available treatment with high-dose interleukin-2 can lead to complete responses in
      a small minority of selected patients but is markedly toxic and not broadly available.
      FDA-approved multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib and sunitinib malate) often cause partial and
      transient tumor regression. There is no standard treatment metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      for patients whose disease progressed on multikinase inhibitors. The kinase mammalian target
      of rapamycin (mTOR) is overstimulated in a subset of renal cell carcinomas and other
      malignancies and can be blocked by sirolimus leading to growth arrest. Erlotinib
      hydrochloride is a drug that blocks the function of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR), often over expressed in kidney cancer. Sirolimus and EGFR inhibitors and been safely
      used in combination. In vitro experiments show that erlotinib enhances the sirolimus induced
      growth impairment in a panel of renal cell carcinoma cells. In the present study patients
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease progressed on multikinase inhibitors will
      be treated with the combination of erlotinib hydrochloride (Tarceva™) and sirolimus
      (Rapamune™). This is a single arm trial with no placebo or drug-based control arm

    <time_frame>Physical exam assessments were performed every 4 weeks during the treatment phase. Survival follow-up information was collected every 4 months following the termination visit until death, loss to follow-up, or study termination up to 275 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression was defined as the time from beginning of therapy until disease progression or death. For subjects who had not progressed at the time of statistical analysis, progression-free survival was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate median progression-free survival. Progression was defined as radiographic progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (year 2000 version), non-compliance in obtaining scans, unequivocal clinical progression or the initiation of another medication for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival</title>
        <description>Time to progression was defined as the time from beginning of therapy until disease progression or death. For subjects who had not progressed at the time of statistical analysis, progression-free survival was censored at the date of their last tumor assessment. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate median progression-free survival. Progression was defined as radiographic progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (year 2000 version), non-compliance in obtaining scans, unequivocal clinical progression or the initiation of another medication for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.</description>
        <time_frame>Physical exam assessments were performed every 4 weeks during the treatment phase. Survival follow-up information was collected every 4 months following the termination visit until death, loss to follow-up, or study termination up to 275 weeks.</time_frame>
