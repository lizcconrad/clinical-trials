  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well ispinesib works in treating patients with metastatic
      or unresectable kidney cancer. Ispinesib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of SB-715992 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer who have
      received at least one prior therapy. This will be achieved by a multi-center, single arm
      phase II study to evaluate the proportion of patients who achieve a complete or partial
      response with this agent.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival. II. To assess the time to progression. III. To evaluate
      the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive ispinesib (SB-715992) IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

          -  Prohibited medications; SB-715992 is a moderate to significant in vitro inhibitor of
             CYP3A4; the following lists of medications/substances are moderate to significant
             inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 that, if administered concomitantly with SB-715992, may
             alter study drug exposure; the use of these medications/ substances within 14 days (=&lt;
             6 months for amiodarone) prior to the administration of the first dose of SB-715992
             through discontinuation from the study is prohibited
