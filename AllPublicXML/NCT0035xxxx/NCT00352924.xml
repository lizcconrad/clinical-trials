      The &quot;Agricultural Health Study&quot; (AHS) is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer
      Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The U.S. Environmental
      Protection Agency and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are providing
      support for a limited exposure assessment effort.

      Initial data collection on a prospective cohort of 89,658 study subjects has been completed
      as of December 1997. Participants completed questionnaires that included items on pesticides
      used, other agricultural exposures, and work practices that modify exposure as well as on
      other activities that may affect either exposure or disease risks (e.g., diet, exercise,
      alcohol consumption, medical conditions, family history of cancer, other occupations and
      smoking history). Phase II of the study (1998-2003) updated information on occupational
      exposures, diet, work practices and medical history by means of a computer assisted telephone
      interview. We also collected buccal cells on sample of 34,000 study participants to assess
      the effect of inheritable polymorphisms and the interaction of environment and genomic
      predisposition.

      The stimulus for this prospective investigation comes from the growing evidence that, despite
      a low mortality overall, farmers experience an excess of several cancers. These excesses have
      been observed in retrospective epidemiological studies among agricultural workers in several
      countries. Excess cancers are observed for the lymphatic and hematopoietic system, connective
      tissue, skin, brain, prostate, stomach and lips. Several of these tumors (brain, NHL,
      multiple myeloma, and prostate) are also increasing in the general population in many of
      these countries. This suggests a common set of exposures may explain the high rates in
      farmers and rising rates in the general population.

      Farmers, their families, and other pest control workers may have contact with a variety of
      potentially hazardous substances including pesticides, solvents, fuels and oils, engine
      exhaust, dust and zoonotic viruses and other microbes. Our cohort study includes all
      registered pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina and the spouse of applicators who
      are farmers. The health effects of pesticide use are the primary focus of the study. The
      influence of other farm exposures are also being evaluated.

      The focus of the phase II follow-up period (2004-2008) is to update exposure information and
      health histories by means of a computer assisted interview and also following the cohort to
      determine disease incidence and mortality. The cohort is being followed through the cancer
      registries within Iowa and North Carolina, the Social Security Administration database, state
      vital statistics offices, National Death Index, and various in-state databases, such as the
      listing of registered pesticide applicators. Individuals who enrolled into the study but who
      are no longer at the address given during enrollment (based on subsequent attempts at follow
      up) have been submitted and will continue to be submitted (through NIOSH) in the standard
      format to the IRS under their Project 057 Taxpayer Address Request Program. Identifying data
      provided to the IRS include only SSN and the first four letters of last name of cohort
      member. IRS provides in return the most current address in IRS records if a match (SSN + all
      four letter of last name) is found. The purpose of this effort is to identify members of the
      cohort who have moved out of state, to enable adjustment of person-years for incidence and
      mortality calculations. Persons who have moved out of state can be followed for vital status
      and cause of death, but not for cancer incidence.

      Continuation of the protocol will provide a valuable epidemiologic resource to help prevent
      cancers in the future by identifying risk factors in the rural/agricultural environment.
      Because more cases of important cancer outcomes occur in this cohort every year, potential
      cancer causes can be evaluated with increased statistical power. Larger number of cases also
      allows for statistical control of confounding factors, making more meaningful conclusions
      about cancer risk, and, for some relatively infrequent cancers, such as the lyphomas and
      leukemias, greater follow-up time is necessary to make any meaningful observations.

      The &quot;Agricultural Health Study&quot; (AHS) is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer
      Institute and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The US Environmental
      Protection Agency and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are providing
      support for a limited exposure assessment effort.

      Initial data collection on a prospective cohort of 89,656 study subjects has been completed
      as of December 1997 (Phase I). Participants completed questionnaires that included items on
      pesticides used, other agricultural exposures, and work practices that modify exposure as
      well as on other activities that may affect either exposure or disease risks (e.g., diet,
      exercise, alcohol consumption, medical conditions, family history of cancer, other
      occupations and smoking history). Phase II of the study (1998-2003) updated information on
      occupational exposures, diet, work practices and medical history by means of a computer
      assisted telephone interview. We also collected buccal cells on a sample of 35,164 study
      participants to assess the effect of inheritable polymorphisms and the interaction of
      environment and genomic predisposition.

      The stimulus for this prospective investigation comes from the growing evidence that, despite
      a low mortality overall, farmers experience an excess of several cancers. These excesses have

      are farmers. The health effects of pesticide use are the primary focus of the study. The
      influence of other farm exposures is also being evaluated.

      Phase III data collection activity was completed in February 2010. The focus of the phase III
      follow-up period (2004- 2010) was to update exposure information and health histories by
      means of a computer assisted interview, to follow the cohort to determine disease incidence
      and mortality, and to collect buccal cell samples from newly-developing cancer cases (and
      matched controls) who have not previously donated a sample. Phase III follow-up interviews
      were completed with 44,130 participants; specifically, interviews were completed with 24,171
      applicators and 19,959 spouses. Additionally, 1,245 buccal samples were collected in Phase
      III from among selected participants with incident cancers. No adverse events were reported
      during Phase III.

      The cohort continues to be followed through the cancer registries within Iowa and North
      Carolina, the Social Security Administration database, state vital statistics offices,
      National Death Index, and various in-state databases, such as the listing of registered
      pesticide applicators. Individuals who enrolled into the study but who are no longer at the
      address given during enrollment (based on subsequent attempts at followup) have been
      submitted and will continue to be submitted (through NIOSH) in the standard format to the IRS
      under their Project 057 Taxpayer Address Request Program. Identifying data provided to the
      IRS include only SSN and the first four letters of the last name of the cohort member. IRS
      provides in return the most current address in IRS records if a match (SSN + all four letters
      of last name) is found. The purpose of this effort is to identify members of the cohort who
      have moved out of state, to enable adjustment of person-years for incidence and mortality
      calculations. Persons who have moved out of state can be followed for vital status and cause
      of death, but not for cancer incidence.

      Additionally, the Iowa field station maintains a database of AHS cohort children in Iowa
      established through linkage of the cohort to Iowa birth certificates. This composite of
      children identified from the Iowa cohort data and birth certificates through 2008 (over
      35,000 live births), is linked to Iowa drivers license tapes, the Iowa cancer incidence
      database, the Iowa mortality database, the NDI, and the Internal Revenue Service (to obtain
      updated addresses). As with the adult linkages, these data are held by the AHS coordinating
      center and are available for secondary analysis.

      Continuation of the protocol will provide a valuable epidemiologic resource to help prevent
      cancers in the future by identifying risk factors in the rural/agricultural environment.
      Because more cases of important cancer outcomes occur in this cohort every year, potential
      cancer causes can be evaluated with increased statistical power. Larger numbers of cases also
      allow for statistical control of confounding factors and more meaningful conclusions about
      cancer risk, and, for some relatively infrequent cancers, such as the lyphomas and leukemias,
      greater follow-up time is necessary to make any meaninful observations.

      The process of planning for Phase IV has begun and it is expected to begin before the close
      of FY2011.

        A prospective cohort of 89,655 registered pesticide applicators and spouses (57,310
        applicators and 32,346 spouses of private applicators) with sufficient personal identifiers
        to conduct follow up activities has been assembled during the first four years of
        recruitment in the Agricultural Health Study, 1993-1997. The majority of@@@applicators were
        asked to enroll in the AHS as they obtained or renewed their pesticide
        registration/licenses through the agricultural extension services of the states of North
        Carolina and Iowa. In the last year of enrollment, applicators who received or renewed
        their pesticide licenses, but were never given the opportunity to enroll due to@@@added
        requirements in the testing/training class, were called and asked to complete the
        enrollment questionnaire over the phone. Spouses of the private applicators were also given
        the opportunity to enroll via the telephone.
