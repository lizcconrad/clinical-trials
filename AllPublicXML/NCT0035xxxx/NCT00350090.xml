  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PROCRIT (Epoetin
      alfa) administered at 40,000 Units weekly in cancer patients that are not receiving
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

      This is an open-label (both the researcher and the patient in the study know the treatment
      that is being given), non-randomized, multi-center pilot study with the objective to
      investigate the efficacy of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) with regard to hematopoietic response when
      administered at 40,000 Units subcutaneously (under the skin) once per week in anemic patients
      with cancer not receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Hematological laboratory tests
      (hemoglobin and hematocrit), vital signs (blood pressure) and occurrence and severity of
      adverse events will be assessed throughout the study. Patients will receive a PROCRIT
      (Epoetin alfa) injection (40,000 Units per injection) under the skin once every week for a
      maximum of 13 weeks. Doses may be reduced depending on the patients' hemoglobin level.
