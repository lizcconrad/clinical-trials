  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about Gaucher disease. The information we collect
      from medical histories and a blood sample from people with Gaucher disease may help us
      pinpoint certain things that are different between people who have Gaucher disease and people
      who do not have Gaucher disease. This information may be useful in the future to help find
      new treatments for Gaucher disease.

      This study is designed to evaluate the ex vivo response to pharmacological chaperone therapy
      by testing blood samples from previously treated and untreated patients with Gaucher disease.
      The study will include patients with non-neuropathic Gaucher disease (type I) and neuropathic
      Gaucher disease (types II and/or III).

      All subjects will participate in one study visit. Clinical information will be collected
      retrospectively from medical records. Information collected will include Gaucher disease
      diagnosis and history, medical history, family history, assessments of clinical severity, and
      genotype. A blood sample will be collected and various cells will be isolated for laboratory
      testing and research.
