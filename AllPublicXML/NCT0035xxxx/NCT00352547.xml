  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of certain genes (MDR-1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5) on
      metabolism of the drug sirolimus, an immune-suppressing drug given to transplant recipients
      to prevent organ rejection. Individual differences in metabolism and excretion of sirolimus
      affect the patient's response to treatment.

      Patients who have undergone kidney transplantation at the National Institute of Diabetes and
      Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Transplant Branch and have received sirolimus treatment
      will be enrolled in this study.

      DNA (genetic material) will be extracted from blood samples collected from transplant
      recipients to determine their MDR-1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 genotypes. Patient demographic
      information and data on sirolimus metabolism and excretion will be collected from the medical
      information system, NIDDK transplant database, and the patients' medical records. The data
      will be compared among patients with different genotypes (genetic constitution of an
      individual) and haplotypes (set of genes that code for different proteins but are inherited
      as a unit) to determine the effect of these gene variations on sirolimus metabolism.

      Information from this study may be applied to developing better dosing strategies, and thus,
      treatment outcomes for transplant patients receiving sirolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immunosuppressant sirolimus is a substrate for the drug efflux pump p-glycoprotein

      (Pgp) and the hepatic and intestinal drug metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4/5

      (CYP3A4/5). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multi-drug resistance (MDR)-1

      gene which encodes for the Pgp, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 genes have been shown to be associated
      with altered metabolism of various drugs including the immunosuppressants cyclosporine and
      tacrolimus. This protocol will evaluate the effects of MDR-1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5
      gentotypes/haplotypes on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sirolimus in patients
      with renal transplantation. All patients who had kidney transplantation at the National
      Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Transplant Branch,
      participated in one of the NIDDK therapeutic protocols, and have received sirolimus will be
      enrolled in this study. Selected MDR-1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 SNPs will be determined by
      polymerase chain reaction based methods using existing patient blood samples. Demographic,
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data will be collected from the medical information
      system, NIDDK transplant database, and medical records of these patients. Population
      pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic measurements will then be compared among
      patients with different MDR-1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 genotypes/haplotypes. Results from this
      study will help to understand the effects of pharmacogenetics on sirolimus pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacodynamics, and will provide information for rationalizing sirolimus dosing in
      patients with renal transplantation.
