      B8: Atrial fibrillation and the risk of neurological complications

      Twenty-five thousand acute strokes are caused by atrial fibrillation every year. But even
      more frequent than symptomatic strokes are silent infarctions of the brain. Silent strokes
      remain undetected in most cases, but cumulate over time and progressively impair cognition.
      The impact of atrial fibrillation on subacute brain infarctions is not yet known. Moreover,
      it has not been elucidated so far how effective different therapeutic strategies in the
      treatment of atrial fibrillation prevent cognitive impairment. Thus, this study aims at
      evaluating the influence of different types of atrial fibrillation on silent strokes and the
      related impairment in cognitive functions. Other risk factors and cardiovascular diseases
      that are known to provoke the development of strokes will be assessed as well. So, it will be
      possible to isolate the contribution of atrial fibrillation to silent strokes and related
      cognitive impairment in segregation to other relevant factors. AF patients and controls will
      be examined twice in two years in order to evaluate the role of atrial fibrillation and
      differential therapeutic interventions with regard to the progression of silent strokes and
      cognitive impairment in a within subject-design.
