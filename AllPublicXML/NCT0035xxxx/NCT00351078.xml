  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the disease is caused by a nonsense mutation
      (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
      (CFTR) protein. PTC124 has been shown to partially restore CFTR production in animals with CF
      due to a nonsense mutation. In an ongoing Phase 2a study being performed at the Hadassah
      University Hospital - Mount Scopus in Israel, patients with nonsense-mutation-mediated CF
      have received PTC124 in two 14-day treatment courses. Preliminary results from that study
      indicate that PTC124 has pharmacodynamic activity of PTC124 in CF and that PTC124 can be
      safely administered in this patient population. This Phase 2b extension study is designed to
      evaluate the activity and safety of 3 months (approximately 84 days) of continuous treatment
      with PTC124 in the same patients who were enrolled to the Phase 2a study. The main purpose of
      this study is to understand whether PTC124 can be safely administered and achieve
      pharmacodynamic activity in patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation.

      In this study, the same patients who were enrolled in a previous study of PTC124 (protocol
      number PTC124-GD-005-CF) will be treated with the investigational drug PTC124 for a period of
      84 days. Evaluation procedures (history, physical examination, blood and urine tests to
      assess organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and CF-specific tests) to
      determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within 21 days prior to the
      start of treatment. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study will be assigned to
      receive PTC124 treatment (based upon TEPD results from the previous study) at 1 of the 2
      following dose levels:

        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 4 mg/kg at breakfast, 4 mg/kg at
           lunch, and 8 mg/kg at dinner, or

        -  PTC124, given 3 times per day (TID) with a regimen of 10 mg/kg at breakfast, 10 mg/kg at
           lunch and 20 mg/kg at dinner.

      During the study, PTC124 efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated
      periodically with measurement of transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), medical
      history, physical examinations, blood tests, urinalysis, sputum tests, ECGs, chest x-ray, and
      pulmonary function tests.
