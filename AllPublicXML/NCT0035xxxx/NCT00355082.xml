  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Treatment phase, where efficacy is determined and a Continuation
      phase for extended safety information. The Continuation phase is open to all Treatment phase
      participants and those who did not qualify for treatment because of an insufficient number of
      seizures during the Baseline phase.

             prior to the Baseline Phase

          -  Have a documented history of partial seizures such that the investigator must judge
             that the subject is likely to have at least 4 partial seizures during the 8-week
             Baseline Phase.

          -  Have experienced at least 4 partial seizures (i.e., simple or complex partial seizures
             with or without secondary generalization) during an 8-week (i.e., 56 days) prospective
             Baseline Phase with at least one partial seizure occurring during each 4-week (i.e.,
             28-day) period.

          -  NOTE: With prior authorization from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), retrospective data may take
             the place of up to the first 4 weeks (i.e., first 28 days) of the Baseline Phase for
             subjects providing reliable documentation of the following:

               1. A complete daily seizure diary that includes the number, and type (i.e., simple
                  or complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization), of
                  seizures experienced each day for up to 28 consecutive days immediately prior to
                  the prospective Baseline Phase

               2. Stability of prescribed dosages of background antiepileptic drug (AED)

               3. Compliance with background AED

        All subjects permitted to use retrospective baseline data must complete a minimum of four
        weeks (i.e., 28 days) of the prospective Baseline Phase. The retrospective plus the
        prospective Baseline Phases must equal the 56 consecutive days prior to the start of dosing
        with study drug.

          -  be currently receiving AED monotherapy treatment with a stable regimen of a non-enzyme
             inducing AED for at least four weeks prior to starting the Baseline Phase.

          -  be able and willing to maintain an accurate, complete, written daily seizure diary, or
             has a parent/caregiver who is able and willing to maintain and accurate, complete,

             to include one of the following:

               1. Complete abstinence from intercourse for two weeks before exposure to the study
                  drug, throughout the clinical trial, and for a period after the trial to account
                  for elimination of the drug (a minimum of 2 weeks).

               2. Consistent and correct use of one of the following methods of birth control:

        Male partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study and is the
        sole sexual partner for that female subject.

        Any intrauterine device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year

        Double barrier method consisting of spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g., spermicide

        NOTE: Women who have had a hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or are post-menopausal are
        considered to be of non-childbearing potential.

        NOTE: A pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed between lamotrigine (LTG) and
        estrogen-based oral contraceptives. Therefore, the use of hormonal therapy (e.g., for
        contraception or hormone replacement therapy) is not allowed.

      <recruitment_details>All participants in the Treatment phase and all Baseline Failure participants are eligible to enter the Continuation phase. The Continuation phase is for long-term safety exposure to lamotrigine extended release (LTG XR) at 300 mg/day; it is not a cross-over phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The number of participants (par.) starting the Continuation phase (CP) does not equal the number completing the Treatment phase (TP), as 1) the CP was optional, 2) not everyone from the TP was eligible to enter the CP, and 3) par. who failed to qualify for the TP (Baseline Failures) were allowed to enter the CP.
