      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study will be conducted in
      patients with Grade 1 or Grade 2 ankle sprains or strains. Eligible patients will be
      randomized (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive double-blind treatment with either the KTP or a
      matching placebo patch to be applied once daily for 14 days. Patients will return to the
      clinic for assessments on Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14; a follow-up assessment will be conducted
      by telephone on Day 28. At each visit through Day 14, patients will rate their average pain
      intensity during daily activities and while at rest using an 11-point scale, and will rate
      their functional disability. Patients will also complete an electronic diary in which pain
      intensity and pain relief ratings will be recorded three times daily. Ratings of the quality
      of sleep will be recorded in the diary each morning, and the use of study treatment and
      rescue medication will be recorded in the diary each day. Ibuprofen will be provided as
      rescue medication
