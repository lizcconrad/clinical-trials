  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess in children the efficacy and safety of 2 dosing regimens of T1225 1.5% eye drops,
      in comparison to a reference product, single-dose oral azithromycin (AZM) 20 mg/kg, for the
      treatment of active trachoma. Evaluation of clinical efficacy was primary (% of clinical cure
      at Day 60 in Per Protocol Set), microbiological evaluation was secondary

      The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of the dosing regimen which was
      demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies to be the best candidate for trachoma treatment
      (T1225 1.5% eye drops BID for 3 days) with a shorter duration of treatment (T1225 1.5% eye
      drops BID for 2 days) and with a single oral administration of AZM (20 mg/kg) in patients
      suffering from active trachoma. The study was to be performed in approximately 600 children
      (aged 1 to 10 years) from Guinea Conakry and Pakistan.
