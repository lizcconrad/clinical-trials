    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if taking interferon or gemcitabine along with sorafenib
      will stop the advanced renal cell cancer from becoming worse in some people. To do this,
      sorafenib along with gemcitabine or interferon will be compared to treatment with gemcitabine
      or interferon alone. More safety information on sorafenib will be also collected. About 260
      patients with progressed renal cell cancer will be in this study.
