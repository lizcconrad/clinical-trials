      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the blood pressure lowering effects of a
      valsartan/amlodipine combination treatment and amlodipine monotherapy for the treatment of
      stage II hypertensive patients (MSSBP ≥ 160 mmHg).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Moderate to severe high blood pressure. This is defined as a systolic pressure (the
             top number) greater than or equal to 160 mmHg and less than 200 mmHg.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to ARBs, CCBs, thiazide diuretics

          -  Inability to stop all prior blood pressure medications safely

          -  Systolic BP ≥ 200 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg

          -  Controlled blood pressure (systolic BP &lt; 140 mmHg) taking more than 3 antihypertensive
             medications at screening

          -  Systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg and &lt; 180 mmHg taking more than two antihypertensive
             medications at screening

          -  Systolic BP ≥ 180 mmHg taking more than one antihypertensive medication at screening

          -  History of stroke, angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, heart attack or
             unstable angina
