  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of
      three concentrations of GW786034 ointment following treatment to small areas of stable
      psoriatic plaques. Dosing will proceed using a microplaque approach, where small volumes of
      ointment will be applied under full occlusion to representative psoriatic plaques. The
      effectiveness of topical GW786034 treatments and controls will be explored using visual
      intensity assessments in addition to dermal imaging and histological surrogates of disease
      activity.
