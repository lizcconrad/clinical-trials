  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive bleeding is common after cardiac surgery. This may result in patients receiving a
      blood transfusion or suffering the life-threatening complication of cardiac tamponade.
      Tamponade is when excessive bleeding compresses the heart and prevents it from pumping
      properly. A major reason for the bleeding is the damage done to platelets by the
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. Often patients receive platelets and plasma from blood
      donors to try to reduce the bleeding post-operatively. The investigators plan to take
      platelets and plasma from patients before they are damaged. They would then return these
      'undamaged' sequestered platelets to the patients after the bypass machine is no longer
      needed. Therefore, the investigators' primary question is whether platelet sequestration
      would reduce the bleeding problems that occur following cardiac surgery. They will evaluate
      bleeding problems using thromboelastography, which provides a comprehensive assessment of
      both how blood clots form and their strength. If sequestration reduces bleeding problems
      following cardiac surgery then it may reduce the chance of patients receiving blood products
      from donors. Although donated blood is thoroughly tested, its use does expose patients to the
      risk of transfusion errors, blood borne infections and reactions. Avoiding its use would be
      very desirable.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy or requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB) often develop a coagulopathy at the end of surgery. We propose sequestering plasma and
      platelets from these patients prior to CPB and thus prior to the dilution and platelet damage
      that occurs with CPB. We hypothesise that if these plasma and platelets are stored properly
      during CPB, and administered at the end of the operation, they will reduce any coagulopathy
      and the associated bleeding.

      Study population:

      Patients undergoing repeat median sternotomy, mitral valve repair, double valve operations,
      aortic surgery, or combined valve and coronary artery surgery.

      Exclusion criteria will include those with anaemia, thrombocytopenia, unstable angina,
      anti-platelet therapy within the previous seven days, known or symptomatic cerebrovascular
      disease, known disorders of haemostasis, aprotinin sensitivity and pregnancy.

      Intervention:

      Patients will be randomised by a closed envelope technique to receive platelet/plasma
      sequestration or not. Patients randomised to undergo sequestration will have 14 mL/Kg blood
      taken. The blood will be separated into red cells and platelets/plasma. Anaemia would be
      prevented by returning the processed red blood cells to the patient. We will store platelets
      at 20-24Â°C/room temperature on a platelet rocker according to guidelines from the National
      Blood Service.

      Assessment of coagulation:

      Patients' coagulation status will be evaluated before and after surgery. Four methods will be
      employed to comprehensively assess the coagulation system: platelet counts and conventional
      clotting studies; heparin levels; thromboelastography; and platelet function analyser.
