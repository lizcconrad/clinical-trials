  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of three different doses of topically applied telbermin in subjects ≥ 18 years
      old with diabetic foot ulcers. Approximately 160 adult subjects with Type 1 or Type 2
      diabetes mellitus will be enrolled at approximately 40 investigational sites in the United
      States and Canada.

             eligible for randomization.

          -  Eye examination (indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, or fluorescein

          -  Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (equivalent to &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone) or
             immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents within 14 days prior to the first study

             participation

          -  Previous or current radiation therapy to the distal lower extremity or likelihood to
             receive this therapy during study participation

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Presence of more than two full-thickness ulcers on the study foot

          -  End-stage renal failure necessitating chronic hemodialysis or chronic ambulatory
             peritoneal dialysis

          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 years (in the opinion of the investigator)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any ingredients of telbermin, placebo, or vehicle, including
             excipients in the formulation of telbermin or placebo gel

          -  Known prior inability to complete required study visits during study participation

          -  A psychiatric condition (e.g., suicidal ideation) or chronic alcohol or drug abuse
             problem, determined from the subject's medical history, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may pose a threat to subject compliance

          -  Use of a platelet-derived growth factor within the 28 days prior to screening

          -  Use of any investigational drug or therapy within the 28 days prior to screening
