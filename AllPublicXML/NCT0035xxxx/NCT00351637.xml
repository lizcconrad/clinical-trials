  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to determine the feasibility of the dose titration and
      assessment protocol in the impatient population, in the clinical setting of preventing or
      managing breakthrough pain, before conducting an appropriately powered phase III study. Thus
      the primary purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of patients who are
      successfully titrated to an effective dose of sublingual methadone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pain due to cancer or its treatment; Controlled baseline pain; episodes of
             predictable, treatment related pain every day that are 4&quot;/10&quot; in severity or greater,
             last 10 minutes or longer, or episodes of breakthrough pain not related to cancer
             treatment, and are responsive to short acting oral opioids such as morphine or
             hydromorphone; are able to hold a volume of 1.0cc of water under tongue for a 2-minute
             period; are able to provide written informed consent; are able to fill out the study
             forms, and are inpatients

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe underlying respiratory disease such that the investigator is wary about the
             risk of respiratory failure from modest doses od opioid; prior sensitivity to
             methadone; currently are being administered methadone; are clinically unstable or have
             a life expectancy of less than one month making completion of the trial unlikely; and
             if they do not understand English sufficiently to provide written informed consent.
