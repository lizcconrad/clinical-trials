      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of belinostat when given
      together with azacitidine in treating patients with advanced hematologic cancers or other
      diseases. Belinostat may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving belinostat together with
      azacitidine may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PXD101 (belinostat) when given in combination with
      azacitidine (when azacitidine is utilized at a dose range where its effects on cellular
      differentiation are known to be predominant) in patients with advanced hematologic cancers or
      other diseases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify any additive or synergistic effects of this regimen on pharmacodynamic
      parameters, including apoptosis and re-expression of specific target genes.

      II. Assess any evidence of clinical activity (complete remission, partial remission,
      hematologic improvement, stable disease) of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of belinostat followed by a randomized study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) and belinostat intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of belinostat until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined,
      additional patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (with
      trilineage dysplasia or arising from MDS) are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive azacitidine SC on days 1-5.

      Arm II: Patients receive azacitidine as in arm I and belinostat at the MTD IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1-5.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After receiving one course, patients randomized to arm I may crossover
      to receive treatment on arm II.

      For patients enrolled in the randomized portion of the study, bone marrow aspirates are
      obtained at baseline, and after course 1 for correlative studies. Samples are examined by
      gene expression analysis of p15 and p21, DNA methylation of p15INK4B, and apoptosis by RT-PCR
      and flow cytometry. Pharmacodynamic assays are also performed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.
