  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Eleanor Drey in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences UCSF
      is conducting a study to examine the personal and economic impact of continuous use of ORTHO
      EVRA, the contraceptive patch, on menstrual related symptoms for women who report having
      severe menstrual related symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 adult women, 18-40 years of age, will be recruited to participate in a six month study.
      The focus of recruitment will be on women with menstrual-related symptoms who are currently
      working in physically demanding, low autonomous service jobs.

      The approximate first two months of women's participation will be spent documenting baseline
      information about their health and well-being, work patterns and performance, and the
      economic impact of their menstruation. Subjects will then initiate two, two month intervals
      of continuous use of ORTHO EVRA.

      Over this four month treatment period, subjects will document their health and well-being,
      work patterns and performance, and the economic impact of their menstruation while being
      treated with ORTHO EVRA. This will allow us to compare subjects' experiences pre- and
      post-treatment. The study's instruments will focus on eliciting information on the personal
      and economic costs of menstruation such as measuring time missed from work, changes in
      productivity and work satisfaction, and impact on quality of life.
