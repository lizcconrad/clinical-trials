  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4 randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, single-center, double-blind
      study to evaluate the effects of mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFNS) in subjects with
      Sleep-disordered Breathing (SDB) associated with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR) using Peak
      Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF), Embletta device home-monitored cardiopulmonary evaluations,
      and rhinitis evaluations and questionnaires. Approximately 30 subjects 18 to 60 years of age
      with symptomatic PAR (with or without SAR) will be selected and randomized at one study site.
      The anticipated duration of subject participation in the study is approximately 39 days.
      Subjects who qualify at the Screening Visit will complete a 10-14 day run-in/screening
      period. Following the run-in period, subjects who meet the qualifications at the Baseline
      Visit will be treated with study medication for 4 weeks.

        <title>Apnea-Hypopnea Index</title>
        <description>Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), used to assess severity of sleep apnea based on total number of complete cessations (apnea) and partial obstructions (hypopnea) of breathing occurring per hour of sleep. Determined by the frequency of occurrence of apnea-hypopnea episodes measured during sleep at home by an Embletta device.</description>

            <title>Mometasone Furoate Nasal Spray</title>
            <description>100 mg of suspension provided 50 mg of mometasone furoate monohydrate. Subjects were instructed to administer 2 sprays into each nostril every morning. The total dosage of 4 sprays (2 per nostril) thus provided 200 mg daily to subjects receiving active drug. Treatment was to be administered for a nominal period of 28 days, to a maximum of 32 days.</description>
