      Title: SWiss multicenter Intracoronary Stem cells Study in Acute Myocardial Infarction
      (SWISS-AMI).

      Study population: Patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with primary PCI.

      Objective: To determine whether intracoronary infusion of BMCs improves recovery of left
      ventricular function after acute myocardial infarction treated by PCI

      Design: Multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial with central core lab analysis
      for MRI.

      Therapy: Intracoronary infusion of BMCs in the infarct related artery at 5-7 days or 3-4
      weeks after successful primary PCI

      Primary Endpoint: Change in global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at 4 months
      relative to baseline measured by quantitative MRI.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Change in LVEF at MRI at 12 months

        -  Change in regional left ventricular wall motion and thickness at 4 and 12 months.

        -  Change in infarct size at 4 and 12 months as assessed by &quot;delayed enhancement&quot; technique
           by MRI

        -  Analysis of the myocardial infarct size and transmurality, time to PCI and coronary flow
           characteristics after PCI as predictor of LV remodeling and change after cell therapy

        -  Change in myocardial perfusion at 4 and 12 months

        -  Change in serum level of amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP)

        -  Major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction, TVR (ACBP or PCI,
           stroke, hospitalization for cardiac reasons) at 12 months

      Interventions:

        -  Aspiration of 50 ml bone marrow (&lt;24 hours) prior to administration

        -  Intracoronary balloon-based infusion of 10 ml BMCs

        -  Cardiac MRI at baseline (resp. at hospital discharge), at 4 and 12 months

      Therapy groups: Bone marrow-derived stem cells infusion in the successfully revascularized
      infarct related vessel at day 5-7 or day 21-28.

      Control group: Management according to the &quot;state of the art&quot; medical therapy after
      successful primary PCI.

      Safety: A study independent &quot;safety committee&quot; will analyze the clinical results after the
      first 60 patients.
