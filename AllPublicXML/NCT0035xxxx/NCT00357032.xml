  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well PXD101 works in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory acute myeloid leukemia or older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid
      leukemia. PXD101 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia treated with PXD101.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the overall survival of these patients. II. Evaluate the duration of response in
      these patients. III. Evaluate the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate molecular response to PXD101.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive PXD101 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      6-12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and bone marrow samples are obtained before and after study treatment for laboratory
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.

    <description>Clinical responses were measured according to International Working Group criteria. Bone marrow studies were repeated at a minimum of every three cycles. Per International Working Group criteria: Complete Response (CR): Repeat bone marrow show &lt;5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood evaluations lasting &gt;=2 months of hemoglobin(&gt;110 g/L), neutrophils(&gt;=1.5x10^9/L), platelets(&gt;=100x10^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia</description>

    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>

    <description>From time of documented treatment response (CR or PR) until progression of death. Complete Response (CR): Repeat bone marrow show &lt;5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood evaluations lasting &gt;=2 months of hemoglobin(&gt;110 g/L), neutrophils(&gt;=1.5x10^9/L), platelets(&gt;=100x10^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia. Partial Resonse (PR): requires the same hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to a post-treatment value of 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. (If the pre-treatment blast percentage was 50-100%, this must decrease to a value between 5-25%. If the pre-treatment blast percentage was 20-49%, this must decrease by at least half to a value greater than 5%.) A value ≤ 5% is also considered a PR if Auer rods are present.</description>

        <description>From time of documented treatment response (CR or PR) until progression of death. Complete Response (CR): Repeat bone marrow show &lt;5% myeloblasts, and peripheral blood evaluations lasting &gt;=2 months of hemoglobin(&gt;110 g/L), neutrophils(&gt;=1.5x10^9/L), platelets(&gt;=100x10^9/L), blasts (0%) and no dysplasia. Partial Resonse (PR): requires the same hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of at least 50% in the percentage of blasts to a post-treatment value of 5% to 25% in the bone marrow aspirate. (If the pre-treatment blast percentage was 50-100%, this must decrease to a value between 5-25%. If the pre-treatment blast percentage was 20-49%, this must decrease by at least half to a value greater than 5%.) A value ≤ 5% is also considered a PR if Auer rods are present.</description>
