      This study will be conducted to collect cases treated by self-injection of sumatriptan 3mg
      kit product for the treatment of migraine or cluster headache attacks in clinical settings,
      to demonstrate the efficacy, and to examine patient acceptability (simplicity and usefulness)
      and rate of successful self-injection.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Headache Relief at 60 Minutes Post Dose(Migraine) or 30 Minutes Post Dose(Cluster Headache)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes or 60 Minutes after each administration</time_frame>
    <description>Headache relief rate was the percentage of participants who showed effectiveness 60 minutes post dose (migraine) or 30 minutes post dose (cluster headache). Data for participants with percentage effectiveness along with 95% confidence interval has been presented.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Subject-rated Acceptability of the Sumatriptan 3mg Kit Product</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subject-rated acceptability of sumatriptan succinate injection 3 mg kit product had three questions, question 1 was &quot;Was the kit product easy to use?&quot;, question 2 was &quot;Do you want to use the kit product in the future?&quot; and question 3 was &quot;Do you consider that the kit product is necessary for the treatment of your illness?&quot;. The responses were given as yes or no. Data for number of participants who responded to the three questions as yes or no has been presented.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Investigator/Sub Investigator-rated Successful Self-injection Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator/sub investigator-rated successful self-injection rate was the percentage of participants who were able to use the kit as directed by the investigator/ sub investigator. The response was given as yes or no. Data for percentage of participants who were actually able to use the kit as directed has been presented.</description>
