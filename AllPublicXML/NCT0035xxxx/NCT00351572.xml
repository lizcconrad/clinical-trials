  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a new diagnostic test called the Cell Search Assay can
      detect circulating colon cancer cells in patients who have had surgery for colon cancer and
      had visible cancer removed. Other parts of the study will look at whether the presence of the
      circulating tumor cells in blood predicts whether a patient will have their colon cancer
      return.
