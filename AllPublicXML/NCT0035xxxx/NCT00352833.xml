  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of the outcome of an adjuvant treatment with catumaxomab as compared to surgery
      alone in patients after curative resection of a gastric adenocarcinoma in order to gain more
      detailed information primary on safety, tolerability and feasibility and secondary on
      relevant efficacy parameters.

      A controlled, randomized, open-label, multi-center, parallel-group, Phase II study to
      generate valid hypotheses on safety and efficacy issues in patients with a primary confirmed
      diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and a high risk of disseminated tumor cells due to
      serosal infiltration after curative gastrectomy. Eligible patients will be centrally
      randomized by IVRS during operation to one of the two study groups in an 1:1 ratio: surgery
      plus catumaxomab or surgery alone.

      Treatment with catumaxomab will consist of an initial dose of 10 µg given intraoperatively as
      an intraperitoneal bolus on day 0 and of four following ascending doses (10-20-50-150 µg)
      which will be administered as an i.p.-infusion via a provided indwelling catheter on the days
      7, 10, 13 and 16, respectively.
