      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, such as busulfan, fludarabine, and melphalan, before a donor
      umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal or cancer cells
      and prepares the patient's bone marrow for the stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a
      donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells,
      red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a
      donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy followed by a
      donor umbilical cord blood transplant works in treating infants with high-risk acute leukemia
      or myelodysplastic syndromes.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of engraftment, defined as achieving donor-derived neutrophil
           count &gt; 500/mm³ by day 42, in infants with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia, acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes treated with a non-irradiation
           containing myeloablative conditioning regimen comprising busulfan, fludarabine, and
           melphalan followed by double umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) with two
           partially HLA-matched units.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 6 months after UCBT

        -  Evaluate pattern of chimerism after double UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of platelet engraftment at 1 year after UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade
           III-IV at day 100 after UCBT

        -  Evaluate the developmental outcome after UCBT

      Transplant Related Objectives

        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year after UCBT

        -  Determine the survival and disease free survival at 1 and 2 years after UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence relapse at 1 and 2 years after UCBT

          -  Patients aged ≤ 3 years at diagnosis (not age of transplant) with hematological
             malignancy as detailed below:

               -  Acute myeloid leukemia: high risk CR1 as evidenced by:

                    -  High risk cytogenetics t(4;11) or other MLL rearrangements; chromosome 5, 7,
                       or 19 abnormalities; complex karyotype (&gt;5 distinct changes); ≥ 2 cycles to
                       obtain complete response (CR); CR2 or higher; Preceding myelodysplastic
                       syndrome (MDS); All patients must be in CR or early relapse (i.e., &lt;15%
                       blasts in BM).

                    -  Acute lymphocytic leukemia: high risk CR1 as evidenced by: High-risk
                       cytogenetic: t(4;11) or other MLL rearrangements; hypodiploid; t(9;22); &gt;1
                       cycle to obtain CR; CR2 or higher; All patients must be in CR as defined by

                  regimens: Patients with evidence of minimal residual disease at the completion of
                  therapy or evidence of rising MRD while on therapy. MRD will be defined by either
                  flow cytometry (&gt;0.1% residual cells in the blast gate with immune phenotype of
                  original leukemic clone), by molecular techniques (PCR or FISH) or conventional
                  cytogenetics (g-banding).

               -  New Leukemia Subtypes: A major effort in the field of pediatric hematology is to
                  identify patients who are of high risk for treatment failure so that patients can
                  be appropriately stratified to either more (or less) intensive therapy. This
                  effort is continually ongoing and retrospective studies identify new disease
                  features or characteristics that are associated with treatment outcomes.
                  Therefore, if new high risk features are identified after the writing of this
                  protocol, patients can be enrolled with the approval of two members of the study
                  committee.

          -  Recipients must have a Lansky score ≥ 50% and have acceptable organ function defined

               -  Cardiac: left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 45%.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:
