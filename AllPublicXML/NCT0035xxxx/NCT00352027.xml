  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this protocol is to estimate the percentage of patients with intermediate
      risk Hodgkin lymphoma who will survive free of disease (Event-free survival) for three years
      after treatment with multi-agent chemotherapy (Stanford V) and low-dose, tailored-field
      radiation therapy. The hypothesis being studied is that this treatment will result in more
      than 80% of patients being alive and free of disease three years after starting treatment.

      Treatment Plan Description:

      Adriamycin 25 mg/m2 IV Day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11

      Vinblastine 6 mg/m2 IV Day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11

      Nitrogen Mustard 6mg/m2 IV on Day 1 of weeks 1, 5, and 9

      Cyclophosphamide 650 mg/m2 IV Day 1 of weeks 1, 5, 9(when Nitrogen Mustard was not available
      due to national shortage)

      Vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV Day 1 of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

      Bleomycin 5 units/m2 IV Day 1 of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

      Etoposide 60 mg/m2 IV Days 1,2 of weeks 3, 7, 11

      Prednisone* 40 mg/m2/day divided in 3 doses PO Every other day of weeks 1-12

      G-CSF (only as needed in case of severe myelo-suppression requiring treatment delay) 5 mcg/kg
      SC Days 3-13, 16-26, 29-39, 42-52, 55-65, 68-78 (as clinically indicated)

      * Prednisone taper is foreseen for the last 2 weeks of therapy. Patients will be treated with
      12 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy in the schedule outlined above. Patients will then
      receive radiation therapy after completion of 12 weeks of chemotherapy. The radiation dose to
      individual nodal sites will be based on response after 8 weeks of chemotherapy: 15 Gy for
      areas achieving a complete response and 25.5 Gy achieving less than a complete response, or
      patients with bulky mediastinal mass.

    <measure>Disease Failure Rate Within Radiation Fields</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as disease that recurs in the initially involved nodal region within the field of irradiation. The disease failure rate within the radiation fields will be estimated with a 95% confidence interval using appropriate methods (e.g., estimate cumulative incidence in the presence of competing risks).</description>

    <measure>Local and Distant Failure for Children Treated With Tailored-field Radiation</measure>
    <time_frame>from first enrollment date up to 3 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative incidence of local and distant failure will be estimated. Effect of competing risks will be taken into account. Local failure is defined as in-field, and distant failure is defined as out-of-field.</description>

    <measure>Prognostic Factors for Treatment Failure: Age</measure>
    <time_frame>5.5 (years) median follow-up with minimum 0.3 to maximum 9.4 years follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Age was examined for the association with event-free survival (EFS) which was defined as the interval between date on study and date of relapse/disease progression, second malignant tumor, death, or last contact, whichever came first. Given only 11 events, the investigators used univariate Cox model with Score test to compute the p value for the statistical significance.</description>

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the association between symptoms distress and QoL scores.
Instrument interpretation: PedsQL v.3.0, higher scores indicate better HRQOL with a range of 0-100. SDS, higher scores indicate higher overall symptom distress with a range of 10-50.</description>

Adriamycin, IV, Day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 Vinblastine, IV, Day 1 of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 Nitrogen Mustard (or Cyclophosphamide), IV, Day 1 of weeks 1, 5, 9 Vincristine, IV, Day 1 of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Bleomycin, IV, Day 1 of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 Etoposide, IV, Days 1, 2 of weeks 1-10 Prednisone, PO, every other day of weeks 1-12 G-CSF, SC, days 3-13, 16-26, 29-39, 42-52, 55-65, 68-78 (as clinically indicated)
After completion of 12 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy, participants receive radiotherapy.</description>

            <description>Intermediate Risk participants treated on the earlier HOD99 protocol (NCT00145600) at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Intermediate Risk was defined as participants with stage classified as:
EITHER Ann Arbor stage IB and IIIA, OR Ann Arbor stage IA or IIA with ANY of the following features: (1) extranodal extension of disease lesion(s), (2) 3 or more nodal sites involved, (3) Bulky mediastinal adenopathy (mediastinal mass to thoracic cavity ratio 33% or greater by chest radiograph).
Participants received 2 alternating cycles of VAMP/COP chemotherapy (total of 4 cycles of chemotherapy) plus low-dose, involved-field radiotherapy. VAMP chemotherapy includes vinblastine, adriamycin, methotrexate and prednisone. COP chemotherapy includes Cyclophosphamide, Oncovin and Procarbazine.</description>
