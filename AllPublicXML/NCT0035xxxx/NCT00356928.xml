      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of abnormal blood cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving cyclophosphamide together with donor lymphocytes that have been treated in
      the laboratory may be an effective treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes or
      myeloproliferative disorders.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the best dose of donor lymphocytes when given
      together with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or
      myeloproliferative disorders.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of allogeneic CD8-positive T-cell-depleted,
           haploidentical donor lymphocytes when given after cyclophosphamide in patients with
           myelodysplastic syndromes or myeloproliferative disorders.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 2. Patients then undergo infusion of
      allogeneic T-cell depleted donor lymphocytes on day 3.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of CD8-positive T-cell-depleted haploidentical
      donor lymphocytes until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.
