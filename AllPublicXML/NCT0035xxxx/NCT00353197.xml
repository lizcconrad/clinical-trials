    <textblock>
      Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are isolated from the early human embryo and have the
      capability to proliferate indefinitely in culture and to develop into nearly every cell of
      the human body. Therefore, hESCs may serve as a renewable unlimited source of cells for
      transplantation therapy. Because of the use of animal products in their derivation, and due
      to the lack of appropriate quality and process controls in the manufacturing of existing cell
      lines worldwide, existing hESC lines are not suitable for utilization in transplantation
      therapy.

      Our objective is to derive several new hESC lines that will be suitable for clinical trials.
      The investigators plan on deriving the new hESC lines utilizing only FDA-approved raw
      materials in a non-animal culture system. They will be produced entirely under GMP
      conditions, using appropriately documented procedures and analytical methods, completely
      safety tested, and screened for infectious and adventitious agents.

      Embryonic stem (ES) cell lines are derived from the pluripotent cells of the early embryo.
      The key properties of ES cells are their ability to proliferate indefinitely in vitro without
      differentiation, and their capability to give rise to all cells of the body. The recent
      derivation of ES cell lines from human embryos (Thomson et al., 1998, Reubinoff et al., 2000)
      attracts significant attention due to the remarkable potential of these cells for basic
      scientific research, drug development, and regenerative medicine.

      Since human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are capable of unlimited self-renewal and can give
      rise to any specialized cell via differentiation, they can potentially be used as an
      unlimited donor source of cells for transplantation in a variety of disorders that result
      from the loss of cells or cellular dysfunction. Among these conditions is Parkinson's
      disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic spinal cord injury, diabetes, heart failure, liver
      failure, etc.

      It has been proposed that the essential characteristics of primate ES cells should include
      (i) derivation from the preimplantation or periimplantation embryo, (ii) prolonged
      undifferentiated proliferation, and (iii) stable developmental potential to form derivatives
      of all three embryonic germ layers even after prolonged culture (Thomson, 1996). The
      investigators have derived stem cell lines from early human embryos that meet these criteria
      (Reubinoff et al., 2000). Our group was second in the world to derive hESC lines, and the
      first to show their potential to undergo somatic differentiation in vitro (Reubinoff et al.,
      2000).

      To exploit the remarkable potential of hESCs, improvement of currently used methods for
      culturing and manipulating the cells as well as controlling their differentiation are
      required. In this context, the investigators have developed novel approaches to cryopreserve
      (Reubinoff et al., 2001), to genetically modify (Gropp et al., 2003; Ben-Dor et al., 2006)
      and to control the differentiation of hESCs cells (Reubinoff et al., 2001, Itsykson et al.,
      2005).

      Human ES cell lines are derived from embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) for
      clinical purposes. Surplus frozen embryos that are no longer required for infertility
      treatment are recruited for this purpose after donor informed consent and
      institutional/national review board approvals are obtained. The embryos are thawed and
      cultured to the blastocyst stage (5-6 days), the inner cell mass (ICM) comprised of
      pluripotent cells is isolated, and the stem cells are most commonly cultured on mouse
      embryonic fibroblast feeder cell layer. The feeder layer is required to prevent
      differentiation and to promote the proliferation of the stem cells.

      Most hESC lines reported worldwide to date and all the cell lines currently listed in the NIH
      registry were derived on mouse fibroblast feeder layers. The current lines would not be
      suitable for clinical use, as the screening of donors and reagents was not FDA compliant, and
      the presence of the mouse feeders renders these lines xenotransplantation products. The
      regulatory compliance issues these lines raise make it difficult to obtain FDA approval for
      human transplantation use.

      To eliminate the use of mouse feeders, undifferentiated hESCs can be successfully propagated
      on laminin or Matrigel-coated plastic surfaces in the presence of mouse embryonic
      fibroblast-conditioned medium (Xu et al 2001). While this system avoids direct contact
      between mouse feeders and hESCs, the risk of cross-transfer of animal pathogens from the
      animal-conditioned medium to the hESCs is not avoided. During the early days of developing
      our cell lines, the investigators successfully cultivated the hESCs on human feeders.
      Subsequently, Richards and his colleges demonstrated that human fetal and adult feeders
      support prolonged undifferentiated propagation of existing hESC lines and are superior to
      cell-free matrices supplemented with human or mouse feeder-conditioned medium. They also
      reported the derivation of a new hESC line using human embryonic fibroblasts and animal-free
      culture conditions (Richards et al., 2002). The potential use of human placenta and
      foreskin-derived feeders to develop and support undifferentiated propagation of hESCs was
      also demonstrated (Genbacev et al., 2005; Amit et al., 2003).

      Maintenance of cultures of undifferentiated hESCs in the absence of feeders was recently
      reported. It was shown that the combination of LIF, basic fibroblast growth factor, and
      transforming growth factor Beta1 can support undifferentiated proliferation of hESCs on
      fibronectin (Amit et al., 2004). The activation of the Wnt signaling system was also
      suggested to promote the maintenance of pluripotent hESCs in the absence of feeders (Sato et
      al., 2004). Furthermore, it has been suggested that substituting the medium with high
      concentrations of FGF2 and noggin is sufficient to support the propagation of hESCs without
      feeders (Xu et al., 2005). In addition, feeder-free undifferentiated propagation of hESCs
      colonies was reported with a chemically-defined medium without serum replacer, supplemented
      with activin or nodal plus FGF2 (Vallier er al., 2005). Lastly derivation and propagation of
      hESCs in an animal free, chemically-defined, feeder-free culture system in the presence of
      high concentrations of FGF2 was reported (Ludwig et al., 2006). So far, the development of
      hESC under conditions that will allow there future use for transplantation therapy was not
      reported.

      In the second half of the project, the investigators propose to continue our efforts to
      develop new clinical-grade hESC lines derived totally from FDA-approved raw materials in a
      non-animal culture system.

      The mouse feeders will be replaced with primary cell lines of human fibroblasts. In the first
      part of the project, the investigators have completed the development of master cell banks
      (MCBs) of clinical-grade human fibroblast feeders. These feeders were produced entirely under
      GMP conditions within the Hadassah Vector Production Facility, using animal-free,
      FDA-approved raw materials (for details see Results section). To the best of our knowledge,
      the development of GMP clinical-grade human feeders was not reported by other groups.

      In parallel, the investigators have modified the methods for the derivation and culture of
      hESCs. The investigators have developed novel animal-free methods for the isolation of the
      pluripotent stem cells from human IVF embryos and successfully used these methods in the
      derivation of new hESC lines. The replacement of animal products and FDA non-approved
      materials with humanized or recombinant clinical-grade materials in the hESC culture system
      is near completion. Validation of the efficacy of the modified culture system is ongoing.
      Preliminary results suggest that the modified culture system can efficiently support
      undifferentiated cultivation of hESCs.

      The newly-derived clinical-grade hESC lines will be derived using embryos from couples
      entirely screened according to organ donation and blood donation guidelines and regulations
      (per the FDA proposed rule for donor suitability). In the first year, the investigators have
      completed the recruitment of 14 embryos from three couples. Donor medical histories were
      reviewed, and screening blood and swab test results were obtained and documented. Samples of
      donor couple blood were archived for retrospective testing in a locked storage facility.
      Recruitment of additional embryos is ongoing.

      Upon completion of the characterization and safety testing of the new human feeders,
      expanding them into working lots, and validation of the efficacy of the clinical
      grade-culture system for hESCs, the investigators will develop the new hESC lines in the
      Hadassah University Hospital Vector Production Facility, whereby stringent quality control
      and environmental testing will be maintained. All work will be accomplished utilizing only
      raw materials approved by our Quality Assurance Program, provided by vendors who underwent a
      strict vendor approval/review process. The production work will be performed using techniques
      adhering to good manufacturing practices (GMPs) and good tissue practices (GTPs).

      Early passage hESCs and feeders (Master Cell Bank) will be submitted for phenotypic and
      latent agent testing, endotoxin analysis, and testing for viral and adventitious agent
      contamination. The Working Cell Bank of both feeders and hESCs will be also tested for
      phenotypic characterization, reproducibility, sterility, and mycoplasma, detection of latent
      agents, and endotoxins. The final product will be retested as per the Master Cell Bank,
      above.

      By the conclusion of our manufacturing and testing process, Hadassah's Stem Cell Program will
      provide a generic commercial product. The procedures and methods that the investigators have
      developed will be instrumental tools to other stem cell researchers, thus paving the way for
      the future of stem cell research in Israel and worldwide. The commercial potential of the
      product will allow production of specific cells for clinical use; they will have a widespread
      commercial value and will be of enormous market worth.
