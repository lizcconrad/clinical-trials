  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if using high-intensity, short-duration,
      intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is better than volitional exercise
      in increasing quadriceps femoris and triceps surae force-generating potential and gross motor
      function in children with cerebral palsy.

      The overall goal of this study is to determine if using high-intensity, short-duration,
      intermittent neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is better than volitional exercise
      in increasing quadriceps femoris and triceps surae force-generating potential and gross motor
      function in children with cerebral palsy. This study consists of a randomized controlled
      trial in which the effects of NMES applied to the quadriceps femoris and triceps surae are
      compared to the effects of volitional isometric exercise and a non-exercising control group.
      This project assesses the ability of NMES to increase muscle force generating ability, the
      mechanisms behind changes in force generating ability, and the effects of training on
      spatiotemporal parameters of gait and gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy.

      Subjects is the NMES group will be implanted with percutaneous electrodes in the medial and
      lateral heads of the gastrocnemius and the quadriceps (3 electrodes in each lower extremity,
      implanted bilaterally). During the intervention phase, these subjects will undergo 15
      electrically-elicited contractions in each of the implanted muscle groups three times/week
      (at home), while positioned on an exercise board to maintain good alignment and facilitate
      isometric contractions. Subjects in the volitional group will perform 15 isometric
      contractions in each muscle group (quadriceps, triceps surae), while positioned on an
      exercise board. The non-exercise control group will continue with typical activities, but no
      intervention will be administered. Subjects are assessed at baseline, 6 weeks into the
      intervention, 12 weeks into the intervention (at which point the intervention is withdrawn),
      and at a follow-up assessment 12 weeks after the withdrawal of the intervention.
