  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension is a widespread disease which affects one out of every three adults in
      the industrialized world. It contributes to cardiovascular disease development, a major and
      well established risk factor. A patient non compliant to drug therapy is recognized as one of
      the primary reasons for inadequate blood pressure control.
