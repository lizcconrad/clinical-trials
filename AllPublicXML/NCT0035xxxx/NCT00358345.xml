      The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of the PreView PHP(study
      device)to detect newly diagnosed non-treated Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV)lesion
      associate with advanced Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) or Myopia and differentiate
      them from Intermediate AMD or Geographic Atrophy (GA)or patients with high Myopia with no
      CNV.

      This study secondary is to enhance NotalVision normative database.
