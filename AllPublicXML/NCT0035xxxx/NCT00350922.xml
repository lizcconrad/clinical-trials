  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine the effectiveness of a supportive and
      educational self-management program for improving health-related quality of life (HRQOL),
      angina symptoms, and self-efficacy and resourcefulness to self-manage for chronic angina
      patients. 130 participants were enrolled in the trial for 3 months. The program, entitled the
      Chronic Angina Self-Management Program, (CASMP) was found effective for improving HRQOL,
      angina symptoms, and self-efficacy to manage symptoms, compared to usual care.
