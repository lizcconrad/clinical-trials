      This study will include a one time intravenous (IV) infusion of Clostridium novyi-NT (C.
      novyi-NT) spores to treat solid tumors which have not responded to standard therapy.

    <textblock>
      Investigators at the SKCCC have developed a bacterial strain (C. novyi-NT) that can infect
      tumors and destroy them, but does not grow in normal tissues. In animal experiments, a single
      intravenous injection of these bacteria can cause dramatic regression of many tumors, and the
      tumors do not recur in approximately (~) 30% of the animals.

      This is a phase I dose escalation study using a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT spores in
      patients with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies. The overall objective of this
      study is to determine the safety and document any preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity
      in this patient population.
