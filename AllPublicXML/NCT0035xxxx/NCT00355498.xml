  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyloid senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are neuropathological
      hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that also accumulate in key brain regions in
      association with normal aging. This project will expand an established program in early
      detection and prevention of AD designed (1) to identify presymptomatic persons most likely to
      benefit from early intervention and (2) to provide an objective, noninvasive means to monitor
      therapeutic trials.

      A total of 194 volunteers will be recruited for this 2-year study. Participants will receive
      a baseline clinical and imaging evaluation and one follow-up evaluation two years later.
      These evaluations will include clinical and neuropsychological assessments, structural MRI
      and/or PET scans. Additional scans and scanning procedures will be performed on a subset of
      participants and participant visits, including serotonin density levels.

        The study population is selected from UCLA primary care clinics, UCLA memory clinic,
        residents from the California counties of Orange and Los Angeles who answer ads placed in
        newspapers in these areas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Agreement to participate in a clinical and brain imaging study

          -  Age 30 years or older

          -  No significant cerebrovascular disease - modified Ischemic Score of ≤ 4

          -  For volunteers with MCI or dementia, there must be a family member or potential
             caregiver available

          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing

          -  Screening laboratory tests and ECG without significant abnormalities that might
             interfere with the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of neurologic or other physical illness that could produce cognitive
             deterioration; in addition to a physical and neurological examination, volunteers will
             be screened for Parkinson's disease

          -  History of myocardial infarction within the previous year or unstable cardiac disease

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP&gt;170 or diastolic BP&gt;100), history of
             significant liver disease, clinically significant pulmonary disease, diabetes, or
             cancer

          -  Major psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia

          -  Because medications can affect cognitive functioning, volunteers needing medicines
             that could influence psychometric test results will be excluded; use of any of the
             following drugs will also exclude volunteers: centrally active beta-blockers,
             narcotics, clonidine, anti-Parkinsonian medications, benzodiazepines, systemic
             corticosteroids, and medications with significant cholinergic or anticholinergic
             effects, anti-convulsants, or warfarin

          -  Current diagnosis or history of alcoholism or drug dependence

          -  Evidence of untreated depression as determined by a HAM-D (Hamilton, 1960) score of ≥
             12 (17-item version) or untreated anxiety by a score of ≥ 8 on the Hamilton Anxiety
             Scale (HAM-A; Hamilton, 1959)

          -  Use of any investigational drugs within the previous month or longer, depending on
             drug half-life

          -  Contraindication for MRI scan (e.g., metal in body, claustrophobia)
