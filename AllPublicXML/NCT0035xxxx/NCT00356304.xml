      This study will determine the effectiveness of motivational interviewing in improving
      antidepressant medication adherence among Hispanics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious mental illness characterized by symptoms that can interfere with a
      person's ability to work, study, eat, sleep, and enjoy activities that were once pleasurable.
      Studies have shown that people of Hispanic descent tend to underutilize mental health care
      services. Additionally, Hispanics have demonstrated lower compliance and completion rates for
      antidepressant treatment. This may be due to low socioeconomic status, lack of family
      financial support, and inadequate communication with mental health care providers.
      Motivational interviewing is a goal-oriented type of therapy that focuses on eliciting
      behavior change by identifying and mobilizing a person's values. This study will determine
      the effectiveness of culturally sensitive motivational interviewing in improving
      antidepressant medication adherence in Hispanics.

      Participants in this 6-month, open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either
      motivational interviewing in addition to their antidepressant therapy or treatment as usual.
      All participants will first attend a 45-minute screening visit, which will include
      questionnaires and an interview about psychiatric symptoms, medication attitudes, and
      medication adherence behavior. Participants will also receive an electronic medication
      container that will record how consistently medication is taken. Participants assigned to
      motivational interviewing will then attend two 1-hour sessions of motivational interviewing
      over 2 consecutive weeks, followed by a third session 8 weeks later. The group assigned to
      treatment as usual will not partake in motivational interviewing, but will continue to
      receive their normal care. All participants will return to the study site for follow-up
      assessments, which will include measures of antidepressant adherence, at Months 2 and 5.

          <description>Participants in this condition received TAU that was enhanced with three sessions of META. Two sessions were provided between the time 1 and time 2 evaluations, with a booster session occurring between the time 2 and time 3 evaluations. These participants were also receiving psychopharmacologic/psychotherapeutic care that was naturalistic.</description>
