    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with ocular melanoma consent to participate in the study. Combined PET/CT
      scans of the whole body are performed at baseline, three months later, and six months after
      that for a total of three combined scans in the first year. Subsequently, these combined
      scans will be performed at 6-monthly intervals for a total of two combined scans per year.
