      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin and docetaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Oxaliplatin and
      docetaxel may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving oxaliplatin and
      docetaxel together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of oxaliplatin when
      given together with docetaxel and radiation therapy in treating patients with unresectable
      stage II or stage III or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer .

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when given with docetaxel and
           thoracic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage II, IIIA, or IIIB or recurrent
           non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of oxaliplatin.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients undergo radiotherapy once a day on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19,
           22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-47. Patients also receive docetaxel intravenous (IV) over 1
           hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43 and oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on days 2,
           9, 16, 23, 30, 37, and 44. Patients with stable or responding disease proceed to
           consolidation therapy.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin during induction therapy until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Consolidation therapy: Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of induction therapy,
           patients receive consolidation therapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour immediately
           followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2-4 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
           2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      for up to 2 years.
