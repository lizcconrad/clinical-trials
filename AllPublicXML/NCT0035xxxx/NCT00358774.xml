  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Common colds affect many people and are the cause of bothersome symptoms such as runny or
      stuffy nose, sore throat, headache and sneezing. Common colds can also cause more severe
      illnesses in certain groups of people like the elderly, people with chronic lung diseases
      such as asthma.

      This study is designed to test whether a non-drug (homeopathic) nasal spray will reduce the
      incidence of colds, decrease cold related symptoms or shorten the length of the cold.

    <textblock>
      Common colds are the most frequent type of respiratory infection, and although the clinical
      manifestations are usually not life threatening or debilitating, they cause annoying symptoms
      such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, malaise, sore throat and sneezing, that can interfere
      with activities of daily living. Furthermore, colds can cause more severe illnesses in
      certain people including: infants, the elderly, and people with asthma, chronic lung
      diseases, or immune deficiency.

      This clinical trial is designed to test whether a new homeopathic formulation has beneficial
      effects on the management of common colds that have been induced by inoculation of rhinovirus
      into the nose of healthy subjects.

      The objective of this research clinical study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      homeopathic nasal formulation for the management of experimentally-induced common colds as
      indicated by a reduction in:

        -  Cold incidence compared to placebo,

        -  Symptom severity compared to placebo

        -  Cold duration compared to placebo

        -  Infection rate compared to placebo

        -  Duration of virus shedding compared to placebo or

        -  Amount of virus shedding compared to placebo
