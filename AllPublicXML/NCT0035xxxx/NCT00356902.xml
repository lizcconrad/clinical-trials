  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants are born with immature lungs and often require help with breathing shortly
      after birth. This currently involves administering 100% oxygen. Unfortunately, delivery of
      high oxygen concentrations leads to the production of free radicals that can injure many
      organ systems. Term and near-term newborns deprived of oxygen during or prior to birth
      respond as well or better to resuscitation with room air (21% oxygen) compared to 100%
      oxygen. However, a static concentration of 21% oxygen may be inappropriate for preterm
      infants with lung disease. Our study will investigate how adjusting the amount of oxygen
      given to sick preterm newborns will affect the ability to maintain a safe oxygen level in
      their blood. Each infant will be assigned to receive one of three treatments at birth.
      Resuscitation will either start with 21% oxygen and be increased if needed, 100% oxygen and
      be decreased if needed or 100% oxygen with no changes made (current standard of treatment).
      The first two groups will have adjustments in oxygen concentration as needed to reach a safe
      target range of blood oxygen saturation. We anticipate that preterm newborn infants
      resuscitated with higher oxygen concentrations will have higher than &quot;normal&quot; levels of
      oxygen in their blood while those resuscitated initially with lower concentrations of oxygen
      will be more likely to have &quot;normal&quot; oxygen levels in their blood. All premature infants will
      have a surface probe placed on the right hand to measure the saturation of blood with oxygen.
      Following the resuscitation, treatment will proceed as per standard of care until hospital
      discharge. All infants will be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit given their
      prematurity. The purpose of this study is to investigate how safely restricting the amount of
      oxygen delivered to newborns during resuscitation will affect the amount of oxygen in their
      blood.

      Hypothesis: In this randomized control trial, infants resuscitated with a &quot;low oxygen
      delivery (LOD)&quot; strategy (initiation of resuscitation with 21% O2) will remain normoxemic for
      the greatest proportion of time during resuscitation and infants resuscitated with a &quot;high
      oxygen delivery (HOD)&quot; strategy (100% O2 used for the entire resuscitation) will be
      normoxemic for the smallest proportion of time during resuscitation.

          -  inborn

          -  &lt;= 32 weeks gestation

             provision of continuous positive airway pressure or positive pressure ventilation
             delivered via either a face mask or an endotracheal tube.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  lethal anomalies

          -  cyanotic congenital heart disease

          -  known hemoglobinopathy

          -  risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension
