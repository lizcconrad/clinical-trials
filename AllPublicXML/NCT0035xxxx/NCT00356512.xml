      This study will explore the regulation of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). It is a
      hormone recently identified as a regulator of the blood levels of phosphorus and vitamin D,
      both of which are essential for overall health and especially important for bone health. The
      parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates phosphorus and calcium, but people with
      hypoparathyroidism or pseudohypoparathyroidism do not have sufficient PTH action. There are
      genetic diseases that influence FGF-23, causing abnormal metabolism of phosphorus and vitamin
      D, thus affecting the bones. Also, there are rare tumors that may cause overproduction of
      FGF-23 causing debilitating bone disease.

      Patients ages 18 and older who have low PTH levels, or are resistant to PTH action, and take
      calcitriol and calcium supplements, who are not pregnant, and who do not have kidney
      disorders may be eligible for this study. During the 4-day study, patients will be provided
      with a controlled diet that has a lower than usual phosphorus content. On day 1, patients
      will be admitted to the NIH Clinic Center and undergo blood and urine tests to measure
      calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and FGF-23. They will continue with their regular medicine
      for hypoparathyroidism. On that day and throughout the study, patients will fast from 10:00
      p.m. to 8:00 a.m. the following day. On day 2, patients will continue fasting until 4:00 p.m.
      A tube will be placed in the vein of each arm: one for drawing blood and the other for
      infusing calcium. Just one intravenous (IV) line will be used on the other days. Patients
      will receive calcium chloride for 8 hours, at a dose carefully monitored by a machine. The
      purpose is to bring the blood calcium level to the high normal range or just above. Blood and
      urine samples will be collected periodically, to check for effects of calcium chloride on
      FGF-23 and PTH. On days 3 and 4, patients will not take calcitriol and calcium but will
      receive injections of PTH, under the skin, two times each day. On day 3, blood and urine
      samples will be again be collected for analysis. On day 4, patients will receive one dose of
      calcitriol by IV. The total amount of blood drawn during this study will be about 5 ounces.

      Vitamin D and phosphate are central to normal mineral homeostasis and important in many
      physiologic functions including skeletal integrity. For several decades parathyroid hormone
      (PTH) has been recognized as a central regulator of serum vitamin D and phosphate levels.
      Recently, FGF-23 has been identified as central in the regulation of the metabolism of
      vitamin D and serum phosphorus. The organ primarily responsible for the physiologic
      production of FGF-23 appears to be the skeleton. The study of FGF-23 metabolism and its
      direct effect on mineral metabolism is confounded by the classic endocrine feedback loops
      that exist among serum calcium, phosphorus, 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D (1,25-D), and PTH. It is
      possible that any of these (phosphorus, calcium, 1,25-D, and/or PTH) are important in the
      regulation of serum FGF-23. The goal of this study is to identify what factors regulate serum
      FGF-23.

      To overcome the confounding effect of PTH, we will study patients deficient in PTH
      (hypoparathyroidism) or resistant to PTH at the kidney (pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B,
      PHP1B). The kidney is one of the primary organs responsible for regulating serum phosphorus
      and generating 1,25-D. It is the target of PTH and FGF-23. While patients with PHP1B are
      resistant to the action of PTH at the kidney, they are sensitive to the action of PTH at the
      bone, the tissue that produces FGF-23. Physiologic manipulation of the serum phosphorus,
      1,25-D, calcium, and PTH in subjects with hypoparathyroidism or PHP1B will allow for a nearly
      complete dissection of the factors that are potential regulators of serum FGF-23.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Adult hypoparathyroid patients, as defined by low or inappropriately normal PTH levels
        despite hypocalcemia, who are on a stable treatment regimen of calcitriol and calcium
        supplementation, and who are willing to participate in the study will be eligible.

        Adult PHP1B patients as defined by the clinical syndrome of elevated PTH and phosphorus and
        confirmed by methylation analysis of the GNAS gene.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Renal insufficiency as evidenced by a creatinine clearance of less than 50 ml/min

        Medically unstable patients

        Uncontrolled comorbid conditions, e.g., diabetes, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
        failure, or cerebrovascular disease.

        Digitalis therapy

        Patients on diuretic therapy, especially thiazides

        Pregnant and lactating women

        Patients whose hypoparathyroidism is caused by severe calcium-sensing receptor defects.
        These patients begin to have marked symptoms of &quot;hypercalcemia&quot; when the serum calcium is
        in the mid-normal range.

        Patients under 18 years of age

        Patients with history of any bone cancer, skeletal metastases or previous radiotherapy to
        the skeleton, unexplained elevations of serum alkaline phosphatase
