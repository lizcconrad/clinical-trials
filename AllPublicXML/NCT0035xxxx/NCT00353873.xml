  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two treatment strategies (doubling the dose of inhaled steroids or
      adding a long acting beta2 agonist to the inhaled steroid at the same dose) in children not
      controlled by inhaled steroid alone at medium dose. The fixed combination SERETIDE 100/50 one
      inhalation twice daily will be compared to FLIXOTIDE 100 two inhalations twice daily.

      salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination (SERETIDE™) at a dose of 50/100mcg twice daily
      and fluticasone propionate (FLIXOTIDE™) at a dose of 200mcg twice daily, both delivered via a
      dry powder inhaler (DISKUS™) for 12 weeks in asthma in children aged 4-11 years not

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over 12 Weeks in Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 1 up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is the maximum flow generated during expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter and recorded in electronic diary record card (eDRC), performed with maximal force and started after a full inspiration. The mean morning PEF measurement was constructed by calculating a simple mean for each participant over the interval Weeks 1 to 12. All PEF measurements were converted to the Wright/McKerow peak flow meter scale for the purposes of analyses. The change from Baseline is then calculated by subtracting the Baseline PEF values from the individual on-treatment values. Baseline was calculated as the mean of the values recorded on the seven days preceding randomization. The analysis was done using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline PEF, country amalgamation, age, sex and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved 'Totally Controlled' (TC) Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>TC asthma is defined as no daily symptoms, no night-time wakening due to asthma, no exacerbations, no rescue salbutamol/albuterol use, no emergency visits, &gt;=80% predicted morning PEF, and no treatment related adverse events enforcing a change in asthma therapy over 7 consecutive days. Number of participants/group who achieved the status of at least TC during the last 8 weeks (wks) of treatment was analyzed using logistic regression, including covariates for sex, age, treatment group, country amalgamation and baseline pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1). Asthma control was assessed each week for the last 8 wks of treatment period. Each week was classified as 'TC', 'Well Controlled' (WC), 'Not Controlled' or 'Unevaluable'. A participant was considered to have TC asthma if they achieved 4/4, 5/5, 6/6, 6/7, 7/8 or 8/8 wks that were TC. 'Unevaluable' classification included participants with less than 4 wks of data during the assessment period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved WC Asthma</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>WC asthma is defined as two or more of symptom score &gt;1 only allowed on &lt;=2 days/week, rescue salbutamol/albuterol use on &lt;=2 days/week and up to a maximum of 4 times per week, &gt;=80% predicted morning PEF daily assessed for 7 consecutive days and all the following criteria: no night-time awakening due to asthma, no exacerbations, no emergency visits, no treatment related adverse events enforcing a change in any asthma therapy. Number of participants/group who achieved the status of at least WC during the last 8 wks of treatment was analyzed using logistic regression, including covariates for sex, age, treatment group, country amalgamation and baseline prebronchodilator FEV1. Each week was classified as 'WC', 'Not Controlled' or 'Unevaluable'. A participant was considered to have WC asthma if they achieved 4/4, 5/5, 6/6, 6/7, 7/8 or 8/8 wks that were WC. 'Unevaluable' classification included participants with less than 4 wks of data during the assessment period.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 46 sites in 12 countries: Belgium (4), Denmark (1), France (8), Italy (3), Latvia (3), Lithuania (3), the Netherlands (6), Norway (1), Poland (4), Russian Federation (9), Spain (3) and Sweden (1) from 18 November 2005 to 26 October 2006.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 584 participants were screened and entered into a 4-week run-in period receiving fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 microgram (mcg) dry powder inhaler (DISKUS) twice-daily (BD) and inhaled salbutamol as required. The number of participants randomized was 321 and 303 participants received investigational product post randomization.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over 12 Weeks in Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population</title>
        <description>PEF is the maximum flow generated during expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter and recorded in electronic diary record card (eDRC), performed with maximal force and started after a full inspiration. The mean morning PEF measurement was constructed by calculating a simple mean for each participant over the interval Weeks 1 to 12. All PEF measurements were converted to the Wright/McKerow peak flow meter scale for the purposes of analyses. The change from Baseline is then calculated by subtracting the Baseline PEF values from the individual on-treatment values. Baseline was calculated as the mean of the values recorded on the seven days preceding randomization. The analysis was done using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for baseline PEF, country amalgamation, age, sex and treatment.</description>

        <description>TC asthma is defined as no daily symptoms, no night-time wakening due to asthma, no exacerbations, no rescue salbutamol/albuterol use, no emergency visits, &gt;=80% predicted morning PEF, and no treatment related adverse events enforcing a change in asthma therapy over 7 consecutive days. Number of participants/group who achieved the status of at least TC during the last 8 weeks (wks) of treatment was analyzed using logistic regression, including covariates for sex, age, treatment group, country amalgamation and baseline pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1). Asthma control was assessed each week for the last 8 wks of treatment period. Each week was classified as ‘TC’, ‘Well Controlled’ (WC), ‘Not Controlled’ or ‘Unevaluable’. A participant was considered to have TC asthma if they achieved 4/4, 5/5, 6/6, 6/7, 7/8 or 8/8 wks that were TC. ‘Unevaluable’ classification included participants with less than 4 wks of data during the assessment period.</description>

Number of participants/group who achieved the status of at least TC during the last 8 weeks (wks) of treatment was analyzed using logistic regression, including covariates for sex, age, treatment group, country amalgamation and baseline pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1). Asthma control was assessed each week for the last 8 wks of treatment period. Each week was classified as ‘TC’, ‘Well Controlled’ (WC), ‘Not Controlled’ or ‘Unevaluable’. A participant was considered to have TC asthma if they achieved 4/4, 5/5, 6/6, 6/7, 7/8 or 8/8 wks that were TC. ‘Unevaluable’ classification included participants with less than 4 wks of data during the assessment period.</description>

Number of participants/group who achieved the status of at least WC during the last 8 wks of treatment was analyzed using logistic regression, including covariates for sex, age, treatment group, country amalgamation and baseline prebronchodilator FEV1.
