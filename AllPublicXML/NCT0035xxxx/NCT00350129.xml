      The primary objective is to assess the effect of glucose on retinal vascular diameter in
      otherwise healthy vasospastic subjects compared to non-vasospastic controls.

      The secondary objective is to compare the effect of glucose also on choroidal blood flow in
      otherwise healthy vasospastic subjects with non-vasospastic controls.

    <textblock>
      It is known that a glucose load can induce an increase in ocular blood flow. Acute
      hyperglycemia increases retinal vessel diameters in animals and humans. The purpose of this
      study is to compare the effect of glucose on the ocular blood flow in vasospastics and
      nonvasospastics. Body core temperature depends on basal metabolism. Peripheral
      vasoconstriction is a physiological way to preserve core temperature of the body. The
      etiology of primary vasospastic syndrome is unknown and potentially represents simply a
      reaction to a defective metabolism. Based on this hypothesis, vasospastics are expected to
      show a different vascular reaction to glucose.

      On both study days, after an overnight fast, the subjects will be seated for 30 minutes in
      the Lab and local tropicamide will be applied for pupil dilatation. After stabilisation of
      blood pressure Retinal vessel diameter and choroidal blood flow will be assessed. Baseline
      blood glucose levels will be measured. Afterwards study substance (75 gram of Glucose or
      Aspartate) will be applied in 3 dl of water. One and a half hour later, the vascular
      measurements will be repeated. Ath the end of hemodynamic assessments, blood sugar level will
      be measured again.

          -  Subjects will be classified as vasospastic if they relate a clear history of frequent
             cold hands (answering yes to the questions: &quot;do you have always cold hands, even
             during summer time?&quot; and &quot;do other people tell you that you have cold hands?&quot;) and as
             normals if they deny such a history
