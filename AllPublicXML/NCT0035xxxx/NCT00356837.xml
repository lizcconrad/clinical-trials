  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of ultrasound in diagnosing the
      presence or absence of extremity fractures or dislocations.

      Hypothesis: Can ultrasound be used as an accurate and effective method for determining the
      presence or absence of extremity fractures or dislocations? Is there a difference in amount
      of pain experienced prior to and after the ultrasound?

      This prospective, multicenter cohort study. The sampling method will be a convenience sample
      of all adult patients presenting to the ED with symptoms concerning a fracture and/or
      dislocation of an extremity. Once a patient has been deemed an appropriate candidate for the
      study, written consent will be obtained from one of the Associate Investigators. Once consent
      has been obtained, a resident physician will perform the ultrasound examination on the
      affected extremity(s) and note their findings.
