  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) has been known to be associated with significant
      clinical and economic consequences. Many studies were performed to find the pathophysiology
      and preventive measures for CIN. But the results were somewhat frustrating. Recently, it has
      been reported that the N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid might have preventive effects for
      CIN by their antioxidant effects.There have been no study to compare these two antioxidant.

  <detailed_description>

      N-acetylcysteine and ascorbic acid may prevent the CIN in the patients with underlying renal
      insufficiency who is undergoing the coronary angiography. The effect may derive from the
      antioxidant function of these two antioxidant. We studied to find which of the two
      antioxidants is more beneficial in prevention of CIN
