  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether guanfacine (Tenex) is an effective treatment
      for borderline personality disorder (BPD), an illness often characterized by unstable mood
      and impulsive aggression. Guanfacine stimulates activity in the front portion of the brain, a
      region associated with attention and the control of behavior. We believe that guanfacine may
      improve symptoms of BPD by improving attention and aiding regulation of behavior.

      This is an 8-week treatment study designed to test whether guanfacine is an effective
      treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Prior to taking the study medication,
      subjects will have medical and psychiatric evaluations, complete self-report questionnaires,
      do a functional MRI scan, and complete a set of cognitive tests. While taking the study
      medication, participants will meet weekly with a study doctor and be administered interviews
      and questionnaires. At the end of the 8-week trial, participants will be asked to repeat the
      MRI scan and cognitive tests.
