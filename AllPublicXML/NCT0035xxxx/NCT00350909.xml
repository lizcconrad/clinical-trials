  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trail is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief,
      cognitive-behavioral therapeutic intervention for adolescents reporting mild or moderate drug
      abuse (MMDA). This school-based initiative employs a collaborative effort between the
      University of Minnesota researchers and the St. Paul Public Schools. This intervention aims
      to reduce post-treatment drug use behaviors and enhance drug-use resistant cognitions and
      problem-solving skills.

      The purpose of this clinical trail is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief,
      cognitive-behavioral therapeutic intervention for adolescents reporting mild or moderate drug
      abuse (MMDA). This school-based initiative employs a collaborative effort between the
      University of Minnesota researchers and the St. Paul Public Schools. This intervention aims
      to reduce post-treatment drug use behaviors and enhance drug-use resistant cognitions and
      problem-solving skills.

      Specifically, we propose a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a
      cognitive-behavioral therapy on key process and outcome dimensions among school-based youth
      with mild-to-moderate drug abuse (MMDA). The experimental treatment is designated Brief
      Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (BCBI) given its theoretical foundation in stage of change
      theory used to coordinate modules on Rational-Emotive Therapy and Problem Solving Therapy.
      BCBI will be compared against a second experimental treatment that consists of BCBI and a
      single parent session (BCBI+P) and an assessment only condition (control). The importance of
      clarifying mechanisms in drug treatment research will be explored with respect to a limited
      number of treatment and individual factors that have emerged as promising mediating and
      moderating factors, such as cognitive and problem solving factors, parenting practices, and
      peer group influences.

    <intervention_name>brief intervention (cognitive-behavioral therapy)</intervention_name>
    <description>Consists of 60 minute individual sessions delivered with a therapist using a motivational interviewing (MI) style. Session 1 focuses on eliciting information about the students' substance use and related consequences based on the assessment, their perception of level of willingness to change, examining the cause and benefits of change using the decisional balance exercise, and discussing what goals for change the student would like to select and pursue. Session 2 reviewed the students' progress with the agreed upon goals, identifying high risk situations associated with clients difficulty in achieving the goals, discussing strategies to address barriers toward goal attainment, reviewing where the client is in the stage of change process, and negotiating either the continuation of goals or advancing to more ambitious goals of substance use reduction. Session 3 involved delivering the same MI interviewing style to the primary parent or guardian (student is not present).</description>
