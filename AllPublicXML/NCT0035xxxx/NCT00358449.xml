    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply. Inclusion criteria pertain to all subjects in both cohorts (treatment and
        observational) unless otherwise stated.

          -  The subject signs and dates a written assent form (age appropriate) and the
             parent/guardian signs and dates a written informed consent form prior to the
             initiation of any study-related activities, including discontinuation of any
             prohibited medications.

          -  Male or female subjects aged 2 to 17 years (from 2nd birthday up to and not including
             18th birthday), who weigh &lt;=84.9kg (males)/ &lt;= 72.5 (females) and who have a BMI
             between 5 and 85% for age, who speak, read and write English as age appropriate and/or
             parent/guardian.

        NOTE: If subject is within weight requirements but close to the upper or lower limits at
        screening and the investigator anticipates that during the study the subject's weight will
        change a become outside the weight requirements, the subject should be excluded from the
        study.

          -  To be eligible for entry in the treatment group of the study, a female subject is
             eligible to enter the study if she is:

          -  - Not pregnant or nursing

          -  - Of non-childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined as a
             pre-menarcheal female who has not yet entered puberty as evidenced by lack of breast
             development (palpable glandular breast tissue); or a female who has documentation
             (medical report verification) of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy.

          -  - Of childbearing potential. These females subjects must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at the screening visit, and agree to consistent and correct use of one
             of the acceptable methods of birth control from at least the commencement of their
             last normal period prior to the first dose of study medication and to continue until
             the first normal period after treatment or after the Week 24 Follow-up visit,
             whichever is longest.

          -  The subject has a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and current evidence on biopsy
             of isolated eosinophilic esophagitis defined as:

          -  - Peak esophageal eosinophil counts (highest count of eosinophils per HPF in at least
             one of all esophageal sites biopsied) of 20 or more eosinophils in a minimum of one
             HPF at 400X magnification on histology of esophageal biopsies from distal and
             mid-esophagus within two weeks of commencing study medication, as determined by the
             central histopathologist.

        and

          -  - Inadequate response to or intolerant of therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis

          -  - -The individual investigators will apply their clinical judgment to define whether a
             clinical response to therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis is inadequate. As guidance,
             inadequate response might consist of persistence under current or recent prior
             therapy, of symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis such as eosinophilic
             esophagitis-related pain in stomach, chest or throat; regurgitation; vomiting; pain or
             difficulties associated with drinking fluids or nutritional supplements; or pain or
             difficulties associated with eating. An inadequate response might also consist of
             persistent eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, in the presence or in the
             absence of eosinophilic esophagitis-related symptoms.

          -  - Similarly, the individual investigators will apply their clinical judgment to define
             whether a patient is intolerant to therapy. For guidance, intolerance to therapy for
             eosinophilic esophagitis may consist of undesirable side-effects of long-term therapy;
             or side-effects of long-term therapy that are difficult to manage; or marked
             non-compliance to therapy or rejection of therapy by the individual patient, or by the
             parent/guardian, which in the opinion of the investigator interferes with the
             patient's optimal disease management.

        The criteria used by the investigator to define inadequate response to or intolerance of
        therapy for eosinophilic esophagitis will be collected in the CRF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply. Exclusion criteria pertain to all subjects in both cohorts (treatment and

          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose that Results in death, life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Drug-related AE’s were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to treatment by the investigator. AE, SAE and drug-related AEs are summarized by TP and FP.</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected pre-infusion at Day 1, Week 4 and Week 8; and 24h and 72h post-infusion at Day 1, Week 4 and Week 8 time points and at Weeks 2, 6, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 34 to estimate the following hematology parameters: basophils (Bas), percentage of basophils (% Bas), lymphocytes (Lym), percentage of Lym (% Lym), monocytes (Mon), percentage of Mon (% Mon), platelet count (PC), total neutrophils (TN), percentage of TN (% TN), white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (He), hemoglobin (Hg), and red blood cell count (RBC). Laboratory abnormalities outside the reference range (high and low values) at any time post baseline were presented. Any time post Baseline = all visits (including scheduled and unscheduled). If participant had given both high and low value at least once then participant is counted under both high and low category for this visit.</description>

        <description>Blood samples for testing anti-mepolizumab antibodies were collected on Day 1, Week 4 and 8 Infusion Visit (before the IV infusion) and at Week 12, 24 and 34 Week follow-up visits. The presence of anti-human mepolizumab antibodies was assessed using an immunoelectrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay. To address transient positive results, an assessment of repeated results were made. For any visit category: results were considered as positive if it was positive at any visit during the study, and results were considered as negative if it were negative at all visits during the study. For repeat visit category: results were considered as postive if the result was positive at &gt;1 visit, and results were considered as negative if the result was negative at all visits or was positive at only one visit.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving a Reduction in Peak Esophageal Eosinophil Count to &lt; 5 Cells Per High Power Field (HPF) at Week 12</title>
        <description>A responder was defined as a participant achieving a reduction in esophageal eosinophils to &lt;5 cells per HPF as the highest count of eosinophils per HPF in all the esophageal sites biopsied at Week 12, confirmed by biopsy at Week 12 or at an early withdrawal visit prior to Week 12. A worst case (WC) approach was considered, if a particiapant withdrew prematurely : If a particiapnt dropped out of the study without having a biopsy taken, due to lack of efficacy or an adverse event, their response was imputed as not achieved. Participants who withdrew, without a biopsy, for other reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up) were considered non-evaluable for the primary analysis. For participants who withdrew early from the study and had a biopsy, the biopsy was used to determine their response.</description>

        <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug is uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Central volume of distribution is a hypothetical volume into which a drug initially distributes upon administration. Peripheral volume of distribution is the sum of all tissue spaces outside the central compartment. Steady state volume of distribution (Vss) is the apparent volume of distribution at steady-state. Blood samples were obtained at pre-infusion and 5m, 2h, 24h, 72-96h post-infusion at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8; and Weeks 2, 6 10, 12, 16, 20, 24 and 34 from each participant to estimate central (V1) and periperial (V2) and Steady State (Vss) volume of distribution of mepolizumab.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pain in Stomach Severity Scores</title>
        <description>Par.and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A severity score of 0 was assigned for days on which pain in stomach was not experienced. If pain in stomach was reported, severity of pain was assessed as: 1=hurt a little, 2=hurt somewhat, 3=hurt quite a bit, and 4=hurt a whole lot. The average pain severity for the interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12, Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the sum of the pain severity scores for that interval (including days assigned as 0) divided by the number of days in the interval. Screening phase was considered as the Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models with terms for the relevant Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pain in Chest/Throat Severity Scores</title>
        <description>Par. and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A severity score of 0 was assigned for days on which pain in chest/throat was not experienced. If pain in chest/throat was reported, severity of pain was assessed as: 1=hurt a little, 2=hurt somewhat, 3=hurt quite a bit, and 4=hurt a whole lot. The average pain severity for the interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12, Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the sum of the pain severity scores for that interval (including days assigned as 0) divided by the number of days in the interval. Screening phase was considered as the Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA models with terms for the relevant Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Days With Pain in Chest/Throat</title>
        <description>The percentage of days with the symptom of pain in chest/throat during each analysis interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the number of days the symptom was experienced divided by the number of days in the analysis interval, and presented as a percentage (ie, the proportion X 100%). Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline for each analysis interval was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA model with terms for Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction. The OC datasets with incorrect questionnaires excluded were used for the analysis.</description>

        <description>Par. and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A score of 0 was assigned for days on which the symptom regurgitation was not experienced. The days regurgitation experienced, the amount the symptom bothered the Par. was assessed as 1=not bothered at all, 2=bothered a little, 3=somewhat bothered, 4=bothered quite a bit, 5=bothered a whole lot. The average pain severity for the interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12, Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the sum of the pain severity scores for that interval (including days assigned as 0) divided by the number of days in the interval. Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Days With Regurgitation Bothersome Scores</title>
        <description>The percentage of days with the symptom of pain in regurgitation bothersome during each analysis interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the number of days the symptom was experienced divided by the number of days in the analysis interval, and presented as a percentage (ie, the proportion X 100%). Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline for each analysis interval was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA model with terms for Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction. The OC datasets with incorrect questionnaires excluded were used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Days With Vomiting</title>
        <description>The percentage of days with the symptom of vomiting during each analysis interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the number of days the symptom was experienced divided by the number of days in the analysis interval, and presented as a percentage (ie, the proportion X 100%). Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline for each analysis interval was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA model with terms for Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction. The OC datasets with incorrect questionnaires excluded were used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Degree of Difficulty With Drinking</title>
        <description>Par. and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A score of 6 was assigned days the participant did not drink. The amount of difficulty with drinking was assessed as 1=no difficulty, 2=a little difficulty, 3=some difficulty, 4=quite a bit of difficulty, 5=a whole lot of difficulty. The average difficulty for the interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12, Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the sum of the drinking difficulty scores for that interval (including days assigned as 6) divided by the number of days in the interval. Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA models with terms for the relevant Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pain With Drinking Severity Scores</title>
        <description>Par. and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A score of 6 was assigned the day participant did not drink. The severity of pain was assessed as: 1=didn’t hurt at all, 2=hurt a little, 3=hurt somewhat, 4=hurt quite a bit, and 5=hurt a whole lot. The average difficulty and pain severity scores was calculated as the sum of the respective scores for that interval divided by the number of days in the interval. . Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA models with terms for the relevant Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Difficulty With Eating Solid Foods</title>
        <description>Par. and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of eosinophilic esophagitis on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP and FP. A score of 6 was assigned for that symptom when Par. did not eat solid foods. When Par.eat solid foods, the amount of difficulty was assessed as 1=no difficulty, 2=a little difficulty, 3=some difficulty, 4=quite a bit of difficulty, 5=a whole lot of difficulty. The average pain severity for the interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12, Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the sum of the pain severity scores for that interval (including days assigned as 6) divided by the number of days in the interval. Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA models with terms for the relevant Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interactions.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Days Participants Ate Solid Foods</title>
        <description>The percentage of days with the symptom of difficulty and pain when eating solid foods during each analysis interval (Baseline, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the number of days the symptom was experienced divided by the number of days in the analysis interval, and presented as a percentage (ie, the proportion X 100%). Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline for each analysis interval was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA model with terms for Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction. The OC datasets with incorrect questionnaires excluded were used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Feeling of Something Stuck in Throat Bothersome Scores (for Par. 8-17 Years Only)</title>
        <description>Par. and/or parent/guardian recorded daily symptoms of the feeling like something is stuck in throat on a hand held personal digital assistant (electronic diary) during the Screening Phase, TP, and FP. A score of 0 was assigned for days on which the symptom of feeling of something stuck was not experienced. On days that feeling of something stuck in the throat was experienced, the amount the symptom bothered the Par. was assessed as 1=not bothered at all, 2=bothered a little, 3=somewhat bothered, 4=bothered quite a bit, 5=bothered a whole lot. Average bothersome score was calculated as the sum of the respective scores for that interval divided by the number of days. Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA models with terms for the relevant Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age interaction.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Days With Feeling of Something Stuck in Throat (for Par. 8-17 Years)</title>
          <description>The percentage of days with feeling of something stuck in throat during each analysis period (Baseline, Weeks 9-12 and Weeks 21-24) was calculated as the number of days the symptom was experienced divided by the number of days in the analysis interval, and presented as a percentage (ie, the proportion X 100%). Screening phase was considered as Baseline interval. Change from Baseline for each analysis interval was calculated as the value for that interval minus the value for the Baseline interval. Analysis was performed using parametric ANCOVA model with terms for Baseline score, treatment group, age group and treatment by age group interaction. The OC datasets with incorrect questionnaires excluded were used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Maintenance of Response</title>
        <description>Participants who achieved a response of &lt;5 esophageal eosinophils/HPF at Week 12 by worst case analysis, were evaluated for maintenance of response of &lt;20 cells/HPF at Week 24. Response categories were defined as: non-responder (did not respond at Week 12 or Week 24); delayed responder (did not respond at Week 12 but responded at Week 24); relapsed (responded at Week 12 but not at Week 24); maintained (responded at Week 12 and Week 24). The following assumptions were made for worst case: if a Participant dropped out of the study due to lack of efficacy or an adverse event and had a missing response, their response was imputed as not achieved (i.e. failure). However for Participants withdrawn for other reasons (e.g. lost to follow-up) with a missing response (i.e. did not have the biopsy) the response was made as missing and not imputed.</description>

        <description>Participants underwent an EGD with biopsies at Screening and at Weeks 12 and 24. Mean esophageal eosinophils were calculated as the mean number across all esophageal biopsies at each time point. Screening value was considered as the Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>
