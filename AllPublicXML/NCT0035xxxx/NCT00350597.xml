      This is a pilot study to describe the immunological responses and clinical outcome associated
      with administration of recombinant human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF) as surgical adjuvant therapy in patients with malignant melanoma who are at high
      risk for recurrence (Stage II T4, III and IV).

      This is a pilot study to describe the immunological responses and clinical outcome associated
      with administration of recombinant human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF) as surgical adjuvant therapy in patients with malignant melanoma who are at high
      risk for recurrence (Stage II T4, III and IV). The immunological responses include serum
      neopterin levels. In a sub-set of study participants, additional immunologic testing will be
      done, including monocyte cytotoxicity to a melanoma cell line and phenotypic and functional
      markers of dendritic and T cell activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The
      clinical end points of the study include safety, time to disease recurrence, time to
      disseminated disease, and survival. Eligible patients are those with high-risk melanoma who
      are clinically tumor free following surgery. Treatment will consist of GM-CSF at 125 g/m2
      once daily (maximum dose 250 g) for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest (28 day cycle) for 1
      year. Clinical status will be monitored until death or until the patient has been tumor free
      for five years, whichever event occurs first. Immunologic responses will be determined
      pretreatment, at the end of the first 14 days of dosing (Day 15), after the 14-day rest
      period (Day 29) and at the end of 14 days of dosing in cycles 6 (Day 155) and 13 (Day 351).
      Clinical outcome will be determined according to patient risk group (ultra-high risk Stage
      IIIC or IV versus high-risk Stage II T4, Stage IIIA and Stage IIIB). The pilot study will
      also assess the association of the immunological responses with clinical response and safety
      by patient risk group.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will be males or females with histologically proven melanoma.
             Patients must have Stage II (T4), III, and IV malignant melanoma surgically resected
             with no clinical evidence of disease by clinical, laboratory criteria or radiologic
             examination as defined below.

          -  Individuals must be at least 14 years of age.

          -  Pregnant women are not eligible. Men and women will be required to use an effective
             form of contraception.

          -  Patients requiring corticosteroid therapy or are receiving other forms of
             immunotherapy are not eligible.

          -  Patients may have received immunotherapy for prior disease. They must have completed
             therapy at least one month prior to study entry. Patients may not have received prior
             chemotherapy or therapy with GM-CSF. Patients are permitted to receive adjuvant
             radiation therapy but these patients will not be selected as part of the sub-set
             undergoing studies of cellular immunologic responses since the radiation could alter
             these responses. Based on the reults from one randomized, controlled clinical trial,
             the LEUKINE product labeling contains the following contraindication: “Due to the
             potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing hematopoietic progenitor cells, LEUKINE
             should not be administered simultaneously with cytoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy or
             within 24 hours preceding or following chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In one controlled
             study, patients with small cell lung cancer received LEUKINE and concurrent thoracic
             radiotherapy and chemotherapy or the identical radiotherapy and chemotherapy without
             LEUKINE. The patients randomized to LEUKINE had significantly higher incidence of
             adverse events, including higher mortality and a higher incidence of grade 4
             infections and grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia.28” Other investigators have reported
             that CM-CSF can be given safely with concurrent radiation therapy. These contrasting
             results may be related to differences in the patient populations or intensity and/or
             location of the site of radiotherapy in the body, among other factors. GM-CSF has been
             administered safely in combination with radiation therapy for treatment of head and
             neck cancers29,30 and has been used safely during regimens that combine chemotherapy
             and radiation therapy.31

          -  Patients must undergo examination for evidence of residual disease, including physical
             examination, CBC, chemistry panel, CT scan of the chest and abdomen (and pelvis for
             lower extremity or lower trunk lesions), and single sequence with gadolinium MRI or CT
             of the brain. A PET scan may be substituted for the CT of the chest and abdomen (and
             pelvis). These tests must be negative for residual disease before entry into the
             study.

          -  Administration of the protocol medication must be initiated within 90 days of the
             definitive surgical excision rendering the patient NED.
