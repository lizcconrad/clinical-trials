      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy, natural killer cells, aldesleukin, and total-body irradiation
      before a donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of abnormal
      cells and cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient
      they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,
      and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and
      methylprednisolone before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
      together with total-body irradiation followed by donor umbilical cord blood natural killer
      cells, aldesleukin, and umbilical cord blood transplant works in treating patients with
      refractory hematologic cancer or other diseases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of 6-month disease free survival. The primary laboratory
           objective is the measure of in vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood (UCB) derived
           natural killer cells (NK) after a fully ablative preparative regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of transplant-related mortality at 6 months after NK UCB +
           double UCBT

        -  Evaluate the pattern of chimerism after NK UCB + double UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 42 after NK UCB + double
           umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT)

        -  Determine the incidence of platelet engraftment at 6 months after NK UCB + double UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grade II-IV and grade
           III-IV at day 100 after NK UCB + double UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year after NK UCB + double UCBT

        -  Determine the disease-free survival at 1 after NK UCB + double UCBT

        -  Determine the incidence of relapse at 1 after NK UCB + double UCBT

      OUTLINE: This is a single arm, nonrandomized, open-label study.

        -  Myeloablative conditioning regimen: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over
           1 hour on days -18 to -16 and cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days -18 and -17.
           Patients undergo total-body irradiation twice daily on days -16 to -13.

        -  Haploidentical umbilical cord blood (UCB) natural killer (NK) cell therapy and
           aldesleukin: Patients undergo haploidentical UCB-enriched NK cell (CD3- depleted)
           infusion on day -13. Patients then receive aldesleukin subcutaneously on days -13, -11,
           -9, -7, -5, and -3. Some patients may also receive methylprednisolone IV on days -1 and
           0.

        -  UCB transplantation (UCBT): Patients undergo a single or double UCBT on day 0. Beginning
           on day 1, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV once daily until blood counts recover.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV over 2 hours
           2-3 times daily beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 100, followed by a taper
           until day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV or orally 2-3 times daily
           beginning on day -1 and continuing until day 30 (or 7 days after engraftment) in the
           absence of acute GVHD.

ANC is the real number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils. The absolute neutrophil count is commonly called the ANC. The ANC is not measured directly. It is derived by multiplying the WBC count times the percent of neutrophils in the differential WBC count. The percent of neutrophils consists of the segmented (fully mature) neutrophils) + the bands (almost mature neutrophils). The normal range for the ANC = 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3).</description>

    <description>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of transplantation in which functional immune cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as foreign and mount an immunologic attack. The acute or fulminant form of the disease (aGVHD) is normally observed within the first 100 days post-transplant, and is a major challenge to transplants owing to associated morbidity and mortality. Acute GVHD is staged as follows: overall grade (skin-liver-gut) with each organ staged individually from a low of I to a high of IV. Patients with grade IV GVHD usually have a poor prognosis.</description>

        <description>Defined as absolute neutrophils (ANC) &gt; 5 x 10^8/Liter for 3 consecutive days.
ANC is the real number of white blood cells (WBCs) that are neutrophils. The absolute neutrophil count is commonly called the ANC. The ANC is not measured directly. It is derived by multiplying the WBC count times the percent of neutrophils in the differential WBC count. The percent of neutrophils consists of the segmented (fully mature) neutrophils) + the bands (almost mature neutrophils). The normal range for the ANC = 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants (Patients) With Acute Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD) Grade II-IV</title>
        <description>Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of transplantation in which functional immune cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as foreign and mount an immunologic attack. The acute or fulminant form of the disease (aGVHD) is normally observed within the first 100 days post-transplant, and is a major challenge to transplants owing to associated morbidity and mortality. Acute GVHD is staged as follows: overall grade (skin-liver-gut) with each organ staged individually from a low of I to a high of IV. Patients with grade IV GVHD usually have a poor prognosis.</description>
