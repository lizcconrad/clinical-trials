  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if treating a donor site wound with the ACell dressing is
      as good as or better than the dressings we currently treat harvested donor sites with. This
      will be tested on consenting burn patients who require excision and grafting surgery for
      their burn wounds.

      Hypothesis: The mean healing time for wounds treated with the ACell dressing will be less
      than the mean healing time for wounds treated with the Standard of Care dressing.

      This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, and controlled study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the ACell Dressing for use as a dressing for autogenous skin donor sites
      compared to our current standard donor site dressing, which is currently Xeroform.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  less than 30% total body surface area burn

          -  burn wounds do not involve the donor site harvesting areas

          -  requires excision and grafting of sufficient extent to justify two donor site of
             roughly equal size on non-dependent body surfaces.

          -  The scheduled excision and grafting procedure is the first such operation for the
             subject

          -  subject agrees to participate in follow-up evaluations

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Critical illnesses such as those requiring ventilator support, systemic infection, or
             hemodynamic instability

          -  Major acute or chronic medical illness that could affect wound healing

          -  Cellulitis or other infection of the potential donor sites

          -  Donor site has been previously harvested for grafting

          -  Subjects who are pregnant

          -  Religious objections or allergy to porcine products
