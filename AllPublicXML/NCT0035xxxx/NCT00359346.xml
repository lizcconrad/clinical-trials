      This study will explore whether an antibody is influencing the autonomic nervous system, and
      if its removal will eliminate signs and symptoms of failure in that system. The autonomic
      nervous system is responsible for many automatic changes involved in everyday activities,
      such as standing up, digesting food, and exercising in the heat. Antibodies fight germs but
      sometimes cause health problems. Removal of the antibody is done through a procedure called a
      plasma exchange.

      Patients with primary chronic autonomic failure and a circulating antibody to what is called
      the neuronal nicotinic receptor may be eligible for this study. To be eligible, patients will
      have participated in an earlier study, protocol number 03-N-0004. Patients will undergo tests
      and procedures that include an electrocardiogram, and blood collection for hepatitis, HIV,
      and pregnancy. Blood will be tested for a complete blood count, clotting factors, and
      chemistries. There will also be tests for liver function, kidney function, cortisol, and
      thyroid. Participants will be tested for signs and symptoms of autonomic failure, and will be
      asked to complete questionnaires about various symptoms before the plasma exchange, 1 or 2
      weeks afterward, and then monthly or bimonthly for up to 1 year. Patients will undergo a
      series of other tests. In one test, a patient is upright and blows against a resistance
      (Valsalva maneuver). The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test (QSART) uses iontophoresis,
      involving application of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger, and a small amount of
      electricity. QSART examines the regulation of sweating, a particular aspect of the autonomic
      nervous system. There will be a test using edrophonium, given intravenously (IV), to evaluate
      that drug's effects on the heart, skin, glands, gastrointestinal activity, bladder tone, and
      salivation. A glucagon test, also by IV, will show patients' ability to release the hormone
      adrenaline.

      The plasma exchange will be performed by use of an automated cell separator. Patients' blood
      will be removed continuously through a needle in the arm. Blood cells will be separated from
      the plasma by a spinning process and continuously returned to circulation through a needle in
      the patients' opposite arm. Blood cells that are returned will be mixed with albumin, a
      sterile replacement solution. A blood thinner, citrate, will be given, to prevent clotting of
      blood. This whole procedure will take about 2 hours. Patients will typically undergo five
      exchange procedures in about 10 days while they are inpatients at the NIH Clinical Center.
      The amount of plasma removed in a single session and the number of sessions will be set by
      the NIH Blood Bank. It is expected that patients' autonomic failure will improve after
      several days of starting the plasma exchange. Testing for symptoms of autonomic failure and
      autonomic function testing will occur about 1 month after the plasma exchange and monthly or
      bimonthly for up to 1 year. For each visit of testing, patients will be inpatients for about
      2 days. If autonomic failure recurs, patients may have a second plasma exchange, with the
      same follow-up tests, for about 1 year.

      Background: Until recently, it was thought that primary chronic autonomic failure occurring
      without central neurodegeneration (pure autonomic failure, PAF) reflected diffuse loss of
      catecholamine-producing cells (sympathetic noradrenergic nerves and adrenomedullary
      chromaffin cells) outside the brain. Rarely, however, PAF patients have clinical laboratory
      findings suggesting decreased post-ganglionic nerve traffic in intact autonomic nerves,
      rather than denervation. To date, all of four such patients have also had a high titer of a
      circulating antibody to the nicotinic receptor mediating ganglionic neurotransmission. In one
      case, studied by another group, plasma exchange reversed signs and symptoms of autonomic
      failure, consistent with the antibody being pathogenic.

      Purpose: In this Protocol, we will carry out plasma exchange in patients we identify as
      having PAF, intact cardiac noradrenergic innervation, and a circulating antibody to the
      neuronal nicotinic receptor, to determine whether antibody pathogenicity is a consistent
      finding in this condition. We will assess the extent of relationship between symptoms, signs,
      and clinical laboratory indices of autonomic function with the titer of the antibody and
      obtain abundant plasma for antibody characterization and target protein identification.

      Methods: Autonomic function testing will be done before plasma exchange, 1-2 weeks after
      plasma exchange, and monthly or bi-monthly thereafter for up to one year. Plasma exchange may
      be repeated once, when symptoms of autonomic failure return as the antibody level builds up,
      to verify in individual patients whether repetition of plasma exchange produces reproducible
      amelioration of clinical and laboratory measures of autonomic failure.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The subjects have primary chronic autonomic failure, intact cardiac sympathetic
        innervation, and a circulating antibody to the nicotinic cholinergic receptor mediating
        ganglionic neurotransmission. This triad will be identified based on results of
        participation in NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are excluded if they do not meet all three of the above Inclusion Criteria.

        Venous Access Candidate subjects are excluded if there is inadequate peripheral venous
        access, identified during participation in NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004.

        Abnormal Clinical Pathology Test Results Candidate subjects are excluded based on abnormal
        Clinical Pathology results identified during participation in NIH Clinical Protocol
        03-N-0004 (platelet count less than 100,000 per microliter, HIV-1 or 2 or chronic hepatitis
        B or C infection, or pregnancy).

        Medical Risk Candidate subjects are excluded for safety reasons if, in the opinion of the
        Associate Investigator of the NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM), therapeutic
        plasma exchange would pose an excessive risk of complications (e.g., stroke, hemorrhage,
        infection) outweighing the potential scientific and clinical benefit. In female patients
        with child-bearing potential, a blood test for pregnancy is done prior to testing on each
        visit. The finding of a positive test for pregnancy excludes the patient from further
        participation.

        Patients with autonomic failure have an increased risk of hypotension in response to
        manipulations that decrease venous return to the heart, such as plasma exchanges. Patients
        with autonomic failure typically also have high blood pressure when they are lying down. We
        expect that at the beginning of plasma exchanges, the blood pressure will be relatively
        high, and the plasma exchanges may be started with the patient in a sitting position. The
        Principal Investigator or one of the other Associate Investigators of the Clinical
        Neurocardiology Section will monitor the blood pressure frequently or continuously during
        the plasma exchanges. Patients with autonomic failure often tolerate remarkably low blood
        pressure. A systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg will be the threshold for intervening. The
        first intervention will be to place the patient in a supine position. Second, we would
        administer saline and albumin and slow down the rate of or stop the plasma exchange. Drugs
        to control blood pressure will also be on hand for immediate emergency use if needed. If we
        think that we cannot prevent low blood pressure and fainting during future plasma
        exchanges, then we would exclude the patient from further plasma exchanges under this
        Protocol. If uncontrollable hypotension occurs in a second patient, then the Protocol will
        be terminated.

        Patients are tested for hepatitis and for HIV before undergoing plasma exchange. Blood from
        people with hepatitis or HIV can contaminate the Blood Bank equipment. If a subject has
        hepatitis or HIV, the subject will be excluded from further participation in the study. The
        Consent Form includes standard consent language about HIV testing.

        Age - The Protocol is restricted to subjects at least 18 years old.

        Medications - Medications likely to interfere with the scientific results will be
        discontinued on an inpatient basis.

        Termination of Participation - A subject may refuse certain tests or procedures, or may
        terminate participation early, without loss of benefits to which the subject was previously
        entitled. The Investigators may also exclude a subject from further participation, such as
        in the event of known or suspect falsification of medical history information or refusal to
        undergo planned tests or procedures, without loss of benefits to which the subject was
        previously entitled.
