  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare first urge, strong urge, and maximum capacity, and
      perception of discomfort during urodynamic testing between room temperature and body
      temperate saline. Twenty-four non-pregnant females referred to the urogynecology clinic for
      bladder testing will be enrolled into the study. Each patient will serve as her own control,
      undergoing the bladder testing with both room temperature and body temperature saline.

      This is a prospective observational study. Patient scheduled to undergo evaluation of urinary
      incontinence by urodynamics in the gynecology clinic will be asked to participate. Patients
      will be counseled and consent forms signed. The nurse will open the envelope which randomizes
      the order of instillation and set up the first fluid. Normal saline in 1000ml bags are used
      for instillation. The bags being used for body temperature fluid will be heated using an
      Olympic Warmette to between 98 and 99 degrees as determined by 3M Tempadot Thermometers.
      Urodynamics will be performed using standard clinic protocol recording first sensation, first
      urge, and maximum capacity. The patient will ask to comment on the discomfort of the test
      using a 5 point Lickert scale for both pain and urgency (see attached questions). Patients
      will be allowed to void. The bladder will be filled again with the second solution with
      identical questions used to determine first sensation, first urge and maximum capacity.
      During each filling the patient will be tested for stress incontinence at 200 and 300 mls as
      per our protocol. Following the instillation of the second solution the patient will again be
      asked her perception of pain and urgency an identical scale. Maximum bladder capacities from
      each temperature saline tested will then be compared against maximum bladder capacity as
      estimated from the patientsâ€™ bladder diary. The patient will then be managed as is
      appropriate for her test results.
