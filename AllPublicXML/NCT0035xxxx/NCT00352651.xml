  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if therapy with the drug pregabalin relieves pain during
      shingles compared with placebo. A placebo is an inactive substance. Pregabalin is a drug
      marketed as Lyricaâ„¢ in the United States for the treatment of seizures, diabetic neuropathy,
      and post-herpetic neuralgia. The use of pregabalin and drugs like it for the treatment of
      pain during the acute phase of shingles is experimental. Thirty four subjects will complete
      the study at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Pain Clinical Research
      Center. This study is funded by Pfizer Global Research.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the smallest of the double-stranded DNA herpes viruses,
      and the only one capable of producing two different diseases, varicella (chickenpox) and
      herpes zoster (acute herpes zoster [AHZ], shingles). The incidence of AHZ, and the secondary
      VZV infection, is strongly age-dependent and reaches 1% per year by age 80 and there are
      between 300,000 and 1 million new cases of AHZ each year in the US. AHZ is almost always
      painful, and the pain can be of disabling severity, rendering some sufferers bed-bound and
      too incapacitated to carry out normal activities, leading to weight loss and dehydration
      sufficient to require inpatient therapy. The elderly are especially likely to suffer severe
      pain.

      The most common complication of AHZ is development of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). Although
      the overall incidence of PHN after AHZ is about 10%, the incidence has been reported to rise
      as high as 80% in those over the age of 80. In all published studies, age and greater
      severity of initial zoster pain are each found to significantly increase the risk of
      developing PHN. Severe zoster pain is believed to correlate with a more severe cutaneous
      outbreak, more severe inflammation of the nerve trunk, and possibly greater injury to primary
      afferent nerve fibers.

      There are two separate issues to address when discussing the pain of AHZ. The first is
      managing the AHZ pain itself, because the burden of suffering is so high. The second is
      reducing the incidence of PHN. Both issues need to be considered in trial design, in part
      because severe AHZ pain is itself a risk factor for PHN. Studies of the analgesic effect of
      pregabalin suggest an analgesic profile similar to that of gabapentin. We would therefore
      predict, that pregabalin would reduce the pain associated with AHZ and possibly prevent
      development of PHN.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female 21 years of age or older

          2. Subjects must have an acute outbreak of herpes zoster (HZ) with unilateral skin rash
             and pain; the diagnosis will be based on physical examination and review of available
             medical records confirming the outbreak.

          3. Subjects must have had pain present for more than 3 days but less than 42 days after
             onset of the herpes zoster skin rash.

          4. Subjects at screening must have an average score of at least 40 mm on the visual
             analog scale (VAS) of the SF-McGill Pain Questionnaire.

          5. Subjects must weigh more than 110 pounds and have a body mass index greater than or
             equal to 20.

          6. No medications for AHZ pain other than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
             acetaminophen and opioids; maintained at a stable dose throughout the study.
