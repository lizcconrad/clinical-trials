      To understand and characterize the effects of linezolid on the optic nerve by observing and
      following patients who have been treated with linezolid for six weeks or longer for the
      development of signs or symptoms of visual disturbance or eye disorders.

    <description>Clinical response was evaluated at the End of Study visit (30 days after last dose) as Cure, Improvement, Failure, Unknown or Other. Clinical response was based primarily on the global assessment of the clinical presentation of the subject made by the investigator at that evaluation timepoint. The clinical response classifications were defined as follows. Cure: Resolution of the clinical signs and symptoms of infection, when compared to Baseline. No additional antimicrobial treatment is required for the disease under study. Improvement: Improvement in 2 or more, but not all, of the clinical signs and symptoms of infection, when compared with Baseline. No additional antimicrobial treatment is required for the disease under study. Failure: Persistence or progression of Baseline clinical signs and symptoms of infection, or development of new clinical findings consistent with active infection. Unknown: Inability to assess clinical response.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects who are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subjects in Treated Group:

          -  Subjects must have received linezolid 600 mg BID for six weeks or greater and be
             currently on drug (or have received linezolid within 7 days of baseline evaluation).

          -  Subjects who have current signs or symptoms compatible with linezolid toxicity (i.e.
             optic or peripheral neuropathy) may be enrolled in the study if they are on linezolid
             at time of baseline evaluation (or have received linezolid within 7 days of baseline
             evaluation).

          -  Linezolid may be discontinued at any time at the primary physician's discretion and
             remain on the study.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must use adequate contraception

          -  Subjects in Control Group:

          -  Subjects will have a diagnosis similar to patients in the treated group and similar
             important co-morbidities and epidemiologic factors if possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject in Treated Group:

             illness, condition or medication.

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing or a diagnosis at time of screening visit of an
             ophthalmologic condition that would adversely affect the study testing protocol (e.g.
             dense cataracts, macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa).

          -  Subjects who are currently receiving or anticipated to receive another medication,
             antibiotic or other, that has known potential to produce ocular or neurologic toxicity
             indistinguishable from that caused by linezolid or lactic acidosis.

          -  Subjects with a history of significant exposure, in the opinion of the investigator
             and with prior discussion with the medical monitor, to medications known to produce
             optic or peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Subjects with an active communicable disease (i.e., tuberculosis assessed as currently
             communicable) and subjects on active treatment for tuberculosis or other mycobacterial
             disease that include drugs that have known potential to produce ocular or neurologic
             toxicity.

          -  Subjects who are currently receiving another medication, antibiotic or other, that has
             known potential to produce ocular or neurologic toxicity indistinguishable from that
             caused by linezolid or lactic acidosis.

          -  Subjects with a history of significant exposure, in the opinion of the investigator
             and with prior discussion with the medical monitor, to medications known to produce

Clinical response was based primarily on the global assessment of the clinical presentation of the subject made by the investigator at that evaluation timepoint. The clinical response classifications were defined as follows. Cure: Resolution of the clinical signs and symptoms of infection, when compared to Baseline. No additional antimicrobial treatment is required for the disease under study. Improvement: Improvement in 2 or more, but not all, of the clinical signs and symptoms of infection, when compared with Baseline. No additional antimicrobial treatment is required for the disease under study. Failure: Persistence or progression of Baseline clinical signs and symptoms of infection, or development of new clinical findings consistent with active infection. Unknown: Inability to assess clinical response.</description>
