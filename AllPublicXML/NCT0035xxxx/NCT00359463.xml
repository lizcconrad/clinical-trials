  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare how one 50mg tablet of SB-497115 is broken down
      in the body by healthy subjects versus subjects with mild, moderate or severe liver problems.
      The study is also being done to 1) check on how well the study drug is tolerated by healthy
      subjects versus those with liver problems and 2) to check if liver impairment affects how the
      study drug binds to protein in the blood.
