      A study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Human Insulin Inhalation Powder [also known as
      AIR® Inhaled Insulin][AIR® is a registered trademark of Alkermes,Inc.] in patients with Type
      2 diabetes who are currently being treated with once daily insulin glargine injections. The
      present study is intended to determine if mealtime AIR® Insulin may be superior to once-daily
      insulin glargine injections.
