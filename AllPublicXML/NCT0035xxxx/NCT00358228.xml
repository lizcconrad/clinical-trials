  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary study objective was to assess the efficacy of 2 fixed doses of rimonabant versus
      placebo on abstinence from tobacco use in cigarette smokers.

      The secondary study objectives were:

        -  To evaluate the effects of rimonabant on craving and weight;

        -  To evaluate the clinical and biological safety and tolerability of rimonabant in a
           population of cigarette tobacco smokers during a 10-week treatment period

        -  To evaluate the population pharmacokinetics of rimonabant (ie, standard PK evaluation in
           the population of smokers);

        -  To observe the percentage of abstinent patients during a 40-week follow-up post
           treatment period;

        -  To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and pharmacoeconomics.
