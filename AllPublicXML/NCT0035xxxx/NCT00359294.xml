    <textblock>
      Phase I trial, dose escalating, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.
      The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and
      recommended dose (RD) of PM00104, administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 days
      every 3 weeks (this is considered as 1 cycle) to subjects with advanced malignant solid
      tumors or lymphoma.

      Phase I trial, dose escalating, prospective, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study.
      The purpose is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and
      recommended dose (RD) of PM00104, administered intravenously over 1 hour daily for 5 days
      every 3 weeks (this is considered as 1 cycle) to subjects with advanced malignant solid
      tumors or lymphoma. Secondary objectives are to determine the preliminary pharmacokinetics of
      PM00104, to evaluate the relationship between pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and to
      evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of PM00104. Dose-escalation guidelines will
      follow an accelerated phase I design for conventional cytotoxic agents in order to minimize
      the number of subjects treated at the subtoxic dose levels. The trial will be conducted in
      compliance with the protocol, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.
