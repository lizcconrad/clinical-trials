    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of induction chemotherapy (capecitabine, oxaliplatin and cetuximab
      (erbitux)) followed by capecitabine, oxaliplatin, cetuximab and radiotherapy followed by
      surgery followed by adjuvant capecitabine, oxaliplatin and cetuximab for locally advanced
      resectable rectal cancer.
