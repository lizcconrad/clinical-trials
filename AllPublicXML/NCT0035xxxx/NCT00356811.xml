    <measure>Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response (OR) of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study medication to the first documented evidence of a confirmed CR or PR (up to Week 86)</time_frame>
    <description>OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a CR or PR, per Response Evaulation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The best OR is defined as the best response recorded from the start of treatment until progressive disease (PD)/recurrence. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of TLs, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD and no PD, or complete resolution of TLs and the persistence of one or more non-TL(s), as assessed by the IRC. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Responses were confirmed at subsequent assessments made &gt;=28 days after the original response. Participants with an unknown or missing response are treated as non-responders.</description>

                  impairment of oviductal or uterine function that would cause sterility). This
                  category includes women with oligomenorrhoea (severe), women who are
                  perimenopausal and young women who have begun to menstruate. These subjects must
                  provide a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and agree to one of the
                  following:

               -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the
                  first dose of study medication until 28 days after the final dose of study

          -  Subjects must have histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer with stage
             IVdisease;

             • Where the disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, the neoplastic nature of the
             lesion should be confirmed by cytology or histology.

          -  Subjects whose disease is ER+ and/or PR+ or unknown status will only be included in
             the study if they meet the following criteria:

                  from this therapy.

          -  Documented amplification of ErbB2 defined by FISH in primary or metastatic tumor
             tissue. Results of FISH testing at local laboratories are acceptable, however, tissue
             sample must still be sent to Central laboratory where results will be repeated but not
             used for eligibility criterion.

          -  If a taxane had been administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, progression
             must have occurred ≥12 months after completion of this treatment.

             acute radiation treatment-related toxicities, in particular bone marrow suppression.

          -  Bisphosphonate therapy for bone metastases is allowed however; treatment must be
             initiated prior to the first dose of study medication. Prophylactic use of

             or leptomeningeal involvement are eligible only if they are not taking oral steroids
             or enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants.

          -  Subjects must have a cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range of normal as
             measured by echocardiogram (or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan if an echocardiogram
             cannot be performed or is inconclusive). Subjects with known history of uncontrolled
             or symptomatic angina, arrhythmias, or congestive heart failure are not eligible.

        <title>Number of Participants With a Best Overall Response (OR) of Confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</title>
        <description>OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a CR or PR, per Response Evaulation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The best OR is defined as the best response recorded from the start of treatment until progressive disease (PD)/recurrence. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters (LD) of TLs, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD and no PD, or complete resolution of TLs and the persistence of one or more non-TL(s), as assessed by the IRC. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Responses were confirmed at subsequent assessments made &gt;=28 days after the original response. Participants with an unknown or missing response are treated as non-responders.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response (DoR), as Assessed by the IRC</title>
        <description>DoR is defined for the subset of participants who had a confirmed CR (disappearance of all TLs and non-TLs) or PR (&gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the Baseline sum LD and no PD, or complete resolution of TLs and the persistence of one or more non-TL[s]) as the time from the first documented evidence of a CR or PR until the first documentation of radiological PD or death due to breast cancer, if sooner. PD is defined as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. For participants who did not progress or die, DoR was censored on the date of the last radiological scan. If a participant had only a Baseline visit or did not have a date of a radiological scan that was later than the date of initiation of anti-cancer therapy, DoR was censored at the start date of treatment.</description>

          <title>Progression-free Survival, as Assessed by the IRC and the Investigator</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the interval between the start date of treatment and the date of radiological disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who did not progress in their disease were censored on the date of their last radiological assessment preceding the start of any additional anti-cancer therapy. PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Responses were confirmed at a subsequent assessment made no less than 28 days after the original response.</description>
