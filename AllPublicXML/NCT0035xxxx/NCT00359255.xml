  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would focus on a new method of adding extra arm exercise to the usual therapy
      delivered in the hospital. We propose to design an exercise program for the affected arm and
      hand that would be given to the client as homework and done in the client's hospital room.
      The program would be designed and monitored by a therapist that works in the hospital.

      We believe that this program will: 1) increase arm and hand recovery over usual care received
      in the hospital, 2) help people make the move from therapist run exercise to self management
      of exercise, and 3) promote family involvement in therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In total 250 participants admitted for stroke rehabilitation at 4 BC sites will be randomly
      assigned to either the experimental or the control group. The extra arm and hand exercise
      program (experimental group) will receive usual therapy plus 60 minutes per day of additional
      arm exercises. This program will last for 4 weeks while the participant is in the hospital.
      The arm and hand program will include muscle strengthening and stretching, repetitive
      reaching, folding, stacking, pushing and pulling tasks, picking up objects, and activities
      that use speed and accuracy. The family will be encouraged to participate in the program with
      the participant. The control group will receive usual therapy only.

    <description>The experimental arm was given arm exercises graded based on motor impairment and administered by the site coordinator. The exercises were given in a booklet with written and photographic instructions. These exercises were monitored on a twice-weekly basis.
The intervention was to be completed once daily for 45 minutes, 5 days per week, and supervised by the site coordinator. Exercises consisted of range of motion, strengthening, and use of the arm in daily activites such as buttoning, pouring and throwing.</description>
