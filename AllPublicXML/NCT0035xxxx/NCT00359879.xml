    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to compare the effects of twice-daily (before lunch and before dinner)
      exenatide plus oral antidiabetic (OAD) agents and twice-daily (before breakfast and before
      dinner) exenatide plus OAD with respect to glycemic control (HbA1c) in patients with type 2
      diabetes.
