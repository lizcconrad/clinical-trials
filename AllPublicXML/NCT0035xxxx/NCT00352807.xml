    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain and assay human aqueous samples following
      pre-operative dosing with 0.1% Brimonidine Purite™ (pH 7.8) or with 0.15% Brimonidine Purite®
      (pH 7.2) from patients undergoing routine cataract surgery in order to evaluate the aqueous
      concentration of the two formulations.Study hypothesis: The aqueous humor concentration 45
      minutes following dosing of 0.1% Brimonidine Purite™ (pH 7.8) is comparable with 0.15%
      Brimonidine Purite® (pH 7.2)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must:

               1. Be willing and able to provide written Informed Consent

               2. Be able and willing to follow instructions and likely to complete the entire
                  course of the study.

               3. Be male or female of any race at least 18 years of age.

               4. Have visually significant cataract for which they have elected to undergo
                  cataract surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No subject may:

               1. Known allergy or sensitivity to the study medication or its components

               2. Contraindications to brimonidine therapy: concurrent use of monoamine oxidase
                  (MAO) inhibitor therapy

               3. Have any active ocular disease other than glaucoma or ocular hypertension that
                  would interfere with study parameters (such as: uveitis, ocular infection, or
                  severe dry eye). Patients with mild chronic blepharitis, age-related macular
                  degeneration, background diabetic retinopathy may be enrolled at the discretion
                  of the investigator.

               4. Any ocular surgery (including laser, refractive, intraocular filtering surgery,
                  or any other ocular surgery) within 3 months.

               5. Require use of ocular medications (including glaucoma medications), except
                  intermittent use of artificial tears.

               6. Have corneal abnormalities that would interfere with the ability to obtain an
                  adequate sample safely or have a shallow anterior chamber which would make
                  obtaining an aqueous sample difficult at the time of surgery in the opinion of
                  the investigator.

               7. Be concurrently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or
                  participation within the last 30 days in any investigational drug or device
                  study.

               8. Be pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or be of childbearing potential and
                  not using a reliable form of contraception.

               9. Have a situation or condition that in the investigator's opinion may put the
                  subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
                  significantly with participation in the study such as, significant cardiovascular
                  disease, hepatic or renal impairment, depression, Raynaud's, orthostatic
                  hypotension; uncontrolled high blood pressure. or concomitant use of other
                  potential CNS depressants and tricyclics, (Amendment 1, May 25, 2005)
