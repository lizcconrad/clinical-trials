  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The computer-based training program (CBT for CBT) focuses on teaching basic coping skills,
      presenting examples of effective use of coping skills in a number of realistic situations in
      video form, and providing opportunities for patients to practice and review new skills while
      receiving substance abuse treatment.

    <textblock>
      In this behavioral trial 120 methadone maintained cocaine abusing individuals will be
      randomly assigned to either treatment as usual in a community-based clinic OR treatment as
      usual plus 8 hours of access to the 'CBT for CBT' computer program over a period of 8 weeks.
      Primary outcomes will be retention in treatment and reduction in cocaine use (percent days
      abstinent, confirmed by urine toxicology screens). The patients' ability to demonstrate
      coping skills through a computerized role-play evaluation will be a secondary outcome. A
      six-month follow-up will assess durability and/or delayed emergence of effects.
