      The purpose of this study is to determine whether rosuvastatin is effective as a coadjuvant
      drug in the integral management of abdominal sepsis acknowledged by surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sepsis is often lethal, the mortality's ranks are identified among 25 to 70%, this
      depends on definition, severity and co-morbidities. The number of deaths by sepsis could be
      similar to myocardial infarct. Patients who get shock have 26-fold risk of death.

      In preliminary studies have been observed, that patients with treatment with statin have
      minor incidence of severe sepsis. A retrospective study suggests the association between
      using statins and reduction of bacteriemia by Gram negatives and S. aureus.

      There are many experimental studies which demonstrate the possible profit in sepsis. However
      there are no clinical prospective studies for determinate if statins are effective in
      management of sepsis. The investigators designed this study to demonstrate the utility of
      rosuvastatin in one kind of sepsis, abdominal sepsis.
