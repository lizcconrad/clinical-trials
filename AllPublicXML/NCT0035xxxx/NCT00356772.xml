      To evaluate azithromycin ocular conjunctiva concentrations 7 and 14 days after treatment
      initiation.

      The aim of the present study was to compare azithromycin tear and conjunctival ocular
      concentrations after one instillation of T1225 1.5% eye drops, twice a day during one day
      versus one instillation of T1225 1.5% eye drops, twice a day during 3 days versus an oral
      single dose of 1g azithromycin.
