      The purpose of this study is to learn if kinase, a protein found in the heart, contributes to
      thickening of the heart muscle in people with high blood pressure.

      A protein called myosin causes the heart to contract and relax. It is thought that kinase
      changes myosin to make it work better at different heart rates. This study will try to
      determine if, in some people with high blood pressure, the different forms of this protein
      cause changes in the heart. If the protein affects the size of the heart, it might be
      possible to use it to improve heart function after an injury, such as a heart attack.

      African-Americans with high blood pressure will be eligible for this study. Current data show
      that of almost 900 multi-ethnic individuals, the particular form of kinase under study in
      this project is found exclusively in the African-American population. Study participants will
      have two tubes of blood drawn for DNA testing to determine what form of kinase is present. An
      electrocardiogram will also be done if a recent one is not available. Some people may also
      have an echocardiogram, an ultrasound test to image the heart.

      Genetic and in vitro mechanical studies in our laboratory have suggested that the
      perturbations in the phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) can
      modulate cardiac function and produce a compensatory hypertrophic response. We have cloned a
      novel human cardiac kinase (MLCK) that targets the cardiac RLC and identified a common allele
      unique to the African-American population. The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate a
      large group of African-American individuals with hypertension and/or cardiac disease, a
      portion of who will possess this allele. It is well documented that hypertensive
      African-Americans have an increased prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). We
      expect that, in this population of hypertensive individuals, we will find an increased left
      ventricular mass in individuals who are heterozygous or homozygous for this kinase allele.

      In this study, patients with the allele can be matched to others in the cohort without the
      allele and evaluated by echocardiography and cardiac MRI to evaluate cardiac function and
      chamber size. In addition, metabolic stress testing will be performed to assess the
      implications of this allele on clinical performance. Another group of 75 Afro-Americans with
      dilated cardiomyopathy will be referred from local heart failure clinics and evaluated in a
      similar fashion. Allele prevalence and associated cardiac findings will also be compared with
      hypertensive patients matched for age and gender. In a parallel experiment, mice
      over-expressing this kinase, are being generated and will provide us with tissue samples with
      which to pursue the biophysical basis of the mechanical changes in muscle function.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Inclusion Criteria (Main Cohort):

        Afro-American patients with a history of hypertension

        Age greater than or equal to 21 years old

        Presence of the kinase allele (homo or heterozygous)

        Ability to give informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria (Myopathy Cohort):

        All of the above as well as:

        Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35% by any imaging technique.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        For subjects with Kinase Allele:

        There will be no exclusion criteria. Patients will be evaluated even if they are only able
        to participate in part of the study.

        For Subjects without the kinase allele and Myopathy Cohort:

        History of myocardial infarction

        History of significant valve disease

        History of primary hyperthropic or infiltrative cardiomyopathy

        History of rheumatic heart disease

        Chronic atrial arrhythmia, bundle branch block intraventricular conduction defect or
        definite myocardial infarction on EKG

        Inability to perform a metabolic stress test

        Inability to perform a cMRI

        Poor echocardiographic windows precluding accurate analysis
