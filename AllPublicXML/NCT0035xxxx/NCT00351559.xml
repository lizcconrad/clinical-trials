  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a leukocyte gene expression
      profiling method in the monitoring of asymptomatic heart transplant patients for acute
      rejection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft rejection is experienced by 20-50% of patients at least once during the
      first year after cardiac transplantation under the present immunosuppression regimens. With a
      higher incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR) in the first six months post-transplant,
      ACR continues to occur beyond the first year post-transplant. However, the optimal strategy
      for detecting rejection during this period of lower risk period for ACR is still
      controversial. The standard for rejection surveillance has been the endomyocardial biopsy
      (EMB). However, EMB is invasive, causes morbidity, and is subject to sampling error and
      inter-observer variability.

      Gene expression profiling (GEP), with its high negative predictive value (NPV) for acute
      cellular rejection (ACR), appears to be well suited to identify low-risk patients who can be
      safely managed without routine invasive endomyocardial biopsy (EMB).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Heart transplant recipients who are &gt; 6 months to 5 years (&gt; 6-60 months)
             post-transplant.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years.

          3. Stable outpatient being seen for routine monitoring of rejection. Stability is defined
             as absence of prior or current evidence of either severe cardiac allograft
             vasculopathy (CAV) or antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) with associated hemodynamic
             compromise.

               1. Severe CAV is defined as either

                    -  &gt; 50% left main stenosis;

                    -  ≥ 50% stenosis in ≥ 2 primary vessels (proximal 1/3 or middle 1/3 of the LAD
                       or LCx, RCA to takeoff of PDA in right-dominant coronary circulations) or

                    -  Isolated branch stenoses of &gt; 50% in all 3 systems (diagonal branches,
                       obtuse marginal branches, distal 1/3 of LAD or LCx, PDA, PLB, and RCA to
                       takeoff of PDA in non-dominant systems).

               2. AMR with associated hemodynamic compromise is defined as AMR (defined according
                  to local criteria) with either

                    -  A left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% or at least 25% lower than
                       the baseline value,

                    -  A cardiac index &lt; 2 l/min/m2, or

                    -  The use of inotropic agents to support circulation.

          4. Left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45% by Echocardiography, Multiple Gated
             Acquisition (MUGA) scan, or ventriculography at study entry (baseline / enrollment
             study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  gallop at the enrollment visit.

               3. Elevated right heart pressures with diminished cardiac index &lt; 2.2 L/min/m2 that
                  is new compared to a previous measurement within 6 months.

               4. Decrease in LVEF as measured by echocardiography: ≥ 25% compared to prior
                  measurement within 6 months.

          3. Rejection therapy for biopsy-proven ISHLT Grade 3A or higher during the preceding 2
             months.

          4. Major changes in immunosuppression therapy within previous 30 days (e.g.,
             discontinuation of calcineurin inhibitors, switch from mycophenolate mofetil to
             sirolimus or vice versa).

          5. Unable to give written informed consent.

          6. Patient receiving hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., Neupogen, Epogen) currently or
             during the previous 30 days.
