  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) has been clearly established as the central cause
      of cervical cancer. Indeed, certain oncogenic types of HPV can infect the cervix (part of the
      uterus or womb). This infection may go away by itself, but if it does not go away (this is
      called persistent infection), it can lead in women over a long period of time to cancer of
      the cervix. GlaxoSmithKline Biological's has developed a HPV vaccine against the oncogenic
      types HPV-16 and HPV-18 formulated with the AS04 adjuvant (control vaccine) and is also
      evaluating novel HPV vaccines formulations. This study will evaluate the long-term
      immunogenicity and safety of a novel GSK Biological's vaccine in approximately 376 subjects
      who received the novel vaccine or the control vaccine administered in the primary study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep
      2007.

      <recruitment_details>The study is a safety follow-up of the primary study NCT00231413, starting from Month 18 post-vaccination.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total number of 383 subjects were enrolled in the primary study. A total of 193, 216, 182 and 166 subjects attended Month 18, Month 24, Month 36 and Month 48 visits, respectively. No separate demography data was tabulated for these intermediate timepoints, as statistics were computed only after the last study visit at Month 48.</pre_assignment_details>
