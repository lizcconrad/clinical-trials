      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the utility of Ischemia Modified Albumin (IMA) for
      risk stratification in patients presenting with chest discomfort and possible ischemic heart
      disease, and to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic implication for IMA for major adverse
      cardiac events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with primary complaints of chest discomfort or patients with symptoms
             indicative of a moderate to high probability for unstable angina clinically indicated
             reason for evaluation for ACS in the Emergency Department meeting tyhe following
             inclusion criteria will be enrolled:

          -  Age &gt;=21 years

          -  Presentation within two hours of relief of most recent episode of chest pain or
             presence of on-going symptoms suggestive of coronary ischemia, which should be at
             least 10 minutes in duration.

          -  Patients being evaluated for suspected ischemic signs and or symptoms (chest pain) at
             the time of presentation according to routine standard of care institutional chest
             pain protocol/pathway.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Administration of thrombolytic medication prior to first (presentation) blood draw

          -  Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) secondary to supply/demand inequity (i.e. known anemia,
             tachycardia, - defined as HR greater than 150 bpm, known sepsis, hypotension, defined
             as blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg).

          -  Established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis

          -  Other acute ischemic sources (ongoing severe claudication, mesenteric ischemia, acute
             TIA/CVA)

          -  Renal failure requiring dialysis

          -  Greater than 2 hours from relief of the most recent episode of chest pain or signs and
             symptoms suggestive of coronary ischemia.

          -  Chest pain following traumatic injury to the chest

          -  Evidence for sever systemic infection, manifesting as fever (temperature &gt;100 degrees)
             and systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to provide written consent, without available next of kin

          -  Cocaine-related chest pain

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Known diagnosis of active malignancy

          -  Acute Bowel Ischemia
