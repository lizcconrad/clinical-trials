      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate, vinorelbine, and cisplatin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller
      and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Cisplatin may also make tumor cells more sensitive to
      radiation therapy. Giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor
      cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy with or
      without surgery and chemoradiotherapy works in treating patients with malignant pleural
      mesothelioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the response to induction combination chemotherapy comprising methotrexate,
           vinorelbine ditartrate, and cisplatin in patients with previously untreated malignant
           pleural mesothelioma.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the tolerability and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine relapse-free and overall survival of patients treated with induction
           combination chemotherapy with or without surgery and hemithoracic radiation.

        -  Assess the impact of induction combination chemotherapy on operability and surgical
           success.

        -  Evaluate the impact of these treatment regimens on quality of life.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive MVP chemotherapy comprising cisplatin IV over
           30-60 minutes on day 1 and vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 5-10 minutes and methotrexate
           IV over 5-30 minutes on days 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2
           courses. Patients with unresectable disease may receive up to 2 additional courses of
           induction chemotherapy. Patients requiring palliative radiotherapy or who have
           progressive disease are removed from the study. Patients with resectable disease or
           sarcomatoid histology and T1-3, N1-2 disease with a complete or partial response to
           induction chemotherapy proceed to surgery.

        -  Surgery: Patients with extensive disease undergo palliative debulking pleurectomy and
           decortication and then are taken off study. All other patients undergo a thoracotomy
           with an extrapleural pneumonectomy and then proceed to chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning 6-10 weeks after surgery, patients undergo 3-dimensional
           conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.
           Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22. Patients with
           responding disease proceed to adjuvant chemotherapy.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive 2 additional courses of MVP chemotherapy as
           above.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after each course of induction chemotherapy, before
      surgery, and then every 3 months thereafter.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
