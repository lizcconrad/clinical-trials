  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically injured patients endure a period of hypermetabolism/catabolism after being
      resuscitated. The metabolic cost of this may be measured in loss of lean body mass, poor
      wound healing, susceptibility to infection and long hospital stays. While there have been
      some data to suggest that hypermetabolism can be ameliorated in burn patients by beta
      blockade, to our knowledge, a prospective trial in trauma patients has not yet been done. Our
      hypothesis is that nonselective beta blockade will reduce catabolism, improve glucose
      control, blunt loss of lean body mass, decrease infections and improve outcome in a cohort of
      critically injured patients.
