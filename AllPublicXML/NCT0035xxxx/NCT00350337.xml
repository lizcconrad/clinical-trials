  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This descriptive study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 3 different
      formulations of the WRAIR dengue vaccine compared to a placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized into one of 4 groups. One group will receive a placebo vaccine
      and the others will receive one of 3 different dengue vaccine formations. Each subject will
      receive two doses six months apart. Study subjects who elect to participate in a mosquito
      transmissibility component of the study will undergo mosquito feedings during each of the two
      assigned follow-up visits after vaccine dose 1. All subjects will have 11 venipunctures
      during 11 visits (i.e., screening plus 10 study visits) over a period of nine months.

      A third (booster) dose of post transfection F17 or F19 will be administered approximately 5
      to 12 months after dose 2 to all subjects who received one of these formulation for their
      first two doses. Volunteers will return for a single visit 6 months after receiving their
      booster dose (long term follow-up)

          -  A healthy male or female adult 18-45 years at the time of vaccination;

             examination before entering into the study;

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject;

          -  Able to read the Subject Information Sheet and Consent Form;

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits) should
             be enrolled in the study;

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e. either

             she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions (i.e.
             intrauterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives or other equivalent hormonal
             contraception, e.g. progestin implantable, cutaneous hormonal patch or injectable
             contraceptives) for 30 days prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test
             within 48 hours prior to vaccination and must agree to continue such precautions for
             60 days after completion of the vaccination series.

             after;

          -  A planned move to a location that will prohibit participating in the trial for 9
             months after the initial vaccination;

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs within 90 days preceding the first dose or planned
             administration during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean
             prednisone, or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed;

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products within 90 days preceding the
