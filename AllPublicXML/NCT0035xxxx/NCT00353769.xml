      Hair Apposition Technique (HAT) is a relatively new technique for treating certain scalp
      lacerations. It has been shown to be equally acceptable as compared to the standard toilet
      and suture. This procedure has been the technique of choice for suitable scalp lacerations in
      Department of Emergency Medicine, Singapore General Hospital (DEM, SGH) and Emergency
      Medicine Department, National University Hospital (EMD, NUH).

      Currently HAT is being performed by doctors in the respective hospitals. Nurses, on the other
      hand, are routinely using tissue adhesives for minor wound closure. However, nurses in
      Kandang Kerbau Women and Children Hospital (KKWCH) have been routinely using HAT for 1 year
      now. Studies had been also been done by nurses in treating of minor wounds using various
      tissue adhesives as well as hair knotting technique.The trend of nurses handling minor wounds
      with tissue adhesives, hair knotting technique as well as HAT suggested the possibility of
      nurses performing HAT to a degree as competent as a doctor.

      This study aims to compare the effectiveness, complications and benefits HAT performed
      between nurses and doctors in the Emergency Department.
