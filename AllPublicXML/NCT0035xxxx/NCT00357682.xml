      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing,
      or coming back. The use of esomeprazole and aspirin may prevent esophageal cancer in patients
      with Barrett's metaplasia. It is not yet known whether esomeprazole is more effective with or
      without aspirin in preventing esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's metaplasia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying esomeprazole with or without aspirin to
      compare how well they work in preventing esophageal cancer in patients with Barrett's
      metaplasia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess whether intervention with aspirin results in a decreased rate of all causes of
           mortality or conversion rate from Barrett's metaplasia to adenocarcinoma or high grade
           dysplasia.

        -  To assess whether high dose PPI (protein pump inhibitor) therapy results in a decreased
           rate of all causes of mortality or conversion rate from Barrett's metaplasia to
           adenocarcinoma or high grade dysplasia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  To assess whether intervention with aspirin results in decreased high-grade dysplasia,
           in decreased all cause mortality, in decreased oesophageal cancer incidence and in
           decreased cause-specific mortality when each is considered separately

        -  To assess whether intervention with high dose PPI results in decreased high-grade
           dysplasia, in decreased all cause mortality, in decreased oesophageal cancer incidence
           and in decreased cause-specific mortality when each is considered separately

        -  To assess whether there are clinical and molecular risk factors which can be identified
           in BM (Barrett's Metaplasia) for the development of BA.

        -  To assess the cost effectiveness of aspirin and/or PPI treatment in the prevention of
           BA.

        -  To assess whether intervention with PPI and/or aspirin induces changes in the expression
           of molecular markers for BA.

        -  To investigate new genes important in the progression of BA, as a unique tissue bank
           will be available with a complete endoscopic, histological, physiology and
           pharmaceutical history.

        -  To assess inherited genetic factors for predisposition to oesophagitis above BM, BM, LGD
           HGD and BA.

        -  To assess what the biological risk factors are for cardiac disease and aspirin
           resistance.

        -  To assess gender differences in outcomes.

      Cancer Research UK approved the study in 2003 for a 10 year period to run from 1st January
      2005 to 31st December 2014. Funding is renewable annually and is dependent on a satisfactory
      review by an independent committee.

      An application for a funding extension will be made to CRUK 18 months before the end of the
      current grant.

      A total of 2513 patients have been accrued for this study. They remain on trial medication
      and follow up.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Aged ≥18 years.

          2. Circumferential Barrett's metaplasia of at least 1cm in length (≥C1M1) or a tongue of
             Barrett's metaplasia of at least 2cm in length (≥C0M2) (irrespective of the presence
             now or historically of histologically proven intestinal metaplasia).

          3. Able to give written informed consent.

          4. WHO performance status of 0 or 1 i.e. fully active and self-caring.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. High grade dysplasia or carcinoma at enrolment.

          2. Medical conditions which would make completing endoscopies or completing the trial
             difficult including:

               1. Frequent transient ischaemic attacks (3 or more) or severe cerebral vascular
                  accident in the previous 6 months*

               2. Severe respiratory disease with arterial oxygen saturation less 90% at rest

               3. Severe ischaemic heart disease (exercise tolerance less than 100 yards or life
                  expectancy &lt; 4 years) or myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months

               4. Severe inflammatory bowel disease requiring at least one hospital admission of 5
                  days in the last year or bowels open &gt; 6 times/day * Patients answering yes to
                  criterion a. were eligible for the PPI-only (non-aspirin) arms of the trial

          3. Continuous/frequent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use or COX-2 inhibitors (more
             than 60 days per year in total).

          4. Patients with absolute contraindications to PPIs, aspirin or their excipients i.e.
             allergies, ulcers, renal impairment or use of oral anticoagulants.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women will not undergo endoscopy and may be given dispensation
             to stop drug therapy for a year. This should be discussed with the Trial Office.

        If a patient was suitable for inclusion but later becomes unsuitable this should be
        discussed with the Trial Office before they are withdrawn. Only in exceptional
        circumstances should patients not be followed up i.e. withdrawal of consent or current life
        threatening disease with poor outcome and therefore unable to tolerate endoscopy. In these
        circumstances patients should be followed up in outpatient clinics.
