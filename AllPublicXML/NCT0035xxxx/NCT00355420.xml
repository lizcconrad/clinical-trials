  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femur fractures are a common injury in the Pediatric population. Despite their high incidence
      little do we know about the long term implications on the bones' length. Our main goal is to
      clarify this obscure issue by assessing the femoral and tibial length as determined by the
      fractures, measuring techniques and treatment modalities
