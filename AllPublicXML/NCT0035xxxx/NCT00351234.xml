      The purpose of this study is to determine whether type I diabetics with carnitine deficiency
      exhibit increased numbers of hypoglycemic (low blood sugars) events and if unrecognized
      hypoglycemia occurs during continuous 72-hour glucose monitoring. If they are determined to
      have unrecognized hypoglycemia, then oral carnitine supplementation will be given to those
      subjects and they will be reassessed for the number of hypoglycemic events in a 72-hour
      glucose monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypoglycemia is a clinical marker of carnitine deficiency. Thus carnitine may compound the
      risk of hypoglycemia for children on insulin therapy. Currently, one of the limitations in
      the management of diabetes is hypoglycemia. The problem of hypoglycemia is of even greater
      significance in the pediatric population because children have smaller glycogen stores.

      In this study, we will determine if there is a group of children with increased frequency of
      hypoglycemia and carnitine deficiency. If there is a correlation from the initial 200
      children, we will compare two groups of type I diabetic children between the ages of 7 to 21
      years. We will take 20 children with the highest carnitine levels (found in a previous study)
      and 20 children with the lowest carnitine levels and perform continuous glucose monitoring
      for a 72-hour period. Those who have at least one episode of hypoglycemia will be asked to
      undergo repeat testing, after a 2-week period of oral carnitine supplementation.
      Supplementation will start at 50 mg/kg body weight for the first week and then increase to
      100 mg/kg body weight the second week. Laboratory studies obtained at baseline include
      Hemoglobin A1c, carnitine panel, and lipid panel. These will be repeated prior to the second
      continuous glucose monitoring. Insulin doses will not be changed between glucose monitoring
      sessions. A comparison will be made between individuals with hypoglycemia, to see if the
      number of hypoglycemic events has decreased.
