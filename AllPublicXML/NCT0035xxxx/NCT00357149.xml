        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

          -  Primary tumor sites eligible: oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx. Although they are
             admittedly of squamous cell types, the following tumors will be excluded because of
             theY responsiveness to chemotherapy: tumors of the nasal and paranasal cavities,
             larynx and of the nasopharynx.

          -  Stage III or IV disease without evidence of distant metastases verified by chest X Ray
             and/or lung CT scan, abdominal ultrasound, or CT (liver function test abnormalities);
             bone scan in case of local symptoms.

          -  At least one measurable lesion.

          -  Tumor considered inoperable after evaluation by a multidisciplinary team (i.e. a
             surgeon, a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist).

          -  No previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy for any reason and no previous surgery for
             squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck patients (other than biopsy) are allowed

             contraception.

          -  Previous or current malignancies at other sites, with the exception of adequately
             treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri, basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, or other cancer curatively treated by surgery and with no evidence of disease
             for at least 5 years.

          -  Symptomatic peripheral neuropathy ≥ grade 2

          -  Symptomatic altered hearing ≥ grade 2

          -  Other serious illnesses or medical conditions including:a) Unstable cardiac disease
             despite treatment, myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.b)
             History of significant neurologic or psychiatric disorders including dementia or
             seizures.c) Active uncontrolled infection.d) Active peptic ulcer.e) Hypercalcemia.f)
             Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring hospitalization during the year
             preceding study entry

          -  History of hypersensitivity reaction to polysorbate 80

          -  Patients requiring intravenous alimentation.

          -  Patients who experienced a weight loss of more than 20% of their body weight in the 3
             months preceding study entry.

          -  Concomitant treatment with any other anticancer therapy.

          -  Participation in a therapeutic clinical trial within 30 days of study entry

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
