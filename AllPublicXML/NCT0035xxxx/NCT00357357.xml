    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of HF 0220 in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to placebo (inactive substance). The study will
      also validate biochemical markers as appropriate clinical end-points and to assess the
      suitability of chosen dose levels for future clinical studies.

             contraception for the duration of the Study.

          -  A diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease established in accordance with the
             National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke /Alzheimer's
             disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) classification.

          -  Severity of dementia of mild to moderate as assessed by the Mini-Mental State
             Examination (MMSE) score of 12-24.

          -  Patients must be living in the community living with or have at least daily visits
             from a responsible carer. The carer should be capable of assisting with the patient's
             medication, and prepared to attend with the patient for assessment.

          -  Written consent should be obtained from the patient and responsible carer.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients will not be eligible to participate in the study if they meet any of the following
        criteria:

          -  Primary, secondary or pseudodementias other than probable Alzheimer's disease.

          -  Clinically significant and/or uncontrolled condition or other significant medical
             disease.

          -  If taking medication for symptoms of dementia, the patient must be stable on therapy
             and have been taking these for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrolment.

          -  Treatment within the previous 3 months with any drug known to have a well defined
             potential for hepatotoxicity.

          -  Non-steroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. However, patients stable on low
             dose aspirin (upto 300mg/day) for at least 3 month prior to enrolment will be
             eligible.

          -  Taking anti-oxidant supplements.

          -  Active smokers of tobacco.

          -  Considered to be malnourished (body mass index &lt;19).

          -  Patients in whom a lumbar puncture is contra-indicated.
