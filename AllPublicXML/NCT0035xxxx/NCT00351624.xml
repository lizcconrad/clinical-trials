  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a 4-month period of
      supplementation with 400 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) provided from chewable softgel
      capsules containing bubblegum flavored microalgal oil (DHASCO-S) versus placebo improves one
      or more cognitive measures of attention, memory, processing speed, and error rate in healthy
      children 4 years of age.

      The secondary objectives are to measure the safety and tolerability of the DHA dose
      administered and to measure blood DHA levels before and after supplementation.

    <textblock>
      DHA is the primary omega-3 fatty acid present in the brain and retina and plays crucial
      structural and functional roles in these issues. The primary dietary source of DHA is fatty
      fish (e.g., salmon, herring, tuna). The American diet provides one of the lowest levels of
      omega-3 fatty acids of most industrialized nations. Children between the ages of 1 and 5
      years consume only 30 to 50 mg DHA per day despite high requirements for this nutrient to
      support growth and tissue turnover.

      Studies with human infants have reported visual and cognitive benefits of DHA supplementation
      in early life. Reported benefits include significant improvements on tests of visual acuity
      during infancy, psychomotor or mental development in the first two years of life, and
      problem-solving and sustained attention around 5 years of age.

      Few studies have evaluated the effect that DHA supplementation has on the cognitive function
      of older children. Studies that considered DHA supplementation in children 4-12 years of age
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or other developmental disorders have
      shown improvements on several measures of attention, behavior, and executive function.

      Given the estimated high requirements of DHA to support growth and maintenance of the brain,
      the low consumption of DHA by American children, and the evidence from human and animal
      studies that DHA status affects the functional capacity of the central nervous system, there
      is a reasonable expectation that DHA supplementation administered to preschool-aged children
      will improve performance on tests of attention, memory, processing speed, and error rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age at enrollment between 4 years 0 months and 4 years 8 months

          -  Height and weight between the 10th and 90th percentiles of the National Center for
             Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts

          -  Subject must meet normal developmental milestones.

          -  Subject able to understand instructions provided during the cognitive testing, i.e.
             English must be the primary language in the home

          -  No evidence of a medical condition that would preclude successful response or outcome
             (e.g., uncorrected vision or hearing impairment, attention deficit disorder, or inborn
             error of metabolism)

          -  Not taking any medications for seizure disorder, anxiety disorders (e.g., Valium or
             related compounds), ADHD (e.g., Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta, Strattera, or similar
             medication), childhood psychosis (e.g., Haldol, Risperdal), depression (e.g., Prozac),
             or for bipolar disorder. A subject will not be withdrawn from the trial if he/she
             needs to take one of these medications after enrollment. Antihistamines (e.g.,
             Benadryl or other antihistamines) should not be administered within 24 hours of the
             day of the cognitive exams (Claritin or Allegra are allowed). If a subject is taking
             an antihistamine on the day of the cognitive tests, the tests will be rescheduled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Premature birth (&lt; 36 weeks gestation)

          -  Family history of ADHD

          -  Subject consumes &gt; 3 oz. of fish more than 2 times per week.

          -  Subject consumes dietary supplements or foods containing or fortified with omega-3
             fatty acids.

          -  Subject received any investigational product within the past 30 days.

          -  Subject having any medical condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator
             would preclude a successful response or outcome (e.g., uncorrected vision or hearing
             impairment, attention deficit disorder or inborn error of metabolism)
