          -  Subject has adequate organ and marrow function

          -  In the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, the subject has a serum
             cortisol level ≥ 20 ug/dL (552 nmol/L) 30-90 minutes after injection of ACTH

          -  Subject has given written informed consent

             administered more than 30 days earlier

          -  Subject has received radiation to ≥ 25% of his/her bone marrow within 30 days of XL820
             treatment

          -  Subject has received an investigational agent within 30 days of the first dose of
             XL820

          -  Subject has known brain metastases

          -  Subject has known uncontrolled intercurrent illness
