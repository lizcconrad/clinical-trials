    <textblock>
      While the gold standard of treatment in invasive bladder cancer is surgical removal of the
      bladder, it is well accepted that a reasonable alternative is an organ preserving approach.
      Bladder preservation can be achieved in patients with radiotherapy alone or together with
      concurrent chemotherapy. This clinical trial will assess the potential of intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) delivered using helical tomotherapy to reduce radiation-induced
      gastrointestinal toxicity and increase the accuracy of bladder cancer irradiation.

      Patients opting for bladder conservation in Ottawa are currently treated using intra-arterial
      cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy using 3D-Conformal radiotherapy. It has been recently
      reported that while combination chemotherapy with local therapy (surgery or radiation) does
      modestly increase survival, greater toxicity results. As a precursor to the integration of
      gemcitabine in the standard chemotherapy regimen at our centre, the current clinical trial is
      designed to determine if a novel approach to the delivery of intensity modulated radiotherapy
      (IMRT), namely Helical Tomotherapy, will decrease the toxicity of standard chemoradiation.
      Chemoradiation will be administered as follows: 3 courses Intra-Arterial Cisplatin 90mg/m2
      every 3 weeks and radical radiation delivered as IMRT for a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 daily
      fractions of 2 Gy per day M-F starting day 15.
