        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with advanced solid tumors (metastatic or local) unresponsive to standard
             therapy, progressed on standard therapy, or no standard therapy exists. No limit to
             the number of prior treatment regimens

          -  Patients may be fully active without physical restrictions, ambulatory with
             restrictions on strenuous physical activity, or ambulatory and capable of self-care
             but not work activities (i.e., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
             of greater than or equal to 2)

          -  Demonstrates adequate organ function (liver, kidneys, hematologic)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks of dosing; or unresolved side
             effects(s) from prior treatment regimen

          -  Participation in an investigational study within 14 days of dosing

          -  Primary central nervous system tumor

          -  Active brain or spinal cord metastases. Patients who completed a course of therapy for
             CNS metastases may be eligible if considered clinically stable for 3 months prior to
             study entry

          -  Symptoms from fluid in the abdomen or around the lungs

          -  Requires certain drugs or other products known to be metabolized by the liver enzyme
             CYP3A4
