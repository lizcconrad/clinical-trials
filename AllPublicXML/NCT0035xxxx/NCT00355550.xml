  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Ketasyn, a compound that increases energy
      availability in the brain, improves memory in older adults with &quot;normal&quot; loss of memory
      abilities since early adult life.

      One physiological hallmark of aging in mammals is a decreased uptake and metabolism of
      glucose within the brain. The impaired glucose metabolism in the brain may contribute or
      exacerbate the cognitive deficits observed during normal aging. Facilitation of memory in
      elderly individuals occurs when glucose levels are elevated by the administration of
      carbohydrate. However, such a treatment poses challenges since elevated blood glucose levels
      are difficult to maintain and must be within a relatively narrow window, as excessive
      hyperglycemia is associated with cognitive impairments. The purpose of this study is to
      explore whether increasing levels of other substrates for the brain improves cognitive
      functioning in normal aged individuals with memory disorders.

      Study participants will be 120 men and women aged 50-85 who have been diagnosed as having
      Age-Associated Memory Impairment (AAMI). During the double-blind period of the protocol, 60
      participants will receive Ketasyn™, and 60 participants will receive a matching placebo.
      Ketasyn™ or the matching placebo will be administered once a day for ninety days by mixing
      powder in 8 ounces of a liquid. Each participant will be seen six (6) times: at Screening;
      Baseline; treatment days Days 30, 60, 90; and 14 days after the conclusion of treatment (Day
      104).
