  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of high intensity respiratory
      muscle strength training in treating blunted facial expression in people with Parkinson
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Facial expressions are complex signals that last only a few minutes and are important for
      communicating intention, motivation, and emotional states. In humans, a variety of
      neurological and psychiatric conditions alter the tendency to use facial signals. One of the
      main symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) is diminished facial expressivity or &quot;masked facies,&quot;
      which refers to the expressionless appearance of individuals with the disorder.

      Unfortunately, little progress has been made over the years regarding the basis of &quot;masked
      faces&quot; or strategies that might improve facial expressivity among individuals with PD. This
      is unfortunate because the particular symptom can have significant medical and social
      consequences ranging from misdiagnosis of depression to the misattribution of negative
      emotional states and motivation by family members and healthcare providers.

      The goal of this trial is to study the effectiveness of a novel, behavioral treatment
      approach—high intensity respiratory muscle strength training (MST)—for blunting of facial
      expressions in people with PD. The MST device, a mouthpiece that the participant uses to
      inspire against resistance, may improve the strength and mobility of muscles around the mouth
      that are involved in forming facial expressions.

      Study participation includes screening, baseline evaluations, 4 weeks of behavioral
      intervention, immediate post-treatment followup, and a 3-month follow-up. Participants will
      be randomly assigned to take part in high intensity respiratory MST, or a Sham MST.
      Participation in the study will last for approximately 5 months.

    <measure>Change in Facial Entropy Score From Baseline [Off Dopamine Medication]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks (i.e., immediate after 4-week treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome is change in entropy score from baseline to immediate completion of 4 week intervention. Entropy is a computer derived index of facial movement that is computed by quantifying changes in pixel intensity as the face moves over a series of video frames. Entropy values range from 0 up to 100. Higher scores reflect greater movement and expressivity (desired). In this condition (&quot;off dopamine), entropy scores were obtained when participants were tested &quot;off&quot; their normal dopamine medications. Off-dopamine testing occurred after a 12-hour overnight washout period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Facial Entropy Score From Baseline [On Dopamine Medication]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks (i.e., immediate after 4-week intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome is entropy change from baseline to immediate completion of 4 week intervention when participants remained on their normal dosage of dopamine medication. Entropy is quantitative index of facial movement that is computed from changes in pixel intensity as the face moves. Entropy values range from 0 up to 100. Higher scores reflect greater movement and expressivity. Greater expressivity is desired outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parkinson Disease Quality of Life-39 Scale (PDQ-39)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks (i.e., immediate post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is a widely used quality of life measure that is specific to Parkinson disease. Total raw score on the PDQ-39 ranges from 0 to 156. Higher scores reflect worse quality of life rating. Total score on PDQ-39 was used to compute pre-post treatment changes.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm involved high intensity muscle strength training at 75% maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Training took place for 4 weeks, 5 days a week. Each daily session involved 5 sets of breathing exercises that required participants to take deep breaths (i.e., inspire) using use a breathing device. Settings on the breathing device were determined by obtaining the individual's maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP)using a specialized breathing gauge. The MIP was determined at the beginning of each week and the training device was adjusted and set at 75% MIP. Exercises took place in home setting, with weekly visit by staff. Participants kept daily exercise log.</description>

    <description>This arm (low intensity MST) was identical to the real intervention in all ways except that the training device was set at 5% maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP). Thus less muscle and breathing effort was required during this sham treatment.</description>

        <title>Change in Facial Entropy Score From Baseline [Off Dopamine Medication]</title>
        <description>Primary outcome is change in entropy score from baseline to immediate completion of 4 week intervention. Entropy is a computer derived index of facial movement that is computed by quantifying changes in pixel intensity as the face moves over a series of video frames. Entropy values range from 0 up to 100. Higher scores reflect greater movement and expressivity (desired). In this condition (&quot;off dopamine), entropy scores were obtained when participants were tested &quot;off&quot; their normal dopamine medications. Off-dopamine testing occurred after a 12-hour overnight washout period.</description>

            <description>High intensity respiratory muscle strength training took place over 4 weeks, 5 days a week. Each exercise session involved sets of breathing exercises taking approximately 20 minutes/day. The inspiratory exercises involved a breathing device that required individuals to take &quot;deep breaths&quot; and breathe in (i.e., inspire). Settings on breathing device were determined by obtaining the individual's maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) using a specialized breathing gauge.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximal Inspiratory Pressure (MIP)</title>
        <description>The dependent variable is the change in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) from baseline to immediate completion of 4-week intervention. MIP refers to how much air pressure force an individual creates by inhaling through the mouth as hard as possible. This was measured over 5-7 trials by placement of lips around a mouthpiece attached to a calibrated fluke digital pressure gauge. From these trials, an average maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) was computed. This was done at baseline and post-treatment. Greater MIP changes correspond to greater treatment-related effects of exercise.</description>
