  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of changing didanosine in an
      effective anti-HIV regimen to tenofovir on virologic suppression. We hypothesize that, in
      patients with maximal virologic suppression on a double class regimen (including two NRTIs
      and an NNRTI or a PI, boosted with RTV or not), a single drug substitution of didanosine for
      tenofovir will represent a viable strategy without any negative impact on the virologic
      efficacy of the regimen.

      Primary objective - to determine the impact of changing part of an effective HAART regimen to
      tenofovir on maintenance of virologic suppression in HCV co-infected patients.

      Secondary objective - to assess the safety and tolerability over 12 weeks in patients
      switched to tenofovir.

      Research Method - This will be a single arm observational study to include 30 subjects.
      Patients requiring HCV treatment will be assessed and patients receiving didanosine will be
      clinically evaluated to determine an appropriate NRTI drug switch. Patients who are to switch
      the didanosine component of their regimen to tenofovir will be eligible to participate in the
      study and will be followed for a period of observation of up to 4 weeks. All patients will be
      receiving tenofovir as one capsule, once daily. The primary endpoint will be maintenance of
      virologic suppression between the Baseline visit and week 12 in the overall study group.
      Measures of adherence to HAART, safety, tolerability and CD4 cell counts will also be
      obtained at each study visit, and will constitute secondary study endpoints.
