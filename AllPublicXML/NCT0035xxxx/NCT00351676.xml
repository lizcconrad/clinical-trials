  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the researchers, propose to link a clinical pharmacist with an internal medicine or
      family medicine team to provide pharmaceutical care to all patients assigned to the team. The
      hypothesis is that through this team based approach, pharmacists will act as a resource for
      providing pharmacotherapeutic advice during the drug therapy decision making process and
      promote optimal drug use by identifying and resolving actual and potential drug related
      problems. This study is designed to test this hypothesis, by assessing the impact of this
      intervention on evidence based, quality of drug therapy indicators, for patients admitted
      with heart failure (HF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), community acquired
      pneumonia (CAP), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and stable coronary artery disease (CAD).

      The overall goal of the COLLABORATE study is to improve processes of care and patient
      outcomes by optimizing drug therapy via a hospital pharmacy practice model that integrates
      clinical pharmacists into the patient care team.

      The intervention consists of a clinical pharmacist assigned to the patient care team for the
      purpose of providing proactive clinical pharmacy services. The study pharmacist will be
      available during normal office hours 5 days per week to provide clarification of the
      patient's medication history, identify and resolve actual and potential patient specific drug
      related problems/issues, participate in patient care rounds, provide drug information to the
      patient care team, provide patient education and discharge medication counselling, and
      provide physician and/or nursing staff education. The anticipated pharmacist to patient ratio
      is approximately 1:20.

      Control patients will receive usual care. Usual care consists of reactive clinical pharmacy
      services (i.e. drug related issues identified as orders are received, or by patient profile
      review) provided by a ward based, not team based, clinical pharmacist.
