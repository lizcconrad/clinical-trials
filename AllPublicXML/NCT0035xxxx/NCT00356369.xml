  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meningococcal disease is mostly caused by N. meningitidis of serogroups A, B, C, W-135, Y.
      Meningococcal polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines have the advantage to induce a T-cell
      dependant immune response while the existing polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell
      independent response, i.e. with no immune memory response. GSK Biologicals has developed a
      combined Men ACWY conjugate vaccine intended to protect against meningococcal disease due to
      serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. In the vaccination phase of this study, the new MenACWY-TT
      conjugate vaccine will be evaluated in adolescents and adults using Mencevax™ ACWY as
      control. In the long-term follow-up phase (extension phase) of the study, the long-term
      protection offered by the new MenACWY-TT conjugate vaccine will be assessed up to five years
      after the vaccination in adolescents and adults using Mencevax™ ACWY as control. This
      protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of both the primary &amp; extension
      phases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will have 7 blood samples taken: prior to and one month after vaccination and
      one, two, three, four and five years after vaccination. No new subjects will be enrolled in
      the extension phases of this Phase IIb study.

      The Protocol Posting has been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act,
      September 2007.
