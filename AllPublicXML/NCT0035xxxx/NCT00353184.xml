  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral montelukast is helpful in chronic asthma. The purpose of this pediatric study was to
      investigate whether the addition of oral montelukast to standard therapy for acute asthma
      exacerbations results in further improvement in breathing function over three hours.

      We hypothesized that children with moderate acute asthma exacerbations receiving oral
      montelukast in addition to standard therapy will have at least 12% greater FEV1 improvement
      in three hours than those receiving standard therapy alone.

      In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, we enrolled emergency patients aged
      6-14 years with moderate acute asthma exacerbations (initial PEFR 40-70% predicted). Subjects
      received montelukast 5-mg or placebo orally then standard therapy consisting of weight-based
      doses of nebulized albuterol, nebulized ipratropium bromide, and oral corticosteroids. We
      measured FEV1 before study medication administration and hourly for three hours.

      We conducted a planned an interim analysis after approximately one-half of the estimated
      sample had been enrolled.
