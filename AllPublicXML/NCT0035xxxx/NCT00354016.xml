  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to antigenic changes of influenza viruses, the virus strains used in influenza vaccines
      are adjusted every year according to WHO (World Health Organization) and CHMP (Committee for
      Medicinal Products for Human Use) recommendations. Immunogenicity and tolerability of the
      newly composed vaccines are subject for evaluation in a yearly clinical trial in non-elderly
      and elderly subjects (CPMP/BWP/214/96).
