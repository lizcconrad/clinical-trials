      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Vaccines made from gp100 peptides
      may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving ipilimumab
      together with vaccine therapy may be an effective treatment for melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying ipilimumab and vaccine therapy to see how
      well they work compared to ipilimumab alone in treating patients with previously treated
      stage IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the impact of ipilimumab with vs without gp100 peptides emulsified with
           Montanide ISA-51 on clinical response in patients with previously treated, HLA-A*0201
           positive stage IV melanoma.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the safety/toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunologic response, as measured by in vitro assays using peripheral
           blood samples, in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the response rate after a re-induction regimen for patients who have relapsed
           after initial response.

        -  Determine overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG
      performance status (0 vs 1 or 2) and metastases (M1a vs M1 b or M1c). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Induction phase:

             -  Arm I: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive ipilimumab as in arm I. Patients also receive gp100
                peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or better for 12
      weeks after 4 courses proceed to maintenance phase.

        -  Maintenance phase:

             -  Arm I: Patients receive ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive ipilimumab IV as in arm I and gp100 peptides emulsified in
                Montanide ISA-51 SC on day 1.

      Treatment in both arms begins in approximately week 21 and repeats every 3 months for 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who relapse
      or progress while on maintenance phase undergo re-induction comprising 4 courses of treatment
      with ipilimumab with or without gp100 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 as in induction
      phase. Patients achieving responding disease (complete response, partial response, or stable
      disease) for 12 weeks after re-induction proceed to the maintenance phase as above for up to
      8 courses of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated for 3 weeks after the last
      treatment, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 94 patients will be accrued for this study.
