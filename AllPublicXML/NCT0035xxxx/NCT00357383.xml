      To evaluate the ocular tolerance of T1225 1% and 1.5% eye drops versus vehicle after one
      instillation twice-daily (morning and evening), in one eye, during 3 days (from Day 0 to Day
      2).

      To assess azithromycin tear, conjunctiva and plasmatic concentrations, after a 3-day
      treatment period

      The aim of the present study was to compare ocular tolerance and safety after repeated
      instillations of T1225 1% and 1.5% eye drops and vehicle and to assess the residual
      azithromycin concentrations in tear, ocular conjunctiva and plasma samples, approximately 12
      hours after the last Investigational Medicinal Product instillation.
