  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the ability of socks weaved with pressure relieving areas to reduce the
      pressure on the foot when weight bearing.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased pressure in weight bearing areas of the foot, especially in insensate feet may lead
      to the development of pressure sore. The creation of socks with pressure relieving areas by
      special weaving technique may prevent the development of these complications.

      Three (3) volunteers will be examined walking on a Tekscan pressure mat, barefoot and then
      wearing socks weaved in a new technique, from cotton, nylon and acrilan.
