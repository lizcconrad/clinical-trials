      Twelve patients with poor pain control or unacceptable side effects during treatment with
      morphine were switched to methadone and followed for nine months in this open prospective
      study. Primary outcomes were patient preference for opioid and pain control while physical,
      cognitive and role functioning were secondary outcomes. The morphine dose was decreased by
      1/3 daily and was replaced with an equianalgesic dose of methadone over a three-day period.
      During switching and a one-week dose titration period, patients were given additional
      methadone if required. During dose titration one patient experienced sedation requiring
      naloxone. Four patients were switched back to morphine due to poor pain control, drowsiness
      or sweating. Seven patients preferred long-term (&gt;nine months) treatment with methadone and
      reported reduced pain and improved functioning while cognition was not improved. This study
      brings novel information on the long-term consequences for pain control, health-related
      quality of life and cognitive functioning with a switch from morphine to methadone in the
      treatment of chronic non-malignant pain.
