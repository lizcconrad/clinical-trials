      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the investigational
      trifunctional anti-Her-2/neu x anti-CD3 antibody ertumaxomab as treatment for hormone therapy
      refractory Her-2/neu 1+ or 2+ expressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer

    <textblock>
      A multi-centre, phase II study of ertumaxomab in metastatic breast cancer patients who became
      progressive after hormonal therapy. Each eligible patient will receive three ascending doses
      of ertumaxomab, administered intravenously. Ertumaxomab will be administered as a 3-hour
      constant rate infusion with a dosing interval of 7 days. Each patient will participate in
      this study for up to 7 months (includes the up to 21 days screening period, 14 days treatment
      period, and up to 180 days/6 months follow-up), with 3-monthly post-study follow-up until the
      patient becomes progressive.
