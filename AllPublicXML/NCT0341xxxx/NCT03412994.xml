  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      (1) Evaluate the efficacy of apatinib in combination with standard second-line chemotherapy
      for advanced colorectal cancer. Whether it can prolong Progression Free Survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and reduce symptoms and
      improve quality of life compared with standard second-line chemotherapy; (2) Observe the
      safety of apatinib for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Standard second line chemotherapy includes chemotherapy based on irinotecan or chemotherapy
      based on oxaliplatin.

      Apatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that highly selectively binds to
      and strongly inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), with a
      decrease in VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tumor microvascular
      density. A phase II trail of Apatinib has been demonstrated that Apatinib is safe to treat
      the metastatic colorectal cancer and the disease control rate can reach 50%.
