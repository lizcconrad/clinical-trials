  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to investigate the cardiac uptake of 89Zr-GSK2398852 in
      subjects with transthyretin cardiomyopathy amyloidosis (ATTR-CM), and its biodistribution to
      other organs. Low doses of GSK2398852 will be co-administered at levels not high enough for
      therapeutic benefit. This study will be conducted in two parts: Part A and Part B. Subjects
      in Part A will participate in up to two dosing sessions and subjects in Part B will
      participate in one dosing session. Subjects will undergo up to 3 PET scans at varying
      intervals after 89Zr-GSK2398852 administration. The total duration of study will be
      approximately 3 to 4 months for subjects in Part A and approximately 2 months for subjects in
      Part B. Part B of the study will be triggered based on data obtained in Part A and other
      emerging data.
