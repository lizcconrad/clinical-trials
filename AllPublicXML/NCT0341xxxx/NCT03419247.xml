  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study where fresh tumor tissue and blood samples will be collected from patients
      with advanced biliary tract cancer who will be undergoing 1st line therapy with gemcitabine
      or fluorouracil (5-FU) regimens to see how useful it is to look for changes and
      characteristics in genes (molecules that contain instructions for the development and
      functioning of the cells) and the genes within the tumour to find characteristics that may be
      useful in choosing treatments for patients in the future.

    <textblock>
      Changes (mutations) in genes have been shown to be an important characteristic in cancers.
      Looking at differences in genes in patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract
      cancer and comparing this information with response to their initial chemotherapy treatment
      may help to learn which treatments may be better for certain patients after initial
      treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histological or radiological diagnosis of inoperable or
             metastatic biliary tract cancer (BTC).

          -  Patient must have a tumor lesion that is amenable to a core needle biopsy as judged by
             a staff radiologist.

          -  Patients must have a measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1 in addition to the lesion that is
             going to be biopsied.

          -  Patients must be fit enough to safely undergo a tumor biopsy as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 (Karnofsky ≥60%).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 90 days, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Within 14 days of the proposed biopsy date, patients must have normal organ and marrow
             function.

          -  Patients must undergo systemic treatment with gemcitabine or 5-FU based regimens as
             first line standard systemic palliative treatment with or without other
             investigational agents within a clinical trial.

          -  Ability to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with one or more contraindications to tumor biopsy.

          -  Patients who have had prior systemic treatment (chemotherapy or any other anti-cancer
             agent) in the advanced setting.

          -  Patients who are currently on anti-cancer treatment including chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases are excluded from participation in this clinical
             study.

          -  Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures
