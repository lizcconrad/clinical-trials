  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The daily behaviors such as drinking,coffee and reading may have influence on the function or
      morphology of the retinal microcirculation in healthy people.A recent study found that the
      fingertips microvascular bed constricted obviously after the intake of a cup of coffee with
      caffeine, it significantly reduced blood flow to the fingers; Long reading of electronic
      products can induce significant dry eye symptoms, affect visual quality, and cause
      asthenopia. Microcirculation is critical for regulating vascular resistance and blood flow in
      organs. Fundus blood vessels is the only visible microvascular in vivo, its morphology and
      function changes not only associated with eye disease, but also with cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular diseases. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new technique
      which could acquire blood flow information in a non-invasive way without the use of dye. The
      study tried to detect the influence of daily behaviors such as drinking, coffee and reading
      on the retinal microcirculation with OCTA, and provide reference for health behaviors.
