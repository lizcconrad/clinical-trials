  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects 2 million people in France. It characterized
      by progressive degeneration of the central area of the retina allowing detailed vision. It is
      the main cause of irreversible blindness in France. All patients initially present an early
      form, the latter can evolve in two different ways: the atrophic form, which progresses
      slowly, and the exudative or neovascular form, of more rapid evolution. While the treatment
      of exudative AMD has improved dramatically in recent years, there is currently no therapy for
      atrophic AMD. Recently, it has been demonstrated in atrophic AMD, an accumulation of
      inflammatory cells, macrophages, in the sub-retinal space. This space is located between the
      pigment epithelium (PE) and the photoreceptors. It is physiologically devoid of immune cells
      (immune privilege). Macrophages will secrete many pro-inflammatory molecules, such as
      cytokines. It has been shown in mouse models that some cytokines (IL-1beta, IL6 et TNFalpha)
      have a deleterious role on (PE) and photoreceptors. The identification of specific cytokines
      in the aqueous humor of patients with atrophic AMD would help to better understand this
      disease and consider potential targeted therapies. This study will be conducted in the
      ophthalmology department of the Croix-Rousse Hospital in Lyon. 80 patients will be recruited
      and divided into 4 groups: three experimental groups of 20 patients with : Early /
      Intermediate AMD, atrophic AMD or exudative AMD, and one control group of 20 patients without
      signs of AMD. Assays of the markers will be performed using the Luminex® technique on aqueous
      humor and blood samples collected for all patients during cataract surgery. The
      concentrations obtained in the aqueous humor will be normalized on their respective blood
      levels in order to confirm the intraocular secretion of these markers,. The identification of
      particular cytokine profiles in atrophic AMD compared to other forms of AMD would support
      emerging hypotheses of involvement of specific inflammatory cells in this pathology. There is
      currently no treatment available for atrophic AMD. If molecular screening identifies one or
      more specific biomarkers, targeted therapy may be considered.

    <description>Aqueous humor sample will be collected during the cataract surgery in patient with atrophic AMD and in patient of control group.
