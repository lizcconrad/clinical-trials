  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of radiotherapy using Hypofractionated image - guided helical
      tomotherapy after hyperbaric oxygen HBO therapy for treatment of recurrent malignant
      High-grade gliomas. HBO therapy will be perform in conjunction with each RT session.

      The treatment scheme is:

      Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (the maximum period of time from completion of decompression
      to RT is 60 min) followed by tomotherapy (3-5 consecutive sessions- one fraction per day , 5
      Gy / die ).

      The trial will enroll 24 patients in 24 months with a follow-up period of 1 year.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to evaluate the efficacy of hypofractionated image- guided helical
      tomotherapy after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) for treatment of recurrent malignant high -
      grade gliomas The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the disease control rate
      (DCR) of treated patients.

      The secondary Objectives are:

        -  Safety assessment (acute and late toxicity).

        -  Overall Survival (OS),

        -  Progression Free Survival (PFS).

        -  Evaluation of predictive score of disease, radionecrosis and pseudoprogression using
           perfusion DSC and DCE MRI

      Patients will receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy using tomotherapy combined with
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy.

      Hyperbaric oxygenation therapy (the maximum period of time from completion of decompression
      to RT is 60 min) followed by tomotherapy (3-5 consecutive sessions- one fraction per day, 5
      Gy / die).

      The overall duration of treatment will be max 5 days.
