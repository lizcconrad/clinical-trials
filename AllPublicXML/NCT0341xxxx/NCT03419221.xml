  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      S. aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) is a severe disease associated with a 30% case-fatality
      rate at 12 weeks. Severity of this disease is related to the high prevalence of
      staphylococcal Deep Foci of Infection (SA-DFI), which require prolonged duration of
      antimicrobial therapy and specific treatment. Timely diagnosis and management of SA-DFI is
      associated with an improvement of prognosis during SAB. 18 FDG PET/CT (PET/CT) is a useful
      tool in the diagnosis of infectious foci during bacterial infections.

      An ecological study performed in the Netherlands has shown that use of PET/CT in patients
      with Gram positive cocci bloodstream infection was associated with an increase of detection
      of DFI and a decrease of recurrences and mortality compared to historical controls.

      The investigators hypothesize that SAB poor prognosis is in part related to the lack of
      diagnosis of all infectious foci and consequently to a suboptimal treatment.

      Subjects will be recruited in medical wards of the 10 participating hospitals. Each included
      patient will be managed according to clinical expertise of investigators who all are experts
      in the field of infectious diseases. Consensual guidelines for antimicrobial therapy of
      patients enrolled in the study will be written before the enrolment of the first patient by
      the steering committee composed of all co-investigators These guidelines will specify the
      nature of empiric therapy as well as adapted antibiotic therapy for each specific DFI for
      methicillin-sensitive as well as for methicillin resistant S. aureus.

      Experimental group: arm A All patients enrolled in arm A will have a PET/CT after enrolment
      and not later than day 14 after the drawing of first positive blood culture.

      Control group: arm B Patients enrolled in arm B will not have PET/CT before day 14. Other
      imaging studies will be guided by anamnesis and clinical symptoms and performed according to
      guidelines written consensually before the enrolment of the first patient by the steering
      committee

Deep collection without any other explanation than S. aureus infection
Osteomyelitis or arthritis without any other explanation than S. aureus infection; in case of presence of material (osteosynthesis or prosthetic joint) the presence of clinical symptoms or bacteriological confirmation will be required because the specificity of imaging including PET/CT is low
