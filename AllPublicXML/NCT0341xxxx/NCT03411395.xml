  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been shown that a carbonated water including a defined amount of amino
      acids and chromium can decrease the postprandial glucose response. In this study, the effect
      of three different doses of amino acids on glucose excursions after a standardized test meal
      will be evaluated in healthy subjects. The study will be conducted in a randomized, single
      center, crossover, double-blinded, placebo controlled design including 25 participants. The
      primary endpoint of the study is the incremental area under the curve for capillary blood
      glucose (iAUC) within 180 minutes after ingestion of the meal.
