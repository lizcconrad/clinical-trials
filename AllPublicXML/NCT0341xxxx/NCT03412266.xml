  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen in
      low- and intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients who receive haploidentical
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). Haplo-HSCT is an effective treatment
      option for MDS patients who did not have identical sibling donor (ISD) or unrelated donor
      (URD). However, post-transplant transplant-related mortality (TRM) is one of the major causes
      for transplant failure in MDS patients, and the risk of TRM for haplo-HSCT recipients was
      higher than that of ISD recipients. RIC regimen can decrease the risk of TRM for haplo-HSCT
      recipients; however, the risk for relapse may increase in these patients. Thus, RIC regimen
      may be more appropriate for low- and intermediate-risk MDS patients receiving haplo-HSCT. The
      study hypothesis: Using RIC haplo-HSCT regimen in patients with low- and risk MDS can reduce
      TRM and improve survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RIC regimen was given for low and intermediate MDS patients who would receive haplo-HSCT. The
      primary end point was transplant-related mortality. The secondary end points were overall
      survival, disease-free survival, relapse, , graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infections.
      Following time is 1 years.
