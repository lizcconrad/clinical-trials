  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study sought to translate laboratory research on learning and memory to better
      understand the mechanisms and methods for implementing exposure therapy for unwanted
      obsessional thoughts. Specifically, we compared the processes and the short- and long-term
      outcomes of: (a) gradual exposure (EXP-G), emphasizing hierarchical exposure completion,
      versus (b) variable exposure (EXP-V), emphasizing variability in exposure intensity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although preliminary research suggests that learning to tolerate varying levels of fear
      during exposure enhances outcomes for some anxiety-related problems, no previous study has
      examined this possibility in the context of unwanted obsessions. Adults with a moderately
      distressing obsessional thought were randomly assigned to four twice-weekly sessions of
      either: (a) gradual exposure (EXP-G), emphasizing hierarchical exposure completion, or (b)
      variable exposure (EXP-V), emphasizing variability in exposure intensity.

    <description>The DOCS-UT is a self-report measure of the clinical severity of the unwanted thoughts (UT) OCD symptom dimension.

    <description>The BAT is an in vivo measure of participants' behavioral responses to their target obsession.

    <description>In EXP-V, exposure stimuli were chosen at random (i.e., pieces of paper with exposure stimuli written on them were pulled randomly from an opaque container) so that mild, moderate, and high intensity exposures could occur in any order during any of the sessions (the participant was not informed which level was coming next). This aimed to maximize (a) uncertainty, (b) variability in exposure intensity, and (c) variability in corresponding physiological arousal.</description>
