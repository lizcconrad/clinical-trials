  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of ETC-1907206 in combination with dasatinib in certain types of
      blood cancers. The first phase of the study (1A) is designed to find the highest tolerated
      dose of ETC-1907206, while the second phase (1B) will assess the safety and tolerability of
      the recommended dose of ETC-1907206. ETC-1907206 has been designed to block the activity of
      an enzyme of the body known as Mnk kinase, which is thought to be involved in the development
      of a variety of cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts: a Phase 1A dose escalation to identify the MTD and the RD
      of ETC-1907206 administered in combination with dasatinib and a Phase 1B expansion at the RD.

      Phase 1A: A dose escalation with an adaptive design model using ordinal continual
      reassessment method (oCRM) will be used to characterise the dose toxicity curve of
      ETC-1907206 when administered orally every other day (EOD) under fasted conditions in
      combination with oral once daily dasatinib (per locally approved product prescribing
      instructions) in order to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD)
      for Phase 1B.

      Phase 1B: Open-label, non-randomised, to assess preliminary clinical activity and safety of
      ETC-1907206 administered orally EOD under fasted conditions at the RD identified in Phase 1A,
      in combination with dasatinib (per locally approved product prescribing instructions).

      Patients will continue in the study until disease progression, the start of new anti-cancer
      therapy, unacceptable toxicity, death, or the completion of 12 separate 4-week treatment
      cycles, whichever occurs first.

      As long as the Sponsor agrees to continue treatment, patients who complete 12 cycles of
      treatment and have no evidence of disease progression are allowed to continue on treatment
      past the end of treatment (EOT) visit until there is disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, the patient decides to withdraw, or it is judged not to be in the patient's
      interest to continue on the study.

      Malignancy assessments of the underlying disease at enrolment (blood and bone marrow),
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling
      for ETC-1907206 and dasatinib, sample collection for ETC-1907206 and dasatinib biomarker
      analysis, and safety and tolerability assessments will be performed during the study.

        who have exhausted all available therapy.

        Subgroup-specific intolerance definition: [Intolerance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
        or other approved treatments for CML-AP, CML-BC and Ph+ ALL; to approved treatments for Ph-
        ALL] defined as:

          -  Non-haematologic intolerance:

        Patients with Grade 3 or 4 toxicity while on therapy, or with persistent Grade 2 toxicity,
        unresponsive to optimal management, including dose adjustments (unless a dose reduction is
        not considered in the best interest of the patient if response is already suboptimal) in
        absence of: major haematologic response (MaHR) for accelerated phase (AP), blast crisis
        (BC) or Ph+ ALL patients; complete remission (CR) or complete haematological response with
        partial haematologic recovery of peripheral blood count (CRh) for Ph- ALL.

          -  Haematologic intolerance:

        Patients with Grade 3 or 4 toxicity [absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or platelets] while on
        therapy that is recurrent after dose reduction to the lowest dose recommended by drug
        manufacturers in the absence of: MaHR for AP, BC or Ph+ ALL patients; CR or CRh for Ph-
        ALL.

        NOTE: For dasatinib, non-haematologic and haematologic intolerance is defined as: CTCAE
        Grade &gt; 2 requiring discontinuation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:

          1. Is a male patient with sexual partner(s) of childbearing potential who is unwilling to
             use a highly effective method of contraception, one of which includes a condom.
             Sexually active male patients must use a condom during intercourse throughout the
             study and for 12 weeks after the end of treatment and should not father a child in
             this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomised males in order to
             prevent potential delivery of the study drug via seminal fluid. Female partners of
             male patients must be advised to also use one of the following contraception methods:

               -  intrauterine device or intrauterine system;

               -  prior sterilisation; or

               -  total abstinence from male/female intercourse.

          2. Is a female patient of childbearing potential, defined as a female physiologically
             capable of becoming pregnant (including a female whose career, lifestyle, or sexual
             orientation precludes intercourse with a male partner, and females whose partners have
             been sterilised by vasectomy or other means), unless they are using a highly effective
             method for birth control throughout the study and for 12 weeks after the end of
             treatment. Highly effective methods for birth control include the following:

               -  Total abstinence: This is an acceptable method when this is consistent with the
                  preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g.,
                  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
                  not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Female sterilisation: The patient has had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with
                  or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior to taking study
                  drug. In case of an oophorectomy alone, the reproductive status of the patient
                  must have been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment.

               -  Male partner sterilisation: The patient has the appropriate post-vasectomy
                  documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. (For female patients on
                  the study, the vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient.) These patients must also agree to the use an intrauterine device or
                  intrauterine system AND a barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive
                  cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, gel, film, or
                  cream, or vaginal suppository. Reliable contraception must be maintained
                  throughout the study and for 12 weeks after study drug discontinuation.

               -  Females considered post-menopausal and not of childbearing potential: The
                  definition applies to females who have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous)
                  amenorrhoea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history
                  of vasomotor symptoms) or 6 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea with serum
                  follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 million international units per
                  milliliter (mIU/mL) (for US only: and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL) or have had surgical
                  bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 6 weeks prior to
                  starting treatment. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                  status of the patient has been confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment is
                  she considered not of childbearing potential.

          3. Is a pregnant or nursing (lactating) female, where pregnancy is defined as the state
             of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) laboratory test (&gt; 5 mIU/mL).

             &gt;2

          5. Has received anti-cancer therapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter
             (except for hydroxyurea, steroids, allopurinol, febuxostat, rasburicase, and
             intravenous hydration), prior to starting study drug or the side effects of such
             therapy have not resolved to Grade ≤1 within 2 weeks prior to starting study drug.

          6. Is receiving concomitant anti-cancer therapy (except for hydroxyurea, steroids,
             anagrelide, allopurinol, febuxostat, rasburicase, and intravenous hydration during the
             first week of the study drug[s] administration, or corticosteroids when appropriate).

          7. Has used other investigational drugs within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             shorter) prior to the first dose of study drug.

          8. Has undergone autologous or allogenic stem cell transplantation &lt; 60 days prior to the
             first dose of study drug;

         14. Has ECG evidence of complete left bundle branch block, or ventricular pacing.

         15. Has abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG that in the opinion of the Investigator increase
             the risk of participating in the study (e.g., sinus rhythm with PR interval &gt; 240 ms
             or second degree or higher atrioventricular (AV) block confirmed by a repeat ECG).

         16. Has blood pressure and heart rate (HR) higher than 160/100 mmHg and 100 beats per
             minute (bpm), respectively, or lower than 80/50 mm Hg and 45 bpm, respectively,
             confirmed by a repeat assessment.

             systemic (including opportunistic) clinically significant infections or any other
             significant or unstable concurrent medical illness that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would preclude protocol therapy.

         24. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sero positivity and/or is
             receiving combination anti retroviral therapy.

         25. Has a history of gastric bypass surgery or with pre-existing gastrointestinal
