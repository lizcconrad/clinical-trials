  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with Parkinson's disease, the characteristic motor symptoms, i.e., slowness of
      movement (bradykinesia), tremor and rigidity, are consequences of the progressive
      degeneration of neurons containing and releasing dopamine. The first-line treatment of
      Parkinson´s is oral administration of levodopa - a precursor to dopamine that (unlike
      dopamine) passes the blood brain barrier. After the first few years of treatment with
      levodopa, many patients do however develop a highly variable response to the drug
      characterised by rapid shifts between impaired locomotion and drug induced dyskinesias
      (referred to as the on-off syndrome). This is cased by the marked variation in serum levodopa
      levels following per oral administration, and it is known that intravenous administration of
      levodopa give a more stable level of levodopa with improved on-off symptoms.

      Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) - under the name of Duodopa® - is delivered directly
      to the proximal jejunum via a tube connected to a portable infusion pump. Infusion of Duodopa
      in the jejunum bypasses gastric emptying, helping to avoid the fluctuation in plasma levodopa
      levels. However, while clearly confirming that an even administration of levodopa is of
      considerable benefit to Parkinson patients with on-off symptomatology, the LCIG approach is
      marred by the need for surgery (for the insertion of the intestinal tube) and various
      possible complications following this, as well as by side effects such as abdominal pain.

      Researchers have now succeeded in producing a physiologically acceptable levodopa solution
      (called Infudopa) in a concentration allowing for a continuous intravenous (i.v.) or
      subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of therapeutic doses to humans. Early experience of this
      strategy confirms that both s.c. and i.v. administration of this solution results in even
      serum levodopa levels and markedly improved motor functioning. The aim of this study is to
      compare the pharmacokinetic profile of Infudopa administered i.v. and s.c. with that of
      Duodopa administered enterally in parkinsonian patients with on-off complications.

      IPO-001 is a prospective, randomized, 3-period cross-over, open-label multicentre trial
      comparing intravenous and subcutaneous Infudopa with intestinal Duodopa. The patients will be
      identified and recruited at neurology clinics at university hospital clinical sites in
      Sweden, and travel from their living location to a clinical phase I site with full Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) standard at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg for the
      three treatment visits.

      At the phase I study clinic, patients will receive Duodopa at optimal dosage for 16 hours at
      one of the treatment visits, i.v. Infudopa at a concentration estimated to yield
      corresponding serum levels of levodopa for the same duration at another treatment visit, and
      they will again receive the corresponding amount of levodopa but in the form of s.c. Infudopa
      at a third visit. The study will hence have a cross-over design with a minimum of three days
      on Duodopa between the different treatment visits, where the order of treatments will be
      non-blinded but randomized.

      Blood samples will be drawn according to a set schedule during the treatment visits, and
      subjects will be monitored for safety throughout the study, with focus on the local
      tolerability at the injection sites of i.v. and s.c. administration.

The occurrence of dyskinesia during these items will be assessed according to the definitions of the Modified Dyskinesia Scale (Goetz et al. 1994).

          3. Patients who are considered to be violent or patients considered at suicidal risk by
             the investigator

          4. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory data at baseline or any abnormal laboratory
             value that could interfere with the study assessments

          5. Patients with serious symptomatic cerebral disease, cerebrovascular disease, focal
             neurological lesions (previous brain surgery), any acute brain trauma requiring
             treatment with anticonvulsant therapy, or acute stroke

          6. Current diagnosis or history of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months of baseline

          8. History of, or current, seizure disorders and patients requiring treatment with
             anticonvulsants

          9. History or presence of any condition that might interfere with absorption,
             distribution, metabolism, or excretion of study drug, however, the PEG/J (percutaneous
             endoscopic gastrojejunostomy) tube that Duodopa patients have is not considered as
             such condition

         10. Patients on medication with warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban,
             monoamine oxidase-A inhibitors and alpha-methyldopa (within last 60 days); selegiline,

             methylphenidate, amphetamine, beta blockers for treating tremor, isoprenaline,
             adrenaline, dobutamide, reserpine, flunarizine or cinnarizine, isoniazid,
             metoclopramide, and anticholinergics (within last 30 days); and iron salts (within
             last 7 days), or any other treatment that could affect the metabolism of levodopa

         11. Patients who use antineoplastic and immunosuppressants (within the last 5 years), and
             drugs known to increase risks for cardiac toxicity, Torsade de Pointes, sudden death

             the duration of the study)
