  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arkansas has one of the highest rates for food insecurity and 27.7% of children in the
      University of Arkansas area are food insecure. In addition, more than 14% of children ages
      2-4 are obese and 20% of children ages 10-17 are obese. In Northwest Arkansas, the area
      surrounding the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville (Washington County), the food
      insecurity rate for adults is 17.9% (an estimated 34,730 individuals) and the food insecurity
      rate for children under 17 years of age is 24.4% (12,150 individuals). In addition, the
      surrounding counties have similar food insecurity rates (This makes Northwest Arkansas an
      ideal location to conduct a pilot study focusing on egg supplementation, childhood obesity,
      and food insecurity
      (http://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america/our-research/map-the-meal-gap).
