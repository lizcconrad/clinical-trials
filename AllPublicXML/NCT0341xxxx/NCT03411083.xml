  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this cohort study, we will investigate short and long term outcomes after knee replacement
      surgery and identify preoperative and early postoperative factors associated with long term
      outcome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients follow the same fast-track program for elective knee replacement surgery at the
      Silkeborg Regional Hospital in Denmark, which includes detailed preoperative written
      information, multidisciplinary education course for patients and relatives, optimized
      multimodal pain treatment and early postoperative rehabilitation. Before the admission for
      surgery, patients will be asked to fulfill several questionnaires and baseline information
      regarding work situation, educational level and previous treatments. At two weeks there,
      there is a scheduled follow up by a physical therapist and a nurse at the hospital. At three
      months there is a scheduled follow up by telephone with a physical therapist.

      The study will adhere methodologically to the STROBE guidelines and checklist for prospective
      cohort studies (www.strobe-statement.org).

      Further description is provided elsewhere as eligibility criteria and outcome measures.
