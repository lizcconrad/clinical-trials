  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the head and neck,
      and its incidence has increased in recent years. Extensive surgery with neck dissection and
      chemo/radio/ targeted therapy is the current treatment for OSCC, and despite great progress
      in chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted therapy in the last three decades, the prognosis
      of OSCC is still poor due to aggressive local invasion and metastasis, which lead to
      recurrence. Postoperative tumor recurrence confers a poor prognosis in OSCC and a poor
      quality of life. The 5-year survival rate is over 90% in OSCC patients without recurrence and
      30% in patients with recurrence, with a median survival of 76.8 months in patients without
      recurrence and 42.5 months in patients with recurrence . Therefore, it is important to
      identify biomarkers that may predict the postoperative recurrence of OSCC. Also, some of the
      OSCC are preceded by precursor lesions. In the oral cavity the most common lesions recognized
      as potentially malignant are leukoplakia and erythroplakia, but it is also apparent that as
      many as 50% of OSCC arise from apparently clinically normal mucosa. The prognostic
      significance of an individual lesion is difficult to determin. At present therefore, the gold
      standard for the assessment of oral potentially malignant lesions is microscopic evaluation
      of haematoxylin and eosin stained sections for the presence of architectural and cytological
      changes, which are generally referred to as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED). The human
      microbiome is defined as the collective genomes of the microbes (composed of bacteria,
      bacteriophages, fungi, protozoa and viruses) that live inside and on the human body, and
      there are approximately 10 microbes and 100 microbial genes for each human cell and gene
      respectively. With the advent of next generation sequencing technology, the Human Microbiome
      Project delineated the composition of healthy microbial communities associated to different
      body sites in healthy individuals, including the oral cavity [Human microbiome consortium].
      As opposed to a normal (healthy) microbiome, a disrupted microbiome or dysbiosis represents
      the lack of equilibrium, and is hypothetically related to disease. Interestingly, the healthy
      oral microbiome shows relative intraindividual stability over time, suggesting that
      differences in microbiome profiles may serve as useful tools for the identification of
      disease states. The working hypothesis is that in OSCC patients, the oral microbiome is
      altered in comparison to healthy individuals and certain microbial signatures are
      characteristic of healthy versus disease. In addition, in precursor conditions, i.e., oral
      epithelial dysplasia (OED), a partial alteration in the composition of the microbiome may
      predict the progression to malignancy.Also, during treatment, it could be that specific
      microbial signatures are associated with incomplete eradication, tendency to local recurrence
      or metastatic potential.Correlations to local recurrence (LR), distant metastases (DM) or
      disease free survival (DFS) adjusted to clinicopathologic correlations will be sought. In
      this study, buccal mucosa samples will be collected from patients with OSCC, OED and from
      healthy individuals , after signing for informed consent, according to Helsinky protocol.
      Routine pathologic diagnosis will be performed by expert Pathology physicians in our center.
      Data will be correlated to demographic and clinical data obtained from medical records. This
      will be carried out in line with institutional ethical guidelines.
