  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-arm, multi-center, interventional post-market study. After signing
      informed consent, eligible subjects will be implanted with the CE marked Evolut™ PRO system.

      The investigation purpose is to evaluate the acute and long term clinical performance and
      safety of Evolut™ PRO in a routine hospital setting in patients with symptomatic native
      aortic valve stenosis or a stenosed, insufficient, or combined surgical bioprosthetic valve
      failure necessitating valve replacement within the approved intended use in local geography.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 600 subjects implanted with the Evolut™ PRO at up to 40 sites in Europe. Other
      regions may be added depending on the regulatory status of the device.

    <description>Change in Quality of Life score (EQ-5D questionnaire) from baseline to 30-day, and 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year post procedure. The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises five dimensions and each dimension has five levels of severity. The subject is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. The EQ VAS records the subject's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale. The subject marks an X on the scale to indicate how his/her health is TODAY and then writes the number they marked on the scale in the box below.</description>
