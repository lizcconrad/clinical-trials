      Primary Objectives:

        -  Main study: To assess in overweight to obese subjects and type 2 diabetes mellitus
           (T2DM) patients not requiring anti-diabetic pharmacotherapy the safety and tolerability
           of 3 different dose escalation regimens of SAR425899 in terms of the relative and
           absolute frequency and severity of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AEs).

        -  Six-month safety extension period: To assess the safety and tolerability of SAR425899
           after 6 months treatment at the maximum dose that was individually well tolerated during
           the main part of the study in terms of the relative and absolute frequency and severity
           of GI AEs.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Main study and 6-month study extension period:

      To assess in overweight to obese subjects and T2DM patients not requiring anti-diabetic
      pharmacotherapy:

        -  The effect of once-daily dosing of SAR425899 on body weight (BW), fasting plasma glucose
           (FPG), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).

        -  Safety and tolerability.
