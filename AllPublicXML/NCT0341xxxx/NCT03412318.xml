  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to comparatively evaluate the post operative pain between root canal preparation by
      reciprocating file (TF) and full rotation file (M-Pro) in patients with single rooted teeth
      with acute irreversible pulpits.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis are selected according to the eligibility and
      exclusion criteria and patients are then randomized to receive treatment after using Twisted
      files or M-pro files. The treatment is done in single visit. The postoperative pain is then
      assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale 6,12, 24 and 48 hours post-instrumentation.
