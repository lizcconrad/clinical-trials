    <textblock>
      Within this clinical study patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency will be investigated
      by clinical and biochemical examination as well as questionnaire to identify predisposing
      factors for adrenal crisis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic adrenal insufficiency (AI) are at risk of suffering from
      life-threatening adrenal crisis (AC), despite established hormone replacement therapies and
      patient education. Recent retrospective analyses observed different risk factors for AC, e.g.
      primary AI and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients that already experienced an AC seem to
      have an increased risk to develop further AC. The aim of the study is to evaluate potential
      risk factors/predisposing factors for AC in patients with chronic primary and secondary AI
      (PAI/SAI). Patients with chronic AI are assessed by clinical and biochemical examination and
      questionnaire to evaluate the quality of hormone replacement therapy with glucocorticoids,
      education status, cortisol-metabolism, catecholamine deficit, chronic inflammation and
      variations of the glucocorticoid receptor. AI patients with a high frequency of AC will be
      compared to matched controls (age, sex and cause of AI) with no AC or a low frequency of AC
      in the past.
