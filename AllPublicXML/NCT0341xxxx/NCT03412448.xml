  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The authors propose to evaluate the prevalence of chronic post-operative pain (CPOP) and
      continued opioid use in the population that has undergone cardiac surgery at the Montreal
      Heart Institute. In addition, the authors wish to evaluate the presence of known risk factors
      for CPOP in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a 15-minute telephone survey to prospectively evaluate the prevalence and
      intensity of chronic pain 6 months and 1 year after cardiac surgery. Data on the level of
      post-operative pain experienced on days 1 to 4, at the time of surgery, as well as opioid
      consumption, adjuvant pain treatments and other variables of interest that are currently
      recorded prospectively at time of surgery will be culled from patient charts. Additionally,
      the possibility of continued opioid use by patients at 6 months post-surgery will be
      evaluated.
