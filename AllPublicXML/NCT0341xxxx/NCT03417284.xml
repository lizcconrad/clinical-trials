    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the recommended dose level and dosing
      schedule of Evomela that can help prevent multiple myeloma from coming back in patients who
      are receiving an autologous stem cell transplant. The safety of using this drug before a
      transplant will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Evomela is FDA approved and commercially available for use
      before stem cell transplants. It is investigational to compare different dosing schedules of
      the drug and to use a higher dose of Evomela than the FDA approved dose.

      The study doctor can describe how Evomela is designed to work.

      Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. You will have an equal chance of
      being assigned to either group.

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive Evomela by vein over 30-60 minutes.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive Evomela by vein over 8-9 hours.

      Up to 2 dose levels will be tested in each group. You will be assigned to a dose level of
      Evomela based on when you join this study. Up to 15 participants will be enrolled at each
      dose level in each group. The first sets of participants will receive the lowest dose level.
      Each new set will receive a higher dose than the set before it, if no intolerable side
      effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of Evomela is found.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will first have a central venous catheter (CVC) placed. A CVC is a sterile flexible tube
      that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will
      explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate
      consent form.

      You will receive Evomela to help prepare your body for the stem cell infusion. The day you
      receive the stem cell transplant is called Day 0. The days before you receive your stem cell
      transplant are called minus days. The days after you receive the stem cell transplant are
      called plus days.

      On Days -5, -4, and -3, you will receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day as
      an outpatient to help decrease the risk of side effects in the mouth and throat.

      On Day -3, you will be admitted to the hospital and given fluids by vein to hydrate you.

      On Day -2, you will receive Evomela by vein over 30-60 minutes or 8-9 hours.

      On Day -1, you will rest.

      Since Evomela may cause mouth blisters/sores, you will be instructed to keep crushed ice in
      your mouth.

      If you will receive Evomela over 30-60 minutes, you will be instructed to keep ice in your
      mouth starting 30 minutes before the infusion, during the infusion, and for at least 2 hours
      after the end of the infusion.

      If you will receive Evomela over 8-9 hours, you will be instructed to keep ice in your mouth
      starting 30 minutes before the infusion, during the infusion (as long as you can tolerate
      it), and for at least 2 hours after the end of the infusion.

      On Day 0, you will receive the stem cell transplant by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

      On Days +1, +2, and +3, you will receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day to
      help decrease the risk of side effects in the mouth and throat.

      Starting on Day +5, you will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) as an injection just under your skin
      1 time each day until your blood cell levels return to normal. The study doctor will discuss
      this with you, including how filgrastim is given and its risks.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over when you have completed the 1-year visit. After
      the 1-year visit, you should have standard of care follow-up visits and/or tests to check the
      status of the disease. Your study doctor can discuss this with you in detail. Your
      information will still be collected even if you go on to another treatment.

      You will be taken off study if the disease comes back after transplant, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. If you are unable or
      unwilling to have follow-up visits and/or study tests, you may also be taken off study.

      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine follow-up visits after the
      transplant, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have begun to receive the study drug
      but before you receive the stem cells.

      Study Tests:

      As part of your standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the
      transplant. Starting on Day -2 until you are discharged from the hospital, blood (about 2
      teaspoons) will be drawn every day to check for side effects, for routine tests, to check
      your kidney and liver function, and to check for infections. This may be repeated more
      frequently, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      After you are sent home from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to be checked
      for infections and other transplant-related side effects until about 3 months after
      transplant. During this time, you will return to the clinic 2 times each week or more often
      if your doctor thinks it is needed. At each visit, you will have a physical exam, and blood
      (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      About 3 months after the transplant:

        -  You will have a PET scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease. To
           collect a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with
           anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is withdrawn through a large
           needle.

      Every 3 months during the first year after the transplant, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will
      be drawn and urine will be collected to check your immune response and status of the disease.

      About 1 year after the transplant:

        -  You will have a bone survey (series of x-rays) to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to check the status of the disease.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing:

      Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing at different schedules,
      depending on when you are enrolled in this study. PK testing measures the amount of study
      drug in the body at different time points. The first 30 participants will have Intense PK
      Testing, and the remaining 60 participants will have Sparse PK Testing. The study doctor will
      tell you which schedule you will follow:

        -  If you have Intense PK Testing, blood will be drawn 1 time before and 8 times over 8
           hours after your first dose of Evomela. If you receive the drug over 8-9 hours, some of
           these draws will take place while you are receiving the drug.

        -  If you have Sparse PK Testing, blood will be drawn before and 4 times over the 8 hours
           after your first dose of Evomela. If you receive the drug over 8-9 hours, some of these
           draws will take place while you are receiving the drug.

      You will be given a heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of
      needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed,
      you will be taken off study. The study doctor will discuss this with you.
