      This study is a randomized 1:1 placebo-controlled 12-week study of Mirabegron in 144
      Parkinson's subjects the age of 40 to 80 with overactive bladder. Active drug will be
      Mirabegron 50mg daily. Subjects will be enrolled based on response to an overactive bladder
      questionnaire at visit 1. Enrolled subjects will have 3 study visits to the clinic as well as
      1 phone visit.
