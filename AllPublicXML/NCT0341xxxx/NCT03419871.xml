  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal study to examine the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and
      child behavior problems in a community sample of toddlers (12-24 months- ages 12-15 months at
      enrollment) living in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes

      The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress
      (allostatic load), and health among toddlers living in economically stressed communities.
      Sleep difficulty, including short sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency, is closely
      related to measures of stress, including interleukin (IL-6), cortisol, c-reactive proteins
      (CRP), secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), and body mass index (BMI) and may therefore
      contribute to 'wear and tear' on the body (allostatic load), a problem that places children
      at high risk of physical and mental health problems. Young children who live with
      socioeconomic adversity are especially vulnerable to both sleep difficulty and higher levels
      of physiologic stress (allostatic load).

    <description>An accelerometer will be placed on the wrist or ankle of the child while the child sleeps in their home. Caregivers will be instructed to keep the accelerometer on their toddler's ankle to measure sleep duration, latency and sleep efficiency. Seven nights of data will be obtained because actigraphy is most reliably measured in young children over this time frame.</description>

    <description>Salivary and hair cortisol measurements were used to obtain a change in baseline from 12 to 24 months. Data on the timing of the saliva collection will be collected using a Medical Electronic Monitoring System (MEMScapTM) - a digital memory cap that records the timing and frequency of opening.
Cortisol will be measure in the morning and bedtime samples. A small amount of hair (30mg) will be cut from the posterior vertex of the child's head. Due to the expected variability in hair length of toddlers, documentation of hair length will be completed. Each centimeter represents 1 month history of stress and ideally 3 cm of hair length will be collected to provide a three month history of stress.</description>
