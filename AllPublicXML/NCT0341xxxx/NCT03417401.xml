  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib study investigates the safety and efficacy of performing a retinal vein
      cannulation with recombinant tissue Plasminogen Activator infusion into a retinal vein with
      the help of an updated dedicated surgical stabiliser for the treatment of central retinal
      vein occlusion.
