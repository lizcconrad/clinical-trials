  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our project highlights one of the primary areas of research within the Kansas Intellectual
      and Developmental Research Center— language and communication. Specifically, we focus on
      language and communication in children with autism and minimal verbal skills (less than 20
      spoken words). Remaining nonverbal past the age of 5 years has been considered a poor
      prognostic indicator for future language developments (Picket et al., 2009), yet few
      interventions have been developed to address this problem. The Specific Aims for this project
      are (1) to further investigate a multimodal intervention for school-age children with minimal
      verbal skills—defined as less than 20 words spontaneously spoken, signed, or selected via
      graphic symbol selection—and (2) to identify significant covariates associated with
      differential responding to the intervention. The research addresses an unmet need to promote
      spoken word production in children who remain essentially nonverbal well past the ages
      associated with speech acquisition. The project is also innovative because: a) it
      investigates a multimodal intervention based on principles of phonotactic probability and
      neighborhood density in combination with augmentative and alternative communication (AAC),
      and b) it investigates novel predictors of treatment response that are obtained through
      cutting-edge technologies. We propose that this intervention will have better success than
      past interventions because we will provide increased input through speech, digitized speech
      and visual images and additional speech sound practice for words that are comprised of high
      frequency sounds in the child's repertoire. Extant speech sounds in each participant's
      repertoire will be identified using LENA™ digitized recordings. Vocabulary words will then be
      selected based on a child's speech sound repertoire and principles of word learning—words
      with high probability speech sound sequences will be selected and taught with either our
      multimodal intervention or a treatment as usual condition. Responses to these interventions
      will be evaluated using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART) design. We
      propose that different outcomes will be associated with individual and environmental
      predictors identified in our previous research. Individual predictors include verbal
      comprehension, imitation skills, adaptive behavior, nonverbal speech sound repertoire, and
      communication complexity. Communication complexity will be measured with the Communication
      Complexity Scale (CCS), developed by the Principal Investigator. Environmental predictors
      include language input to the child as measured with LENA™ recording devices. Results will
      determine if our multimodal intervention is more successful than treatment as usual for
      teaching word productions, but will also identify the individual and environmental profiles
      associated with differential outcomes. Our discoveries will lead to more focused clinical
      trial research and will inform customized intervention practices in schools and clinics.
      Ultimately this line of research aims to improve the lives of children with autism and their
      families through enhanced communication skills.

    <textblock>
      Communication is an essential aspect of life for all individuals including children with
      autism. Many children with autism are severely impaired in their verbal communication
      development and there is a need for additional research demonstrating the effectiveness of
      interventions that improve communication for participants with autism and severe
      communication impairments. The proposed study directly follows from a recently published
      pilot study demonstrating both the feasibility and importance of an intervention designed for
      children with autism and minimal verbal skills (less than 20 words pre-intervention) (Brady
      et al., 2015). We propose to follow up this pilot study with a two stage SMART (Sequential
      Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) design that will allow us to compare results from our
      experimental intervention to a treatment as usual condition, and compare two intensities of
      our multimodal intervention. Further, we will investigate how proposed variables measured at
      the outset of intervention predict responsiveness to the treatment conditions.

      Aim 1. Investigate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention aimed at teaching students
      with autism and minimal verbal skills to produce new words with speech and augmentative
      communication (AAC). Briefly, the multimodal approach combines joint book reading,
      computerized instruction, and AAC. The AAC component teaches participants to select target
      words on speech generating devices in communication routines. All components will focus on
      teaching a set of vocabulary selected for each participant based on results from digitized
      recordings of sounds produced over a 12-hour time period. Target vocabulary will be
      one-syllable words that consist of sounds in each child's phonetic repertoire in sequences
      that are highly represented in the English language (i.e., high phonotactic probability).
      Further, we will determine if increasing intensity leads to better outcomes for participants
      who do not respond to the initial intervention and if increased intensity or regular
      multimodal intervention is better for those who do not respond to treatment as usual. Primary
      outcome measures include:

        -  Total number of words each child learns to say and the number of words each child learns
           to produce with AAC during intervention.

        -  Total number of words each child says in generalization contexts. Generalization of word
           use to classrooms and at home will be measured with recordings from generalization
           probes conducted in homes and classrooms.

      Aim 2. Investigate potential predictor variables for individual differences in learning
      outcomes measured in Aim 1. Results from Brady et al. (2015) showed 5 of 10 participants were
      &quot;high responders&quot; to our multi-modal intervention - learning 18 or more new words over
      approximately 2 months of intervention. However, three participants learned to say only a few
      words and two participants essentially made no progress. Hence, we propose to comprehensively
      examine individual predictors of differential responding and identify variables that will
      enable clinicians to personalize intervention according to specific environmental and
      participant characteristics. The proposed predictor variables are:

        -  Environmental variables: Based on previous research linking the amount and type of
           environmental input to children's word acquisition, we will measure vocabulary input
           from parents and teachers as detected with automated speech recognition technology. We
           will use existing technology available through LENA™ software (Warren et al., 2010) to
           measure total number of words produced by communicative partners and conversational
           turns in home and school environments.

        -  Participant characteristics: Based on our pilot investigation as well as previous
           longitudinal studies, we will determine how the following specific child variables are
           predictive of responsiveness to one of our experimental interventions: verbal imitation,
           receptive vocabulary, adaptive behavior, autism severity, and nonverbal communication
           complexity measured with the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS; Brady et al., 2012).

      Results will drive the development of more effective adaptive language interventions for
      minimally verbal children with autism and related intellectual and developmental
      disabilities.

    <intervention_model_description>Following the selection of target words based on sounds in the child's speech repertoire as described below, participants will be randomly assigned with equal probability to either the multimodal or TAU treatment in phase one. If data indicates a positive slope in the number of words correct in speech production probes and at least 2 words produced with &gt; 80% accuracy, the participant will meet &quot;responder&quot; criterion, and continue in their originally assigned intervention. Participants who do not meet this criterion will be re-assigned to one of the stage 2 treatment conditions as depicted in figure 1. Participants who do not respond to the TAU will be randomly reassigned with equal probability to receive either the multimodal intervention or the high intensity multimodal intervention. Participants will continue in this second stage of intervention until 40 words have been learned or 12 weeks elapse (whichever occurs first).</intervention_model_description>
