    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, two arm, dose escalation, phase I study of oral ONC201 in
      pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) and
      recurrent/refractory H3 K27M gliomas. Arm A will define the RP2D for single agent ONC201 in
      pediatric patients with glioma who are positive for the H3 K27M mutation (positive testing in
      CLIA laboratory) and have completed at least one line of prior therapy. This will allow for
      recurrent patients and also patients who have not yet recurred, but have completed radiation
      and will inevitably recur based on prior clinical experience and the literature. Arm B will
      define the RP2D for ONC201 in combination with radiation in pediatric patients with newly
      diagnosed DIPG.

             unstained slides must be submitted if archival tissue is available from the DIPG. If
             no archival tumor tissue is available, or if H3 K27M status of tumor is unknown, then
             subjects must agree to submit a post-mortem biopsy specimen.

             will be excluded. History of CHF, or MI or stroke in the last 3 months will be
             excluded.

          7. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment within 3
             years of start of study drug.

          8. Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inhibitors during the treatment phase of the study
             and within 72 hours prior to starting study drug administration.

          9. Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4/5 inducers, which include enzyme inducing
             antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (see Appendix B), during the treatment phase of the study
             and within 2 weeks prior to starting treatment. Concurrent dexamethasone is allowed.
