      This study is designed to quantify the ventricular stasis in patients with non-ischemic
      dilated cardiomyopathy by post-processing of 2D color Doppler echocardiography images in
      order to establish the relationship between quantitative variables of intraventricular stasis
      and the prevalence of silent embolic events and/or intraventricular mural thrombosis
      determined by magnetic resonance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, intraventricular mural thrombosis is a
      recognized risk factor for cardioembolic events. The flow stasis accompanying ventricular
      remodeling and myocardial dysfunction could favor the formation of small intracavitary
      thrombi between LV trabeculae, small enough not be detected by conventional imaging
      techniques. Computational post-processing techniques allow a robust and complete
      characterization of numerous aspects of fluid dynamics within the heart using the flow field
      obtained by Echo or MRI imaging, and it is possible to quantify the stasis and washing of
      blood in the left ventricular cavity.

      A cross-sectional study in 80 patients with non-ischemic DCM in sinus rhythm is proposed in
      which an echocardiogram, cardiac and cerebral MRI will be performed. Our objective is to
      quantify the ventricular stasis by post-processing of 2D color Doppler echocardiography
      images in order to establish the relationship between quantifiable intraventricular stasis
      variables and the prevalence of silent and embolic events and intracavitary thrombosis
      determined by magnetic resonance (MRI).

    <time_frame>Within 10 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricle mural thrombosis will be assessed by contrast cardiac MRI. Early after gadolinium contrast administration (3 min), two dimensional T1-weighted fast-field-echo sequences with an inversion-recovery prepulse will be used. A long inversion time (520 ms) will be used to identify intraventricular thrombus as a LV mass with low-signal intensity surrounded by high-signal intensity structures.</description>

    <measure>Silent brain infarcts (SBI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>SBIs diagnosis entails the presence of a focal lesion &gt; 3 mm that meets one of the three following criteria: 1) high signal on DWI isotropic images and low signal on the map of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). DWI sequence allows to detecting ischemic lesions (4 hours) and assessing their chronology. (2) cavitary lesion hyperintense on T2, with no signal (or low) in the FLAIR sequence usually surrounded by a ring gliotic hyperintense, hypointense on T1). (3) hyperintense lesion on T2 / T1 hypointense with prior distribution defect known or new in a follow-up study. The studies will be interpreted by a neuroradiologist blinded to clinical and echocardiographic information. For the assessment of whether the brain infarct is clinically silent, a medical history and physical examination focused on neurological symptoms will be performed including for that purpose the National Institute of Health (USA) questionnaire.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive impact of SBIs</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive impact of SBIs assessed by MMSE. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a tool that can be used to systematically and thoroughly assess mental status. It is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. The maximum score is 30, and the minimum score is 0. A score of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment.
The following three cut-off levels are employed to classify the severity of cognitive impairment: no cognitive impairment = 24-30; mild cognitive impairment = 18-23; severe cognitive impairment = 0-17.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric impact of SBIs</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 10 days after enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropsychiatric impact of SBIs assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression; each set is ranked in terms of severity and scored from 0 to 3. The maximun score for the whole test is 63 and the lowest is 0. The cut-off scores with patients diagnosed as having an affective disorder are the following: none or minimal depression is &lt; 10; mild to moderate depression is 10-18; moderate to severe depression is 19-29; and severe depression is 30-63.</description>
