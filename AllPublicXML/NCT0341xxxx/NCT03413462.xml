    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of HS-25 (20mg) in reducing low density lipoprotein-cholesterol
      (LDL-C) levels after a 12-week period of treatment in adults with primary
      hypercholesterolemia;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the
      effects of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor HS-25 on LDL-C levels in adults who have
      untreated LDL-C levels ranging from 3.36-4.88mmol/L(130-189 mg/dL)and fasting triglyceride
      levels &lt; 350 mg/dL. Eligibility is restricted to 18-75 years old men or women who are using a
      highly effective birth control method or are not of childbearing potential. Patients with
      diabetes, a history of myocardial infarction or other clinical evidence of atherosclerotic
      vascular disease are not eligible for participation in the study.
