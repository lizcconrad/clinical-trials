    <textblock>
      once weekly dosing for 4 weeks in patients with short bowel syndrome who require total
      parenteral nutrition; patients will complete period 1 and after a 6-10 week wash-out, they
      will enter period 2 (active treatment and placebo)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a repeated dose, placebo controlled, double blind, randomised cross-over trial
      investigating safety, efficacy and PD of FE 203799 in 8-10 patients with SBS. Additionally,
      the plasma concentration of FE 203799 will be assessed for determination of the trough and
      post-dose concentration in SBS patients. The patients will receive a subcutaneous (SC) dose
      of 25 mg FE 203799 or placebo once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks, and after a washout period
      of 6-10 weeks, the alternate treatment will be administered once weekly for 4 consecutive
      weeks. Safety follow-up assessments will be performed 6-10 weeks after the last dose in
      treatment period 1 and 4-6 weeks after the last dose in treatment period 2.

      The first two administrations of trial drug in each treatment period will be performed at the
      clinic, while the third and fourth dose can be either self-administered by the patient or
      administered at the clinic if the patient prefers to travel to the site or other
      considerations make a site visit preferable.

      Prior to each administration of trial drug, liver function parameters will be analysed and
      assessed. During each treatment period, patients who develop extremely high or persistently
      elevated liver enzymes following trial drug administration will be discontinued from the
      trial.

      The patients will complete a diary during each treatment period with daily data on parenteral
      support (PS) usage, oral liquid intake at specific periods, trial drug administrations
      performed at home, local tolerability and adverse events (AEs).
