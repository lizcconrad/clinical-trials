  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the CIRCULATE project is to compare the clinical outcomes of CardioCell
      administration in treatment of ischemic damages of cardiovascular system with control group,
      who will receive the placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CIHF trial will enroll 105 patients with randomization into active and placebo therapy
      with 2:1 ratio.

      Additional 5-10 subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive, in a non-blinded
      fashion, labelled CardioCell to determine the early myocardial uptake and retention of IMP.

      The primary research question of this project is to check if the administration of CardioCell
      could improve the clinical outcomes in patients with CIHF. There are several secondary
      questions, defined by secondary endpoints in each cohort, e.g.: if the investigated treatment
      is possible to administered, if the investigated treatment and way of CardioCell
      administration is safe, if it is possible to define any selected subgroup in which the
      treatment results are significantly different than in whole group.
