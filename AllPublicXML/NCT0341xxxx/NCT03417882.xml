      This is a non-randomized, Phase 2, 2-cohort, 2-stage, open-label, multi-center study of
      GRN-1201/sargramostim + pembrolizumab in subjects with PD-L1+ metastatic NSCLC. Both first
      and second line subjects will be enrolled including:

        -  Cohort 1: Subjects with newly diagnosed, metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS ≥ 50%) NSCLC with no
           epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genomic
           tumor aberrations, or

        -  Cohort 2: Subjects with metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS ≥ 1%) NSCLC with progression on or after
           first-line platinum-based regimen. Subjects with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
           with progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations are eligible

      This is a non-randomized, Phase 2, 2-cohort, 2-stage, open-label, multi-center study of
      GRN-1201/sargramostim + pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic PD-L1+ NSCLC.

      Both first and second line subjects will be enrolled including:

        -  Cohort 1: Subjects with newly diagnosed, metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS ≥ 50%) NSCLC with no
           EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations, or

        -  Cohort 2: Subjects with metastatic PD-L1+ (TPS ≥ 1%) NSCLC with progression on or after
           first-line platinum-based regimen. Subjects with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations
           with progression on FDA-approved therapy for these aberrations are eligible.

      Each cohort will follow a Simon two-stage design [1] with up to 43 subjects in Cohort 1 and
      47 subjects in Cohort 2 for a total of 90 subjects enrolled if both cohorts enroll both
      stages. All subjects will receive GRN-1201 at 3.0 mg in combination with 75 µg sargramostim
      and 200 mg pembrolizumab.

      GRN-1201 is to be administered once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every 3-week dosing for an
      additional 12 doses (16 total doses of GRN-1201). Each dose of GRN-1201 will be given as 1 mL
      divided into 4 separate 0.25 mL intradermal injections on each day of treatment.
      Pembrolizumab is to be given every 3 weeks for up to a total of 35 doses.

      This study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days; a treatment period consisting
      of GRN-1201/sargramostim administered weekly for 4 weeks (4 doses) followed by administration
      every 3 weeks for 12 additional doses . Pembrolizumab is to be given every 3 weeks for up to
      a total of 35 doses.
