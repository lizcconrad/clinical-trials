  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of a five-year multifactorial lifestyle intervention in the
      Oslo diet and antismoking study on long-term cancer risk. In 1972-1973, 1232 men with high
      cardiovascular risk profile were randomised to intervention including cholesterol lowering
      diet, weight loss and antismoking advice, or control (1:1). This study examines the effect of
      the intervention on 43-year cancer incidence and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Oslo diet and antismoking study showed that a 5-year lifestyle intervention reduced the
      long-term risk of coronary events and mortality. The lifestyle risk factors for cancer are
      partly similar to those for coronary heart disease, e.g. smoking, high body weight,
      unfavourable diet. The investigators therefore expect that the intervention has an effect on
      cancer risk in the long term.

      In this follow-up study, the investigators analyse the association between the intervention,
      and cancer incidence and mortality drawn from the Cancer Registry of Norway and the Norwegian
      Cause of Death Registry from the time of randomisation in 1972/3 until the end of 2015.

    <description>Dietary advice with the aim of reducing participant's serum cholesterol levels, including reduction in the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol, and increased intake of polyunsaturated fat, fish, vegetables and fruit. Weight reduction was recommended for overweight men, as well as reduced consumption of sugar rich foods and drinks, and alcoholic beverages. Smokers were advised to stop smoking. The advice was given both individually and in group sessions during a five-year time period from 1972/3 until 1977/8.</description>

        The participants selected for this follow-up study (n=1216) are the eligible subjects of
        the 1232 men at high cardiovascular risk profile who participated in the Oslo Diet and
        Antismoking Study (included in 1972-73). Fourteen men were excluded because they did not
        consent to studies other than the main study, and two more because of previous history of
        cancer.
