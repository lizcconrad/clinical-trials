      The purpose of this Phase 1/2 study is to compare the safety and tolerability of four times a
      day (QID) dosing of a non-preserved topical ocular drop formulation of 10 vol/vol % and 30
      vol/vol % of FD hPL to vehicle control eye drops in patients with Dry Eye Disease (DED)
      secondary to Graft vs. Host Disease (GvHD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients who do not find relief from other modes of therapy, autologous serum tears have
      been used as an alternative therapy since the mid-1980s. Limitations such as the need for
      periodic blood draws, the lack of standardization in the preparation of AST and
      platelet-enriched plasma tears, the unknown shelf life of AST preparations, the use of
      non-preserved multi-dose packaging and the practical difficulties patients face in storing
      these products frozen or refrigerated have hindered their widespread use for treating GvHD
      and other forms of severe tear deficiency.

      To address these shortcomings, Cambium Medical Technologies, LLC has developed a proprietary
      method of standardizing and manufacturing a fibrinogen-depleted standardized platelet lysate
      using pooled human platelet lysates (phPL) collected from qualified healthy donors (CAM-101).
      Because Cambium's proprietary manufacturing process depletes pooled human platelet lysates of
      fibrinogen (the key clotting protein in platelets), the remaining product contains enriched
      levels of several key nutritive and regenerative components than are normally found in
      non-standardized AST as well as healthy tear film.

      Given the multi-factorial nature of DED, the enriched levels of numerous key nutritive
      components in CAM-101 may well prove to be superior to artificial tears and certain single
      active ingredient products which treat only one cause or contributor of dry eye (e.g.,
      inflammation) and other forms of tear deficiency.

             could affect tear function (e.g., antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants,
             anxiolytics, antimuscarinics, beta-blocking agents, phenothiazines, tacrolimus,
             sirolimus, etc.) during the study. If currently taking any of these drugs,
             treatment(s) can continue throughout the study without a change in dose;

             alcohol consumption &gt;2 drinks/day over the last 3 months prior to screening); drug
             abuse is any use of illegal drugs or prescription-drug over usage or addiction. A
             positive drug screen or alcohol screen will disqualify a patient from study
             participation;

         18. Taken any investigational medication and/or participated in any clinical studies
             within 30 days of screening;

         19. Any patient who, in the judgment of the Investigator, may not be able to cooperate
             fully with the study staff, may have difficulty following some study requirements, or
             is otherwise not qualified for the study;

         20. Any patient who is directly involved in the conduct of the protocol.
