  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment of high-risk prostatic adenocarcinoma is based on pelvic-prostatic
      external radiotherapy combined with concomitant and adjunctive hormone therapy for a total of
      3 years.

      Prostatic stereotactic radiotherapy in 5 sessions is a therapeutic option currently delivered
      and described in multiple cohorts of patients with a tolerance comparable to normo-fractional
      treatments. This therapeutic scheme makes it possible to deliver a higher equivalent
      biological dose than during a treatment carried out with a conventional fractionation.

      The results with a follow-up of 9 years are extremely encouraging and do not show any excess
      toxicity compared to other irradiation techniques. They confirm that urinary and digestive
      toxicities are acceptable. All these studies did not involve pelvic irradiation. Several
      trials have also demonstrated the feasibility of normofractionated pelvic irradiation
      associated with hypofractionated prostatic irradiation using an integrated boost technique.

      The primary objective is to evaluate, for localized high-risk prostate cancers (unfavorable
      intermediate or high risk), the rate of digestive and urinary toxicity cumulated at 3 months
      of the association of a pelvi-prostatic irradiation contracted in 5 sessions, with:To
      evaluate, for localized high-risk prostate cancers (unfavorable intermediate or high risk),
      the rate of digestive and urinary toxicity cumulated at 3 months of the association of a
      pelvi-prostatic irradiation contracted in 5 sessions, with:

        -  a prostatic boost in brachytherapy with high dose rate (HDR) or

        -  an integrated boost in stereotaxis (in case of contraindication to brachytherapy)
