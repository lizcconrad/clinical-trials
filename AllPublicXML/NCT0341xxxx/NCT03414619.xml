  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are examining whether difficulties with cognitive control (i.e., the
      ability to stop one's thought process and shift attention) is a common problem across three
      types of repetitive, negative thinking: obsessions (as seen in obsessive compulsive disorder,
      OCD), worries (as seen in generalized anxiety disorder, GAD), and ruminations (as seen in
      major depressive disorder, MDD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to utilize self-report and behavioral measures to examine
      whether cognitive control is a common factor across three types of repetitive negative
      thinking (RNT): obsessions in OCD, worries in GAD, and ruminations in MDD. Specifically, the
      investigators aim to test whether individuals with obsessions, worries, and depressive
      ruminations demonstrate impaired cognitive control on executive functioning
      neuropsychological tasks (i.e., response inhibition, set shifting, attentional disengagement)
      relative to individuals without any psychiatric diagnoses. Additionally, the investigators
      will examine whether these deficits are associated with self-report measures of RNT as well
      as in vivo responding during a laboratory paradigm designed to induce intrusive thinking.
      Findings could inform psychological treatment of these problematic intrusions using novel
      transdiagnostic approaches.

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>In the Go/No Go Task participants press a button immediately upon detecting a target stimulus (e.g., a square), but are told to refrain from responding to a &quot;no go&quot; stimulus (e.g., a cross of similar size). The main outcome is commission errors (i.e., responding to a &quot;no go&quot; stimulus).</description>

    <measure>Perseverative Errors on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>In the Wisconsin Card Sort Test participants are asked to match a stack of response cards to four stimulus cards without knowing the matching rule. They receive feedback for each trial about whether their matching was correct or not. After ten consecutive correct trials, the matching criterion changes without notice requiring the use of flexible goal-driven strategies.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>In the Attentional Engagement-Disengagement Task two emotional facial stimuli are presented on the computer screen (i.e., happy, disgusted, fearful, and sad faces paired with neutral faces) and eye tracking (when participants shift from the emotional to neutral face and vice versa) is measured.</description>

    <measure>Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire is a 15-item measure of repetitive, negative thinking considered independent of disorder-specific content (e.g., &quot;The same thoughts keep going through my mind again and again&quot;).</description>

    <measure>State measure of intrusive thinking</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>

    <description>All participants will receive a structured diagnostic assessment and complete self-report questionnaires about cognitive factors and anxiety/mood symptoms. They then will complete a battery of neuropsychological executive functioning tasks on the computer, each of which measures a different facet of cognitive control (i.e., response inhibition, cognitive flexibility, and attentional control). Finally, they will be guided through a standardized script-driven imagery paradigm that involves generating and listening to an individualized imaginal script associated with a moderately distressing intrusive thought. Self-report and psychophysiological data will be collected during this exercise.</description>
