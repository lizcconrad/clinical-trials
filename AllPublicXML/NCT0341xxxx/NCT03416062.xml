      The trial intends to study the safety and efficacy of Remaxol® (succinate + methionine +
      inosine + nicotinamide; POLYSAN Ltd., Russia),solution for infusion for the reduction of
      hyperbilirubinemia in patients with obstructive jaundice caused by tumor (malignancy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit in-hospital surgical patients with obstructive jaundice caused by
      malignancies of pancreatic and hepatobiliary zone.

      The study consists of the following periods:

        -  Screening - preliminary examination of patients (duration up to 3 days).

        -  Period of therapy (including surgery and postoperative period) - treatment with the
           investigational product Remaxol®, solution for infusions, (NTFF POLYSAN Ltd., Russia) or
           placebo, as part of standard infusion therapy during the postoperative period of
           patients with mechanical jaundice of malignant origin (duration 10 days).

        -  The period of follow-up (duration - 3 weeks after the end of treatment).

      After the screening, patients who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have exclusion
      criteria will be randomly assigned to three groups (1:1:1):

        -  Group I: treatment with Remaxol® 400 ml IV, and placebo (Ringer solution) 400 ml IV,
           once a day for 10 days, along with standard infusion therapy.

        -  Group II: treatment Remaxol® 800 ml IV, once a day for 10 days, along with standard
           infusion therapy.

        -  Group III: patients will receive placebo ((Ringer solution) 800 ml IV, once a day for 10
           days, along with standard infusion therapy.

      Assessment will include physical examination data, vital signs, blood tests (CBC,
      biochemistry - protein, albumin, AST, ALT, APG, GGTP, LDH, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin,
      amylase, glucose, electrolytes, creatinine, urea, uric acid, C -reactive protein, lipid
      profile; coagulogram; urine samples), ECOG assessment, repeated abdominal ultrasound,
      neurophysiological test for the evaluation of encephalopathy, record of bile volume by
      drainage (if applicable).

      All patients will be followed up for 31 days.
