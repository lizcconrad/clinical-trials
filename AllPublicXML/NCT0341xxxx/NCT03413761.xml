  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the null hypothesis that use of antioxidant supplements during
      adjuvant chemotherapy will have no impact on toxicities and disease-free, as well as overall,
      survival, and also evaluate the role of polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress in
      relation to treatment outcomes.

      This study will enroll 3000 women from S0221with node positive or high-risk node-negative
      breast cancer receiving AC+T onto this ancillary study to address the following specific
      aims:

        1. To characterize use of antioxidant supplements with a survey instrument prior to and at
           completion of treatment, and to evaluate reported use pre and post treatment in relation
           to toxicity and disease-free survival. The potential effects of diet, physical activity,
           and other lifestyle factors on relationships between supplement use and treatment
           outcomes will also be considered.

        2. To evaluate if variants (polymorphisms) in genes that produce reactive oxygen species
           (ROS) (MPO) and in genes that protect cells from the effects of ROS are associated with
           treatment-related toxicities and with disease-free survival.
