      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the effects of multiple-dose ramipril on the steady state pharmacokinetic (PK)
      parameters of sotagliflozin and its main metabolite (sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide) in
      healthy male and female subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effects of multiple-dose sotagliflozin on the PK of ramipril and its
           active metabolite (ramiprilat).

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple-dose sotagliflozin with and without
           multiple-dose of ramipril.

      The expected duration of subject participation, including Screening of up to 29 days,
      Treatment Periods of 6 days and 11 days each with a Washout period of minimum of 7 days in
      between periods, Follow-up period of 6 days, and end-of-study-period of 10-14 days after last
      sotagliflozin dose, is approximately 66 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Healthy male or female subjects, between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Body weight between 50.0 and 100.0 kg, inclusive, if male, and between 40.0 and 90.0
             kg, inclusive, if female, body mass index between 18.0 and 32.0 kg/m², inclusive.

          -  Certified as healthy by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history
             and complete physical examination).

          -  Normal vital signs after 10 minutes resting in supine position:

          -  100 mmHg &lt;systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;140 mmHg,

          -  60 mmHg &lt;diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;90 mmHg,

          -  50 bpm &lt;heart rate (HR) &lt;90 bpm.

          -  Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters after 10 minutes resting in supine
             position in the following ranges; 120 ms&lt;PR&lt;200 ms, QRS &lt;120 ms, QTc ≤430 ms if male
             and QTc ≤450 ms if female with normal ECG tracing unless the Investigator considers an
             ECG tracing abnormality to be not clinically relevant.

          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range, unless the Investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects; however serum
             creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
             aminotransferase) should be strictly below the ULN. Total bilirubin out of normal
             range can be acceptable if total bilirubin should not exceed 1.5 the upper limit with
             normal conjugated bilirubin values (unless the subject has documented Gilbert
             syndrome).

          -  Female subject must use a double contraception method including a highly effective
             method of birth control except if she has undergone sterilization at least 3 months
             earlier or is postmenopausal. The accepted double contraception methods include the
             use of 1 of the following contraceptive options: (1) intrauterine device; (2) condom
             or diaphragm or cervical/vault cap, in addition to spermicide. Menopause is defined as
             being amenorrheic for at least 2 years with plasma follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             value being within the normal range for postmenopausal women according to the local
             laboratory. Hormonal contraception is NOT acceptable in this study due to drug
             interaction.

          -  Having given written informed consent prior to undertaking any study-related
             procedure.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any history or presence of clinically relevant cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, neurological,

             mmHg within 3 minutes when changing from supine to standing position.

          -  Presence or history of drug hypersensitivity, or allergic disease diagnosed and
             treated by a physician.

          -  History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse (alcohol consumption more than 40 g per
             day on a regular basis).

          -  Smoking more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent per day, unable to stop smoking during
             the study.

             glasses per day)

             given within 4 months before inclusion. Any oral contraceptives during the screening
             period or for at least 15 days prior to inclusion; any injectable contraceptives or
