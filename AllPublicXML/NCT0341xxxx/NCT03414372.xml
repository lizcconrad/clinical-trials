    <textblock>
      Tough Talks is a virtual reality based HIV disclosure intervention that allows HIV+
      individuals to practice disclosing to romantic partners. Tough Talks allows participants to
      have the opportunity to practice disclosing using a variety of strategies and experience
      different outcomes including acceptance, confusion, lack of HIV knowledge, and rejection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During Phase I of this project, the investigators developed an iPad based virtual reality
      system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios
      which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM.
      In Phase II the investigators will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature
      automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the
      newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care
      Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research.

    <intervention_model_description>This study includes 3 phases: 1) formative research to refine and enhance Tough Talks with input from YMSM and their social/sexual networks; 2) a technical pilot to optimize functionality and technical performance; and 3) a three-arm RCT to evaluate efficacy and effectiveness of Tough Talks among HIV-infected YMSM.
In the RCT, the investigators will conduct a combined efficacy/effectiveness trial to compare the intervention delivered online, in the clinic or standard of care clinic messaging. Primary outcomes will be assessed at intervention completion (1 month) and at 6 months and include HIV viral load and CAI.</intervention_model_description>
