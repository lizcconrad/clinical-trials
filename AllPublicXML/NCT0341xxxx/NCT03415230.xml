  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized control trial to test the effectiveness of therapeutic massage on the
      sleep quality and the stress levels in women that have completed their treatment for breast
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The period following the completion of treatment for breast cancer (but also for any other
      type of cancer as well) is once that is accompanied by an increased uncertainty. This can
      often trigger increased anxiety levels and sleep disturbances. This trial tests the
      effectiveness of therapeutic massage as a non pharmaceutical intervention that can increase
      the management of stress and sleep disturbances during this period of time.

    <description>Athens insomnia scale (The AIS is a self-assessment psychometric instrument designed for quantifying sleep difficulty based on the ICD-10 criteria. It consists of eight items: the first five pertain to sleep induction, awakenings during the night, final awakening, total sleep duration, and sleep quality; while the last three refer to well-being, functioning capacity, and sleepiness during the day). Each item of the AIS can be rated 0-3, (with 0 corresponding to no problem at all and 3 to very serious problem); thus, the total score ranges from 0 (absence of any sleep-related problem) to 24 (the most severe degree of insomnia).</description>
