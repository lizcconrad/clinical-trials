  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) are confronted with a multitude of psychological and
      physiological changes post-injury leading to seemingly insurmountable barriers to
      participating in daily life. After injury persons with SCI engage in fewer social
      interactions, spend more time sedentary, and are less likely to leave the home. This leads to
      restricted social participation that, in turn, contributes to greater psychological problems
      and negatively impacts the lives of adults with SCI. Intense, structured exercise has
      substantial potential benefits for improving psychosocial wellbeing among persons with SCI,
      but accessible exercise options are few and cannot achieve high intensities of whole-body
      exercise. This work will use approaches to overcome the barriers to intense exercise. The
      investigators will use hybrid functional electrical stimulation row training (FESRT) to allow
      for a more intense exercise stimulus, potentially having a greater impact on psychosocial
      wellbeing. There is initial evidence that persons with mobility impairments who are highly
      physically active demonstrate better psychosocial wellbeing compared with those who have low
      levels of physical activity. A limitation to understanding the influence of exercise on
      psychosocial wellbeing is the lack of robust and time-dependent measures. The investigators
      will use a smartphone-based research application to measure psychosocial well-being, thus
      decreasing self-report bias and capturing in-the-moment behavioral and self-report data.
