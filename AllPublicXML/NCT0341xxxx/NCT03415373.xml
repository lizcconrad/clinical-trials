  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microdermics Inc. is a British Columbia-based Canadian incorporation primarily focusing on
      microneedle-based painless and effective drug delivery systems.The Microneedle Adapter (model
      UAR-2S) is a single-use disposable medical device intended to provide a mechanism for
      intradermal bolus fluid delivery when used with a standard syringe with a Luer-lock tip
      connection. The Microneedle Adapter consists of a single-use gold-coated metallic microneedle
      integrated within the microneedle adapter with fluidic connections to a standard Luer syringe
      mount. The primary function of the Microneedle Adapter is to guide the microneedle into the
      skin in a controlled manner for successful insertion passing the stratum corneum layer. The
      fluid loaded onto the syringe can then be injected precisely intradermally into the skin.The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Microneedle Adapter in
      healthy subjects in 3 different injection sites. Pain perception of the Microneedle Adapter
      will be a key secondary outcome, compared with the control device.
