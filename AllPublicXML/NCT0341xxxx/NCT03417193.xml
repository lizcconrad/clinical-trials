  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the intraoperative opioid free anesthesia approach in multilevel spine
      posterior instrumentation surgery to a conventional opioid-based anesthesia. Half of
      participants will receive opioid free anesthesia with dexmedetomidine, lidocaine and ketamine
      while the other half will receive opioid based anesthesia with fentanyl, remi-fentanyl and
      ketamine

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid analgesics are commonly used in clinical practice for per and postoperative pain
      treatment. However their use is associated with a lot of undesirable effects. From this comes
      the idea of using opioid free anesthesia intra-operatively in an attempt to decrease opioids
      postoperative use and accordingly, their associated side effects.

      Intravenous (IV) lidocaine has been found to have analgesic, antihyperalgesic, and
      anti-inflammatory properties. It was found to significantly improve postoperative pain, when
      its intraoperative use was compared with placebo .

      Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha-two adrenergic receptor agonist that has
      antinociceptive, analgesic, opioid sparing and sedative properties. Similar to lidocaine,
      dexmedetomidine was shown to lower postoperative pain, opioid consumption and accordingly,
      opioid related side effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours post operative.</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) consists of a straight line with the endpoints defining extreme limits such as 'no pain at all' and 'pain as bad as it could be' The patient is asked to mark his pain level on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between 'no pain at all' and the mark then defines the subject's pain. The score ranges from 0 to 100 mm. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. The distribution pain is the following:no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm).Postoperative pain will be measured using Verbal Analogue Scale (VAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours to be repeated every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours post surgery</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>After the surgery the patient will go to the PACU (Post Anesthesia Care Unit). the patient will receive morphine if the pain score is more than 4. the total dose of morphine in mg (milligrams) will be documented. Before discharge from the PACU, the patient will have a PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) morphine,All attempts and given values of morphine In mg obtained from the PCA machine will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours post surgery..
And the total amount of morphine in mg will be calculated for 48 hours</description>

    <time_frame>48 hours post operative.</time_frame>
    <description>-Sedation score: 0 alert
Mild, drowsy , easy to awake
moderate, easy to arouse
Severe: somnolent difficult to arouse 4:sleeping The Sedation score will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine Side effects:Respiratory depression</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the respiratory rate : The number of breaths per minute. In practice, the respiratory rate is usually determined by counting the number of times the chest rises or falls per minute.
The respiratory rate will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine Side effects: Nausea vomiting</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of nausea vomiting using the verbal rating score from 0 to 10 : 0= no nausea/ Vomiting, 10: worst possible nausea vomiting.
The degree of nausea vomiting will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative morphine Side effects: Itching</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Itching: presence or absence The presence or absence of itching will be documented at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours and every 6 hours thereafter up to 48 hours.</description>
