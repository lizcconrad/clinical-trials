  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modified perforated membrane (MPM) is considered as a modality that could enable
      participation of periosteal cells and gingival stem cells which could improve the outcomes of
      guided tissue regeneration more than the use of the traditional occlusive membrane (OM).
      Simvastatin (SMV) modulates bone formation by increasing the expression of bone morphogenetic
      protein 2 and angiogenesis. Ethylenediaminetetraacitic acid (EDTA) found to be effective as
      low ph etchant for smear layer removal and exposing root surface collagen. The investigators
      compared the clinical and radiographic outcome of SMV gel combined with MPM to SMV gel
      combined with OM with and without an associated EDTA gel root surface etching for improving
      bone regeneration in intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis patients. Moreover,
      evaluation of SMV gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels availability for 30 days in cases
      with and without EDTA root surface etching was performed.

  <detailed_description>

      Forty patients with 40 intrabony defects having chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned
      into four equal groups to receive open flap procedure, 1.2% SMV gel and covering the defect
      with OM (Group I), open flap procedure, 1.2% SMV gel and covering the defect with MPM (Group
      II), open flap procedure, 24% EDTA root surface etching,1.2% SMV gel and then coverage of the
      defect by OM (Goup III), or open flap procedure, 24% EDTA root surface etching, 1.2% SMV gel
      and then coverage of the defect by MPM (Group IV). Plaque index, gingival index,probing
      pocket depth, clinical attachment level, defect base level, crestal bone level, and
      radiodensitometric measurements were measured at baseline and reassessed at 6 and 9 months
      after therapy. Additionally, GCF was collected from group I, II, III and IV at 1,7,14, 21,
      and 30 days in order to evaluate SMV availability and the effect of EDTA root surface etching
      on its availability using High-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC).
