  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the performance and safety of
      endovascular treatment with stenting (Optimed Sinus Superflex 635 or Qualimed Pontos-pp) or
      balloon angioplasty (Cardionovum Legflow or Optimed Nylotrack .035 + .018) according to
      current practice. The goal of the study will be achieved by assessing binary restenosis with
      duplex ultrasound, peri- and postoperative complications, technical success, target lesion
      revascularization, amputation and clinical outcome.
