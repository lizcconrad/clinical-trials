      Abstract: Introduction:

      Vestibular migraine(VM) is a disease that manifests with episodic vertigo attacks in patients
      with or without migraine type headaches, when present accompanying the headaches. Its
      prevalence was found out as %1 in a study in Germany. It usually involves middle aged women.
      VM can make a huge impact on quality of life, therefore advances in its diagnosis and
      management are valuable. While pharmacotherapy that is being used in migraine can be
      beneficial, vestibular rehabilitation(VR) programmes are predicted to be one of the most
      important types of treatment in management of VM. This study compares the results of
      pharmacological management options and vestibular rehabilitation programmes in the context of
      dizziness, balance problems and headache.

      Material and methods:

      77 patients with VM were included in study, and 60 of them completed it. While one group took
      only VR programme, and another took only pharmacological prophylaxis. The third group took a
      combined therapy, and the groups were consisted of 20 patients. Patients were assessed with
      caloric tests, audiometric studies, static posturography, Dizziness Handicap Inventory(DHI),
      and Activities Specific Balance Confidence(ABC) scales. All of the assessments were applied 3
      times throughout the study, and the results were compared with relevant statistical tests.

    <description>A scale which is used to evaluate balance confidence of patients in some specific activities. Confidence in daily activities requiring balance is rated by subject as percentage(from %0 to %100). Higher percentage relates to better confidence in balance.</description>

    <description>Static posturography was performed using the NeuroCom System Version 8.0.3 (NeuroCom International Inc., Clackamas, OR, USA). Mean center of gravity (COG) sway velocity (Â°/s) was recorded on a static platform with eyes open (ST-EO) and closed (ST-EC) and on foam with eyes open (FO-EO) and closed (FO-EC)</description>

    <description>Adaptation Exercises The exercises were performed in horizontal and vertical planes, for a period of one minute each, three times a day.
Substitution Exercises Standing dynamic balance exercises: The patient stands and moves without walking. The patient might march in place, step forward or backward, step to the side, step up or down, or turn around.
Habituation exercises: These exercises that cause mild to moderate difficulty in daily life was given as an exercise to the patient. These exercises involved movements and positions sufficient to cause mild-to-moderate symptoms during the patient's daily activities Ambulation exercises: Exercises that include walking with head moving towards different sides.
The exercise program consisted of one session per week for a period of eight weeks. Each session lasted approximately 30-45 minutes and was conducted in the rehabilitation unit.</description>

For pharmacological therapy, patients were assessed by a neurologist and appropriate drug options were applied based on patients' needs and features. Propranolol was selected primarily and other prophylactic drugs were used in the case of its' being contraindicated.</description>
