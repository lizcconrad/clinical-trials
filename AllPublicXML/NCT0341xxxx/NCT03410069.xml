  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulatory shock is defined as an imbalance between oxygen supply and/or impaired oxygen use
      to maintain organ function. With growing evidence of lack of correlation between macro- and
      micro-circulation, use of &quot;Whole Body&quot; markers such as blood pressure (BP) or Lactates are
      often insufficient to assess the severity of the oxygen debt and/or tissue hypoperfusion.
      Thus, an approach incorporating tissue-perfusion based endpoints would represent a
      significant step up to guide optimal resuscitation of critically-ill patients and to reduce
      complications in high-risk surgery.

      Current monitoring techniques, that complement systemic hemodynamics by focusing on regional
      perfusion, still lack the required user-friendliness and/or clinical relevance to be
      routinely used at bedside. Therefore, assessment of the adequacy of tissue perfusion and
      oxygenation is suboptimal, and implementation of the above-mentioned approaches of
      resuscitation is still a challenge.

      Urethral perfusion is likely to be early and significantly impaired during low-flow states
      and thus represents a good &quot;candidate&quot; as a surrogate site to assess the perfusion of
      visceral organs. Besides, urethral mucosa can be investigated in a less invasive and simpler
      manner than &quot;deeper&quot; organs. Nowadays, no practical methods or devices are available to
      monitor perfusion in the pelvic area. Thus, recent development of a new monitoring device of
      urethral perfusion could fill this need and enable enhanced management of patients in
      Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Operating Rooms (OR).

      The device consists of a modified Foley catheter equipped with a photoplethysmographic
      sensor: the IKORUS UP probe.

      The probe will be used by intensivists on ICU patients with unstable hemodynamic states
      and/or suspicion of microcirculation impairment. The device is also intended to be used by
      anesthesiologists on high-risk surgical patients, i.e. patients with comorbidities undergoing
      major vascular, thoracic and/or abdominal surgery.
