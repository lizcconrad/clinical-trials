  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies how well questionnaires and cognitive assessments work in
      tracking patient symptoms following mammography. Gathering information over time through
      questionnaires and cognitive tests about symptoms patients may experience after a mammogram
      may help doctors understand the cause of these symptoms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of Internet-based cognitive assessments as preliminary data
      prior to larger clinical trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete questionnaires and cognitive assessments over 45-60 minutes within 3 weeks
      following mammography and at about 3 months in patients for whom biopsy is not required,
      before biopsy and at about 3 months in patients for whom biopsy is required, and at 4-6 weeks
      after first chemotherapy infusion in patients receiving chemotherapy.
