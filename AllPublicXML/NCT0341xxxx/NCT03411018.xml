    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates the impact of respiratory management modifications
      implemented in our institution on the intubation rates and the death or Bronchopulmonary
      Dysplasia (BPD) outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Less invasive respiratory management has been implemented in most neonatal units as well as
      lung protective ventilatory strategies when intubation is required in order to minimize
      ventilator induced lung injury.

      In our institution a new ventilatory protocol including less invasive surfactant
      administration, Synchronized nasal positive pressure ventilation and early rescue High
      frequency ventilation has been implemented during 2013-14.

      Hypothesis: New less invasive and lung protective strategies to prevent lung injury had been
      effective in reducing intubation rates.
