      This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 1b study in pediatric patients age 2-11 years old
      with extensive atopic dermatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter, open-label study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetics of RVT-501 0.5% topical ointment administered twice daily (BID) for 4
      weeks in pediatric patients age 2-11 years of age with extensive atopic dermatitis. The
      efficacy of RVT-501 will also be evaluated as a secondary objective in these patients. The
      study will consist of three phases: Screening (up to 30 days), Treatment Phase (28 days), and
      Follow-up (7-10 days).
