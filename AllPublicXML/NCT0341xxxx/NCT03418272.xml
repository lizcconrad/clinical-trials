  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if the bacteria found in your mouth (oral flora
      bacteria) in children admitted to the intensive care unit who need to be on a breathing
      machine is different from the oral flora in healthy children undergoing anesthesia for their
      dental caries. Children in the intensive care unit with a breathing tube are at a higher risk
      for getting a lung infection due to the bacteria in the mouth slipping into their lungs past
      the breathing tube over several days. This means that bacteria are found in the child's lung
      when this is normally not the case. If the bacteria in the mouth have changed from normal
      then they may get a pneumonia.

Bacteria obtained in samples will be dispersed in non-selective Mueller Hinton Broth (Sigma-Aldrich), divided into two separate cultures and grown overnight at 37Â°C in aerobic condition and in 5% CO2 to assure survival of both aerobic and facultative anaerobic species.
