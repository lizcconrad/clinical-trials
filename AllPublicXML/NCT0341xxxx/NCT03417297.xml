      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) in patients with epilepsy whose medicines are not
      working well. The ExAblate transcranial system is the name of the device that will be used to
      create and send ultrasound waves through the scalp and skull precisely to a small structure
      located in the center of the brain. This structure is known as the &quot;Anterior Nucleus&quot;, and is
      an important region in the brain that may cause the seizures. Safety will be measured by
      recording and analyzing any adverse effects that may occur from the day of the experimental
      surgery through 12 months following the surgery.

      This is a open-label prospective intervention study. Ten (10) adults with refractory,
      partial-onset epilepsy with secondary generalization and able to provide informed consent
      will be enrolled. In addition to the diagnosis of medically refractory epilepsy, these
      patients will need to meet protocol specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. These adults
      will be screened from the patients being cared for by the epilepsy program at The Ohio State
      University or referred from elsewhere for enrollment in the study. Initially, 3 participants
      will be enrolled and followed for 3 months to assess the safety of study intervention.
      Pending review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), an additional 7
      participants will be enrolled.

      This pilot study is being conducted to test this feasibility of this device in order to
      confirm the design and operating specifications of the device including the ability to
      identify, and accurately ablate the target focus within the Anterior Nucleus.

      Safety will be assessed by the absence of side effects, e.g. new onset of neurological
      deficits, performance deterioration on neuropsychological testing. Feasibility is defined as
      the ability to create the desired lesion within the anterior nucleus.

      Seizure frequency data will be collected by seizure diary. Quality of life will be measured
      by the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory -31. Imaging analysis will include study of
      changes in resting state functional connectivity (assessed by fMRI), as well as in structural
      (assessed by volumetric T1 and T2 weighted imaging) and microstructural (assessed by
      diffusion tensor imaging) brain anatomy.

    <description>Neuropsychological determination of cause for suspension/termination will 2 include detection of statistically and clinically meaningful decline among 2 of the initial 3 subjects enrolled; else among 4 of the total 10 subjects expected to be enrolled. This is determined through reliable change index analysis comparing raw subject performance scores in language, memory, and executive function domains with existing data published in test manuals to determine whether 3-month performance represents a clinically and statistically meaningful decline in at least two measures in one of these domains. We intend to use the McSweeny et al. RCI model.</description>
