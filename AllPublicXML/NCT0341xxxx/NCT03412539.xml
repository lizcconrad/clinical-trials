      The participants in the study are patients who undergo surgery to damaged nerve transmission
      and processing system in the nervous system as part of the routine clinical treatment that
      will not be affected by the proposed study. Patients who are candidates for procedures are
      referred from all over the country and undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation in the
      framework of the Palliative Pain Management Clinic, which operates exclusively in Israel at
      the Sourasky Medical Center in Tel Aviv.
