  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of salvinorin A on human brain activity and
      connectivity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) methods. An inhalation route
      of administration will be used as it is the most common route for contemporary use of Salvia
      divinorum, a plant containing salvinorin A.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Volunteers will undergo two experimental sessions that include the inhalation of salvinorin
      A. The first session will be completed in a comfortable space furnished as a living room, and
      the second session will be conducted within a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner.

             caffeinated beverages, he or she must agree not to do so on session days

          -  Agree to refrain from using any psychoactive drugs, including alcoholic beverages and
             any tobacco product such as cigarettes or any other nicotine product such as
             e-cigarettes, within 24 hours of each drug administration. Exceptions include daily
             use of caffeine.

          -  Be healthy and psychologically stable as determined by screening for medical problems
