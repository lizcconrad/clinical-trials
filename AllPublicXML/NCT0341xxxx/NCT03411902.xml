  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot project to determine the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, treating, and
      following 24 older sleeve gastrectomy patients into a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      examining the efficacy of bisphosphonate use versus placebo in the prevention of surgical
      weight loss associated loss of bone mass and quality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a RCT, involving 24 participants randomized to Risedronate or placebo
      capsules for 24 weeks. All subjects planning a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) procedure will be
      approached during their pre-surgical evaluation for possible participation in the study.
      Eligible participants will be referred onto the study coordinator to read/sign an
      IRB-approved informed consent prior to enrollment.

      Two in-person baseline assessment visits [baseline visit 1 (BV1), baseline visit 2 (BV2)]
      occurring 1-6 weeks prior to surgery, and two in-person follow up assessment visits [follow
      up visit 1 (FV1) and follow up visit 2 (FV2)] occurring ±2 weeks from their 23-week
      post-surgery date will be conducted, as well as monthly medication compliance reminders and
      adverse event reporting via phone. The Wake Forest WMC, under the direction of Drs. Ard and
      Fernandez, will serve as a source of recruitment for potential study participants.
