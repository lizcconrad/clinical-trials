  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic thyroidectomy developed rapidly in recent years, and the most popular surgical
      approach was endoscopic thyroidectomy by bilateral areola approach, but some operative steps
      was required optimization. One of the most annoying problem was the smog blurring endoscopic
      lens during surgery. The researcher summarized a set of convenient foot-control exhaust
      method and carried out this prospective study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma were included according to the inclusive
      criteria and randomly divided them into two groups (foot-control exhaust group and direct
      exhaust group). The foot-control exhaust group used the foot-control exhaust method by the
      way of adjustable Pressure to intermittent exhaust, while direct exhaust group exhaust
      through the Trocar hole. Comparison of operation time, times of wiping the endoscopic lens,
      volume of postoperative drainage, and number of identified parathyroid gland between two
      groups.
