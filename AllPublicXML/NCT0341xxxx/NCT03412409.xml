  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen in
      elderly or high comorbidity burden patients who receive haploidentical hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT). Haplo-HSCT is an effective treatment option for patients
      who did not have identical sibling donor (ISD) or unrelated donor (URD). However,
      post-transplant transplant-related mortality (TRM) is one of the major causes for transplant
      failure, and the risk of TRM for old patients or those with high comorbidity burden was
      higher. RIC regimen may decrease the risk of TRM for haplo-HSCT recipients. The study
      hypothesis: Using RIC haplo-HSCT regimen in elderly patients or those with high comorbidity
      burden can reduce TRM and improve survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RIC regimen was given for elderly patients or those with high comorbidity burden who would
      receive haplo-HSCT. The elderly patients were defined as older than 55 years. The burden of
      comorbidities in HSCT recipients was assessed based on the hematopoietic cell
      transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), and patients with score ≥3 were assigned
      as high burden. The primary end point was transplant-related mortality, and the secondary
      endpoints included overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse, engraftment,
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infections. Following time is 1 years.
