      Objectives:

        1. To further validate the predictive efficacy of our established microRNA prediction model
           of HCC lymph node metastasis.

        2. To establish a precise therapeutic mode of prophylactic radiation therapy in high-risk
           patients with HCC with lymph node metastasis under the guidance of a microRNA prediction
           model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, screening out patients who underwent hepatic tumor resection and pathologically
      diagnosed as HCC .

      Then，performing the detection of miR-145, miR-31 and miR-92a by using the HCC lymph node
      metastasis microRNA correlation prediction model established in our previous study. The
      patients are judged as high risk of lymph node metastasis and low risk Patients, then
      high-risk patients under the condition of informed consent into the group, randomized into
      treatment group and control groups.

      Last, Patients enrolled in the treatment group were treated with radiotherapy and followed
      up.

Radiotherapy was started in lymphatic drainage areas about 1 month after HCC surgery. The range of radiotherapy was hepatic portal area, pancreas circumference, celiac trunk and abdomen Around the aortic lymph drainage area, the dose of radiation 45Gy, conventional segmentation.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. patients underwent liver tumor resection and pathological diagnosis of HCC in our
             hospital.

          2. The tumor samples of these HCC patients were detected by in situ hybridization with
             miR-145, miR-31 and miR-92a. We used the previously established HCC lymph node
             metastasis microRNA prediction model to determine the patients with high-risk lymph
             node metastasis and low-risk patients at high risk Patients were randomly assigned
             into treatment group and control group with informed consent.

          3. HCC patients were not receive other anti-cancer treatment.

          4. Blood routine examination was normal.

          5. Child-Pugh grade A, normal liver and kidney function in the normal range (including
             ALT or ASL within 2.5 times the normal), WBC&gt; 3 × 109 / L, Hb&gt; 90g / L, PLT&gt; 50 × 109
             /

          6. HCC patients were not receive the history of upper abdominal radiotherapy.

          7. sign the informed consent.

          8. age 18-75 years old.

          9. KPS score 80-100 points.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. accepted other anti-cancer treatment.

          2. Patients was determined to be low-risk lymph node metastasis by the pre-established
             HCC lymph node metastasis microRNA prediction model.

          3. blood and liver and kidney dysfunction.

          4. can not control the infection.

          5. at the same time the merger of other malignant tumors.

          6. while using other experimental drugs or to participate in other clinical trials.

          7. serious heart, lung, kidney disease.
