  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      So far, only vital signs (mostly, blood pressure and heart rate) helped the anesthesiologist
      to administer hypnotic agents or analgesics. Many devices have offered pain monitoring for
      anesthetized patients, the most recent being the PMD200 device and its NoL index. The BIS
      index is widely used for depth of anesthesia monitoring. The hypothesis of this study is that
      the intraoperative combination of both the NoL and the BIS indices to guide the delivery of
      opioids and hypotonics respectively, will improve the quality of recovery as well as the
      safety after anesthesia in ERAS patients undergoing colonic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis is that the intraoperative use of the combination of 1) the NoL index (given by
      the PMD200TM monitor, Medasense LTD inc, Ramat, Israel) to monitor pain levels and to guide
      opioids' administration during surgery, and 2) the BIS index (Medtronic, St-Laurent, QC,
      Canada) to monitor the depth of hypnosis during anesthesia and to guide the administration of
      anesthetic halogenous gases, will improve the quality of recovery as well as the safety after
      anesthesia in ERAS (Early Rehabilitation After Surgery) patients undergoing colonic surgery
      under general anesthesia + epidural analgesia.

      This study will compare a group of patients monitored by the classical monitoring (with
      anesthesia/analgesia guided by these classical parameters: heart rate, blood pressure;
      Control &quot;C&quot; group; no BIS, no NoL) to a group of patients monitored by the same classical
      monitoring implemented with the NoL/BIS indices (with analgesia/anesthesia guided by these 2
      indices; Monitoring &quot;M&quot; group).

      The primary objective of the study will be the total consumption of desflurane that is
      expected to be significantly reduced in the M group. Secondary objectives will be evaluating
      safety and side effects of anesthesia and opioids and we expect a reduction of the following
      parameters: time for awakening from anesthesia, time for extubation, time for transfer to
      PACU, intraoperative opioid consumption, opioid consumption in PACU and for 48h, time for
      readiness for discharge from PACU, incidence of adverse effects such as: nausea-vomiting /
      sedation / respiratory depression / itching / dizziness / cognitive dysfunction in PACU and
      for 48h, satisfaction of the patients at 24 and 48hs, pain scores at rest and at mobilization
      in PACU, at 24h and 48h. Quality of postoperative recovery after surgery and treatment
      satisfaction are also expected to be higher in the M group than in the C group.
