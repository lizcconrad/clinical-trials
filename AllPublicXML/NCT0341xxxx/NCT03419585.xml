  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue due to cancer and its treatment (for example, radiation therapy) can interfere with
      quality of life and can linger long after treatment has ended, yet research examining
      preventative approaches has produced limited clinical benefit. The proposed study will
      provide information about systematic light exposure for the prevention of fatigue in prostate
      cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy and will investigate how it works. This study
      would facilitate the development of this potential preventative treatment, giving health care
      providers and cancer survivors a much-needed tool to help with cancer-related fatigue.

    <description>Goldin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire. From the measure itself: &quot; For the first question, weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities are multiplied by nine, five, and three, respectively. Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by summing the products of the separate components, as shown in the following formula: Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light) The second question is used to calculate the frequency of weekly leisure-time activities pursued &quot;long enough to work up a sweat&quot; (see questionnaire).&quot;</description>
