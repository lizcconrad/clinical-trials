  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit of subcutaneous (SC)
      daratumumab administered in combination with standard multiple myeloma (MM) regimens in
      participants with MM as measured by overall response rate (ORR) or very good partial response
      (VGPR) or better rate.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the addition of daratumumab administered SC to standard MM regimens
      will improve responses compared to response data observed in completed phase 3 studies
      without daratumumab. Disease evaluations will include measurements of myeloma proteins, bone
      marrow examinations, skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and
      measurements of serum calcium corrected for albumin. Safety will be measured by adverse
      events, laboratory test results, electrocardiogram (ECGs), vital sign measurements, physical
      examination findings, SC injection-site assessments, and assessment of Eastern Cooperative
      Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score. Study will consist of 3 phases (screening,
      treatment and follow-up) and duration of study is approximately 3 years.
