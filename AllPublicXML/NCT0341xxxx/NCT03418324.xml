  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to measure the clinical benefit of TRC105 in combination
      with abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients
      who are taking either abiraterone or enzalutamide and showing signs of biochemical
      progression without radiographic progression. A patient who is progressing on AR-therapy will
      continue the same AR-therapy on study with the addition of TRC105. The two arms will accrue
      in parallel and independently.

      This is a Phase II, open-label study of TRC105 (anti-endoglin antibody) in combination with
      abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who
      are taking either abiraterone or enzalutamide and showing signs of biochemical progression
      without radiographic progression. A patient who is progressing on AR-therapy will continue
      the same AR-therapy on study with the addition of TRC105. The two arms will accrue in
      parallel and independently.

      There will be a 2-week washout of the active AR-targeted therapy prior to initiation of
      combination therapy. Tumor response should be assessed at a frequency of 8 weeks by CT/MRI
      chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as bone scan. Patients may continue on therapy until
      radiographic progression by RECIST 1.1 or PCWG3 criteria.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. History of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer with rising PSA on either
             abiraterone or enzalutamide

               -  PSA rise will be defined as an increase in PSA of 0.2 ng/mL or higher on at least
                  2 separate occasions greater than 1 week apart while on either abiraterone or
                  enzalutamide

               -  If there is a drop in serum PSA after the first rise, and the patient has another
                  PSA rise which is greater than the first, the patient will still be considered
                  eligible.

          2. ECOG 0-2

          3. Resolution of adverse events results from prior cancer therapies to NCI CTCAE grade 1
             OR baseline with the exception of the laboratory tests specified below.

          4. Adequate organ function defined by:

               -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN

               -  Total serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Platelets &gt; 100K

               -  Hgb &gt; 8.5 g/dL

               -  Serum Cr &lt;1.5 x ULN

               -  INR 0.8 - 1.2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Non-PSA producing prostate cancers- such as small cell prostate cancers or those
             prostate cancers which exhibit radiographic progression without PSA rise

          2. Inability to tolerate standard doses of abiraterone (1000 mg daily) or enzalutamide
             (160 mg daily).

          3. Other prior malignancy requiring active anticancer therapy

          4. Prior exposure to TRC105 or any CD105 targeted antibody

          5. Any major surgical procedure within 2 weeks of starting therapy

          6. Uncontrolled chronic hypertension defined by systolic pressure (SBP) &gt;150 mmHg or
             diastolic pressure (DBP) &gt;90 despite optimal therapy that is present in more than 3
             readings taken no less than 10 minutes apart.

          7. Active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carries a high bleeding risk

          8. Use of thrombolytics within 10 days prior to the first day of TRC105

          9. Known hypersensitivity to Chinese hamster ovary products or other recombinant human,
             chimeric, or humanized antibodies

         10. A known diagnosis of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome

         11. Ascites or pericardial or pleural effusion requiring external drainage procedures

         12. History of untreated brain involvement with cancer, spinal cord compression, or
             carcinomatous meningitis, or new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease. Patients
             with radiated or resected lesions are permitted, provided the lesions are fully
             treated and inactive, patients are asymptomatic, and no steroids have been
             administered for at least 28 days. Imaging for CNS disease will not be required for
             screening unless there is a history of a neurological finding such as new onset
             weakness or numbness that cannot be explained by other medical history.

         13. Acute cardiovascular event within the past 6 months. An acute cardiovascular event
             will be defined as a myocardial infraction, NYHA Class II or worse congestive heart
             failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, arterial embolism,
             pulmonary embolism, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), or CABG.
             Deep venous thrombosis within 6 months, unless the patient is anti-coagulated without
             the use of warfarin for at least 2 weeks. In this situation, low molecular weight
             heparin is preferred.

         14. Patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception
             during the study and for 3 months following last dose of TRC105. The definition of
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the Principal Investigator or
             a designated associate. Abstinence from intercourse is an acceptable form of
             contraception.
