  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians' decisions to order potentially unnecessary services -- such as those targeted in
      the Choosing Wisely® campaign -- are often affected by their high-pressure practice
      environments, which can make it hard to consistently avoid ordering low-value care. The field
      of behavioral economics offers a promising and highly scalable approach to decreasing use of
      low-value services: asking clinicians to commit to avoid ordering such services and providing
      them and their patients with resources to support adherence to this commitment. This project
      will evaluate the effects of such an intervention across 2 large health systems, Michigan
      Medicine and IHA, through a mixed-methods, stepped wedge cluster randomized trial. In each of
      the study clinics, clinicians will be invited to commit to following a set of targeted
      Choosing Wisely® recommendations. Clinicians who make such a commitment, and their patients,
      will receive access to key resources to support adherence to this commitment. To measure the
      effects of the intervention, automated clinical data and medical record data before and after
      the intervention will be examined. Surveys and semi-structured interviews of both clinicians
      and patients will also be conducted to determine the effects of the intervention on their
      decision-making and experiences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A mixed-methods stepped wedge cluster randomized trial will be conducted in 8 primary care
      clinics of IHA, a private multispecialty group practice, and Michigan Medicine, a large
      academic health system. The study will test whether pre-encounter clinician commitments
      combined with patient and provider supports decrease overtreatment of type 2 diabetes among
      patients 65 and older, use of benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics among patients age 65
      and older who have insomnia or anxiety, and use of PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer
      among men 75 and older. These 3 recommendations were chosen because they are commonly
      performed in primary care practice, have Choosing Wisely® recommendations against these
      low-value services, and represent situations in which clinician decisions about ordering of
      services can be unduly swayed by interactions with patients.
