    <textblock>
      The study will test the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive, evidence-based,
      multi-component, behavioral program for treating obesity called Health-Smart. This program is
      being implemented by Community Health Workers at the primary care centers and followed by
      either of two physician-implemented behavioral counseling programs to prevent weight
      gain--programs that are implemented quarterly over 12 months.

    <description>This program is designed to enable physicians to: (a) talk with their patients about their weight, weight loss goals, goal barriers, strategies for overcoming these barriers, and deliver this talk in patient-centered, culturally sensitive ways, (b) assist their patients with engaging in self-identified strategies for achieving and sustaining their self selected goals for weight loss and overall health, (c) be knowledgeable about health-smart behaviors, (d) use behaviors and display attitudes in physician-patient interactions with patients that are provider cultural sensitivity indicators in published literature, and (e) say and display behaviors and attitudes that patients identified as important when discussing obesity and losing weight.</description>

    <description>This program is designed to enable physicians to: (a) implement motivational interviewing approaches when talking with their patients about their weight loss goals and behavioral strategies to achieve these goals, (b) become knowledgeable about empirically supported behavioral change principles that have been used to help patients maintain weight loss in previous interventions, (c) communicate how to use these empirically supported behavioral change principles to have patients initiate or maintain their self-selected health-smart goals related to weight loss and/or weight loss maintenance, and (d) use motivational interviewing approaches to communicate empathy and understanding with patients who are struggling to maintain their weight loss and/or accomplish a behavioral goal.</description>

    <intervention_name>Health Smart for Weight Loss</intervention_name>
    <description>We will test the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive, evidence-based, multi-component, behavioral program for treating obesity called Health-Smart. This program will be implemented for 6 months in 20 UF Health Jacksonville primary care clinics by Community Health Workers (CHWs) with Black women patients who have obesity, and followed by either of two physician-implemented behavioral counseling weight loss maintenance programs that are applied quarterly over 12 months to prevent weight gain. Specifically, we will compare the effects on weight-loss and weight-loss maintenance of (1) Health-Smart plus the Patient-Centered, Culturally Sensitive Weight Loss Maintenance Program (PCS-WLM), and (2) Health-Smart plus the Standard Behavioral Weight Loss Maintenance Program (SB-WLM).</description>
