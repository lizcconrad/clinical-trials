    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, single arm, open-label pilot study to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of CAR-NK cell treatment in subjects with metastatic solid tumours. Autologous or
      allogeneic NK cells are transfected by mRNA electroporation to prepare investigational CAR-NK
      cells with transiently enhanced specificity and activity against NKG2D-ligand expressing
      cancer cells.

    <description>The infusion of CAR-NK cells will be performed in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Following infusion of CAR-NK cells, interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be injected subcutaneously into some patients to support the in vivo survival of CAR-NK cells. The subject will be observed for any side effects during this time and all the adverse events will be recorded.</description>

         10. If a subject or blood donor is a female of childbearing potential, she must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test result.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are suffering from uncontrollable or active infectious diseases of the
             hematological system, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, digestive system,

          2. Patients with immunologic deficiency or autoimmune diseases;

          3. Patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions;

          4. Patients received other forms of cellular therapies within the last 3 months;

          5. Patients received systemic steroids within the last 3 months;
