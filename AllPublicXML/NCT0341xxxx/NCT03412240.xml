  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac pacing which involved stimulating the heart electrically with electrical wires that
      go into the heart is routine practice in the diagnosis and treatment of heart rhythm
      problems. Clinically this involved the fields of cardiac pacing and electrophysiology.
      Patients who are at risk of sudden death because of serious heart rhythms that are a result
      of malfunction of the electrical system of the pumping chambers of the heart (ventricles) are
      generally implanted with specialised pacemakers that can defibrillate (shock) the heart if a
      nasty life threatening rhythm should result. Shocks are painful and in order to try and treat
      these rhythms without shocks, anti tachycardia pacing is performed (this is routine part of
      the device), which aims to interrupt the rhythm by stimulating the heart electrically. This
      does not always work and can destabilise the rhythm leading to a shock. REVRAMP is a novel
      modification of anti tachycardia pacing which involved stimulating the heart through the
      defibrillator wires in a different way. It appears to work better and seems less likely to
      destabilise the heart rhythm, hence can reduce painful shocks.

    <description>Once the defibrillator leads have been inserted or, in the case of a box change, the old leads have been tested as per routine procedure, these pacing leads will be connected to an external pacing stimulator. The test involves electrically pacing your heart at different rates and we will be constantly monitoring you under close clinical supervision. During the test, your heart will be electrically stimulated to beat at a faster rate.</description>
