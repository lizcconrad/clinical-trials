  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to measure the difference in the walking performance when functional
      electrical stimulation (FES) is on and off in people with MS that present foot drop under
      different 'real life' conditions, i.e. walking while doing another task that requires your
      attention and after been physically tired

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) often experience foot drop, which means that the foot
      is not adequately lifted from the ground when walking. Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) is applied to the shin muscles to aid lifting the foot of the ground and reduces the
      risk of trips and falls. PwMS that are users of functional electrical stimulation (FES)
      report that one of the benefits is that it reduces the mental effort of walking and that as a
      result less concentration is needed when they walk. Motor fatigability, which is the reduced
      ability of the muscles to produce force or power, also negatively affects the walking
      performance of pwMS. There have been several studies showing the benefits of FES to the
      walking of pwMS, but not while performing two tasks at the same time and experiencing
      fatigability resembling more daily life conditions. The proposed study aims to investigate
      the direct orthotic effect of FES (FES on vs off) in three different conditions, which
      include just walking, walking while performing an attention-demanding task and walking with
      an attention-demanding task after having completed a fatiguing task. The study design of this
      research allows the quantification of benefits of the use of FES which have until now only be
      reported subjectively.

    <intervention_name>Incremental shuttle walk test</intervention_name>
    <description>In the incremental shuttle walk test, participants will have to walk between two cones (10m distance) several times. The time they will have to cover the distance between the two cones (signified by 'bleeps') will become increasingly shorter, until they cannot get to the next cone before the next 'bleep'. This test will last a maximum of 20 minutes.
In the Stroop test, the words of four colours, but written with a different colour, will be projected on the wall in front of participants and they will need to identify the colour of the text and ignore the word itself.</description>
