  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility pilot is part of the project &quot;LiFE-is-LiFE&quot; (2017-2020). It is based on the
      Lifestyle-Integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) program by Clemson et al., which has proven
      effective in improving strength, balance, and physical activity while simultaneously reducing
      falls in older people via incorporating exercises in recurring daily tasks. However,
      implementing the original LiFE program includes high financial requirements and human
      resources. Therefore, LiFE-is-LiFE investigates whether implementing LiFE in groups (gLiFE)
      is not inferior to the original, individually delivered LiFE in terms of reducing falls per
      physical activity. In this pilot study, we evaluate our conception of gLiFE for large-scale
      use in the subsequent, larger LiFE-is-LiFE trial.

    <description>Manualized teaching of balance and strength principles and integration of exercises and physical activity into daily routine during 7 sessions in a group of 8 to 10 participants with 2 trainers. The pilot intervention group will undergo the same strength and balance exercises and learn about the same physical activity enhancement strategies as described in the LiFE programme by Clemson et al. (BMJ 2012;345:e4547). However, instead of 7 home visits, gLiFE participants will attend seven group sessions (1 session/week). In these, LiFE contents are adapted to the group setting and enhanced by health psychological and behaviour change strategies fitting to the social structure and modalities of a group.</description>
