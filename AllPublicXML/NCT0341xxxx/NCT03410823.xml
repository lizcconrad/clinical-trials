  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a common problem among older individuals. The goal of current standard of
      care after hip fracture is to achieve independent, household ambulation 2-3 months after
      surgery, yet decreased functional ability typically persists well beyond three months and
      many patients never resume independent ambulation outside the home. Previous research has
      established that one must be able to walk at least 300 meters (~330 yards) within 6 minutes
      to re-establish routine interactions in the community, such as going to the store or to
      church. In part, this is based on the average distance from handicapped parking spaces into
      most facilities. Activity and exercise are believed to be of benefit for reducing disability
      in older adults, yet the majority of older adults does not participate in regular exercise
      and is not active. This is especially true for older adults following hip fracture after they
      complete the usual rehabilitation program.

      This research study is being done to test a 16-week, multi-part exercise intervention for hip
      fracture patients that will be supervised by specially trained physical therapists (PTs). The
      exercise intervention uses a novel machine to provide strength and endurance training in the
      home. This has been shown in smaller studies to be safe and effective at increasing strength.
      The purpose of this small pilot study is to test whether adding a protein supplement to the
      exercise intervention leads to more improvements in a person's ability to walk in their own
      home and in the local community. With this knowledge, investigators hope to help a greater
      number of hip fracture patients enjoy a more complete recovery and improved overall health.

      In addition to providing important information on adherence, feasibility, and safety, this
      pilot study of hip fracture patients has the unique advantage of being able to compare data
      to two recently completed studies where participants received the PUSH intervention without
      protein supplementation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study including 30 older adults who have experienced a hip fracture will be carried
      out with participants receiving a specific multi-component intervention with protein
      supplementation (PUSH Plus Protein). Study activities for participants meeting eligibility
      criteria will take place after post-acute rehabilitation ends, up to 26 weeks after admission
      to the hospital for hip fracture. Patients age 60 and older who have had surgical repair for
      hip fracture will be identified in study hospitals or by self-referral and evaluated for
      eligibility. Following consent to participate, eligible participants will undergo a
      comprehensive baseline assessment. Participants completing the entire baseline assessment
      will be eligible to receive the intervention. All participants will receive the PUSH Plus
      Protein intervention. The follow-up assessment will occur after the intervention is
      completed, approximately 16 weeks after baseline testing. The primary endpoint will be
      measured using the Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT).

      Participants in this pilot will receive the same specific multi-component 16-week
      intervention, PUSH, as participants in the multi-site randomized controlled trial, &quot;Improving
      Community Ambulation after Hip Fracture (CAP)&quot; (NCT01783704). The purpose of this study is to
      test whether adding a protein supplement to the PUSH intervention (PUSH Plus Protein) leads
      to greater improvement in a person's ability to walk in their own home and in the local
      community compared to the PUSH intervention alone; therefore, data in this pilot study will
      be compared to data from participants in the CAP study across the three sites who received
      the PUSH intervention alone (n=105). The working hypothesis is that PUSH Plus Protein will
      lead to greater improvements in ability to walk in the community compared to PUSH.

      Investigators will also compare the effect of PUSH Plus Protein intervention to PUSH
      intervention alone on secondary outcomes in the CAP study believed to be precursors to
      community ambulation as shown in Aim 2 below.

      Investigators can also compare participants in the pilot study to participants who received
      PUSH alone in the ancillary study to CAP, &quot;Mechanistic Pathways to Community Ambulation
      (CAP-MP)&quot; (n=19) to examine whether PUSH Plus Protein has an impact on the mechanistic
      factors on the pathway to recovery of ambulatory ability after hip fracture (Aim 3).

      Aim 1. To test whether PUSH Plus Protein intervention improves community ambulation (as
      measured by distance walked in six minutes) compared to PUSH intervention alone (from CAP
      parent study) at the end of 16 weeks.

      Aim 2. To assess the effects of PUSH Plus Protein on precursors to community ambulation
      compared to the PUSH intervention alone (CAP study). To determine the effects of PUSH Plus
      Protein intervention, compared to PUSH, on several other outcomes in CAP including activities
      of daily living (ADLs), quality of life, lower-extremity physical performance, increase of â‰¥
      50 meters in distance walked in six minutes, cognitive status, and nutritional status.

      Aim 3. To determine the effects of PUSH Plus Protein intervention on the mechanistic factors
      compared to PUSH intervention alone (CAP-MP ancillary study). To determine if, at the end of
      the 16 week intervention, participants in the PUSH Plus Protein intervention, compared to
      PUSH alone, have: a) greater muscle volume and attenuation (i.e., reduced intra-muscular fat)
      of the thigh; b) greater lower extremity strength; c) better gait parameters; d) greater bone
      mineral density and bone strength; e) more bone formation and less bone resorption; and f)
      lower levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines.

      Aim 4. To determine safety and tolerability of delivering the PUSH Plus Protein intervention
      to hip fracture patients. This pilot study will be used to estimate the sample size
      requirements for a more definitive study.

    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Six-Minute Walk Test (SMWT) will be used to obtain a continuous measure of total distance walked in six minutes. The SMWT is highly correlated with workloads, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and dyspnea responses when compared to bicycle ergometry and treadmill exercise tests in older persons. It has been performed by elderly, frail and severely compromised participants who cannot perform standard maximal treadmill or cycle ergometry exercise tests.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function (3MS)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) is one of the most widely used screening instruments for dementia. The Modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) test was developed to overcome shortcomings of the MMSE, specifically its narrow range of possible scores and ceiling effects. The 3MS incorporates four additional items (on long-term memory, abstract thinking, category fluency, delayed recall), more uniform administration, and refined scoring, in order to sample a broader variety of cognitive functions, cover a wider range of difficulty levels, and enhance the reliability and validity of the test scores. The 3MS test has a score range of 1-100. It can provide an estimated score of the MMSE, and can also be used to monitor cognitive change over time.</description>

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB evaluates lower extremity performance in older persons based on timed short distance walk, repeated chair stands, and a set of balance tests. Each of the tasks is assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of performance and 0 an inability to complete the test. The test takes about 10-15 minutes to administer and was designed to be administered by a lay interviewer in a setting with limited space. The battery has an excellent safety record. It has been administered to well over 10,000 persons in various studies and no serious injuries are known to have occurred. The SPPB components and total score are derived from normative values obtained from a population-based study.</description>

    <measure>Activities of daily living (ADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure ADLs using the Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability (PAT-D) with two modifications. First, two items (walking a quarter mile and walking across a small room) were added to address perceived gaps in the original PAT-D scale. This modification is consistent with the version used in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders study. Second, two items (walking several blocks and lifting heavy objects) were deleted to avoid duplication with other items in the scale. The resulting 19-item scale allows examination of three subscales (basic ADL, functional limitations, and instrumental ADL).</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will use an interviewer-administered version of the SF-36, a health survey that assesses quality of life in eight subscales (physical function, social function, role-physical, role-emotional, bodily pain, mental health, general health, and vitality). The measure has been validated as a generic measure of quality of life in many different populations, including patient and non-patient samples.</description>

    <measure>Nutritional status</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Nutritional status will be assessed using the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNAÂ®-SF), a validated and widely used malnutrition screening tool. We are using a modified version of the MNAÂ®, approved by the scale's developer (the NestlÃ© company), to facilitate use as an interviewer-administered tool in a research setting. Scores range from 0 to 14; participants scoring â‰¤7 will be considered malnourished; those scoring 8-11 will be considered to be at risk of malnutrition; and those scoring 12-14 will be considered to have normal nutritional status.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given a whey-based protein supplement containing 27.6g of protein daily for 16 weeks and receive the PUSH intervention. PUSH is a specific multi-component intervention based on improving specific precursors to community ambulation. The intervention addresses endurance with continuous upright exercise for 20 min.; function by improving fast walking, standing from a chair, and stair negotiation; muscle performance by exercising to enhance lower extremity strength; and balance by performing unilateral activities and activities with decreased base of support. Participants receive 32 visits of approximately 60 minutes in duration from a study PT. Participants will receive two visits a week, on non-consecutive days, for 16 weeks. Visits take place in the participant's place of residence. Participants also receive the nutritional intervention for the duration of the 16-week study.</description>

    <description>Strength components of the muscle performance intervention are performed using a portable progressive resistive exercise device (ShuttleÂ® MiniPress, Contemporary Design Company, P.O. Box 5089, Glacier, Washington 98244). Muscle performance focuses on bilateral hip extensors, hip abductors, knee extensors, and plantar flexors. Balance and strength are addressed with additional exercises performed while standing. The endurance intervention begins with 2-3 minutes of continuous upper and lower extremity active range of motion (AROM) with the participant sitting in order to increase the participants' heart rate (HR) or exertion closer to the target zone. The participant is then asked to walk on level surfaces and/or up and down steps to keep the HR within the training zone for 20 minutes.</description>
