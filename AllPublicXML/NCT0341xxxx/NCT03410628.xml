      The purpose of this feasibility study is to gather preliminary information on the safety and
      effectiveness of patient self-administration of a noninvasive neurostimulation of the vagus
      nerve using the GammaCore device for the treatment of pain and allodynia symptoms associated
      with acute migraine in adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Is between the ages of 18 and 55 years.

             IHS-Classification criteria (2nd) (with or without aura).

          -  Experiences at least 2 migraines per month, but less than 15 headache days per month
             (over the last 3 months).

          -  Has age of onset of migraine less than 50 years old.

          -  Is able to distinguish migraines from other headaches (e.g. tension headache).

          -  Agrees to withhold usual migraine medications until after stimulation treatment with
             the GammaCore device.

          -  Agrees to follow all of the requirements of the study, including follow-up visit
             requirements, and is sufficiently trained with respect to the operation of the
             GammaCore device and the data collection procedures.

          -  Agrees to report use of the GammaCore device, study data, and any adverse device
             effects to the study center within 24 hours of treatment(s), and agrees to schedule an
             office visit 4-10 days after the third and final treatment, or when 6 weeks has
             passed, whichever comes first.

          -  Is able to give written Informed Consent, or his/her legally authorized representative
             is available to give written Informed Consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a history of aneurysm, bleed, brain tumors or significant head trauma.

          -  Has a lesion (including lymphadenopathy) at the therapy head placement site.

          -  Has known or suspected severe atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, carotid artery
             disease (e.g. bruits or history of TIA or CVA) or congestive heart failure (CHF).

          -  Has a history of epilepsy.

          -  Has suspected or confirmed sepsis, or infection.

          -  Has a clinically significant irregular heart rate or rhythm.

          -  Is receiving pressors to maintain blood pressure.

          -  Has a history of syncope.

          -  Is currently implanted with an electrical and/or neurostimulator device, including but
             not limited to cardiac pacemaker, vagal neurostimulator, deep brain stimulator, spinal
             stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant.

          -  Has been implanted with metal cervical spine hardware.

          -  Has a history of carotid endarterectomy or vascular neck surgery on the right side.

          -  Has a condition that would interfere with headache pain self-assessment.

          -  Is pregnant or is thinking of becoming pregnant in the next 6 weeks.

          -  Is participating in any other therapeutic clinical investigation or has participated
             in a clinical trial in the preceding 30 days.

          -  Takes medication for acute headaches more than 10 days per month.

          -  Has a history or suspicion of substance abuse

          -  Belongs to a vulnerable population or has any condition such that his or her ability
