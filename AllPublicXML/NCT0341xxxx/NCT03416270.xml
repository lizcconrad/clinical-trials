      This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms whereby the SGLT2i &quot;ertugliflozin&quot; modifies
      cardiorenal interactions that regulate fluid volume and neurohormonal activation in patients
      with type 2 diabetes and heart failure (T2D-HF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newer agents called sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been developed
      to improve glycemic control and lower hemoglobin A1c by increasing glycosuria. SGLT2i also
      reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in T2D - possibly through natriuresis. Importantly, a
      landmark trial &quot;EMPA-REG OUTCOME&quot; demonstrated that the SGLT2i &quot;empagliflozin&quot; is the first
      anti- hyperglycemic agent to reduce mortality and HF risk, and also to decrease the risk of
      progressive diabetic nephropathy. Similar benefits were also recently reported in the CANVAS
      Program trial with canagliflozin. Despite the benefits observed in these two pivotal trials,
      the mechanisms responsible for beneficial effects of SGLT2i in patients with T2D with respect
      to the development and/or worsening of HF are not currently known.

      In light of the results of EMPA-REG OUTCOME, the investigators aim to elucidate the
      mechanisms whereby the SGLT2i &quot;ertugliflozin&quot; modifies cardiorenal interactions that regulate
      fluid volume and neurohormonal activation in patients with T2D and HF (T2D-HF). The
      investigators will test the hypothesis that ertugliflozin increases proximal tubular
      natriuresis, thereby reducing plasma volume, without inducing significant renal
      vasoconstriction or activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) (see below, Figure 1).
      The systematic understanding of the effects of SGLT2i in the setting of HF will enable the
      design of rational physiology based strategies to decrease the burden of HF, which could have
      major clinical and research implications internationally.
