      Several studies have demonstrated that music can improve various outcomes during labor and
      delivery. However, many of these studies didn't measure satisfaction rate accurately. This
      study aim to assess patient satisfaction in the setting of music or no music during the
      cesarean delivery. The study will be conducted in the labor and delivery unit and the
      expected number to enroll and complete the study is 22.

      Background:

      Several studies have demonstrated that music can improve various outcomes during labor and
      delivery. However, many of these studies suffer from severe methodological flaws. In
      particular, patient satisfaction is often measured on a simple VAS scale, where 0 is no
      satisfaction and 10 is the highest satisfaction. However, patient satisfaction is a complex
      parameter to measure, and may be affected by a number of different factors. This will be the
      first study performed on the labor and delivery unit to assess patient satisfaction with a
      validated, reliable, 22-question survey in the setting of music or no music during the
      cesarean delivery.

      Although &quot;music&quot; is an all-encompassing term that describes sound with different pitches and
      rhythms that comes together as a harmonious whole, not all music is the same. Using &quot;music&quot;
      for therapeutic purposes would be the equivalent of using &quot;antibiotics&quot; to cure an infection;
      it is too general of a term, and unlikely that such a general use of music would show a valid
      therapeutic benefit. However, a study demonstrated that specific selections of Mozart piano
      sonatas, which have a specific rhythm and mode, improve patient anxiety through a biochemical
      mechanism (changing the plasma levels of IL-6 and epinephrine). Therefore, in this study, the
      term &quot;music&quot; will specifically means the same Mozart sonatas as described in the prior study.

      Objectives:

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of music on patient satisfaction and
      anxiety during cesarean delivery. The study will evaluate this objective by studying the
      following outcomes:

        -  The primary outcome of this study is patient satisfaction. This outcome will be measured
           using Morgan's &quot;Maternal Satisfaction Scale for Cesarean Section&quot; (MSSCS) on
           post-operative day one during the hours of 8am-1pm.

        -  The secondary outcome will include anxiety at several time points (immediately prior to
           and after neuraxial technique placement as well as at the end of surgery). This will be
           evaluated using a simple numeric rating score from 0-10, where 0 is no anxiety and 10 is
           the greatest anxiety.

      The hypothesis is that parturients exposed to music during cesarean delivery will have
      greater overall satisfaction and less anxiety.

      Study Timelines:

        -  Participation begins at the time of consultation for cesarean delivery on the day of
           surgery, where the co-investigator Dr. Dahlawi will approach the participants and ask
           them to sign the ICF, and it ends after the post-anesthesia check on postoperative day
           1. After recruitment and consent, patients will be randomized using a computer-generated
           randomization scheme will be used to allocate patients to one of the arms of the study.

        -  The two arms of the study are as follows:

             -  Control group: baseline hemodynamics and anxiety screen; no music

             -  Intervention group - Mozart: A study investigator will turn on a playlist of
                pre-selected Mozart music.

        -  Given the sample size calculation and that not all women who are approached will consent
           to the study, the investigators expect recruitment to take 12 months.

        -  The estimated date for primary analyses will be November 2018

        -  The investigators estimate that it will take an additional 12 months to complete the
           study, including statistical analysis and manuscript preparation.

      Procedures:

      After reviewing their medical records, the co-investigator, Dr. Dahlawi, will approach
      parturients meeting inclusion criteria on the day of admission for scheduled cesarean
      delivery at Tufts Medical Center. The research study will be explained and parturients will
      be given an informed consent form to read. After the parturient read through the informed
      consent form, think about the risks and benefits, and ask questions, she will be asked to
      sign the form if she wishes to participate in the study. The informed consent form will then
      be stored in the principal investigator's locked office. Once a study subject is enrolled,
      the anesthesia provider, obstetric provider, as well as the nurse will be informed that this
      parturient is part of the study.

      Once the subject is recruited, patient demographic data and baseline vitals signs (including
      anxiety levels) will be collected. All parturients will receive a standardized spinal
      technique using 1.6 mL of 0.75% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 15mcg fentanyl and 200mcg
      morphine, which is the typical standard dose at Tufts Medical Center in nulliparous
      parturients.

      Upon entry into the operating room, parturients who are randomized to music will start to
      listen to the Mozart piano sonatas during the entire procedure, while those randomized to no
      music will not listen to any music. After at least 5 minutes of listening to music and
      immediately after the spinal anesthetic is placed, anxiety levels and vitals signs will be
      assessed again. At the end of surgery, after coming into the PACU, anxiety and vitals will be
      assessed. Finally, on postoperative day 1, during the hours of 8AM - 1PM, patient
      satisfaction will be assessed by administering the MSSCS, which should take about 10 minutes
      to complete. After that, her participation in the study will end.

      Statistical Analysis:

        -  Given that the primary outcome is the satisfaction between two groups, a statistical
           test to compare proportions (the Chi-squared test) will be used.

        -  Given that the secondary outcomes include mean patient anxiety levels and mean blood
           pressure, a statistical to compare means (Student's t-test) will be used.
