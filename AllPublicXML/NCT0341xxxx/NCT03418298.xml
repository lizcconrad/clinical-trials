      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a
      internet-based preoperative exercise program in patients with esophageal or gastric cancers.
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of this preoperative program on functional
      capacity, anxiety and depression, quality of life, fatigue and markers of inflammation.

      Methods: This feasibility study will be conduct at University Hospital Saint-Luc in Brussels.
      Twenty patients with esophageal or gastric cancers will participate in internet-based program
      3 sessions per week. Each session will combine aerobic and resistance training. Moreover,
      inspiratory muscle strengthening (IMT) will be performed daily. The researcher will conduct
      weekly telephone calls to educate and motivate subjects. Assessments will be performed at
      baseline, after neoadjuvant treatment (if a neoadjuvant treatment is indicated), one day
      before surgery, 10 days after hospital stay and 3 months after surgery. The following
      parameters will be measured: functional capacity, quality of life, fatigue, anxiety and
      depression and markers of inflammation.
