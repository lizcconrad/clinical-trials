      This study looks at dose escalation treatment in patients diagnosed with brain metastases.
      Treatment involve five fraction stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with brain tumors
      2.1-4.0 cm in diameter or 4.1-6.0 cm in diameter and dose escalation treatment is delivered
      only to the single largest tumor while all other tumors are treated with standard of care
      practices if they are present. A dose escalation schedule is proposed based on the monitoring
      of CNS toxicity and tumor size of the largest tumor, given it falls into the parameters set
      on diameter.

    <description>Patients will undergo dose escalated five fraction stereotactic radiosurgery for diagnosed brain metastases. Tumors must fall into one of two categories: 2.1-4.0cm diameter or 4.1-6.0 cm diameter. Only single largest tumor will be treated with dose escalation. All other tumors (if present) will be treated with standard of care five fraction stereotactic radiosurgery.</description>

    <intervention_name>Dose Escalated Five Fraction Stereotactic Radiosurgery</intervention_name>
    <description>As focal radiation techniques are utilized more frequently in the treatment of brain metastases, there is increasing need to accurately define the appropriate patient and tumor characteristics for focal therapy. Unfortunately, not all patients are good candidates for single fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) since large tumors and those in unfavorable locations have been associated with unacceptable rates of treatment-related toxicity. Five fraction stereotactic radiation has proven to be a more effective treatment for these patients that aren't good candidates.</description>

          -  Patients must provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Patients must have less than or equal to 10 brain metastases as identified on brain
             MRI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of surgical resection to the tumor of interest

          -  History of radiation to the tumor of interest

          -  History of previous whole brain irradiation

          -  Receipt of systemic therapy within one week of planned radiation treatment except for
             hormonal agents.

          -  Patient is unable to have MRI or MRI contrast.

          -  Inability to meet the appropriate normal tissue dose constraints secondary to tumor
             location should result in exclusion of the patient / tumor.

          -  Patients with a non-index tumor (second tumor) greater than 3 cm in diameter will be
             excluded.
