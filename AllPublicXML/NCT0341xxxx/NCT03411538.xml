  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective surveillance study to estimate excess deaths due to and risk factors
      associated with antibiotic-resistant infection among patients with hospital-acquired
      infection (HAI) in a resource-limited setting. We will focus on six pathogenic bacteria that
      are of clinically important in the hospital.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will first identify patients with pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical sample
      collected &gt;48 hours after admission. These patients will then be screened for eligibility
      criteria. Signed informed consent will be sought from the enrolled patients. The primary
      outcome is survival status within 28 days since the first specimen culture positive for one
      of the six organisms of interest. All patients with hospital-acquired infection will be
      assessed for in-hospital 28-day survival as part of the routine hospital surveillance system.
      Follow-up to confirm 28-day outcome via telephone call will be performed only if patient
      signed informed consent and permission is granted. All isolates from positive cultures will
      be collected and stored securely.

      This study will not interfere with standard patient care or routine diagnosis procedure,
      hence subject will receive no direct medical harm or benefits from being in the study.
      Researchers of this study will not be involved in the management, care and treatment of study
      subjects. Patient care will remain under the responsibility of the attending medical staff
      according to standard practice of care. The study team will work closely with the hospital
      Infectious Control team to screen and enroll patients as part of the HAI surveillance data
      system in Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital. This study will be an enhancement of the current HAI
      surveillance system, which will provide data on 28-day survival status, Charlson
      Comorbidities Index (CCI) score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score for each
      patient and risk factors related to acquiring hospital-acquired infection to the hospital
      Infectious Control (IC) team.

        The target study subjects include male and female patients of any age admit at the
        hospital, and acquired hospital-acquired bacterial infection during hospital stay. We will
        focus on six key pathogens that were in the WHO global priority list of
        antibiotic-resistant bacteria and are also of clinical importance in resource-limited
        settings, namely:

          -  Staphylococcus aureus

          -  Enterococcus spp

          -  Escherichia coli

          -  Klebsiella pneumoniae

          -  Pseudomonas aeruginosa

          -  Acinetobacter spp

        The severity of underlying illness will be assessed using Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
        score and severity of the infection will be assessed using Sequential Organ Failure
        Assessment (SOFA) score. These score will be reported to the physician whenever
        appropriate.
