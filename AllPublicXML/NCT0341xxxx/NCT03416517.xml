  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After standard multimodal therapy, the prognosis of relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma is
      dismal and unchanged over the last decades.Thus, the investigators explored the activity of
      anlotinib combined with irinotecan in patients with relapsed and metastatic Ewing Sarcoma
      after the failure of first-line chemotherapy with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide,
      ifosphamide and etoposide.
