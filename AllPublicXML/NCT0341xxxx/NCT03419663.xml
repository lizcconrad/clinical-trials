  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involved a systematic literature review of published trials of cereal or grain
      in relation to the risk of gastric cancer. Data was extracted from the publications on
      PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library.A traditional meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and
      heterogeneity was conducted on the extracted data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library for studies focusing on cereal or
      grain in relation to the risk of gastric cancer up to October 2017. Summary odd ratios (OR)
      and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by using either random effect models or
      fixed effect models according to the heterogeneity of included studies. Subgroup analysis,
      heterogeneity, and publication bias were also performed.
