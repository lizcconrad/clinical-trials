  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30% of community-dwelling older adults experience one or more falls per year,
      resulting in injuries, loss of independence, and reduced quality of life. While there are
      known physiological risk factors for falls, including poor balance and altered gait patterns,
      it is now recognized that impaired cognitive functioning is also a risk factor for falls.
      Within the broad construct of cognition, one specific domain that has been focused on in the
      falls literature is attention. The literature suggests that improving attention in those
      at-risk for falls may reduce older adult's risk of falling.

      The current study aims to investigate the impact of meditation strategies on measures of
      attention and electrical signals in the brain in older adults with poor mobility.
      Investigators will recruit older adults who are at-risk for falls, based on mobility scores
      and falls history. Participants will be assigned to one of two groups: 1) guided focused
      attention group, or 2) music group (control group). All participants will complete three
      in-person sessions per week and then be encouraged to practice independently on the other
      days in the week, for a total of four weeks.The current study focuses on focused attention
      meditation strategies, as it is recommended for beginner-level meditators. This will include
      training to be able to focus on one's breathing for 20 minute sessions. Focused attention
      meditation has been found to increase levels of executive functioning and attention.
      Participants will complete mobility and cognitive assessments at both the beginning and end
      of the intervention. These will be completed in the retirement homes for convenience.
      Participants will also attend an in-lab session to complete electroencephalogram (EEG)
      testing at both timepoints.

    <description>Participants will take part in a guided focused attention practice led by the researcher. This will include strategies used in meditations where participants focus on their breathing. More specifically, they will be instructed to close their eyes and focus on the sensation of breathing in one area of the body for the entire session. They will be given reminders throughout the session to remain on task (focusing on the breath) and not to let their thoughts wander.
Participants will be asked to either sit on a chair or cushion on floor to ensure they are comfortable to sit still for the session, but not so much that they might fall asleep.</description>
