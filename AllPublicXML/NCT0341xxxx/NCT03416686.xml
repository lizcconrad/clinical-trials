  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency (RF) could be technically feasible and effective in the treatment of lymph
      node metastases of differentiated thyroid cancer. It could constitute a minimally invasive
      and feasible therapeutic alternative in ambulatory, allowing a reduction of the tumoral
      volume sufficient to limit the symptoms even to induce a tumor remission, a normalization of
      the tumoral markers and a better quality of life.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor echographic efficacy at 12 months of
      radiofrequency on lymph node (LN) metastasis of thyroid cancer
