  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is commonly performed to remove bile
      duct stones.Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD),
      and endoscopic sphincterotomy plus balloon dilation (sEST+EPBD) are 3 methods used to enlarge
      the papillary orifice, but their efficacy and safety remains controversial. This study aimed
      to compare these methods for treating common bile duct (CBD) stones.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators first divided the patients with different sizes of common bile duct stones into
      two groups. The bile duct stone diameter of group A is less than 1.0cm while group B is more
      than 1.0cm and less than 1.5cm. Each group compared Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST),
      endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD), and endoscopic sphincterotomy plus balloon
      dilation (sEST+EPBD) in ERCP. Through the postoperative comparison of relevant inspection
      test indicators, the recovery of patients, whether the occurrence of complications, including
      infection,bleeding,pancreatitis,perforation , and 1 year stone recurrence rate,Investigators
      assess the advantages and disadvantages in three different strategies in different sizes of
      common bile duct stones , and finally get a relatively objective evaluation to guide our
      daily ERCP work on the choice of duodenal papillary sphincter treatment strategy.

    <description>Investigators comprehensively assess whether the hemorrhage, perforation, pancreatitis and other complications of retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) happen or not by clinical sympton and blood index 1 day after the ERCP. The blood index includes CRP, amylase,lipase,leukocyte,red blood cell,hemoglobin.Besides,CT will be done if necessary.Finally investigators use statistical method to analyse the incidence of composite events of infection, hemorrhage, perforation, pancreatitis.</description>

    <description>EST is an operation using the Erbao electric knife and Three-cavity incision knife to make a large incision to the duodenal nipplesï¼Œand the incision scope is the nipple mouth uplift length of 4/5. It has been used since 1974. The technique is intuitive and intact. However, EST cut too small to achieve the purpose of treatment and will affect the next step, and if the incision is too large it may be easier to occur gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding.The EST will also damage the anatomy of the Oddi sphincter structure,which causes bacterial reflux to the bile duct, the recurrence of CBD.Some surgeons prefer it because it's postoperative pancreatitis rate is lower and it may be easier to find the lesion position if bleeding or perforation occurs.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>EPBD is an operation using the Columnar expansion balloon to expand duodenal to achieve the purpose of using the basket and other instruments to take stone out. Balloon expansion may retain part of the sphincter not destroyed, and basically retain the normal physiological function of the nipple sphincter.Thus it may reduce the risk of recurrence of stones and bacterial reflux. However,the postoperative pancreatitis rate is high(4.8% -19.5% ), and nipple sphincter tear is uncontrollable in EPBD.If the digestive tract perforation or bleeding occur after EPBD,it is hard to accurately find the lesion position.Some surgeons prefer it for it's lower bleeding and perforation rate.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>sEST+EPBD</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>sEST+EPBD is an operation combining EST and EPBD. Investigators use the Erbao electric knife and Three-cavity incision knife to make a small incision to the duodenal nipples, and the incision length is less than 5mm while the incision scope is less than the nipple mouth uplift length of 1/2. Then, Investigators match the appropriate Columnar expansion balloon according to the diameter of the common bile duct and gradually expand the duodenal nipples.This method allows the nipple sphincter to be cut in a small range, then the balloon can guide the direction of the nipple sphincter tearing after the expansion , so that the digestive tract bleeding, perforation may be smaller and more controllable. Besides,it may reduce postoperative pancreatitis rate and the recurrence rate of stones.</description>
