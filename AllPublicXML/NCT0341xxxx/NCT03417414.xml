  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study of patients with a new diagnosis of B cell Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia or B cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma who will receive an anti-CD20
      monoclonal antibody treatment during the induction phase of their treatment. Throughout the
      study, patients will have four blood draws at specified time points throughout the study. The
      initial blood draw will be analysed test patients for Cytomegalovirus and conduct a g-NK cell
      analysis. The final three blood draws will be conducted to analyse the g-NK cells at
      specified time points. The objectives of this study are to: 1) characterize the frequency of
      CMV (+) and g-NK (+) individuals in the B-NHL and B-CLL populations, 2) Determine changes in
      circulating g-NK cells during and after anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing remission
      induction chemotherapy and 3) Evaluate whether the presence of g-NK cells improve the outcome
      of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody containing remission induction treatment of patients with
      B-NHL or B-CLL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection results in a unique population of highly effective ADCC effector cells (g-NK)
      in more than 50% of individuals. Unlike most NK cells, g-NK cells are long-lived and persist
      for years following primary infection. The g-NK population enlarges following antibody
      binding through their Fc receptors (FcR) and target engagement by the antibody. The addition
      of rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies directed against B lymphocyte targets to
      remission-induction therapy has improved the depth and durability of response for patients
      with B cell lymphoproliferative diseases, such as Non-hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The effects of rituximab and other monoclonal anti-cancer
      antibodies are at least partially mediated through ADCC mechanisms.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the clinically relevant aspects of g-NK biology
      during antibody-containing therapy of lymphoproliferative diseases including whether the
      presence of g-NK might correlate with improved treatment responses.

      Up to 160 patients with either B cell NHL or CLL will be enrolled in this study.

      The study enrollment will occur over approximately 2 years. Patients will only be involved in
      this study until their blood samples are collected at the time point described below.

      The following data will be abstracted from the clinical record over the course of the study:

        -  Age (at beginning of remission-induction therapy)

        -  Gender

        -  Weight and height

        -  Pathological diagnosis including subtype and genetic testing when available.

        -  Stage at diagnosis

        -  Prognostic index score (IPI or FLIPI as appropriate)

        -  Date that remission-induction therapy begins

        -  Chemotherapy used for remission-induction.

        -  Dose of anti-CD20 antibody administered during remission-induction

        -  Remission status after 3 cycles of remission-induction therapy (if available)

        -  Details of maintenance therapy (drug, dose, schedule)

        -  Date of progression or relapse.

      The CMV status of individuals will be measured by serology in the laboratory of Dr. Lee.

      The presence and function of g-NK cells will be identified and quantified following staining
      with appropriate fluorescent monoclonal antibody conjugates using flow cytometry of
      peripheral blood.

      Samples from individuals will be examined to determine changes over time associated with
      remission-induction and maintenance anti-CD20 based treatment.
