  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement an intervention designed to promote ethnic and racial identity
      development. It is hypothesized that the intervention will have positive effects on
      ethnic-racial identity development, stress biology (including sleep hours and quality and
      diurnal cortisol profiles), emotional well-being, executive functioning, and academic
      outcomes, particularly for minority youth.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On average, students from disadvantaged racial-ethnic minority groups (such as Blacks and
      Hispanics) show lower academic performance and attainment on a variety of measures, including
      grades, test scores and graduation rates. Racial-ethnic minority students are also exposed to
      higher levels of stress, especially &quot;race-based stress,&quot; including higher levels of
      discrimination and stereotype threat. Past research has shown that race-based stress is
      related to alterations in stress biology, including altered stress hormone levels and less
      and lower quality sleep. Altered stress hormones and shorter and lower quality sleep in turn
      have important implications for multiple aspects of cognitive functioning, including
      executive functioning, that have known impacts on emotional well-being and academic
      performance.

      It is therefore hypothesized that disparities in race-based stress and stress biology may
      help to account for racial-ethnic disparities in academic performance. One (correlational,
      non-causal) purpose of this study, therefore, is to measure and test associations among
      race-based social stress (RBSS, such as perceived racial discrimination), stress biology
      (cortisol daily rhythms and sleep hours and quality) and academic outcomes in 300 high school
      students in a racially diverse, mid-sized, suburban high school.

      Additional research has shown that the presence of a strong ethnic-racial identity is
      associated with better-regulated stress biology and higher academic attainment. A second
      major purpose of this study, and the primary purpose of this RCT, is to test, through a
      random-assignment intervention, whether promoting positive ethnic and racial identity
      development serves to advance ethnic and racial identity development, improve stress biology,
      and improve emotional well-being, cognition (executive functioning), and academic outcomes.
      Positive effects on these outcomes are expected for those in the experimental (ethnic and
      racial identity promotion) group, compared to the comparison group. Effects are expected to
      be particularly strong for those in the experimental condition that are from black and
      hispanic ethnic and racial minority groups.

      The present study will assess race-based social stress (received racial discrimination and
      stereotype threat susceptibility), ethnic and racial identity, cortisol, sleep, cognition
      (executive functioning), emotional and academic adjustment, and academic outcomes in a cohort
      of 300 high school freshman both before and after an 8-week randomized control trial of the
      Identity Project Intervention (Umaña-Taylor &amp; Douglass, 2017; Umaña-Taylor, Douglass,
      Updegraff &amp; Marsiglia, 2017). Participants will be recruited in 2 or (if necessary) 3 annual
      waves, with baseline data collection for the study starting on December 16, 2017. Initial
      tests of the RCT effects will occur immediately after the intervention and in the year
      subsequent to the intervention. Questionnaire and administrative outcomes will continue to be
      measured through the senior year of high school. Additional funding will be sought to measure
      physical health outcomes, and to follow participants into their college and/or work years.
      Study plans and hypotheses for these follow-on studies will be registered separately.

    <measure>Ethnic and Racial Identity (ERI) development: Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 month following the 8-week intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure an ethnic and racial identity total score from the Ethnic Identity Scale (Douglass &amp; Umaña-Taylor, 2015). The measure uses a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (does not describe me at all) to 4 (describes me very well). The mean score is computed for the total score. Therefore the minimum score is 1, and maximum is 4. Negatively worded items are reverse scored, so that higher scores indicate higher levels ethnic and racial identity development.</description>

    <measure>Ethnic and Racial Identity (ERI) development: Centrality</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 month following the 8 week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the centrality with a modified version of the Centrality subscale from the Multidimensional Inventory of Black Identity (MIBI; Sellers, Rowley, Chavous, Shelton, &amp; Smith, 1997). The subscale uses a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The mean score is computed for the total score. Therefore the minimum score is 1, and maximum is 7. Negatively worded items are reverse scored, so that higher scores indicate a greater extent to which a person normatively defines her or himself with regard to race. It is a measure of whether race is a core part of an individual's self-concept.</description>

    <description>The investigators will assess student emotional wellbeing, specifically adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms using Child Behavior Check List, Youth Self Report 11-18 (CBCL YSR; Achenbach, 1991). The YSR includes 112 problem items on a 1 (not true) to 3 (very true or often true) Likert-type scale. The total problem scale is divided into 9 syndrome subscales (i.e., withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, aggressive behavior, and self-destructive/identity problems). The items are summed for a raw score, which is converted to a T-score and corresponding percentile. A T-Score of 65 or greater represents 1.5 standard deviations (or greater) above the mean, and is indicative of clinically significant adolescent problems (both internalizing and externalizing). Higher scores indicate worse symptoms.</description>

    <description>The investigators will assess self-reported executive functioning (inhibition) using the Behavior Rating Inventory of executive function Self-Report Version (Guy, Gioia, &amp; Isquith, 2004). The BRIEF contains 80 items on a 1 (never a problem) to 3 (often a problem) Likert-type scale. The Inhibit Scale is one of three scales that make up the Behavioral Regulation Index. The items from this scale are summed for a raw score, which are converted to a T-score and corresponding percentile. T of 65 or greater represents 1.5 standard deviations (or greater) above the mean, and indicative of clinically significant deficits in executive functioning, specially related to inhibition. Higher scores are indicative of worse executive functioning, namely poorer ability to control impulses (inhibitory control) and to stop engaging in a behavior.</description>

    <description>A brief paper and pencil measure of executive functioning, the Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B), will be administered (Tombaugh, 2004). TMT-B provides a measure of cognitive flexibility and set switching. The total raw score time for TMT-A is subtracted from TMT-B to obtain a difference score, to remove the effects of pure processing speed from the TMT-B executive functioning scores. Higher scores are indicative of more time to complete the TMT-B task (while removing baseline processing speed), and suggestive of worse executive functioning. There are no recommended cut-offs, and this score is rather a comparative score.</description>

    <description>The NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test (Gershon et al., 2013; Zelazo, &amp; Bauer, 2013) measures set shifting, or the capacity for switching among multiple aspects of a strategy or task. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these &quot;vectors&quot; ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value from 0-10. For any given individual, accuracy is considered first. If accuracy levels for the participant are less than or equal to 80%, the final &quot;total&quot; computed score is equal to the accuracy score. If accuracy levels for the participant reach more than 80%, the reaction time score and accuracy score are combined.</description>

    <description>The NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (Gershon et al., 2013; Zelazo, &amp; Bauer, 2013) measures the allocation of one's limited capacities to deal with an abundance of environmental stimulation. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time and is identical for both the Flanker and DCCS measures (described below). A 2-vector scoring method is employed that uses accuracy and reaction time, where each of these &quot;vectors&quot; ranges in value between 0 and 5, and the computed score, combining each vector score, ranges in value from 0-10. For any given individual, accuracy is considered first.

    <description>The NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test (Gershon et al., 2013; Zelazo, &amp; Bauer, 2013) measures the acquisition, storage and retrieval of new information. It involves conscious recollection of information learned within a context. The PSMT is scored using IRT methodology. The number of adjacent pairs placed correctly for each of trials 1 and 2 is converted to a theta score, which provides a representation of the given participant's estimated ability in this episodic memory task. All normative standard scores are provided. Scores are converted to age-corrected Standard Scores and fully-corrected (including gender and educational level) T-Scores. The present study will use fully-corrected T-scores, which are evaluated on the normal bell curve.</description>

    <description>The NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (Gershon et al., 2013; Zelazo, &amp; Bauer, 2013) measures the amount of time it takes to mentally process a set amount of information, or the amount of information that can be processed within a certain unit of time. It is a measure that reflects mental efficiency. The participant's raw score is the number of items answered correctly in 85 seconds of response time, with a range of 0-130. This score is then converted to the NIH Toolbox normative standard scores. Scores are converted to age-corrected Standard Scores and fully-corrected (including gender and educational level) T-Scores. The present study will use fully-corrected T-scores, which are evaluated on the normal bell curve.</description>

    <description>The NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test (Gershon et al., 2013; Zelazo, &amp; Bauer, 2013) measures the capacity of an individual to hold information in a short-term buffer and manipulate the information. List Sorting is scored by summing the total number of items correctly recalled and sequenced on 1-List and 2-List, which can range from 0-26. This score is then converted to the nationally normed standard scores. Scores are converted to age-corrected Standard Scores and fully-corrected (including gender and educational level) T-Scores. The present study will use fully-corrected T-scores, which are evaluated on the normal bell curve.</description>

    <description>The NIH Toolbox computes a Fluid Intelligence composite score (Gershon et al., 2013; Zelazo, &amp; Bauer, 2013). This composite includes the Flanker, Dimensional Change Card Sort, Picture Sequence Memory, List Sorting and Pattern Comparison. The composite score is derived by averaging the standard scores of each of the measures, and then deriving standard scores based on this new distribution. An Age-Corrected Standard Score, Fully Corrected T-Score, Uncorrected Standard Score and associated Percentiles are computed. Higher scores indicate higher levels of functioning. An uncorrected or age-corrected standard score at or near 100 indicates ability that is average compared with others nationally. A Fully Corrected T-Score at or near 50 indicates ability that is average compared with others nationally and with similar demographic characteristics, and one below 40 suggests the possibility of health-related, acquired cognitive impairment.</description>

    <description>Salivary cortisol samples self-collected by participants four times per day for four weekdays (Monday through Thursday) on the same week as the diary and sleep measurement, at waking, 30 minutes after waking, immediately after school, and at bedtime. The diurnal cortisol slope is rate of change (usually decline) in cortisol from waking to bedtime, measured in micrograms per deciliter per hour. A steeper rate of decline in cortisol from waking to bedtime is considered an indicator of positive cortisol functioning; the researchers expect a stronger decline in cortisol in the experimental as compared to the active comparison condition. The researchers expect this to be the strongest cortisol finding, with larger effect sizes than for the next two cortisol outcome variables.</description>
