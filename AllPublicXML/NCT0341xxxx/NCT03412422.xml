  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive leg raise (PLR) and fluid challenge are useful tools in assessing the fluid
      responsiveness. However, they require continuous monitoring of cardiac output, which is
      usually an invasive technique and in some cases not always available. Vascular ultrasound can
      be an alternative to cardiac output monitoring in a fluid status evaluation. The common
      carotid artery (CCA) is an easily accessible vessel. It has recently been noted that the
      diameter of this artery changes after an intravenous fluid bolus. It is possible that the
      change in the diameter of the common carotid artery during passive leg raise and fluid
      challenge can be a predictor of fluid responsiveness.

    <description>During the procedure, the investigator will be imaging one of the carotid arteries with ultrasound. In expiratory phase, four sets of three video loops will be recorded: before and after PLR and then before and after fluid challenge. There also will be noted hemodynamic parameters measured with PiCCO monitor. The fluid challenge is defined as administration of 500ml of crystalloid in less than 10 minutes. Later, another investigator, who will be blinded to other data, will measure the maximal and minimal diameter of CCA in each loop. The measurements will be averaged and eventually two values (maximal an minimal) from each set will be obtained.</description>
