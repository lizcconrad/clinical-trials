    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective open-label randomized controlled clinical trial with a two-group
      parallel design aiming to prove the Yi-Qi-Qing-Jie formula combined immunosuppressive agents
      brings less adverse events but more potential renal benefit than only immunosuppressive
      monotherapy for the treatment in high-risk IgAN patients.

      The investigators designed to recruit 56 participants with progressive IgA nephropathy
      (proteinuria greater than 1 g/d and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of 20 to 60
      mL/min/1.73m2 after a run-in phase of 4 weeks of optimized supportive care) and to provide
      follow-up.

      Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment groups- combination therapy group(n = 28):
      optimized supportive care, oral decoction, prednisolone plus intravenous cyclophosphamide;
      immunosuppressive monotherapy group(n = 28): optimized supportive care, oral prednisolone
      plus intravenous cyclophosphamide. All patients were followed up for 48 weeks.

    <description>The optimized supportive care included:
Lifestyle: low-salt, restricted protein dietary with sufficient calorie supply, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol consumption and keeping a healthy weight
The use of renin-angiotensin system blockade: lowering blood pressure to a target below 130/80 mmHg, during which treatment was adjusted to ensure that patients were receiving the maximum labeled or tolerated dose of RAS blockade
Patients with Diabetes Mellitus received insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve HbA1c&lt;7.0%
Received uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors as necessary to achieve serum uric acid &lt;6 mg/dL</description>
