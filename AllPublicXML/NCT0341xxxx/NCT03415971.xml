  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The result of the study will demonstrate that the functional activity of maxillofacial area
      with edentulous posterior bounded spaces recovers more effectively in patients treated with
      restorations on implants comparing to patients treated with fixed dentures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will be provided with electromyographic research before denture treatment, in a
      month and three months after the termination of treatment.

    <description>The present study demonstrated that Osseo Speed implants are safe and reasonable way of treatment for partial tooth loss in the lateral side. There was observed healthy soft tissue and marginal bone stability around the implants. Received data analysis using surface EMG allow to assume than functional state of maxillofacial region and neuromuscular coordination of the muscles of mastication in patients with bounded edentulous space in the lateral side (molars and/or premolars) with implant-supported prosthesis is considerably better than in patients with fixed bridges. Implant-supported prosthesis provide greater bite force for chewing function in comparison with fixed bridges , but certainly less effective than natural teeth. Implant-supported prosthesis increase patients' quality of life and is more convenient for dentoalveolar apparatus.</description>
