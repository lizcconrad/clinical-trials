    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter real-world retrospective comparative study. The patients with
      thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophagectomy and adjuvant
      chemotherapy(Cisplatin plus Docetaxel or Lobaplatin plus Docetaxel) from 6 centers in China
      were enrolled from Jan.2013 to Dec.2016. Completed clinical and pathological data were
      collected from Large-scale Data Analysis Center of Cancer Precision Medicine-LinkDoc database
      and analyzed by using data technology support from LinkDoc by using R-language. A hybrid
      solution for extracting structured medical infromation from unstructured data in medical
      records via a double-reading/entry system. The World Health Organization (Toxicity Grading
      Scale for Determining the Severity of Adverse Events) was used. The side effects of adjuvant
      chemotherapy and overall survival rate were compared by a propensity score. The 6 centers are
      The affiliated Cancer Hospital of ZhengZhou university/Henan Cancer Hospital, Anyang Cancer
      Hospital, Anhui Province Hospital, The first affiliated Hospital of Anhui university, Tangdu
      Hospital/the affiliated Hospital of Fourth Military Medical University, The First Affiliated
      Hospital of Xi'an Jiao Tong University.
