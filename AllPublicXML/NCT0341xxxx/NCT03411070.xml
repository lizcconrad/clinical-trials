  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well radiofrequency tagged surgery works in treating
      patients with breast cancer. Tagging radiofrequency markers to lymph nodes in the area of the
      armpit (axilla) to which cancer has spread may help doctors more accurately identify lymph
      nodes for removal.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Percentage of patients with successful retrieval of the radiofrequency (RF) tag confirmed
      by specimen radiography.

      II. Percentage of patients with successful retrieval of the biopsied node, confirmed by
      presence of clip, biopsy changes or treatment-related changes on pathology.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Total number of lymph nodes removed. II. Percentage of patients in which clipped node was
      a sentinel node. III. Percentage of patients with nodal pathologic complete response (PCR).
      IV. Residual cancer burden (RCB) score for patients with residual nodal disease.

      V. Percentage of patients requiring axillary dissection. VI. Days prior to surgery of tag
      insertion.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo image-guided placement of the radiofrequency tag within 4 weeks before
      standard of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients undergo standard of care surgery 3-6
      weeks after chemotherapy.
