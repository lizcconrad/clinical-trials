      This randomized, open label, four-way crossover phase I study is to evaluate the food effect
      of Ibuprofen CR Tablets 600 mg (IBUCR), and its bioavailability comparison versus 3 doses of
      the reference arms including Advil® Ibuprofen Tablets 200 mg (IBUAdv) and Motrin® IB
      Ibuprofen Tablets 200 mg (IBUMot) in normal healthy volunteers.

      This study will enroll at least 26 evaluable subjects. The duration for test and reference
      treatments is 24 to 32 hours with a washout period of at least 5 days after the last dose
      administration of study drugs. The total study will take at least 28 days.

      Subjects who meet all eligible requirements for participating in the study will receive all
      following interventions according to one of the 4 random sequences by Williams design.

        1. One tablet of IBUCR 600 mg under fasting condition

        2. One tablet of IBUCR 600 mg under fed condition

        3. IBUAdv with a 4-hour dosing interval for 3 tablets (3×200 mg, q4h) under fasting
           condition

        4. IBUMot with a 4-hour doing interval for 3 tablets (3×200 mg, q4h) under fasting
           condition

      The blood sampling schedule are described as follows:

      -For subjects receiving IBUCR (fed and fasted): Before dose administration (blank) and at
      0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 5h, 6h, 7h, 8h, 12h, 18h, 24h, 28h, 32h post-dose (A total
      of 17 samples per subject)

      -For subjects receiving IBUAdv/IBUMot (fasted): Before dose administration (blank) and at
      0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, 3h, 4h, 4.5h, 5h, 5.5h, 6h, 6.5h, 7h, 8h, 8.5h, 9h, 9.5h, 10h,
      10.5h, 11h, 12h, 16h, 20h, 24h post-dose (A total of 25 samples per subject)
