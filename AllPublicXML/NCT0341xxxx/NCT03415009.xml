  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Response to peginterferon and ribavirin treatment in hepatitis C (HCV) depends on viral and
      host factors. Single nucleotide polypmorphisms (SNP) near to IL28B gene (especially at
      rs12979860 and rs8099917) are strongly associated with the response to treatment in HCV
      genotype 1 infection, less so in HCV genotype 2/3 infection. CC genotype in rs12979860 and TT
      genotype at rs8099917 are associated with good treatment outcome. Asian populations have high
      prevalence of CC genotype in other studies, which can explain relatively good response to
      peginterferon/ ribavirin in genotype 1 infection in Asians compared with Caucasians.

      The prevalence of different genotypes of IL28B polymorphism in the local population will be
      studied. DNA will be extracted from the whole blood sample of hepatitis C patients with
      genotype 1, 2 and 3 infection. It will be amplified by real-time PCR and subsequently
      analysed for the genotypes of IL28B SNPs.
