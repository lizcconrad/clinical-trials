  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of hypofractionated partial
      breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for low-risk breast cancer patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total dose of 40.05Gy in 15 fractions was delivered to the tumor bed for each eligible
      breast cancer patients. The endpoints including loco-regional recurrence, cosmetic outcomes,
      and toxicities, were evaluated after treatment.
