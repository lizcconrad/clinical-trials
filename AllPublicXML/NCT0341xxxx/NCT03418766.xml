  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of white matter lesions in Chinese
      migraineurs with and without right-to-left shunt. The aim is to study the relationship among
      right-to-left shunt, migraine and white matter lesions.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter study of Chinese population. Participants (normal
      individuals without migraine and migraineurs) are included after standardized diagnostic
      procedures (TCD and migraine diagnosis). For all the participants, brain MRI and c-TCD are
      required. Up to 10-15 study sites nationwide will be needed to recruit the planned
      participant population during a 1-year period.

      The information of each participants will be registered, including basic facts, the
      longitudinal headache history, frequency, location, quality, intensity, duration, accompanied
      symptoms, precipitating and exacerbating factors, with or without aura, and Headache Impact
      Test-6 (HIT-6) questionnaire.

        We detect RLS through contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (c-TCD). The normal
        individuals will be selected to group 1, while those who suffer from migraine will be
        selected to group 2. All the participants are required to take c-TCD and brain MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who fulfilled the criteria for migraine according to the International
             Classification of Headache Disorders III-beta were included.

        healthy volunteers without a history of migraine were included as controls.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were excluded from the study if they had severe arterial stenosis, an
             insufficient temporal window, inadequate cubital venous access, and/or were unable to
             perform the Valsalva manoeuvre (VM) because of severe heart or lung disease.
