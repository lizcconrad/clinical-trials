      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of a
      game-based intervention (Prognosis) designed to improve science, technology, engineering, and
      mathematics (STEM) skills among high school-aged students. The research questions are as
      follows:

      H1: Students will find Prognosis usable, feasible, and acceptable and recommend continued
      development and testing of Prognosis.

      H2: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to perform basic quantitative data skills
      such as calculating incidence and prevalence.

      H3: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to observe patterns in data at the
      neighborhood and city level.

      H4: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to construct explanations and models
      describing the organization of systems in the game and how they contribute to health
      outcomes.

      H5: After playing Prognosis, students will be able to formulate and test hypotheses for how
      to best coordinate various city systems and leverage finite resources to reach their target
      health goal.

    <description>Prognosis will be a single-player 2D, digital simulation game and supporting multimedia website. Players are situated as a major official of Hexacago, and tasks them with managing the city's finances, education levels, and health concerns to lower rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. In the game Prognosis, player dispatches professionals from a variety of fields to different neighborhoods around the city, observing the effects of their resource allocation decisions across multiple systems over many in-game months. The supporting multimedia website will house curriculum and learning tools to support the learning objectives of Prognosis.</description>
