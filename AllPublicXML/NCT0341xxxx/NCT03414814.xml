  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, non-randomized multicentre phase 2 study in NSCLC patients with EGFR
      exon 20 insertion mutation, whose disease has progressed on standard chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EGFR exon 20 insertion-mutant NSCLCs are generally resistant to 1st-generation EGFR tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as well as 2nd-generation EGFR TKIs (overall response rates of
      0-8.7%). Osimertinib is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR-TKI selective for sensitizing EGFR
      and EGFR T790M resistance mutations with a significant selectivity margin against wild-type
      EGFR. Osimertinib is potent with a wide therapeutic window in Ba/F3 cells with EGFR exon 20
      insertion mutations. Therefore, this study will be performed to investigate the efficacy of
      osimertinib in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

          2. Male or female must be &gt; 19 years of age.

          3. Locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy
             with local confirmation of the presence of the EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation

          4. Disease progression while on standard chemotherapy (platinum doublet chemotherapy or
             single-agent chemotherapy in selected patients)

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.

          6. Patients must have a life expectancy â‰¥ 12 weeks

          7. Females should be using adequate contraceptive measures, should not be breast feeding
             and must have a negative pregnancy test prior to start of dosing if of child-bearing
             potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential by fulfilling one of
             the following criteria at screening:

          8. Male patients should be willing to use barrier contraception

          9. Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up.

         10. At least one measurable lesion

         11. Provision of archival FFPE tissue

         12. Provision of informed consent for translational genetic research

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to both sponsor staff
             and/or staff at the study site)

          2. Previous treatment with osimertinib (3rd generation EGFR TKIs such as olumtinib,
