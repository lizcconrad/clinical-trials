  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is produced from the metabolism of gut microbiota and is
      reportedly pro-atherogenic and associated with cardiovascular events. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the sequential change in TMAO levels by current optimal secondary
      prevention therapies in patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) and
      the clinical impact of TMAO levels on the progression of atherosclerosis and subsequent
      cardiovascular events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes patients with their first STEMI. The investigators measure plasma TMAO
      levels using the frozen plasma at the onset of STEMI and 10 months later (the chronic phase).
      To assess plaque progression, residual SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary
      Intervention With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score and chronic-phase SYNTAX score are
      measured. After the chronic-phase assessment of TMAO and SYNTAX score, patients are followed
      for cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and
      unstable angina pectoris with coronary revascularization.
