  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Under contract to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Mathematica Policy
      Research is conducting an impact study of Healthy Families Healthy Futures in Houston, Texas
      for a Federal Evaluation of Programs for Expectant and Parenting Youth (PEPY). The impact
      study will be designed to address three main questions:

        -  Was the program successful in exposing participants to program content, such as
           information about methods of birth control?

        -  Was the program successful at improving short-term outcomes, such as use of a LARC and
           intention to space births?

        -  To what extent did treatment youth receive the intended program components?

      A random assignment design will be used to assess the program's impact on exposure to program
      content and short term outcomes. Potential study participants were recruited between June
      2015 and October 2016, and were considered eligible for participation if they were first time
      mothers between the ages of 14 and 19, English or Spanish speakers, had not enrolled in the
      program in the previous six mounts, and were not enrolled in the Nurse Family Partnership
      program. Potential participants who were eligible and who consented to participate were
      randomly assigned to (1) a treatment group that was eligible for Healthy Families Healthy
      Futures (HFHF) services or (2) a control group that was not eligible for HFHF. Random
      assignment was conducted within two blocks determined by whether study participants were
      pregnant at the time of random assignment or were parenting at the time of random assignment.
      The study draws on data from HFHF administrative records on service receipt, a baseline
      survey administered prior to random assignment, and a follow-up survey administered
      approximately 12 months after random assignment.

    <description>Family coaches meet with participating pregnant and parenting females, the woman's partner, and the child. Visit frequency varies from once per week to once per month, depending on the length of time in the program, the client's needs, and the accomplishment of program milestones. In the short term, the program seeks to increase the use of Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC), enhance family functioning including improving father involvement, and to meet the baby's child development needs. In the long term, the program aims to delay subsequent pregnancies, ensure positive child development, and increase parents' self-sufficiency.</description>
