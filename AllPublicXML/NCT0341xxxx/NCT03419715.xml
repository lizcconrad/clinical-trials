  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to assess the effectiveness of topically applied bimatoprost in reducing
      migraine headache frequency, severity, and duration. It will also assess the effect of
      topical bimatoprost on quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hall, et al. have observed retrospectively that treatment with topical prostaglandin F2 alpha
      analogs (applied either to the eye or fingernail bed) significantly reduced the frequency,
      severity and duration of headaches in migraine sufferers, as well as their migraine
      disability assessment score (MIDAS).

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective clinical study to determine if the
      effect of FDA-approved bimatoprost, a prostaglandin F2 alpha analogue, has anti-migraine
      activity when administered topically to people suffering from migraine.

    <description>Change from baseline in quality of life as measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS). MIDAS is a five-item instrument developed to measure migraine related disability and functional consequences. It is divided into four categories based on the score of: 0-5, minimal disability; 6-10, mild disability; 11-20, moderate disability; greater than 20; severe disability.</description>
