      This clinical research studies the physiology and immunology of new-onset post-transplant
      diabetes mellitus in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Oral glucose
      tolerance tests (OGTT), hyperglycemic clamps, and immune assays will be used to define the
      mechanisms associated with abnormal glucose homeostasis following stem cell transplantation.
      Information from this clinical trial could be used to develop standardized screening
      procedures or to develop optimal treatment strategies for patients developing post-transplant
      diabetes mellitus.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if changes in islet cell physiology are detectable before or after matched
      related donor (MRD) hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) in patients developing new-onset
      post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM).

        1. To determine if a compensatory increase in glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)
           by β-cells precedes PTDM development in patients without diabetes undergoing MRD HCT.

        2. To determine if excess glucagon secretion and impaired α-cell response to glucose or
           GLP-1 contributes to the hyperglycemia of PTDM.

      II. To determine if the IL-33/ST2 axis promotes immune/islet cell dysregulation during PTDM.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 2 OGTTs and a standard hyperglycemic clamp procedure prior to HCT. Patients
      then undergo repeat OGTTs and a hyperglycemic clamp procedure once after HCT between days
      80-100.

    <measure>Pre-transplant insulin secretion will be measured as glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) during a hyperglycemic clamp procedure among patients who do or do not go on to develop PTDM (univariable analysis).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days pre-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>A hyperglycemic clamp procedure will be performed pre-transplant. Pre-transplant will be defined as no more than 28 days before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Patients will then be followed for 100 days after transplant for development of diabetes. In univariable analysis, a Wilcoxon rank sum test will be applied to compare the population mean difference in GSIS between these two groups.</description>

    <description>A hyperglycemic clamp procedure will be performed pre-transplant. Pre-transplant will be defined as no more than 28 days before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Patients will then be followed for 100 days after transplant for development of diabetes. In multivariable analysis, logistic regression will evaluate whether GSIS is an independent predictor of PTDM after adjusting for the following covariates: gender, conditioning (ablative vs. reduced intensity), or acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) requiring steroids. The estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval of the OR will be provided to measure the effect of the association.</description>
