  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with wrist pain on the little finger side of the wrist will received either
      usual care, consisting of ultrasound, specialized massage and stabilization exercises therapy
      for 6 weeks, or will receive injection of dextrose at 0, 3 and 6 weeks. After 9-week data is
      gathered, dextrose injections will be offered as needed to both groups, with follow-up at 6
      and 12 months

      Participants with ulnar side wrist pain and who score more than 40 the Patient Rated Wrist
      Evaluation rating scale will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 open label to one of two groups.
      Group 1 will receive 6 weeks of therapy to consist primarily of therapeutic ultrasound,
      myofascial release and stabilization exercises. Group 2 will receive injections at 0, 3 and 6
      weeks of 12.5% dextrose in 1% lidocaine with 1 ml volume each in 5 locations: Origin of ulnar
      collateral ligament, insertion of ulnar collateral ligament on the triquetrum, insertion of
      the extensor carpi ulnaris on the base of the 5th metacarpal, triquetral hamate ligament and
      ulnotriquetral joint space. At 9 weeks data will be gathered and each group will receive
      dextrose injections as needed until 12-month follow-up.
