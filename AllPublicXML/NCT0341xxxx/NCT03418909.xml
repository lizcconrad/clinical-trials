    <textblock>
      To investigate the treatment related effects of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) versus
      oncological treatment of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with a 1-year follow up.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are enrolled prospectively at the department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck
      Surgery &amp; Audiology at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet.

      All eligible patients with histologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx,
      regardless of treatment option (as long as the intent is curative) can be included.

      Outcome measures are assessed at baseline and repeated 3 and 12 months after treatment.
