  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to understand the journey that patients eventually are diagnosed with
      vasculitis experience in the period prior to their formal diagnosis by a healthcare provider.
      Data elements of interest include average time from the onset of the first symptoms to the
      time a diagnosis of vasculitis is confirmed. Other aims include identifying factors
      associated with the time to diagnosis. These factors will be divided into: a) intrinsic
      factors, or so-called &quot;patient-related factors&quot;, such as the type of vasculitis symptoms,
      patient demographics, socioeconomic status, patients' beliefs regarding the etiology of their
      symptoms, and other factors, and b) extrinsic factors, or &quot;professional/health system
      factors&quot;, such as healthcare access, referral patterns, testing patterns, and other factors.
      Understanding such factors can guide future efforts to shorten delays in diagnosis and
      thereby improve outcomes. All analyses will be done for the population of patients with
      vasculitis as a whole and by individual types of vasculitis.
