  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a paucity of data on management of non-acute postpartum anemia. Although blood
      transfusions were historically initiated with 2 units, the most recent recommendation from
      the American Association of Blood Banks is to begin with 1 unit. As no randomized controlled
      trials have been performed in obstetrics, the investigators propose a randomized, controlled
      trial in non-acute postpartum anemia comparing single- versus multiple-unit transfusion by
      total numbers of units transfused and maternal morbidity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which accounts for 30% of all direct maternal deaths, is the
      single most important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality across the globe and is a
      focus of attention of national organizations such as the Council for Patient Safety in
      Women's Health in recent years. Yet, there remains a paucity of data on the appropriate
      management of non-acute postpartum anemia.

      It is common practice in obstetrics to offer a transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs)
      to women with a hemoglobin (Hb) value less than 7 g/dL (hematocrit less than 20%) and to
      symptomatic women with even higher hemoglobin levels. Although transfusions were historically
      initiated with 2 units of pRBCs, the most recent recommendation from the American Association
      of Blood Banks (AABB) for a stable patient is to begin with 1 unit and reassess. However,
      while surgical data has successfully demonstrated that liberal blood transfusion increases
      morbidity and mortality in comparison to restricted transfusion, no randomized controlled
      trials have been performed in obstetrics to demonstrate superiority of a single-unit
      transfusion protocol.

      The investigators propose a randomized, controlled trial in non-acute postpartum anemia
      comparing single-unit versus multiple-unit transfusion by total numbers of units transfused
      and maternal morbidity at the University of Pennsylvania with the hypothesis that single-unit
      transfusions can reduce the number of units transfused without increasing maternal morbidity.
