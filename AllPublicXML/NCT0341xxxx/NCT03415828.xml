  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DISCOGEL® is on the market since 2007. About 20,000 kits were sold to date (October 2017).
      The device re-obtained its CE mark in 2017.

      A clinical evaluation was performed by bibliographic route in 2016. Clinical data on more
      than 600 patients treated by DISCOGEL® were analyzed. These data should be confirmed by
      monitoring on the long term, with a large cohort of patients, over a two-year follow-up
      period.

      As part of the post-CE surveillance, the manufacturer GELSCOM is responsible of this
      &quot;Post-Market Clinical Follow-up&quot; (PMCF) study in accordance with Directive 93/42/EEC and
      MEDDEV guide 2.12/2, to assess the efficacy and the long-term safety of DISCOGEL®.

      The study is comparative. The results will evaluate the performance and safety of the
      CE-marked medical device used in &quot;real life&quot;, in comparison with a steroid infiltration, used
      according to its indication and to the current standards. It will include economic data.
      Patients and evaluators will be blinded. Both DISCOGEL® and HYDROCORTANCYL 2,5 POUR CENT are
      authorized products used according to their intended use.

      This is an interventional, prospective, national, multi-center, comparative, randomized,
      single-blind (patient and evaluator) post-market clinical study. The primary objective is to
      compare the short-term efficacy profile of DISCOGEL® versus intradiscal steroid.
