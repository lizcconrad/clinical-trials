  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospital-acquired influenza is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in
      hospitalized patients notably elderly patients. Furthermore, it is also associated with a
      large economic impact for the hospitals.

      The transmission of influenza has been mostly reported in pediatric and long-stay units. The
      chains of transmission of influenza in acute-stay units have to be describe in order to
      prevent and control potential outbreaks. Furthermore, to know clinical symptoms seems to be
      important in order to identify potential sources of virus as soon as possible and to set up
      appropriate hygiene prevention measures. Moreover, the definition of the hospital-acquired
      influenza has to be harmonized for all over the studies, especially concerning the delay
      between the admission in the hospital and the symptoms onset.

      The aim of this study is to describe the hospital-acquired influenza in a french university
      hospital of around 800 beds
