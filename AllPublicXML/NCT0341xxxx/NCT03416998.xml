  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Photobiomodulation with low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been widely used in
      clinical practice for diverse purposes, such as modulation of the inflammatory process,
      acceleration of the tissue repair process, pain relief and the enhancement of post-exercise
      recovery. Studies have demonstrated a beneficial interaction between photobiomodulation and
      the production of creatine kinase, with a reduction in the release of this marker of muscle
      damage when laser and/or LEDs is administered prior to high-intensity physical activity. The
      aim of the proposed study is to determine the influence of pre-exercise phototherapy on
      post-exercise muscle recovery.

      Methods: A randomized, cross-over, sham-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial is proposed.
      The participants will be healthy professional soccer players aged 15 to 20 years from the
      same team with a body mass index within the ideal range (20 to 25 kg/m2) and no history of
      lower limb musculoskeletal injuries or surgery or back surgery in the previous six months.
      The athletes will be allocated to two groups based on the previously calculated sample size
      and will be blinded to allocation. Creatine kinase will be measured and the subjective
      perception of fatigue will be determined for each participant. The volunteers will then be
      randomly allocated to Group A, which will receive active phototherapy, and Group B, which
      will receive sham phototherapy. The athletes will undergo reevaluations immediately after as
      well as 48 hours after a football match. The data will be submitted to statistical analysis
      and the level of significance will be set to 5%.

    <description>Phototherapy active group will be administered 30 minutes prior to the soccer match as well as 48 h after the match in direct contact with the skin with light pressure at predetermined sites: nine on the knee extensor muscles, six on the knee flexor muscles and two on the gastrocnemius muscle on both lower limbs.</description>

    <description>Phototherapy placebo group will be administered 30 minutes prior to the soccer match as well as 48 h after the match in direct contact with the skin with light pressure at predetermined sites: nine on the knee extensor muscles, six on the knee flexor muscles and two on the gastrocnemius muscle on both lower limbs.
For placebo treatment, the same procedures and treatment times will be employed, but the equipment will be set in placebo mode. Only the researcher in charge of programming the device will have knowledge regarding which treatment is being used. However, the programmer will not participate in the execution of the treatment, evaluations or data analysis</description>

    <description>Phototherapy will be performed using clusters of 12 diodes (Table 1); four 905 nm diodes (mean power of 0.3125 mW and peak power of 12.5 W for each diode; 250 Hz), four 875 nm diodes (mean power of 17.5 mW for each diode) and four 640 nm diodes (mean power of 15 mW for each diode). The device manufactured by Multi Radiance Medical® (Solon, OH, USA) will be used due to its high quality, ample use in clinical practice and due to the fact that no national companies manufacture diode clusters with the characteristics required for the proposed project.</description>
