  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe the physiological effects of two different Semi-occluded vocal
      tract (SOVT) exercises in the larynx and pharynx when they are executed by individuals with
      constant vocal effort and without vocal pathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SOVT is a voice education or rehabilitation method that involves different postures which
      partially occlude or elongate the vocal tract. It causes a change in the vibration pattern of
      the vocal folds. SOVT postures have been postulated to produce changes in contact quotient
      (CQ), measured with electroglottograph (EGG), as well as in stroboscopy parameters. Despite
      all the research, some results remain inconclusive. This study aims to observe the
      physiological effects of two different SOVT exercises in larynx and pharynx when they are
      executed by people with constant vocal effort and without vocal pathology. In order to do so,
      stroboscopy and EGG will be performed before and while 24 volunteers execute two SOVT
      exercises (tongue trill and resonance tubes). The following parameters will be captured: CQ,
      symmetry, amplitude, periodicity, mucosal wave, closure, vertical laryngeal position,
      anterior-to-posterior compression and pharyngeal width. An analysis of covariance will be
      used to observe the effect of the SOVT exercises.

    <description>24 participants will produce the vowel /a:/ as baseline during 10 seconds in habitual, comfortable speaking pitch and loudness. Thereafter, participants will produce 3 series of two semi-occluded vocal tract exercises (resonance tube, tongue trill). Electroglottographic and Stroboscopic signals will be captured with each task.</description>

    <description>Participants will phonate into a tube (10cm length 4mm inner diameter) during 5 seconds. They will produce 3 series of the vowel /u/ into the tube. They will be asked to maintain the same pitch and loudness as they did in the baseline samples. They will be perceptually controlled by experimenters. When performing the exercise, the participants will be instructed to phonate with ease voice and to sense vibrations in the anterior face and the mouth.</description>
