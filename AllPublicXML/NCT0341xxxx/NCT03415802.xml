  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is a common malignancy of digestive system with gradually increasing
      incidence, is the fourth and seventh leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world
      (1) and China (2) according to the statistics in 2014. The vast majority of patients were
      confirmed as locally advanced or distantly metastatic disease at diagnosis with an estimated
      five-year survival rate of 4% (3) due to occlusive development and rapid progress. Advanced
      pancreatic cancer is characterized by poor prognosis.

    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine has been approved as the standard chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer
      since 1996, but the efficacy is extremely limited by a response rate of 6-8%, and median
      survival of 5.5-7 months. However, Gemcitabine-based combination treatments fail to transcend
      GEM monotherapy on overall survival, including GEM + 5-Fu [10], GEM + Oxaliplatin[11], and
      GEM + Irinotecan [12] and GEM + Cisplatin [13] (7-8) . Until 2011, Conroy et al.[15] reported
      that FOLFIRINOX solutions significantly improved ORR (31.6% vs 9%, P=0.0008), PFS (6.4 vs.
      3.3 months, P&lt;0.0001) and OS (11.1 vs. 6.8 months, P&lt;0.001) than GEM single-agent, but the
      significant increase of grade 3/4 adverse reactions, to some extent, limited its wide
      application. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore effective and safe
      chemotherapy of advanced pancreatic cancer.

      Nab-Paclitaxel was approved by FDA for advanced pancreatic cancer in September 2013. S-1 has
      demonstrated potential value in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer as a new compound
      oral 5-FU(4-5) and has been approved for pancreatic cancer treatment in Japan.

      We conducted a single arm, prospective, phase II study in our center on the first-line
      treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer with nab-Paclitaxel and S-1 to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of the combination regimen.
