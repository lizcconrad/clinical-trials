  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of music to relieve pain has been studied in many forms of medicines and has been
      proven to reduce anxiety, pain and analgesic use in the perioperative setting. However, music
      listening as an inexpensive and duplicable method has not been investigated and implemented
      in the local context. The investigators hereby propose a prospective study to recruit
      patients undergoing surgery to evaluate the effectiveness of music in pain relief and
      post-operative recovery; as well as the implementation and operational readiness of music
      listening.

      Patients will be offered to select from pre-determined lists of music of different genres or
      patient choice, before and after surgery. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score,
      pain scores, analgesia usage, patient satisfaction, and quality of life measurement will be
      collected. Analysis of the type of music, duration of music listening, and the genre chosen
      will be analysed.

      This study will investigate the clinical relevance of music for pain relief in local context
      and cultural settings. The implementation and operational readiness of music listening can
      then be adopted as a non-invasive pain relief intervention in local surgical settings. This
      will prove patient outcomes with lower cost, greater efficacy and safety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some tissue injury is often unavoidable during surgery, which leads to unavoidable pain and
      anxiety during the perioperative and post-operative period. Acute post-operative pain and
      anxiety have been managed via pharmacological interventions (e.g. opioid-based analgesia) for
      over a century. However, non-pharmacological interventions - such as music - have also been
      shown to be safe and cost-effective, improve the overall patient experience, and improve
      outcomes across a variety of surgical settings.

      Music has been shown to decrease pain in the perioperative period, to reduce plasma, urine,
      and salivary cortisol levels, modulate the inflammatory response (natural killer
      lymphocytes), blood pressure, and heart rate.Additionally, anxiety scores and pain scores
      (measured using the visual analog scale (VAS)) have shown statistically significant
      reductions in the perioperative period, when music therapy was available.

      While music therapy in the hospital has been offered as a part of cognitive rehabilitation
      services or end of life care, there are very few studies which investigate its effects during
      the perioperative period, especially in the local setting. In KK Women's and Children's
      Hospital (KKH), there were over 31,000 surgeries done in a year (April 2015 to March 2016).
      Based on the above rationale, the investigators shall therefore investigate the feasibility
      and practicability of deploying music listening in pain management in KKH, and further
      determine the nature of the music (duration, genre) by fitting the local context in order to
      improve the patient outcome in perioperative settings.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>HADS Anxiety and Depression score before and after surgery. HADS is commonly used by doctors to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3 and this means that a person can score between 0 and 21 for either anxiety or depression. The HADS uses a scale and therefore the data returned from the HADS is ordinal. For each subscore (anxiety/depression), 0-7 = Normal; 8-10 = Borderline abnormal (borderline case); and 11-21 = Abnormal (case).</description>

    <measure>Change in EQ-5D-3L score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D-3L score before and after surgery. EQ-5D-3L is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It is made up for two components; health state description and evaluation. The health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; each dimension ranging from 1-3. From these five dimensions, EQ-5D index is calculated, having a value between 0-1. The evaluation part involves an analogue scale, asking to mark health status on the day of the interview on a 20 cm vertical scale with end points of 0 and 100. Zero corresponds to &quot; the worst health you can imagine&quot;, and hundred corresponds to &quot;the best health you can imagine&quot;.</description>

    <description>The recruiter will give the patient an ipod with earphone, in which the ipod is equipped with saved playlist of different music genres. Patient will choose the desired playlist and listen to the music for about 30 minutes, seated in a quiet environment in pre-operative waiting area before her turn for the scheduled surgery. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaire will be conducted during this period.
Patient will be sent to the recovery room after the surgery, and will start the music listening again for 30 minutes once she is ready and feel comfortable to start the session. Pain score, HADS and EQ-5D-3L will be collected from the patient, as well as interview on her satisfaction and experience on the music listening.</description>
