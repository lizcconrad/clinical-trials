  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Er:YAG pulse therapy for achieving
      pulpal analgesia in pediatric patients and to quantify the duration and extent of any effects
      assessed.

      Design: a randomized split-mouth study with two-way repeated measures design.

    <textblock>
      The intention of the technique of &quot;pre-emptive laser analgesia&quot; is to reduce sensation in
      that small percentage of patients who may experience unpleasant sensations during caries
      removal. Laser analgesia is a non-invasive, non-thermogenic bio-modulation of the dental pulp
      reactivity aiming for reduction of impulse formation of the pulpal nociceptors. It is based
      on the idea that parallel with the ablative high-energy level laser action, simultaneous low
      level laser therapy (LLLT) may occur. We hypothesize that when operating at pulse energies
      below the Er:YAG laser ablation threshold of tooth structure, the laser energy leads to loss
      of impulse conduction of type A-delta nerve fibers in the dental pulp, leading to an
      analgesic effect.

    <measure>Pain felt during treatment according to a visual analogue scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Reported by the patient at the end of the dental treatment session on a VAS (visual analogue scale), which contains a combination of Numeric Rating Scale (0-10, where 0 means no pain, 10 - worst possible pain) and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale, which includes pictures of facial expressions with correlating numbers of 0-10 (0 being 'no hurt' and 10 being 'hurts worst'). The combination allows children to pick a facial expression, that corresponds with their pain and see a number that matches it.</description>

    <time_frame>25 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated via electrical pulp tester (EPT) 5 minutes before and on the 5th and 20th minute after laser/placebo analgesic procedure. EPT result is a number.</description>

    <description>Cold-test is applied 4 minutes before and on the 6th and 21st minute after laser/placebo analgesia. Pain is reported by the patient on a VAS (visual analogue scale), which contains a combination of Numeric Rating Scale (0-10, where 0 means no pain, 10 - worst possible pain) and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale, which includes pictures of facial expressions with correlating numbers of 0-10 (0 being 'no hurt' and 10 being 'hurts worst').</description>

    <measure>Pain related behavior evaluated by the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability Behavioral Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluated by the outcomes assessor. The FLACC scale has five criteria - Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability, which are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2. Total score of scale is summed in range 0 to 10, where: 0=relaxed and comfortable; 1-3=mild discomfort; 4-6=moderate pain; 7-10=severe pain.</description>

    <measure>Need for local anesthesia infiltration during the treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Registered with 1=no; 2=yes. Patients who request that the procedure is terminated to administer an anesthetic injection, are asked to rate their level of pain, according to aforementioned visual analogue scale, immediately following termination. The visual analogue scale contains a combination of Numeric Rating Scale (0-10, where 0 means no pain, 10 - worst possible pain) and Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale, which includes pictures of facial expressions with correlating numbers of 0-10 (0 being 'no hurt' and 10 being 'hurts worst').</description>
