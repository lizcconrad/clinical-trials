      The Clinical trail is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study. The planned
      sample size is 240 subjects. These subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment group
      (Platinum-based two medicine (carboplatin / cisplatin) plus Sheng Bai oral liquid) or control
      group ( Platinum-based two medicine (carboplatin / cisplatin) plus blank control). The study
      population includes the patients with non-small-cell lung cancer .
