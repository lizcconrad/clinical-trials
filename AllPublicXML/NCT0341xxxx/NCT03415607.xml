  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Succinylcholine is a myorelaxant agent often used during rapid sequence induction for
      patients who need to undergo general anesthesia but who are at risk of pulmonary aspiration
      of gastric content. Whereas other myorelaxant agents are monitored with train of four
      stimulation to assess onset and duration, few anesthesiologists use train of four stimulation
      for onset of succinylcholine, as the anesthesiologists evaluate the effect with the time from
      injection (usually one minute) and the muscle fasciculation due to the release of
      acetylcholine.

      The data available on onset duration of this drug are old and bases on only few studies, but
      the succinylcholine if sometime harmful (anaphylaxis , cardiac arrest, bronchospasm).

      The investigators want to assess the onset time of succinylcholine with an objective toll ,
      the train of four stimulation, and evaluate if the clinical judgment of the anesthesiologist
      is reliable to predict an adequate moment for endotracheal intubation.
