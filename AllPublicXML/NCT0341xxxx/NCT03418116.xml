  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is conducted to evaluate the safety and benefit of the Argus II System in a
      selected patient population with advanced Retinitis Pigmentosa who have a measurable central
      residual visual field smaller than or equal to 5 degrees radius.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Argus II System is intended for use in blind patients with severe to profound retinitis
      pigmentosa with at least some light perception in the eye to be implanted.

      The majority of RP patients still have some central vision even at a very late stage of the
      disease. This extremely restricted visual field is, however, highly disabling in daily life.
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and benefit of the Argus II
      System in RP patients characterized as late stage with a central residual visual field
      smaller than or equal to 5 degrees radius . The electrode array will be placed in a para- to
      peri foveal location adjacent to the subject's residual visual field, thus increasing the
      total retinal area receptive to light.

      Safety data will be monitored to ensure continued acceptability of risks to study subjects
      and visual function will be measured to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in this
      &quot;better vision&quot; RP population. In addition, effects on functional vision and quality of life
      will be assessed through the Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment (FLORA) and the
      National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25).

    <description>The Argus II System is designed to provide visual function to individuals with severe to profound vision loss due to outer retinal degeneration. It consists of implanted and external components. The implant is an epiretinal prosthesis that is surgically implanted in and around the eye. The external equipment includes glasses and a video processing unit (VPU). The glasses include a miniature video camera, which captures video images, and a coil that sends data and stimulation commands to the implant. The VPU converts the video images into stimulation commands and is body-worn. The Argus II System operates by converting video images into electrical energy that activates retinal cells, delivering the signal through the optic nerve to the brain where it is perceived as light.</description>
