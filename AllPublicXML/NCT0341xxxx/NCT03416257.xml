  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators sought to prospectively examine the associations of
      plasma levels of TMAO, choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, and sarcosine with risk of incident
      carotid artery plaque, assessed by repeated B-mode carotid artery ultrasound imaging over a
      7-year period, in women and men with and without HIV infection from the WIHS and MACS.

        A total of 737 women and men with available baseline plasma choline metabolite data were
        included in this analysis. There were 520 HIV-infected (291 women, 229 men) and 217
        HIV-uninfected (107 women, 110 men) participants included in this study. Baseline
        characteristics are shownin Table 1. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants were
        generally similar in terms of demographic and behavioral variables, although HIV-infected
        participants were more likely to have a history of HCV infection. In addition, HIV-infected
        participants had lower total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels compared to those
        without HIV infection. The majority of HIV-infected individuals reported using potent ART
        at baseline (74% in women and 83% in men), and 46% of women and 66% of men had undetectable
        HIV-1 viral load (â‰¤80 copies/mL). Compared to men, women were younger, more likely to be of
        black race or Hispanice thnicity and current smokers, and have a history of HCV infection
        and higher BMI.
