      This study is designed to verify the clinical efficacy and safety of different statins in
      dyslipidemia patients, and explore the effects on glycometabolic in patients with impaired
      glucose regulation.

      Study Objective:

        1. The main Objective: To explore the effects of different statins lipid-lowering treatment
           on glucose metabolism in patients with impaired glucose regulation in a large sample of
           Chinese population;

        2. The secondary Objective: To obtain real-world evidence of the clinical efficacy and
           safety of statins lipid-lowering therapy in Chinese patients.

      Study Design: The study was an open-label, multi-center network register-based follow-up
      study.

      The total sample size: 10000 participants.
