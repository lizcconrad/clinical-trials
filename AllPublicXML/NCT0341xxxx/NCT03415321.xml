      A mobile support application will be developed that will support mothers in the postpartum
      period and will be tested the effects of application on anxiety and depression symptoms.The
      study will consist of two phases. The first phase of the action research (participant design
      method) method will be done to provide postpartum mobile support application. In the second
      stage, postpartum mobile support application will be evaluated for the anxiety and depression
      symptoms of the mothers after six weeks of use.

    <textblock>
      The postnatal period is a different life-cycle that requires compliance with the other
      members of the the family and mother. It requires new role adaptation such as newborn care
      and motherhood. Adapting to this period may not be equally challenging for every mother. This
      term is difficult to cope with for most mothers and causes social and psychological problems.
      The lack of information about the postpartum period makes them feel insecure, while the
      feeling of insecurity can turn into anxiety and depression afterwards. Feeling safe and
      having adequate knowledge and skills in the postpartum period is very important for maternal
      and infant health.

      The progress of the technology and the fact that the internet takes place at every stage of
      our life also causes to confusion in the postnatal period. Mothers apply for the information
      needs of the postpartum period, but the differences and inconsistencies of these sources of
      information create a sense of insecurity for the mothers. It is not easy for them to conduct
      research in the remaining times of the baby's first month after birth. Pre-natal training
      programs are forgotten or not effective until the end of the birth. Even postpartum period
      can bring new questions together. For all these reasons, it has been decided to develop a
      program to increase the motivation and reach of mothers with accurate and reliable
      information. This study will develop a mobile support application that will support mothers
      in the postpartum period and will test the effects of application on anxiety and depression
      symptoms.

      The study will consist of two phases. The first phase of the action research (participant
      design method) method will be developed to provide postpartum mobile support. In the second
      stage, postpartum mobile support will be evaluated for the anxiety and depression symptoms in
      the mothers after six weeks of use. In the first stage, postpartum mobile support application
      will be designed with the involvement of mothers by the action research method. First of all,
      postnatal adjustment of the information that mothers need will be made based on the
      literature and the first trial version of mobile support application will be created. This
      pre-created version will be reviewed for use, and deficiencies in terms of content, shape,
      and ease with a group of mothers.

      Proposals of the participants will be evaluated and updated. The postpartum mobile support
      application will be designed with a feature that allows ask questions directly to the
      researcher, aiming at being able to be with her anytime. The final mobile application will be
      evaluated in the experiment and control group during the testing phase, which is the second
      phase of the study. Mothers who are in postpartum period will be given detailed information
      about how to use the application that will be installed on the phones of the mobile support
      application to those in the experimental group before they leave the hospital and their
      security feelings, anxiety and depression levels will be evaluated as preliminary tests. For
      this purpose, anxiety and depression scales at postnatal period will be used. The mothers in
      the control group will continue to receive routine maintenance services that will not install
      applications on their phones. Discharged mothers will receive instant information,
      motivational messages, and ask the investigator if they have any questions with mobile
      support application for six weeks. At the end of six weeks, the mothers will be interviewed
      again and their anxiety and depression levels will be reevaluated. The pre-test post-test
      results will be analyzed in the experimental and control groups and the effectiveness of the
      mobile support application will be tested.

      With this study, it was aimed to access of the right information in the early postpartum
      period at their houses, feel sense of security, prevent the emergence of symptoms of anxiety
      and depression. Since it is not possible for nurses to be with postpartum mothers after birth
      at any moment in our country so this study will make the follow-up of the mothers easier. If
      the effectiveness of the application is tested, it will be updated later and will be released
      and published. Thus, while the births, infants and mothers's follow-up are provided directly,
      health problems that may arise in the postnatal period will be detected early and an
      important result will be obtained in terms of community health.

    <measure>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Postpartum 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a 10-item self-report scale that evaluates depressive symptoms just after delivery developed by Cox et al. (1987). EPDS will be used to assess depression in fathers and mothers. Each item is scored on a four-point scale(0-3), the minimum and maximum scores being 0 and 30,respectively. The prevalence of depression will be identified using the recommended cut-off point of 13 or above. The following severity ranges were established for the EPDS: None or minimal depression (0-6), Mild depression (7-13), Moderate depression (14-19), Severe depression (19-30).The EPDS score should not override clinical judgment. A careful clinical assessment should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis.</description>

    <measure>Mothers' Postnatal Sense of Security</measure>
    <time_frame>Postpartum 1th day and 7th day</time_frame>
    <description>Parents' Postnatal Sense of Security (PPSS) has been developed by Eva K. Persson et. al. (2007). The mother's version of the PPSS instrument consists of 18 items (possible score 18-72.The items are statements on four point Likert-scales to which the parents are asked if they agree or not, (1- strongly disagree and 4 -strongly agree). A higher score denotes a higher sense of security.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Postpartum 1th day and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is self-report questionnaire consists of two subscales each containing 40 items, 20 items allocated to each of the S-Anxiety and T-Anxiety subscales. It has 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: &quot;I am tense; I am worried&quot; and &quot;I feel calm; I feel secure.&quot; Trait anxiety items include: &quot;I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter&quot; and &quot;I am content; I am a steady person.&quot; All items are rated on a 4-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. The scores obtained from the scale range theoretically from 20 to 80. Bigger score indicates high anxiety level; small score indicates low anxiety level.</description>
