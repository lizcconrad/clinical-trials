  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a need to investigate the effectiveness of IVT aflibercept injection in routine
      clinical practice.

      The aim of this study is to collect 12-month real-world clinical data from treatment-naïve
      nAMD patients who started first-line treatment with IVT aflibercept injection, according to
      the SmPC (Summary of Product Characteristics) and the SERV (Spanish Society of Retina and
      Vitreous) guidelines. The effectiveness of IVT aflibercept will be assessed by the changes in
      VA (Visual Acuity) and CRT (Central Retinal Thickness) during treatment.

        maintained anti-VEGF treatment with IVT aflibercept injection in 8 Spanish centers which
        treat AMD patients routinely.
