  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for eligible participants who do not qualify for
      participation in, or who are otherwise unable to access, the ongoing clinical trial ABC-108.
      This program is designed to provide access to ABC294640 (Yeliva ®) for treatment of
      cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) prior to approval by the local regulatory agency. Availability will
      depend on territory eligibility. Participating sites will be added as they apply for and are
      approved for the EAP. An oncologist must decide whether the potential benefit outweighs the
      risk of receiving an investigational therapy based on the individual patient's medical
      history and program eligibility criteria.
