  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SafERteens Study demonstrated the efficacy of a brief intervention (BI) for violence on
      changing attitudes, self-efficacy, and reducing violent behaviors, peer victimization, and
      violence-related consequences among adolescents in the emergency department (ED). Using a
      RE-AIM framework to measure outcomes (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
      Maintenance), a study was conducted to translate this BI for violence into clinical practice
      in the ED. A SafERteens Implementation Package was created, which is housed on a website
      (www.saferteens.org), and includes: 1) a self-administered screen via iPad; 2) training
      materials (e.g., standardized patient videos); 3) clinician tools to guide intervention
      delivery; and 4) a tailored text message booster program.

      To increase reach and impact on reducing youth violence, this project will implement
      SafERteens into primary care. Primary care represents a logical dissemination channel for the
      SafERteens intervention because 95% of adolescents report having a usual place for primary
      health care, with 75% receiving medical care in the past six months. Violence interventions
      have yet to be systematically implemented in primary care settings despite the alarming
      prevalence of violent behaviors among adolescents.

      This pilot study will customize the SafERteens intervention for the unique constraints of
      primary care settings and test implementation of the SafERteens brief intervention in primary
      care using the RE-AIM framework: reach (e.g., number of patients screened and given BI);
      effectiveness (e.g., change in violent behaviors, peer victimization, and violence-related
      consequences among intervention and control groups); adoption (e.g., number of providers
      trained, hours participated in training); implementation (e.g., participant ratings of
      intervention); and maintenance (e.g., ongoing screening and interventions during maintenance
      phase). Specifically, a control sample of youth ages 14-18 (n=50) will be obtained, who will
      complete a baseline and 3-month follow-up survey, but who will not receive the intervention,
      and an intervention sample of youth ages 14-18 (n=50) will be obtained, who will receive the
      SafERteens BI and will complete a baseline and 3-month follow-up survey. These data will
      provide a control sample for testing effectiveness of the SafERteens intervention package,
      versus the intervention sample.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Violent Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in violent behavior is assessed using 10 validated items from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and Conflict Tactics Scale and assess the frequency of moderate (e.g., pushed or shoved) and severe (e.g., hit or punched, used a knife/gun) aggression towards peers. A composite score will be computed by summing the midpoint of responses to facilitate assessing change between baseline and follow-up.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Victimization by peers</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in victimization by peers is assessed using 2 validated items from the Conflict Tactics Scale which assess the frequency of moderate and severe peer victimization. A composite score will be computed by summing the midpoint of the items to facilitate measuring change between baseline and follow-up.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Violence Consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Change in violence consequences is assessed using a 7 item scale. This scale was developed for the original SafERteens study and inquires about possible consequences of fighting, like trouble at school and expressed concern about fighting by family members or friends. A composite score will be computed to facilitate measuring change between baseline and follow-up.</description>

    <description>A 30 minute private one-on-one brief motivational interviewing intervention administered by clinic staff. The goal of the intervention is to reduce and prevent youth violence using techniques to change behavior in a respectful, non-confrontational, and non-judgmental manner. This one-on-one counseling approach emphasizes individual choice and responsibility and differentiates between future goals/values and current behavior. In the 2 months following the intervention, participants will receive booster text messages tailored to their responses during the intervention.</description>
