      Migration is well known to be stressful and to have a negative impact on Health.
      Multidisciplinary health-promoting group interventions have significantly improved self-rated
      health. Further, symptom improvement was shown after implementation of physical activity in
      form of basic body awareness training. In this study a multimodal team consisted of a
      physiotherapist, nurse, psychologist, dietician, and physician held sessions of three hours
      weekly for a period of nine weeks. The sessions started with basic body awareness training,
      followed by theme discussions on symptoms and health strategies. A total of 54 participants
      completed the intervention. Health care consumption and movement quality were measured before
      and after the intervention.
