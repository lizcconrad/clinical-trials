  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether a medication called mirabegron is better than placebo (sugar
      pill) in helping patients with achalasia swallow better. Each patient will receive either
      mirabegron or the placebo for 4 weeks followed by the opposite medication. Each patient will
      complete several surveys and undergo several tests to determine if the mirabegron is helping
      reduce the pressures in the esophagus (swallowing tube).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achalasia is characterized by incomplete or absent relaxation of the lower esophageal
      sphincter (LES) and loss of esophageal peristalsis which leads to dysphagia. Standard of care
      for achalasia includes endoscopic management (dilation and injection of injection of
      botulinum toxin) and surgery, however both of these options carry procedural risks, may lose
      efficacy over time and many patients are not appropriate candidates for these treatment
      options. Unfortunately, there are limited oral medications for patients with achalasia.
      Mirabegron is an oral beta-3 agonist currently FDA approved for overactive bladder that works
      by relaxing the bladder muscles. Beta-3 receptors have also been identified in the LES with
      stimulation leading to LES relaxation in preclinical studies. Through a proof of concept
      pilot study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of mirabegron in patients with
      achalasia via high resolution manometry and a validated dysphagia scale.

    <time_frame>Patients will complete the EAS on study day -14, 0, 7, 28, 42, 49, 70, 84. We will evaluate changes in patient's EAS between day 0 and all of these time points.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete the Eckardt Achalasia score which is a simple written scale evaluating dysphagia, regurgitation, retrosternal pain and weight loss. Patients report their symptoms from a 0 to 3. Weight loss (0-none, 1: &lt; 5 kg, 2: 5-10 kg, 3: &gt; 10 kg), Dysphagia (0-none, 1-occasional, 2-daily, 3-each meal), Retrosternal pain (0-none, 1-occasional, 2-daily, 3-each meal), Regurgitation (0-none, 1-occasional, 2-daily, 3-each meal). The value for each of the 4 categories is added together to give the EAS. This EAS will be reported for each time point below. A higher score is consistent with worse achalasia and worse outcomes. A lower score is consistent with less severe achalasia and better outcomes. The total range is 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (severe symptoms). There are no subscales.</description>
