  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and chronic pain are common and serious health problems for
      military veterans and often co-occur, leading to poor post-deployment adjustment.
      Pharmacological treatments for pain elevate risk of opioid abuse, and research suggests
      veterans perceive barriers to existing non-pharmacological, clinic-based treatments. Thus,
      there is an urgent need to develop pain management approaches that are effective, overcome
      barriers to care, and are readily usable by Veterans. Evidence suggests that neuromodulatory
      treatments, grounded in understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms of pain, reduce
      pain-related symptoms and have the potential to be developed into self-directed treatments
      through use of mobile technology.

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, three-arm, randomized controlled trial of neuromodulatory
      treatments for chronic pain, for post-9/11 veterans with co-occuring pain and TBI. Three
      hundred participants will be scheduled for a baseline interview at the Duke Behavioral Health
      and Technology Lab after passing a preliminary telephone screen. After providing informed
      consent, participants will provide data on clinical measures. Electroencephalography (EEG)
      will be used to measure brain activity. Following data collection, participants will be
      assigned to one of three groups (n=100 in each). Each group will receive an iPod Touch with a
      different mobile application (app), which participants will be instructed to use for 10
      minute a day, 4 times a week for 12 weeks. Study coordinators will conduct two home visits
      (week 1 and week 6) and two phone calls (week 3 and week 9) to reinforce training,
      troubleshoot difficulties, and ask about intervention utilization. Follow-up data on clinical
      measures and EEG will be collected at 12 weeks and again at 24 weeks.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Served in one of the military branches (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, or Coast
             Guard) since October 2001.

          2. Diagnosis of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), defined as a traumatically induced
             structural injury or physiological disruption of brain function, as a result of an
             external force, that is indicated by new or onset or worsening of at least one of the
