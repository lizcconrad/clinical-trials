    <description>Discomfort levels were measured using Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no discomfort and 10 represents the worst discomfort; this scale has been confirmed to be sensitive and reliable. Discomfort was defined as &quot;sensation other than pain&quot; and included nausea, vomiting, headache, and dizziness. Clinically significant postoperative discomfort was considered serious discomfort (NRS score â‰¥5) any time postoperatively.</description>

    <description>Wrapping a piece of self-adherent wrap around the patient's head starting with the opened end on the forehead above the affected eye.The bandage is then firmly but not tightly wrapped around the head twice. Then, after the second circuit, the bandage is brought on the cheek and up over the eye to the forehead, where it was passed between the eyebrows but not wrapped around the head. Instead, the bandage is folded and then first passed back on the cheek of the affected side then back to the forehead a total of four times. Finally, the bandage is wrapped completely around the head once</description>

    <description>Wrapping a piece of self-adherent wrap around the patient's head starting with the opened end on the forehead above the affected eye.The bandage is then firmly but not tightly wrapped around the head twice. After the second circuit, the bandage was brought below the ear, up over the eye and around the head of the non-affected side and then wrapped around the head in the same manner four times. The bandage is then brought around the head once.</description>
