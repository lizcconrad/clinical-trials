    <textblock>
      This study aims to analyze the impact of using polysulfone membranes on continuous
      ultrafiltration with volume replacement in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In this type
      of surgery, techniques such as conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) and modified
      ultrafiltration (MUF) are known for controlling the patient's fluid balance during the
      procedure. However, there is no scientific evidence on the benefits of continuous
      haemofiltration with volume replacement and its effect on lactatemia. Method and design: A
      single center randomized controlled trial, parallel treatment design with patient-blinded to
      compare outcomes in terms of the lactate clearance rates (quantity/unit of time) of the
      assigned therapy groups. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the type of
      surgery, in order to ensure an unbiased assessment of treatments, randomisation will be
      performed in eight blocks of five patients. The study groups will be equivalent in all
      aspects except the procedures they undergo. Participants will be assigned to the first
      control group without haemofiltration (CG or 1) or one group with haemofiltration using a
      Polysulfone filter (PG or 2). Data will be collected by a blinded evaluator.

    <description>The purpose of the research is to determine whether, by controlling the patient's hemodilution level and, therefore, the acute anaemia caused by the Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) priming fluid, continuous conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) can decrease serum lactate levels during normothermic CPB by increasing the haematocrit and, consequently, the supply of oxygen to the tissues, and whether the haemofiltration membrane can remove lactate molecules in situations of hyperlactataemia in CPB.</description>
