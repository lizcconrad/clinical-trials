  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is frequently suspected in the Emergency Department (ED).
      However, usual diagnosis procedure based on clinical features and chest X-Ray has rather bad
      performances.

      A recent study on CT performance in suspected CAP found that 58% of classifications were
      modified by CT when compared with usual procedure. However, extended CT usage in CAP
      diagnosis is associated with many limitations :

      availability in a majority of ED, delay, cost and irradiation, in particular In young
      patients.

      Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has good performances in CAP diagnosis even when compared with CT. It
      is a rapid, inexpensive, radiation-free tool available in a majority of ED. It is performed
      at the patient's bedside with immediate results. The learning curve allows Emergency
      Physicians (EP) to perform this exam after a relative brief training.

      The Investigators aim to investigate LUS performances in clinically suspected CAP
      authentication , and assesses specific diagnostic contributions and impact on antibiotic
      prescriptions .

      120 patients will be enrolled on CAP suspicion. All explorations (radiography…) and
      biological exams (blood culture…) will be performed as usual to build physician primary
      diagnosis. Complementarily, an EP will be realized and final diagnosis will be made by
      physician. Finally, at Day28 expert adjudication committee will authentic diagnosis
      considering explorations and clinical issues. Frequency of discordant diagnosis between 1st
      and 2nd assessment and against expert will be measured Primary Purpose: diagnostic Study
      Phase: Not Applicable Intervention Model: NA Number of Arms: 1 Masking: open label, Masked
