  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indwelling tunneled pleural catheters have been successfully used to palliate dyspnea
      associated with recurrent malignant pleural effusions with few complications and spontaneous
      pleurodesis occurring in 30-50% of patients when using vacuum assisted drainage systems.
      Notably, all data on palliation of dyspnea as well as on rates of spontaneous pleurodesis
      have been performed using indwelling tunneled pleural catheters with vacuum assisted drainage
      systems. No current data exists regarding the efficacy, complications or rate of spontaneous
      pleurodesis when using indwelling tunneled pleural catheters and non-vacuum assisted drainage
      systems. This study is designed to evaluate an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter with a
      non-vacuum assisted drainage system for the management of recurrent malignant pleural
      effusions.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Relief of dyspnea as measured using the Visual Analog Scale for Dyspnea (VAS-Dyspnea)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 2 weeks following catheter insertion</time_frame>
    <description>This will be determined based on the difference between the VAS-Dyspnea score on the day of catheter insertion prior to catheter insertion compared with the VAS-Dyspnea score on the 2 week follow up visit
The scale presents the question &quot;how much shortness of breath are you having right now?&quot; with a straight line. At one end it states &quot;no shortness of breath&quot; and the other end is &quot;shortness of breath as bad as can be&quot;. The participant will mark the line on how they feel
No shortness is breath is 0% score and shortness of breath as bad as can be is 100% score</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, at least 18 years of age, inclusive

          -  Subject has a symptomatic malignant pleural effusion requiring intervention. For an
             effusion to be defined as malignant, at least one of the following must be true

               -  There is cytological confirmation of pleural malignancy

               -  The effusion is an exudate (per Light's criteria) in the context of
                  histocytologically proven malignancy elsewhere, with no other clear cause for
                  fluid identified

          -  Subject is able to provide informed consent

          -  Subject is willing and able to meet study requirements, including follow up visits

          -  Subject has sufficient pleural fluid to allow safe insertion of an indwelling tunneled
             pleural catheter as determined by the PI

          -  Subject is able to perform home drainage of the pleural effusion or has sufficient
             resources (family member, caregiver, home health).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who refuse to participate

          -  Are unable to provide informed consent

          -  Subject has evidence, in the opinion of the PI, of either ongoing systemic or pleural
             infection

          -  Subjects with uncorrected coagulopathy

          -  All patients whom do not have malignant pleural effusions as outlined in the
             &quot;definitions&quot; section
