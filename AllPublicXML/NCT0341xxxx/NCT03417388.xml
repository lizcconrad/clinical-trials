      The Ischemia-IMT (Ischemia-Intensive Medical Treatment Reduces Events in Women with
      Non-Obstructive CAD), subtitle: Women's Ischemia Trial to Reduce Events in Non-Obstructive
      CAD (WARRIOR) trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, blinded outcome evaluation
      (PROBE design) evaluating intensive statin/ACE-I (or ARB)/aspirin treatment (IMT) vs. usual
      care (UC) in 4,422 symptomatic women patients with symptoms and/or signs of ischemia but no
      obstructive CAD. The hypothesis is that IMT will reduce major adverse coronary events (MACE)
      20% vs. UC. The primary outcome is first occurrence of MACE as death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal
      stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) or hospitalization for heart failure or angina.
      Secondary outcomes include quality of life, time to &quot;return to duty&quot;/work, health resource
      consumption, angina, cardiovascular (CV) death and primary outcome components. Events will be
      adjudicated by an experienced Clinical Events Committee (CEC). Follow-up will be 3-years
      using 50 sites: primarily VA and Active Duty Military Hospitals/Clinics and a National
      Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) clinical data research network
      (CDRN)(OneFlorida Consortium).

      This study is being conducted to determine whether intensive medication treatment to modify
      risk factors and vascular function in women patients with coronary arteries showing no flow
      limit obstruction but with cardiac symptoms (i.e., chest pain, shortness of breath) will
      reduce the patient's likelihood of dying, having a heart attack, stroke/TIA or being
      hospitalized for cardiac reasons. The results will provide evidence data necessary to inform
      future guidelines regarding how best to treat this growing population of patients, and
      ultimately improve the patient's cardiac health and quality of life and reduce health-care
      costs.

      WARRIOR trial is a multi-site, PROBE design, that will evaluate an intensive statin/ACE-I (or
      ARB)/aspirin treatment strategy (IMT) vs. primary prevention risk factor therapy treatment
      strategy (UC) in 4,422 symptomatic (chronic angina or equivalent) women with non-obstructive
      CAD (&lt;50% diameter narrowing).

      There will be ~50 US sites, including VA/ military and OneFlorida CDRN sites, with a proven
      record in prior trials. The investigators will use web-based, real-time data entry, and
      management University of Florida Data Management System (UFDMS) for site selection,
      screening, participant eligibility confirmation, enrollment, and randomization. Participants
      will be recruited from screened women with symptoms suspected to be ischemic with
      non-obstructive CAD by invasive coronary angiogram or CT angiogram. The high dose statin
      (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) and ACE-I (lisinopril) [or ARB (losartan)] are generic
      commonly used medications previously demonstrated effective for improving angina, stress
      testing, myocardial perfusion and coronary microvascular flow reserve in small size trials in
      this population. Additionally, if IMT-assigned participants are statin intolerant or if
      LDL&lt;100 is not achieved, a PCSK9 Inhibitor will be made available. Aspirin will also be
      recommended to IMT participants without contraindications or excess bleeding risk, however
      aspirin will not be provided by the study. Both the groups will also receive Lifestyle
      Counseling (PACE Assessment), and the same visit schedule and &quot;face-time&quot; with site staff to
      reduce bias. Events will be adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC), according to
      objective criteria and masked to treatment assignment clues.

    <description>Collection of all deaths reported between the two groups will use the log rank test for comparison of outcomes. Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards).</description>

Although the power analysis required the exponential assumption, the actual statistical test is free of assumptions, as the null hypothesis is that the survival distributions for the two strategies are the same, and therefore the null hazard ratio is 1.00 (proportional hazards). MI definition follows universal criteria for Types 1-5 MI events. Specifically, the use of the &quot;Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction&quot; detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values, with at least one value &gt;99th percentile upper reference limit and preferred biomarker is Cardiac troponin (cTn).</description>

The stroke definition is new onset neurological defect of central origin confirmed by brain imaging (CT or MRI) evidence of cerebral infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage. The definition of TIA is the same as stroke except no confirmation by brain imaging, but confirmed by a neurologist consult.</description>
