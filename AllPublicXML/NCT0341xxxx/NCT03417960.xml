  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the feasibility and tolerability of 6x/day intermittent theta
      burst (excitatory) transcranial magnetic stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex over the course of 3 days for women with post-partum depression. The investigators
      further hope to characterize the anticipated anti-depressant effect of this treatment
      paradigm.

      This is an open-label study designed to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of a
      novel TMS treatment protocol to treat depression in women with post-partum depression. It is
      known that TMS can effectively treat depression. The FDA approved protocol lasts 6 weeks and
      is not feasible for many women with post-partum depression. The investigators are
      investigating a 3 day treatment for depression which may be more acceptable for this
      population. The investigators further hope to characterize the ant-depressant effect of this
      protocol in order to design a larger trial.

    <description>Determine the preliminary anti-depressant effect size of a course of accelerated iTBS for women with postpartum depression. He hope to find at least 30% of post-partum depressed subjects receiving accelerated iTBS will achieve a response (50% reduction in symptoms as measured on Ham-D) at 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The investigators will treat post-partum depressed subjects with accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation. iTBS will be delivered via a MagVenture MagPro100 and Cool-B65 coil. The investigators will use a standard resting motor threshold (rMT) determination to determine the TMS dose. Treatment will be delivered at 120% of the motor threshold. The accelerated paradigm will consist of 6 such sessions separated by 30 minutes. Treatments will be delivered at the 10-20 EEG coordinate for F3 (approximating the left DLPFC), and will be found using the Beam-F3 method.</description>
