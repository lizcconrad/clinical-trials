  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gastric barrier plays a major role in the maintanance of the distal intestinal microbiome
      composition. It has been shown before that the use of gastric acid suppression medication,
      such as proton pump inhibitors, are associated with distinctive alterations of the intestinal
      microbiome. Foremost, the invasion of predominantly oral bacteria, like Veillonella and
      Streptococcus species, were a resurring finding in previous reports.

      Gastric cancer treatment includes the total or subtotal resection of the stomach which can
      influence the gastric acid production. However, the influence by alterations in gastric
      milieu after this treatment on the composition of the intestinal microbiome is not well
      studied.

      Therefore, the intestinal microbiome of patients after total or subtotal gastrectomy and its
      influence on intestinal inflammation and gut permeability will be studied.
