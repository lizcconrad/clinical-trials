  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to further establish that SQUID, an alternative liquid embolic
      agent with specific properties, is a safe and effective alternative in bAVM endovascular
      treatment strategy available to date. Therefore, the performance of SQUID will be documented
      and its safety of use will be confirmed in current practice.

    <description>mRS is a scale used to measure the degree of handicap or dependence in daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological handicap.
The scale ranges from 0 to 6, running from perfect health, without symptoms, to death.
0 - No symptoms
- No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
- Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
- Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
- Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
- Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
- Death.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient planned for one or multiple embolization sessions using SQUID to achieve
             occlusion of a previously untreated bAVM.*

             *Patients with a direct fistula or saccular/flow-related aneurysm previously treated
             with NBCA and/or coils may be included.

          -  Patient in whom the use of SQUID had been decided for an embolization alone or in
             association to neurosurgery or radiotherapy.

          -  Patient ≥18 years old.

          -  Patient or authorized representative dully informed and having no objection to the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with bAVM not eligible for endovascular treatment.

          -  Patient with bAVM previously treated by embolization with other devices (Liquid
             embolic agent, NBCA, particles, and coils).*

             *Patients with a direct fistula or saccular / flow-related aneurysm previously treated
             with NBCA and/or coils may be included.

          -  Patient with bAVM previously treated with surgery or radiotherapy.

          -  Patient with multiple bAVM or bAVM associated with dural arteriovenous Fistula*.

             *Patients with a direct fistula or saccular / flow-related aneurysm previously treated
             with NBCA and/or coils may be included.

          -  Patient presenting contra-indication to the use of SQUID according to the Instructions
             For Use.

          -  Intention to treat with any non-adhesive embolic liquid other than SQUID, or planned
             treatment with another non-adhesive embolic liquid over the course of the endovascular
             treatment phase.

          -  Patient planned for a total endovascular treatment phase duration exceeding 2 years.

          -  Patient participating in another clinical study evaluating another medical device,
             another procedure or a medication.

          -  Any condition or any situation that would prohibit the patient from coming to the
             investigational center for the follow-up as recommended by the study protocol between
             3 and 6 months, or prohibit carrying out the telephone mRS assessments at 1 month
             after each embolization session and at 12 months after the end of the endovascular
             treatment phase.
