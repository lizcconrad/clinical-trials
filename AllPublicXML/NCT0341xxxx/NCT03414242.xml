  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to provide an onsite diagnosis with subsequent return to play
      criteria, as well as, lower the risk of traumatic brain injury by primary prevention through
      cervical spine neuromuscular control and vision training. The central hypothesis is that
      improved understanding of neurocognitive measures and function will provide improved
      diagnosis of concussion and help reduce the incidence of subsequent sports-related injury.
