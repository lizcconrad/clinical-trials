  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical readiness of military personnel is a corner stone of each army, as soldiers are
      expected to meet high physical demands on a daily basis and soldiers have mandatory one hour
      of physical conditioning each day. Participation in physical conditioning rises the risk for
      musculoskeletal injuries, and our 10-year retrospective analysis shows that each year 5% of
      soldiers sustain a sports injury during physical conditioning and that ankle and knee
      injuries have highest incidence rate of 25% and 20%, respectively. The primary aim of our
      study is to lower the rate of ankle and knee injuries through implementation of preventive
      exercise program. The study is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial with two
      arms (experimental and control).

      Members of Slovenian Armed Forces - SAF (age range 18-51 years) are expected to participate
      in the study. Prior to recruitment the whole project will be explained to soldiers in a form
      of briefing during which they have the opportunity to ask and have answers to any questions
      concerning the nature of subsequent research. Following that explanation each participant
      will sign a consent form to voluntarily participate. No compensation will be given or
      promised for participation in a study that was approved by the Ethical board of the Faculty
      of Sport in Ljubljana (No. 454/2017). At the time of testing all soldiers must be free of
      acute injuries and should not reported any pain in musculo-skeletal system. Prior to the
      implementation of the preventive program all participants will underwent the set of
      functional testing that includes counterMovement jump (CMJ) testing, stork balANce test,
      pUll-ups, single leg hAmstrings bridge test, and loaded prone pLank test - MANUAL. Following
      initial testing a 15-week preventive training program will be implemented in experimental
      group, while control group will be training as usual. Following the intervention final
      testing will be performed to check for effectiveness of the intervention. After that a
      follow-up period will start during which injuries will be registered in both groups and later
      compared between groups (control and experimental) and within (2016-2017 injuries) groups to
      see if incidence rate of ankle and knee injuries has fallen.

    <description>15 weeks of structured exercise intervention in the form of functional training. We have divided 15 weeks into 5 cycles each cycle lasting 3 weeks. Intervention will be administered twice per week, and each session will last 45 minutes.Each 45 minutes will be further divided into 10 minutes of functional warm-up, 30 minutes of neuromuscular training (strength, agility, balance, coordination) and 5 minutes of cool down. During the 3 week period the intensity of exercise will be increased with different form of same exercise, different number of repetitions and exercise duration.</description>
