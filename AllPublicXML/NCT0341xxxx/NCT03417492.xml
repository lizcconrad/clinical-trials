  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will measure cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) using functional near-infrared
      spectroscopy (fNIRS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the chronic phase after
      repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) as a biomarker of traumatic cerebrovascular
      injury (TCVI). We hypothesize that CVR will be decreased in patients with rmTBI and that
      these decreases will correlate with clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we predict that 5 week
      administration of a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, sildenafil citrate, will augment
      CVR in patients with a history rmTBI.
