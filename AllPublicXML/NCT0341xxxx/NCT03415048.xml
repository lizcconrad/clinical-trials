    <textblock>
      For children and adolescents who have had a concussion resulting in prolonged symptoms (&gt;3
      months), the investigators will:

        1. Measure post-concussion symptoms, cognitive and emotional function during the 3 years
           post-injury.

        2. Determine length of recovery and frequency of return to prior level of sports
           participation.

        3. Determine the incidence of and risk factors for subsequent concussion during the 3 years
           post-injury.
