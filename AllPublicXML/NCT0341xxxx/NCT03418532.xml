  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the anti-tumor efficacy, safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity and biological activity of the MP0250 DARPin® drug
      candidate in combination with osimertinib orally once daily (o.d.), when administered to
      patients with EGFR mutated, advanced, non squamous NSCLC after tumor progression on
      osimertinib and on or after the most recent therapy.

      MP0250 is a multi-DARPin® protein with three specificities, able to simultaneously neutralize
      the activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor
      (HGF) and also to bind to human serum albumin (HSA) to give an increased plasma half-life and
      potentially enhanced tumor penetration.
