  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2, open-label, 2-cohort, multicenter study evaluating adoptive cell
      therapy (ACT) with autologous TIL therapy (LN-145) alone, (Cohort 1), or in combination with
      durvalumab (anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 [PD-L1] monoclonal antibody [mAb]) (Cohort
      2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LN-145 is an adoptive cell transfer therapy that utilizes an autologous TIL manufacturing
      process, as originally developed by the NCI. The cell transfer therapy used in this study
      involves patients receiving a nonmyeloablative (NMA) lymphocyte depleting preparative
      regimen, followed by infusion of autologous TIL followed by the administration of up to 6
      doses of IL-2. Patients in Cohort 2 will also receive durvalumab Q4Weeks until progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
