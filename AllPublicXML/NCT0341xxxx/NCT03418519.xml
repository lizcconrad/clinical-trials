  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates CIMT(Constraint Induced Movement Therapy) in the treatment of physical
      activity performance and motor function of the weaker extremity in young children with
      cerebral palsy. Half of participants will receive CIMT while the other half will receive no
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is a short-term, intensive treatment to promote
      functional arm and hand skills in people with hemiparesis. It usually involves constraint of
      the non-involved extremity and intensive movement practice of the weaker extremity.

    <measure>Actigraph(physical activity performance)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days</time_frame>
    <description>For the upper limb use assessment, participants wear two accelerometers (one on each wrist). To quantify the affected upper limb movement relative to the unaffected upper limb before and after the CIMT program, two other variables are computed: use ratio and magnitude ratio. The use ratio is the ratio of the active duration for the affected arm to that for the unaffected arm. The magnitude ratio quantifies the contribution of the affected upper limb to activity.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Motor Activity Log(PMAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Motor Activity Log (PMAL) is a parent-report measure of the use, by children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, of their affected upper limb in everyday activities. Each item is scored 0-5(0= Never used affected arm , 5= Used affected arm on almost every occasion)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory(PEDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The PEDI is a parental-report, or structured-interview, instrument used by pediatric physical therapists and other rehabilitation professionals to assess functional abilities of young children children</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2(PDMS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The PDMS-2 consists of six subtests: Reflexes (for children from birth through 11 months), Stationary (ability to sustain control of body within its center of gravity), Locomotion (ability to move from one place to another), Object Manipulation (ability to manipulate balls for children 12 months and older), Grasping (ability to use hands), and Visual-Motor Integration (ability to use visual perpetual skills to perform complex eye-hand coordination tasks).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross motor function measure(GMFM)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The 88 items of the GMFM are measured by observation of the child and scored on a 4-point ordinal scale (0=does not initiate, 1=initiates &lt;10% of activity, 2=partially completes 10% to &lt;100% of activity, 3=completes activity). The items are weighted equally and grouped into 5 dimensions: (1) lying and rolling (17 items), (2) sitting (20 items), (3) crawling and kneeling (14 items), (4) standing (13 items), and (5) walking, running, jumping (24 items).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of improvement and severity(CGI-I, CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI acomprises two companion one-item measures evaluating the following: (a) severity of psychopathology from 1 to 7 and (b) change from the initiation of treatment on a similar seven-point scale.</description>
