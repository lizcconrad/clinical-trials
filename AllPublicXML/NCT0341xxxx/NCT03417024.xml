  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The contribution of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) to the screening pathway for breast
      cancer is not fully understood. This prospective study aims to collect longitudinal data in
      women with dense breasts undergoing ABUS as a supplement to digital breast tomosynthesis
      (DBT). The data are intended for use in future research on the value and effectiveness of
      ABUS in routine clinical care.

      Data will be collected from eligible women who have been prescribed or have completed DBT and
      ABUS, screening within a 30-day window. Radiologist evaluations and, when performed, outcomes
      of biopsy and/or laboratory testing will be recorded. Subjects will be followed for breast
      cancer status and results of any diagnostic breast exams and/or treatment.
