  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the high burden of caring for a Veteran with dementia, the investigators propose
      to study the effect of a low-cost, rehabilitative intervention for family caregivers of
      Veterans with dementia. The investigators' novel approach will use mobile media technology
      that can reach caregivers in rural areas who do not have easy access to major VA medical
      centers. If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach
      to Veteran and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff,
      resource, and cost burdens.

      The proposed project studies the effects of an education and skill-building rehabilitation
      intervention, designed to be low-cost and clinically translatable through mobile media
      devices (i.e., tablets), on family caregivers of Veterans with dementia. Intervention effects
      will be examined longitudinally at baseline and 3 months post-intervention.

      Advanced statistical techniques will be used to determine the impact of the intervention on:
      quality of life in caregivers of Veterans with dementia (Aim 1), perceived stress and
      depressive symptoms in caregivers (Aim 2), and socialization and engagement in pleasant
      activities in caregivers (Aim 3).

      If this rehabilitative intervention proves successful, it may represent an approach to
      Veteran- and family-centered dementia care that can be used throughout VA with low staff,
      resource, and cost burdens.

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is the most widely used psychological instrument for measuring the perception of stress. It is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. Items were designed to tap how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents find their lives. The scale also includes a number of direct queries about current levels of experienced stress. We use a 14 item version of the PSS with a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 56. Lower values indicate lower perceived stress while higher values indicate higher perceived stress.</description>
