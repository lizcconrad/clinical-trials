  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      56 Parturients, aged 18-40 year, undergoing elective CS were randomly assigned to receive
      sequential intrathecal injection of fentanyl and hyperbaric bupivacaine at the same rate
      (normal sequential) NS or a rapid intrathecal injection of fentanyl followed by slow
      injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine (rapid sequential) RS. Time of first rescue analgesia,
      Dose of rescue analgesics, degree of postoperative pain, incidence of hypotension,
      hypotension duration, ephedrine dose, spinal anaesthesia related complications and failed
      block were recorded.

      56 ASA physical status I, II Parturients, aged 18-40 year, undergoing elective CS were
      randomly assigned to receive sequential intrathecal injection of fentanyl and hyperbaric
      bupivacaine at the same rate through a 5ml syringe each (NS (normal sequential), n 28) or a
      rapid intrathecal injection of fentanyl through an insuline syringe followed by slow
      injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 5ml syringe RS (rapid sequential), n 28). Onset
      of sensory block (T6 level), highest level of sensory block, time of first rescue analgesia,
      Dose of rescue analgesics, degree of postoperative pain by VAS 6H postoperative, Onset of
      motor block (Bromage scale0&gt;3), duration of motor block (return to Bromage 0), incidence of
      hypotension, hypotension duration, ephedrine dose, spinal anaesthesia related complications
      as nausea, vomiting, pruritis, shivering and failed block were recorded.
