    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the intervening effects of N1115 Probiotic Supplement
      (containing Junlebao Lp. N1115) on gut development in young children at the age of 6 month to
      3 years by the way of a randomised, double-blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial, and to explore the change of intestinal microbiota composition and healthy condition
      after intervention.

      N1115 Probiotic Supplement contains Lactobacillus paracasei N1115 [Junlebao Lp. N1115], a
      lactobacillus bacteria strain isolated from traditional homemade yogurt in North China. In
      recent studys feeding Junlebao Lp. N1115 to C57BL/6 mice, the data suggest that Lp. N1115
      enhances intestinal development in neonatal mice, and may confer benefits on the growth at
      early stage of life.

      This study is to investigate if a N1115 Probiotic Supplement product containing Lp. N1115
      will improve intestinal health in young children. This randomised, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial includes two treatment groups which respectively need to recruit 30
      volunteers born by cesarean section and aged from 6 months to 3 years. The study group
      receives N1115 Probiotic Supplement, while the control group receives placebo. The trial
      lasts for 8 weeks and include four time points of data collection. The stool consistency of
      children will be recorded everyday, the saliva and stool samples will be collected and
      analysed.

    <intervention_model_description>The model is a randomized, double-blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled intervention study to assess effect of N1115 Probiotic Supplement (containing Junlebao Lp. N1115) on gut development in young children. Up to 60 healthy children, between the ages of 6 months and 3 years who were born by caesarean section will be recruited into this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, one group is N1115 Probiotic Supplement intervention which contains Lp. N1115 and maltodextrin, the other group is placebo intervention which contains maltodextrin only.</intervention_model_description>
