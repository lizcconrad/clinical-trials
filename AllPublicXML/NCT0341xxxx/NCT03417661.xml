  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the antimicrobial properties of HEXI-PREP by Clinell compared to both a
      negative and a positive control product.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HEXI-PREP by Clinell is a sterile single sachet wipe containing chlorhexidine gluconate and
      isopropyl alcohol. Both active ingredients are well-established ingredients commonly used for
      their disinfectant properties.

      This trial is designed to assess the superiority of HEXI-PREP by Clinell Wipe against a
      negative control, and also to demonstrate the relative efficacy of HEXI-PREP by Clinell WIpe
      against a similar commercially available product.

          -  Exposure of the test sites to strong detergents, solvents or other irritants during
             the 14-day pre-test conditioning period or during the test period.

          -  Use of systemic or topical antibiotic medications, steroid medications or any other

          -  Known allergies to latex (rubber), alcohols, tape adhesives or to common antibacterial
             agents found in soaps, lotions or ointments, particularly chlorhexidine gluconate or
             chlorine.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant, become pregnant or are breastfeeding during the
