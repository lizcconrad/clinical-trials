  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to understand the utilization of cabozantinib in subjects with
      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following prior VEGF-targeted therapy in real life
      settings in terms of dose modifications due to adverse events (AEs) when used as a second
      line therapy or third and later line therapy. Other patterns of use of cabozantinib will also
      be described.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will follow the real-life management of patients in clinical practice. Visits will
      take place according to the study site's clinical practice. Cabozantinib is to be
      administered as directed by the investigator according to the study site's usual clinical
      practice and the Cabometyx™ Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).
