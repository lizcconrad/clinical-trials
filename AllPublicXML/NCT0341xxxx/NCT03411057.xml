  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the mental health and clinical benefits of Mindfulness Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have anxiety or depression. MBSR,
      an interactive form of meditation that includes gentle yoga, will be taught by a certified
      instructor over an eight-week period. Mental health surveys will be conducted within one
      month of the study start and end as well as mid-course. Clinical assessments will be
      conducted within one-month of the study start and end.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participation in the study entails completing a baseline and 1-month post MBSR follow up
      research appointment. A baseline research appointment must occur within 30 days (+/- 15 days)
      of the MBSR start. The 1 month follow up appointment must be completed within 30 days (+/- 15
      days) after the MBSR course end. At each research appointment, disease activity, patient
      reported outcome measures (PROMs), and blood will be collected for future analysis. Patients
      will also be asked to complete the PROMs through an online survey platform using email, at
      MBSR course start, week 4 of the MBSR course, and at MBSR course end. Participants in the
      MBSR arm will also be recommended to perform self-directed meditation for 20-40 minutes per
      day, on off-days, throughout the 8-week session, as is typical for the MBSR course.
      Compliance with home meditation will be recorded on a take-home &quot;practice&quot; sheet that will be
      collected each week during the MBSR course.

      If patients do not wish to participate in the MBSR course but are willing to participate in
      the study as a control, they may also be consented. Controls will be asked to attend a
      baseline and 3-month research appointment where disease activity, PROMs, and blood donation
      would be obtained. If a patient does not wish to participate in either arm of the MBSR study,
      they will continue with routine psychological care for their anxiety and depression.

      Blood samples will be collected at the baseline research appointment and the follow up
      research appointment, if the patient is willing. These samples will be drawn and banked for
      future analysis of inflammatory markers and cytokine expression.

      Participants will be sent a health care usage survey after 3 months (coinciding with research
      visit 2; 1 month post-MBSR research visit or 3-month follow up research visit if control).
      Health care usage will continue to be screened for up to 1 year post research visit #1 via
      the electronic medical record.

    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety Scale (8a). The PROMIS Anxiety Scale is measured as a t score with a t-score range from 41 (less anxious) to 80 (highly anxious). For most PROMIS instruments, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post course (approximately 8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI is calculated by the formula, CDAI = swollen joint count (28 sites) + tender joint count (28 sites) + patient global assessment (0-10; 10= severe) + evaluator global assessment (0-10; 10=severe). The total range is 0 to 76. Higher scores indicate more severe disease activity. Remission is considered less than 2.8, mild disease 2.8 to 10, moderate disease 10 to 22, and severe disease greater than 22.</description>
