    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to lead to a larger prospective, randomized, controlled study of older
      adult (ages 50 and older) spinal patients with thoracolumbar/lumbar scoliosis evaluating
      improvement with physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercise (PSSE) compared to traditional
      low back physical therapy (PT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult scoliosis with chronic back pain is a very complex condition. Chronic back pain remains
      one of our country's most costly conditions to manage and treat. Many of these patients have
      difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), household and community ambulation, and
      maintaining their professional career. The intervention options for this population remain
      limited, with surgery being the only one that has shown improvements in health related
      quality of life and an overall decrease in the complaints of pain. However, the costs of
      surgery and additional complications are limitations to this treatment option.There has been
      increased attention and interest in the medical community looking at the effects of
      Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSE) on curve progression, improvements in
      health related quality of life, and pain. The investigators hypothesize that PSSE can
      directly affect radiological parameters, such as the sagittal vertical axis (SVA), as well as
      showing improvements in health related quality of life using subjective patient specific
      outcome measures.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score for Back Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a psychometric response scale which measures subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Scoliosis Research Society 22-item (SRS-22r)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measure designed by the Scoliosis Research Society that is specially designed for patients with scoliosis and evaluates their scores for self-image, pain, mental health, and function. It contained 22 items contributing to five main domains: Function (5 items), Pain (5 items), Self-image/appearance (5 items), Mental Health (5 items), Satisfaction with Treatment (Current/Previously performed—2 items). Scores range from 5 (best) to 1 (worst).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Score on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a self-completed questionnaire containing 10 topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel. Each topic category is followed by 6 statements describing different potential scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.</description>
