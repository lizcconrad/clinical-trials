  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an all-encompassing frailty model using laboratory
      and functional studies. A frailty model will help us determine prior to surgery who will
      require rehabilitation and skilled nursing needs beyond discharge. This model will also help
      us determine who will likely be readmitted and why they will be readmitted. Understanding
      these things can help us prevent some of them from occurring in the future.
