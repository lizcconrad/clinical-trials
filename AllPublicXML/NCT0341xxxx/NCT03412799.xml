  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase 1A/1B study to assess the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of SBP-101 when combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in subjects
      with previously untreated metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and to identify a
      recommended phase 2 dose. The study will also assess preliminary efficacy of the 3-drug
      treatment combination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two phases: dose escalation and expansion. Up to three dose
      levels of SBP-101 will be assessed in up to 18 subjects during dose escalation. The expansion
      phase of the study will consist of 10 additional subjects who will receive the recommended
      dose of SBP-101 combined with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.
