  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of an intervention to promote smoking cessation among light smokers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The three-arm randomized controlled trial compares Arm 1) standard smoking cessation plus
      support text messages, 2) enhanced cue exposure treatment (lab-based + interactive SMS
      texting) + D-cycloserine placebo, Arm 3)will include a combination of cognitive behavioral
      cessation counseling, enhanced cue exposure treatment (lab-based + interactive SMS texting)
      and a cognitive-enhancing drug - D-cycloserine. In addition to an in-person screening visit,
      we will conduct three in-person treatment visits and an in-person follow-up visit.
