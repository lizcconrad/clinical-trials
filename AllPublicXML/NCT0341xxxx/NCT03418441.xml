    <textblock>
      The Danish Study Group of Infections of the Brain is a collaboration between all departments
      of infectious diseases in Denmark. The investigators aim to monitor epidemiological trends in
      central nervous system (CNS) infections by a prospective registration of clinical
      characteristics and outcome of all adult (&gt;17 years of age) patients with community-acquired
      CNS infections diagnosed and/or treated at departments of infectious diseases in Denmark
      since 1st of January 2015.

      The investigators include data on diagnosis at admission, symptoms and signs on admission,
      character and timing of diagnostic work-up and treatment and outcome assessed by the Glasgow
      Outcome Score (GOS).

      Diagnostic work-up and treatment is left at the discretion of the local physician and
      therefore not standardised

      In general any symptoms/deficits should only be listed if they are 'new' to the patient, e.g.
      a known palsy of the facial nerve should not be listed as a new relevant finding at
      admission. On the other hand, worsening of a known neurological deficit should be listed
      under signs in the given instrument (bacterial meningitis, encephalitis, neuroborreliosis
      etc). Likewise, for outcome only changes in pre-morbid conditions should be listed including
      place of residence, functional status, neurological deficits etc.

      Time of admission is obtained in prioritized order from the ambulance charts or notifications
      of arrival by secretaries or nurses in the emergency departments. Timing of lumbar puncture
      and cranial imaging is extracted from the electronic records at the departments of
      biochemistry or radiology while timing of antibiotic therapy for meningitis is identified in
      electronic medication systems. Time to lumbar puncture, cranial imaging and antibiotic
      therapy is calculated as time from arrival at hospital to each of the above events.

      Quality control of case enrollment is ensured by ad hoc case-to-case discussions and at study
      group meetings 2-3 times a year

      To ensure completeness of reported CNS infections annual searches of selected International
      Classification of Diseases version 10 (ICD-10) codes are performed in local administrative
      databases at each department:

      A17 A32.1 A32.7 A39.0 A52.1-52.3 A69.2 (neuroborreliosis) A83 A84 A85 A87 A89 B00.3-00.4

        All patients above 17 years of age are prospectively included in the DASGIB cohort by the
        principal investigator at each site if they have a clinical presentation suggestive of CNS
        infection (e.g. any combination of neck stiffness, fever, headache or altered mental
        status) and either (i) Positive CSF culture or positive bacterial/viral DNA-based analysis
        for (community-acquired) pathogens in the CSF or (ii) a positive blood culture and CSF
        leukocytes &gt;10/mL or (iii) CSF leukocytes &gt; 10/mL without any alternative diagnoses more
        likely to explain the patients' conditions. Exceptions apply for brain abscess,
        neurosyphilis and neuroborreliosis and exact definitions of included CNS infections are
        provided below.

        We exclude patients with hospital-acquired CNS infections as defined by the Centers for
        Disease Control and Prevention (Garner et al, Am J Infect Control, 1988), or an implanted
        neurosurgical device.

        Definitions of central nervous system infections:

        For all cases with unproven aetiologies no alternative diagnosis than CNS infection is
        thought more likely after completed multidisciplinary diagnostic work-up.

        Viral meningitis inclusion criteria

        - All patients have to have a clinical presentation consistent with non-bacterial
        meningitis (e.g. headache, neck stiffness, photo- or phonophobia, fever)

        and

        Cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes&gt;10 cells/ml

        Patients with viral meningitis with undetermined pathogen have to have:

          -  CSF leukocytes&gt; 10/mL and no other more probable diagnosis assessed by the local
             investigator.

        In case of doubt, patients are discussed with the DASGIB secretary and chair or at
        meetings.

        Bacterial meningitis inclusion criteria - All patients have to have a clinical presentation
        consistent with bacterial meningitis (e.g. headache, neck stiffness, fever, altered mental
        status)

        and

        Proven bacterial aetiology (CSF or blood culture/DNA based technology or antigen tests)

        Patients with bacterial meningitis in whom the bacteria cannot not be cultured or
        identified by DNA-based technologies have to have:

        - CSF leukocytes&gt; 10/mL and no other more probable diagnosis assessed by the local
        investigator.

        In case of doubt, patients are discussed with the DASGIB secretary and chair or at
        meetings.

        Encephalitis inclusion criteria - All patients have to have a clinical presentation
        consistent with encephalitis (e.g. headache, fever, focal neurological deficit, altered
        mental status &gt;24 hours) as defined by the International Encephalitis Consortium
        (Venkatesan A et al., Clin Infect Dis 2013; doi:10.1093/cid/cit458.).

        Encephalitis exclusion criteria

        - We exclude cases of proven or suspected autoimmune encephalitis.

        Primary brain abscess inclusion criteria

        - All patient have a clinical presentation consistent with brain abscess (e.g. headache,
        focal neurological deficit, mass lesion on cranial imaging)

        and

        - Proven microbiological aetiology by culture/DNA-based technology from pus from brain
        abscess or blood or CSF

        or

        - Aspiration of pus from the brain abscess

        or

        - Response to antimicrobial treatment

        or

        - Tumour ruled out

        or

        and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences.

        Lyme neuroborreliosis inclusion criteria

        - A clinical presentation consistent with neuroborreliosis (e.g. radiculopathy)

        and

        - CSF pleocytosis&gt;10 leukocytes/mL

        and

        - Positive intrathecal B.burgdorferi antibody production index.

        Neurosyphilis inclusion criteria - A clinical presentation consistent with neurosyphilis
        (e.g. 'encephalitis-like symptoms', dementia, ocular or otogenic syphilis)

        and either

        - Positive syphilis serology in serum combined with CSF leukocytes&gt;10/mL

        or

        - CSF syphilis antibodies.
