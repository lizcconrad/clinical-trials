    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of dosing iodinated contrast media
      according to a patient's total body weight vs. lean body weight. Participants will be
      randomized into 2 groups based on contrast dosing technique, and solid organ enhancement at
      uniphasic abdominal CT will be measured.

    <measure>Mean hepatic enhancement (MHE): difference in liver attenuation on computed tomography images acquired before and after administration of contrast (in portal venous phase), as measured in Hounsfield units (HU)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Images of the liver will be obtained before and after administration of iodinated contrast media. Regions of interest will be drawn on these pre- and post- contrast computed tomography (CT) images of the liver. The average attenuation before and after contrast administration will be calculated. The mean hepatic enhancement (MHE) will be calculated as the average attenuation post-contrast minus the average attenuation pre-contrast. This will provide a measure of liver enhancement.</description>

    <measure>Standard deviation in mean hepatic enhancement (sigma MHE): standard deviation in the difference in liver attenuation on CT acquired before and after administration of contrast (in portal venous phase), as measured in Hounsfield units (HU)</measure>

The mean hepatic enhancement (MHE) will be calculated as the average attenuation post-contrast minus the average attenuation pre-contrast.
