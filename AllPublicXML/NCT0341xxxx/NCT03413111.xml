  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective cannulation is considered the most challenging step for most of Endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Wire-guided cannulation is the standard technique
      for initial cannulation. When meeting difficulty, double wire technique (DWT) is widely used.
      With one guidewire occupying pancreatic duct (PD), the following cannulation of common bile
      duct (CBD) with a sphincterotome preloaded with another guidewire often becomes feasible.
      However, because of the small opening of the papilla, sometimes it is technically challenging
      for the following cannulation of CBD with the sphincterotome and PD guidewire in the same
      working channel. We hypothesized that a tiny cut of the opening of papilla, without the
      injury of pancreatic sphincter, may facilitate the success of DWT and shorten the overall
      cannulation time.

    <description>A sphincterotome was used for standard wire-guided cannulation. If the difficult biliary cannulation occurred and guidewire inadvertently entered PD, a tiny cut of opening, with the length of 5mm, was performed with the sphincterotome. Then the guidewire was left in PD and the sphincterotome withdrew. The same sphincterotome was re-inserted in the working channel alongside the first guidewire, another wire is used for wire-guided selective cannulation of CBD. If the cannulation of CBD was not successful within 5 attempts, other cannulation techniques (e.g. transpancreatic precut, needle knife (NK) precut or over-the stent precut) would be tried at the discretion of endoscopists. A 5Fr, unflanged PD stent was placed before the ending of ERCP.</description>
