    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose study to
      assess the safety and tolerability of ascending repeat doses of COR388 HCl in older healthy
      male and female subjects and a cohort of Alzheimer's disease subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 3 cohorts of 8 healthy subjects ≥55 and ≤80 years of age at the
      Clinical Pharmacology Unit (CPU) and 1 cohort of 12 AD subjects ≥55 and ≤80 years of age.
      Subjects in cohorts 1-3 will receive the study drug or placebo for 10 consecutive days while
      confined to the CPU. AD patients in cohort 4 will receive the study drug or placebo for 28
      days as outpatient. Blood samples samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic measurements.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects ≥55 years to ≤80 years of age, at the time of consent;

          -  Males of reproductive potential must agree to use double-barrier contraceptive
             measures or avoid intercourse from the first dose of study drug through 90 days after
             the last dose of study drug.

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must be non-lactating, have negative serum
             pregnancy test results at Screening and negative urine pregnancy test results at Day
             -1; agree to use double-barrier or hormonal contraceptive measures or avoid
             intercourse from Day -10 through 28 days after the last dose of study drug.

          -  Stable doses of medications used for stable chronic illnesses that are not prohibited
             by the protocol are allowed as long as the dose has been stable for 30 days prior to
             Screening, and no changes are expected during participation in the study;

          -  Body mass index ≥19 kg/m2 to ≤35 kg/m2 at Screening;

          -  Good general health as determined by medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             reports, and 12-lead ECG prior to enrollment;

          -  Non-smoker and non-tobacco user for a minimum of 6 months prior to the first admission
             and for the duration of the study;

          -  Must have moderate to severe periodontitis according to the CDC-AAP criteria as
             determined by the study dentist during the screening oral examination;

          -  If applicable, have a primary caregiver willing to accept responsibility for
             supervising the treatment (eg, administering study drug) and assessing the condition
             of the subject throughout the study in accordance with all protocol requirements.

          -  Provide, if mentally competent and willing, written informed consent. If the subject
             is not able to provide written informed consent, written informed consent must be
             obtained from a legally authorized representative on the subject's behalf, and verbal
             assent may be obtained from the subject. In addition, if the subject has a caregiver,
             the caregiver will be required to provide written informed consent prior to the
             subject's participation in the study.

             that required treatment with antibiotics for longer than 1 week;

          -  History or current evidence of psychiatric or emotional problems that would invalidate
             giving informed consent or limit the ability of the subject to comply with study
             requirements;

          -  History of systemic allergic reaction to any drug that is considered significant by

             unsuitable for enrollment, could interfere with the subject's participation in or
             completion of the study, or could interfere with interpretation of study results;

          -  Abnormal results of screening laboratory tests, ECG, or MRI of the brain deemed
             clinically significant by the Investigator;

          -  The use of any prohibited medication that cannot be stopped or replaced safely, based
             on the judgment of the Investigator; or

          -  Participation in another investigational new drug research study involving small
             molecule drugs within 30 days or biological drugs within 60 days prior to the first
             dose of study drug.
