  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to:

        1. assess how well individuals entering medication assisted treatment like the RETAIN
           e-health application as measured by their feedback on the intervention.

        2. test the impact of RETAIN on knowledge about medication-assisted treatment(MAT).

        3. assess treatment retention rates in patients completing the RETAIN intervention.

        4. test the impact of RETAIN on knowledge about HCV/HIV

        5. test the impact of RETAIN on interest in being tested for HCV/HIV

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pre-post study of RETAIN will: 1) assess the acceptability of RETAIN as measured by
      participant feedback about the intervention; 2) test the impact of RETAIN on knowledge about
      MAT, as measured by the MAT Knowledge Assessment; 3) assess MAT retention rates in patients
      completing the RETAIN intervention; 4) test the impact of RETAIN on knowledge about HCV/ HIV;
      5) test the impact of RETAIN on interest in being tested for HCV/HIV.

      The acceptability of RETAIN will be assessed with a feedback form which includes questions
      about how helpful the intervention was (scale of 1-4), what the patient liked most and least
      about the intervention, and any suggestions for improving it. The average (and standard
      deviation) for the rated helpfulness of the intervention will be derived and the qualitative
      data about what they liked most and least about the intervention and suggestions for
      improvement will be tabulated. Pre-/post-changes in the percent of correct knowledge
      assessment items (i.e., about MAT and HCV/HIV) and interest in HCV/HIV testing will be
      analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The 3- and 6-month retention rates for RETAIN
      participants will be compared, using Fisher's exact tests, to the overall treatment retention
      rates at 3- and 6- months for the UC Health MAT clinics as determined by the retrospective
      chart review.

    <intervention_name>self-administered, e-health application</intervention_name>
    <description>RETAIN is a self-administered, e-health application and includes short videos in which patients who are successfully engaged in MAT discuss what they wish they had known about MAT and its benefits when they started treatment. The intervention is designed to maximize &quot;scalability&quot; - the administration would entail handing an electronic device (e.g., tablet, laptop, etc.) to an individual who would then self-administer the intervention.</description>
