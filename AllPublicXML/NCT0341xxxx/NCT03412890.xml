      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term efficacy of Relugolix 40 mg once
      daily co-administered with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate for up to 52 weeks,
      on heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in patients who previously
      completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the parent studies (MVT-601-3001 or
      MVT-601-3002).

      This study is an international phase 3 open-label, single-arm, long-term efficacy and safety
      extension study that will enroll eligible patients who have completed their participation in
      one of the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies, MVT-601-3001
      (LIBERTY 1 - NCT03049735) or MVT-601-3002 (LIBERTY 2 - NCT 03103087). All patients will
      receive relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low-dose estradiol (1.0 mg) and
      norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg) for up to 28 weeks.

      Approximately 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will
      be enrolled, after having completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the parent studies.
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety through up to 52
      weeks of treatment (including treatment during the parent study) of relugolix co-administered
      with low-dose estradiol/norethindrone acetate.

      Screening and baseline procedures will be done at the same visit for this extension study
      (referred to as the &quot;Week 24/Baseline Visit&quot;), which coincides with the Week 24 visit from
      the parent study, and will be defined as the date of completion of the last Week 24 procedure
      in the parent study. Patients will have received their last dose of study drug in the parent
      study on the day prior to the Week 24/Baseline Visit and will receive their first dose of
      study drug for this extension study in the clinic after the patient is determined to be
      eligible for this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate. The
      administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT-601-3003 will define enrollment into
      this study. Study participants will then take the open-label study treatment orally once
      daily for 28 weeks.
