  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Three-dimensional (3D) printing has gained popularity in medicine over the last decade. Once
      3D printers have become more affordable, the true strength of this technique has been
      recognized because of its ability to obtain anatomical models based on the unique
      characteristics of each patient. Liver resections are challenging operations because of the
      complex nature of the liver and venous anatomy within the liver, so 3D imaging is a promising
      new tool for surgical planning.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Complex liver tumors (bilobar disease, infiltration of suprahepatic veins or requiring
             two-time resection or intrahepatic vascular reconstruction).

          -  Preoperatively was performed, a CT scan and / or MRI of all patients were performed to
             document the tumor distribution, estimate remaining liver volume, and identify
             tumor-vessel relationships in order to know the intraoperative vascular anatomy.

    <ipd_description>Good practice principles include: (i) the use of a controlled access approach, using a transparent and robust system to review requests and provide secure data access; (ii) seeking consent for sharing IPD from trial participants in all future clinical trials with adequate assurance that patient privacy and confidentiality can be maintained; and (iii) establishing an approach to resource the sharing of IPD which would include support from trial funders, sponsor organisations and users of IPD.</ipd_description>
