  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CIRCUS study is a randomised controlled, cross-over trial to evaluate the effects of
      increased intakes of citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables on vascular function in 20
      untreated, prehypertensive participants. The study comprises three 14-day dietary
      intervention periods, preceded by one week run-in period and separated by one week wash-out
      periods, 9 weeks in total. The diet will be fully controlled and provided by the researchers.
      Participants will receive in random order three interventions:

        -  1 portion of fruits plus 1 portion of vegetables, of commonly consumed types per day.
           Intakes are at 25th percentile of UK consumption and will exclude citrus fruits,
           cruciferous and allium vegetables.

        -  4 portions of fruits plus 4 portions of vegetables, of commonly consumed types per day
           excluding citrus fruits, cruciferous and allium vegetables.

        -  4 portions of citrus fruits plus 4 portions of cruciferous vegetables per day.
