  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is designed to test the effectiveness of a force-feedback cuff in combination with
      a myoelectric prosthesis in conveying information on grasp strength to the user, as well as
      the user's preference regarding the feature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human sensorimotor control system uses both feedforward planning and sensory feedback
      information, in order to actuate the musculoskeletal system and interact with the external
      environment, e.g. when modulating grip force for various object properties. As a result, lack
      of sensory input, as in the case of motor impairments or amputations, can dramatically affect
      activities of daily living (ADLs). The contribution of the proposed research will be to test
      the effectiveness of a novel, non-invasive prosthetic technology in delivering sensory
      information. The investigators' approach is &quot;modality matching,&quot; in that it produces a
      sensation in the user similar to the type of information to be transmitted. Specifically, the
      approach will combine the Soft Hand Pro (SHP), an anthropomorphic, myoelectrically controlled
      prosthetic hand, with an upper limb force feedback device (CUFF) to provide patients with
      transradial amputations with grasp force (pressure) information.
