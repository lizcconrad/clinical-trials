    <textblock>
      Hospital acquired chest Infections are common complications in hospitalized cirrhotic
      patients. Infectious complications are the most common cause of mortality in cirrhotic
      patients with bronchopneumonia early antibiotic treatment at the base of culture and
      sensitivity is an optimal therapeutic approach in cirrhotics with nosocomial pneumonia
      Intensive care unit acquired pneumonia is the leading infection in critically ill patients
      and a major cause of morbidity and mortality despite recent major advances in antimicrobial
      therapy, supportive care, and the use of a broad range of preventive measures

      Aim of the work

        1. To estimate the frequency and risk factors of nosocomial chest infections in cirrhotic
           patients .

        2. To determine the causative pathogens of nosocomial chest infections in patients with
           cirrhosis including fungal infections in order to establish our local empirical
           antimicrobial protocol.

        3. To define the impact of nosocomial chest infections on survival of our patients.

        4. To develop an effective and continuous surveillance program and infection control
           measures to reduce the burden of these infections as well as morbidity , mortality ,
           hospital stay ,hospital cost and to achieve quality of care .

        5. To motivate pharmaceutical companies to create a new umbrella coverage of antimicrobials
           through the ongoing knowledge of the changes in microbial resistance pattern inside
           hospitals
