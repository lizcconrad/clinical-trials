  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and classification of scoliosis are almost exclusively based on frontal and
      lateral radiographs. Current classifications of adolescent or adult idiopathic degenerative
      scoliosis are based only on the 2D approach. The classifications consider only the lateral
      deviation and the sagittal alignment and completely ignore all the changes (the axial
      vertebral rotation and the lateral translation etc ...) in the horizontal plane.

      The demand for an accurate assessment of the vertebral rotation in scoliosis is not new.
      Biplane x-ray images provide insufficient quantitative or qualitative information on the
      anatomical landmarks needed to determine axial rotation. Several measurement methods have
      been published, all of which are based on the evaluation of the relative positions of various
      posterior vertebral elements. The Perdriolle torsiometer is currently the most accepted
      method in clinical practice, but its reproducibility is very limited and can not be
      quantified accurately.The horizontal plane deviations are more accurately evaluated by the CT
      scan, but the systematic use of this method is limited because of its relatively high cost
      and excessive radiation dose. Expert opinion is also divided on the veracity and
      reproducibility of CT scan for such measurements.

      Given the absence of a definitive and reproducible measurement method for 3D characterization
      of the vertebral columnar deformities, the investigators introduced the concept and system of
      vertebral vectors.The vertebral vector technique is currently the only technique in the world
      that allows the visualization of vertebral column deformities by analyzing each vertebral
      body and defining characteristic mathematical and geometric parameters that uniquely
      characterize each vertebrae. A new digital radioimaging technique based on a low dose X-ray
      detection technology simultaneously creates frontal and lateral whole body radiographic
      images captured in a standing position, which is the basis of visualization of the vertebral
      vector.

      To examine the two phenotypes of scoliosis, it is necessary to collect the radiological data
      specific to the disease. After generating the vertebral vectors and obtaining the
      three-dimensional coordinates, an analysis and an exact mathematical description will be
      performed. The projections of the curves in the three planes will also be analyzed, with
      particular attention to the projections in the horizontal planes. Based on the mathematical
      models and the axial projection of the curves, a new three-dimensional classification can be
      imagined for the first time not only for adolescent scoliosis, but also for adult
      degenerative scoliosis.

      The main objective of this study is to develop new evidence-based treatments based on the
      unambiguous understanding of 3D features of vertebral columnar deformities.
