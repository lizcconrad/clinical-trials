  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer - including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) - is a disease of the elderly but
      little is known about the biology and progression of cancers in these patients.

      While most patients receive chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation as first treatment, no
      treatment standard for following treatments has been established so far and there is a clear
      unmet medical need, especially for elderly patients.

      Hence, this study assesses the efficacy and safety of two experimental immunotherapy regimens
      (Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab combination) in elderly patients with advanced
      esophageal squamous cell cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer - including esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) - is a disease of the elderly, more
      than 60% of all tumors arise in patients with the age of 65 years or older. In contrast,
      little is known about the biology and progression of cancers in these patients, since most
      clinical trials enroll patients with age limits of 70 or 75 years.

      While most patients undergo chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation in first-line, the role of
      second-line therapy is less well understood. No treatment standard has been established so
      far and there is a clear unmet medical need. This is particularly true for geriatric patients
      for whom palliative systemic therapies are especially challenging.

      Hence, the primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate a significant survival benefit
      of two experimental immunotherapy regimens (Nivolumab monotherapy or Nivolumab/Ipilimumab
      combination) in elderly patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer compared to
      historical data of standard chemotherapy regimens.

    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer - Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (30 items) Version 3.0. The QLQ-C30 is composed of multi-item scales and single-item measures, including five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.
All of the scales and single-item measures have a score range from 0 to 100. A high score shows a high response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

The single-item subscales include questions related to joint stiffness and Family support. Items are assessed on a 4-level numerical scale with 1= &quot;not at all&quot;, 2= &quot;a little&quot;, 3= &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4= &quot;very much&quot;. Scores are linearly converted and summated into a scaled score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a worse QOL or better QOL for purpose and family support.</description>
