      Subjects will assess their tolerance to the administration of the study drug, utilizing a
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The VAS is a 100-mm horizontal line with verbal descriptors at
      either end. The VAS ratings will be completed after administration of the study drug on Day 1
      (post-dose), Day 28, Day 56, Day 84, and Day 105. Subjects will place a single slash mark
      across the horizontal line between the end labeled &quot;completely intolerable&quot; (0 mm) and
      &quot;easily tolerable&quot; (100mm).
