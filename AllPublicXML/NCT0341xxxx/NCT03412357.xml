  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a cancer, caused by asbestos, which currently affects 2500
      people in the UK each year. The main symptom is breathlessness caused by fluid building up in
      the space between the lung and the chest wall (pleural effusion). Treatment involves draining
      the fluid to allow the lung to re-expand (pleurodesis). However, sometimes tumour growth over
      the surface of the lung can prevent it from re-expanding. This 'trapped' lung results in
      fluid re-accumulation and repeated drainage which can lead to discomfort and multiple
      hospital visits.

      One approach to dealing with 'trapped' lung in mesothelioma is to insert a thin tube
      (Indwelling Pleural Catheter - IPC) into the space around the lung. The tube can stay in
      place for a long time allowing patients to drain off fluid at home.

      Another approach is a keyhole surgical operation (video-assisted thoracoscopic partial
      pleurectomy/decortication - VAT-PD) to remove as much tumour as possible from the lining of
      the lung to allow it to re-expand.

      While both approaches are currently offered in clinical practice, it is not known which of
      the two is most effective at relieving breathlessness. The only way to find out is to conduct
      a research trial comparing the two. The Investigators plan to do this, but first of all need
      to carry out a small pilot study to collect information necessary to help plan the full
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled pilot clinical trial and
      feasibility study comparing video-assisted thoracoscopic partial pleurectomy/decortication
      (VAT-PD) with indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) in patients with trapped lung (TL) and
      pleural effusion due to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), aimed at addressing recruitment
      and randomisation uncertainties as well as sample size requirements for a full phase III
      study. 38 patients will be randomised and allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either VAT-PD or IPC.

      The study will be undertaken at mesothelioma surgical centres with expertise in either IPC,
      VAT-PD or both procedures, together with their linked non-surgical referral hospitals (hub
      and spoke). Patients meeting all eligibility criteria will be informed about the study,
      provided with a patient information sheet and given at least 24 hours to consider
      participation.

      Following consent, patients will be randomised, baseline measurements will be taken and a
      procedure date will be arranged. Following the procedure follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3, 6
      and 12 months post-randomisation are planned to coincide with clinical care visits.

    <description>VAT-PD is a type of &quot;keyhole surgery&quot; performed under general anaesthesia using a telescope and instruments put inside the chest. Through small incisions, or keyholes made between the ribs, the thoracic surgeon removes the hard rind of the tumour over the surface of the lung, thereby allowing the 'trapped' lung to fully expand again. Simultaneous removal of mesothelioma from the outer pleural membrane allows pleurodesis to occur.</description>
