    <textblock>
      Study objectives are to investigate the efficacy and safety of activated autologous dendritic
      cells (DCs) in treatment of gastric cancer. DCs are activated by the proteins from autologous
      tumor cell membrane and cytokines in vitro. The efficacy endpoints include objective
      response, immune-cell response, recurrent rate after a radical surgery, progression-free
      survival and overall survival, and the safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory
      tests, ECG, ECOG-PT, etc.

      Study objectives are to investigate the efficacy and safety of activated autologous dendritic
      cells (DCs) in treatment of gastric cancer. The autologous DCs are collected and enriched
      from peripheral blood, and then are activated by the proteins from autologous tumor cell
      membrane and cytokines in vitro. The efficacy endpoints include objective response,
      immune-cell response, recurrent rate after a radical surgery, progression-free survival and
      overall survival, and the safety endpoints include adverse events, laboratory tests, ECG,
      ECOG-PT, etc. All patients will be followed up for at least 2 years after treatment.
