  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrographic seizures are common in critically ill patients leading to increased use of
      resource-intense continuous EEG monitoring for seizure identification and management. When
      identified, electrographic seizures are generally treated with anti-seizure medications, but
      there are very limited data available regarding optimal treatment in terms of the efficacy or
      safety of specific anti-seizure medications or overall management strategies.

      This is a single-center prospective observational study. The investigators aim to track
      critically ill patients undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring and seizure management
      to identify risk factors for electrographic seizures, create prediction models guiding EEG
      monitoring resources to the patients at highest risk for seizures, and evaluate our current
      management strategy in terms of safety.

      Context: Electrographic seizures are common in critically ill patients leading to increased
      use of resource-intense continuous EEG monitoring for seizure identification and management.
      When identified, electrographic seizures are generally treated with anti-seizure medications,
      but there are very limited data available regarding optimal treatment in terms of specific
      medication selections or overall management strategies. The Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia (CHOP) has a formal ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway aiming to standardize EEG
      monitoring and seizure management. This is a single-center prospective observational study of
      patients undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring to identify risk factors for
      electrographic seizures and create prediction models guiding limited EEG monitoring resources
      to the patients at highest risk for seizures, and also to evaluate the current seizure
      management strategy in terms of safety.

      Objectives: The primary objective is to identify risk factors for electrographic seizures in
      critically ill patients and use these risk factors to create and validate a seizure
      prediction model. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of a targeted and timely
      electrographic seizure identification and management strategy among critically ill patients
      guided by a CHOP ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway.

      Study Design: Single center observational study of consecutive patients undergoing clinically
      indicated EEG monitoring.

      Setting/Participants: Single-center study of critically ill children in the Pediatric ICU at
      the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia undergoing clinically indicated EEG monitoring and
      seizure management.

        This study is a prospective observational study of consecutive patients undergoing
        clinically indicated EEG monitoring in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Pediatric
        ICU as guided by an institutional ICU EEG Monitoring Pathway. Each subject will participate
        from the time of EEG monitoring initiation until the time of hospital discharge. This
        duration will generally be from several days to several weeks depending on the duration of
        the hospitalization.
