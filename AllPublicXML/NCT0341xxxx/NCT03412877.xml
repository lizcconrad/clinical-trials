      Background:

      In gene transfer therapy, cells are taken from a person s tumor to isolate mutations. White
      blood cells are then taken from the person's body, changed with a type of virus to attack the
      tumor cells, and returned to the person.

      Objective:

      To see if gene transfer therapy shrinks tumors.

      Eligibility:

      People with certain metastatic cancer for which standard treatments have not worked

      Design:

      Participants will complete screening and stages 1-3 under another protocol. Screening
      includes:

      Undergoing a biopsy or surgery at the NIH to obtain pieces of tumor in order to grow tumor
      cells

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Scans

      Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests

      The study has 7 stages:

        1. Screening tests repeated over 1-2 weeks. Participants will have leukapheresis: Blood is
           removed by a needle in one arm. A machine removes white blood cells. The rest of the
           blood is returned by a needle in the other arm. An IV catheter will be placed in the
           chest.

        2. Care at home over 6-12 weeks.

        3. Stopping therapy for 4-6 weeks while their cells are changed in a lab.

        4. Hospital stay for 1 week to get chemotherapy by IV.

        5. Receiving changed cells by catheter. Then getting a drug over 1-5 days to help the cells
           live longer.

        6. Recover in the hospital for 1 2 weeks. Participants will get drugs and have blood and
           urine tests.

        7. Participants will take an antibiotic and maybe an antiviral for at least 6 months after
           treatment. They will have repeat screening tests at visits every few months for the
           first year, every 6 months for the second year, then as determined.

      Background

        -  The administration of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate
           complete, durable regressions in 20 to 25% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Recent
           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated neoantigens
           expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.

        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to patients with a variety of other solid cancers,
           including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have little if
           any therapeutic impact.

        -  Recent studies in the Surgery Branch, NCI, have shown that TIL from non-melanoma solid
           cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against non-shared unique mutated neoantigens
           expressed in the cancer. The frequency of these T-cells is very low (often &lt; 0.1%) and
           it is thus difficult to isolate and grow mutation reactive T-cells to levels required
           for effective therapy.

        -  In a single patient with chemo-refractory metastatic cholangiocarcinoma we were able to
           grow a relatively pure population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these
           cells mediated a near-complete regression of all metastatic disease now lasting 2.5
           years.

        -  We have now developed approaches to identify these rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from
           common non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically
           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express these TCRs with high
           efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene-modified cells can recognize and destroy the
           autologous cancer in vitro.

        -  We are now proposing a clinical protocol to treat patients with refractory solid cancers
           using the adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transduced with genes encoding TCRs that
           recognize unique mutated neoantigens expressed by the cancer.

      Objectives

      -Primary objective:

      --To determine the rate of objective response (using RECIST criteria) of patients with solid
      cancers who receive autologous PBL that have been transduced with genes encoding T cell
      receptors that recognize mutated neoantigens in the autologous cancer.

      Eligibility

      -Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have:

        -  Measurable solid cancer with at least one lesion that is resectable for TIL generation
           with minimal morbidity plus at least one other lesion that can be measured that falls
           into one of four cohorts: (1) gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers, (2) breast and
           ovarian, and other solid cancers, (3) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and (4)
           glioblastoma. Metastatic disease is required for cohorts 1-3, but not for cohort 4.

        -  Evaluable solid cancer that has recurred following standard chemotherapy or standard
           systemic therapy

        -  Normal basic laboratory values.

        -  At least one lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of the cell
           product

        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design

        -  Patients will undergo resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for generation of autologous
           TIL cultures. Patients will be entered into four cohorts that include (1)
           gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers, (2) breast and ovarian, and other solid
           cancers, (3) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and (4) glioblastomas. Exomic
           sequencing and often RNA Seq will be performed to identify the mutations expressed in
           the patient s cancer. Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and tested for
           reactivity against mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have developed
           that involve the exposure of autologous antigen presenting cells to long peptides
           containing the mutation or tandem mini genes encoding the mutation.

        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutations will be identified and the individual
           T-cell receptors that recognize the mutation will be synthesized and used to create a
           retrovirus for transduction of the TCR into patient s autologous PBL.

        -  Transduced autologous PBL will then be expanded to large numbers using our standard

      rapid expansion protocol and administered to the patient following a non-myeloablative

      lymphodepleting regimen.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Patients will then receive the infusion of
           autologous transduced PBL and begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8
           hours for up to 10 doses). At the discretion of the PI, patients enrolled in cohort 3
           may receive low-dose aldesleukin (72,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 10 doses).

        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after cell infusion
           and periodically thereafter.

        -  It is anticipated that approximately one patient per month may enroll into the trial for
           each of the 4 histologic groups. Thus, accrual of up to 4 x 50=200 total evaluable
           patients may be completed in approximately 2 to 4 years. In order to allow for a small
           number of inevaluable patients, the accrual ceiling will be set to 210.

             bleeding.

          -  Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease
             and AIDS).

          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its

        toxicities.)

                  pain

          -  Clinically significant patient history which in the judgment of the PI would
             compromise the patients' ability to tolerate high-dose aldesleukin. (Note: At the
             discretion of the PI, patients enrolled in cohort 3 may receive low-dose aldesleukin.)
