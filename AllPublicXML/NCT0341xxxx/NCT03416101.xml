  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Siewert type II adenocarcinoma, the relationship between adenocarcinoma sub types and
      survival, histologic/biologic patterns related to the presence/absence of gastric greater
      curvature metastases, were investigated.

      In order to achieve further data on the biological patterns of intestinal and diffuse
      subtypes of esophageal adenocarcinoma (Lauren's classification), on the frequency of gastric
      greater curvature nodal stations and on the clinical relevance, in terms of prognosis and
      survival, of these parameters, a Siewert type II case series of Siewert type II
      adenocarcinomas, submitted to primary (no neoadjuvant therapy) surgical, studied, operated
      upon and followed up, were analysed. According to histologic patterns, cases were ordered in
      intestinal and diffuse adenocarcinoma sub types (Lauren's classification)and distinguished in
      Barret's, cardiopyloric, gastric types.

    <description>The esophagus was resected at the arch level of the azygos vein, a frozen section of the resection margin was routinely performed to achieve a proximal clean resection margin. The surgical specimen was comprehensive of distal esophagus, stomach and omentum. Digestive tract continuity was established with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy. Lymphadenectomy was extended to the thoracic stations R 2-4, 7-8-9, and L 4, numbered according to the Mountain's classification [39] (Suppl. File 2 Figure A) and to the abdominal stations 1-12, numbered according to the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer (JRSGC) 1998 classification.</description>
