  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the project, investigators basically plan to test the difference in social behavior and
      social cognition between depressive patients and healthy individuals. To test this,
      investigators plan to use traditional or novel behavioral experiment paradigms to target
      various behaviors.
