  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of two Colorectal
      Cancer (CRC) screening methods, including stool DNA test and blood mRNA test, for colorectal
      cancer in Chinese population, with colonoscopy as reference method. Lesions will be confirmed
      as malignant or precancerous by colonoscopy and histopathologic examination.

      The secondary objective is to compare the performance of these two CRC screening methods to a
      commercially available FIT assay, both with respect to cancer and advanced adenoma. Lesions
      will be confirmed as malignant or precancerous by colonoscopy and histopathologic
      examination.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who are at high risk of developing colorectal cancer will be asked to collect
      two stool samples one for the stool DNA test and the other for the commercially available FIT
      assay, and a single blood sample for the blood mRNA test. Subjects will undergo colonoscopy
      within 60 days of enrollment. Representative histopathology slides from tissue biopsied or
      excised during colonoscopy and those from subsequent definitive surgery may be retrieved in
      order to be evaluated by pathologists to confirm the diagnosis and staging.
