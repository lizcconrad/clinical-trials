    <textblock>
      This trial is a multicenter prospective, open, non-intervention clinical study. 200 patients
      with newly diagnosed adult ALL who underwent induction remission with the VDCLD regimen
      containing PLD and DNR, respectively,were plan to enrolled in this study to evaluate the CR
      rate and the level of myeloid leukemia stem cells in the first course of chemotherapy with
      two regimens; and to evaluate the safety of the two induction chemotherapy regimens.

      Subjects will receive one of two treatment regimens:

      Group A: intravenous drip of liposomal doxorubicin 36 mg/m2, d1、d15，1h； VCR 1.4mg/m2.d
      d1，d8，d15，d22 iv，CTX 800mg/m2.d d1 ivdrip，L-asp 6000u/m2.d d19～28 ivdrip，Dex10mg.d d1～28
      ivdrip，once every 28days.

      Group B: intravenous drip of DNR45mg/m2，d d1～3，1h；VCR 1.4mg/m2.d d1，d8，d15，d22 iv，CTX
      800mg/m2.d d1 ivdrip，L-asp 6000u/m2.d d19～28 ivdrip，Dex10mg.d d1～28 ivdrip，once every 28days.
      The primary endpoint is complete remission after the first course treatment of induced
      remission chemotherapy, to evaluated the ratio of CR patients after the first course of
      chemotherapy with PLD and DNR VDCLD regimens.The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the
      changes of myeloid leukemia stem cells in patients before and after induction of VDCLD with
      PLD and DNR respectively.
