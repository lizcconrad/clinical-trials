  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Globally, cirrhosis is the fifth commonest cause of mortality. Its natural history is
      typified by an initial, largely asymptomatic, &quot;compensated&quot; phase followed by
      &quot;decompensation&quot; due to complications of raised portal pressures and hepatocellular
      dysfunction.

      Currently the only definitive treatment option for cirrhosis is liver transplantation which
      is limited in its applicability due to donor shortage, exorbitant costs and lack of
      widespread availability. The need for long term immunosuppression and its attendant
      complications are a further drawback. The ability of stem cells to differentiate into
      multiple cellular lineages makes one speculate that they can be used for tissue repair and
      regeneration when tissue-resident stem cells become overwhelmed. Bone marrow derived stem
      cells have amazing plasticity. They can &quot;home&quot; to the liver in response to injury and help in
      liver regeneration by trans-differentiation, cell fusion and augmentation of tissue- resident
      stem cell mediated repair. Two methods are available for the mobilisation of stem cells from
      the bone marrow to the liver. One involves the administration of cytokines like
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the other is the isolation of stem cells
      from the marrow followed by their injection into the hepatic artery or portal vein after
      purification. The latter is probably more cumbersome and may be potentially risky due to the
      underlying coagulation abnormalities in cirrhotic patients .

      G-CSF has been shown to mobilise bone marrow stem cells and even increase survival in
      patients of severe alcoholic steatohepatitis and ACLF. There is conflicting evidence on the
      role of G-CSF in decompensated cirrhosis with some studies showing improved survival while
      others have shown a lack of clinical or biochemical benefit. Many of these studies have used
      a single course of G-CSF. Verma et al, in a recent study published in 2018, elegantly
      demonstrated the beneficial effect of multiple courses of G-CSF in improving mortality and
      transplant free survival in decompensated cirrhotics.

      The investigators too speculate that multiple cycles of G-CSF could result in better outcomes
      in decompensated cirrhosis by causing more prolonged and sustained stem cell homing to the
      liver. Thus, this study is being undertaken to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      multiple cycles of G-CSF in decompensated cirrhotics.
