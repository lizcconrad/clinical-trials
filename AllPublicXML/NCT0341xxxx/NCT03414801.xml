      To validate the Red Maple Trials Natural Exposure Chamber for cat exposure studies in
      non-asthmatic subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis and allergy to cat dander by
      examining the reproducibility of the response on two allergen challenge days and comparing
      the response of allergic to non-allergic subjects.

          -  With positive skin prick test reactivity to cat dander. A positive skin prick test is
             a wheal ≥3 mm larger than the negative control performed at the screening visit or
             within 6 months of the screening visit provided that complete documentation (specific
