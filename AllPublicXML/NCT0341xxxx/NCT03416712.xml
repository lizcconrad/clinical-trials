  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized control trial of 800 children admitted to the Pediatric Hospital
      Medicine service at Texas Children's Hospital. Each eligible participant will give informed
      consent prior to enrollment. Study participants will be randomized into an intervention (400
      participants) or control group (400 participants). The intervention group will receive a
      survey (WE CARE HOUSTON) that has been designed to assess family need for community resources
      that address the SDH (such as food insecurity, housing insecurity, etc.). The intervention
      group will receive referrals to community resources based on their responses to the WE CARE
      HOUSTON survey.

      This will be a randomized control trial of 800 children admitted to the Pediatric Hospital
      Medicine service at Texas Children's Hospital. Each eligible participant will give informed
      consent prior to enrollment.

      Study participants will be randomized into an intervention (400 participants) or control
      group (400 participants). The intervention group will receive a survey (WE CARE HOUSTON) that
      has been designed to assess family need for community resources that address the SDH (such as
      food insecurity, housing insecurity, etc.). The intervention group will receive referrals to
      community resources based on their responses to the WE CARE HOUSTON survey. The intervention
      group will receive a phone call within 3 months of discharge to ask if they have had trouble
      following up with resources.

      Both the intervention and the control groups will be followed for 6 months. Study
      investigators will obtain outcome data through structured telephone interviews at 6 months
      and also through medical record review.

      This research has been designed to test our hypotheses:

        1. The use of the WE CARE HOUSTON screening tool and subsequent referral to community
           resources will result in increased family participation in community resources that
           address the SDH; i.e. we believe that the intervention group will enroll in more
           community resources than the control group over the 6 month study period.

        2. The use of the WE CARE HOUSTON screening tool and subsequent referral to community
           resources will result in improved health outcomes, i.e. children in the intervention
           group will have fewer ED visits, fewer readmissions, improved BMI and improved parent
           perception of child's health during the study period.

Screen will assess educational attainment, employment, literacy, language skills, substance dependence, childcare and child behavior, mental health, domestic violence, housing insecurity and conditions, medical insurance, access to primary care, transportation to medical appointments, ability to pay for prescriptions, legal issues and immigration services. 2. Increase vulnerable family enrollment in community resources to decrease unmet psychosocial and economic needs in the study population 3. Evaluate impact of this intervention on health outcome indicators and hospital resource utilization (body mass index (BMI), return visit to ED, hospital readmission, and parent's perception of child's health).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>To obtain baseline socioeconomic data on all children (intervention and control), study participants will utilize the Children's HealthWatch Survey (www.childrenshealthwatch.org), which is a standardized, validated survey designed to collect demographics and information on child health and development, parental health, and socioeconomic factors income, education level, financial literacy, childcare, and government assistance).
The control group will not complete the WE CARE HOUSTON survey and will not receive any referrals to community resources from the study team at the time of enrollment (they may be referred to resources by their medical/clinical team as per standard of care during their hospitalization at Texas Children's Hospital). The study investigators will offer control participants information on community resources at the end of the study. Study participants will be called for a 6 month follow up structure telephone survey.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will complete a short survey called the WE CARE HOUSTON survey. The WE CARE HOUSTON survey has been designed to quickly assess patient need for local services that address the social determinants of health. The WE CARE HOUSTON survey will be administered on paper or verbally if family is not able to read. Based on the parent's responses to the screening survey, the study investigators will use an algorithm to direct families to appropriate services and community resources. Families who screen positive for social needs will receive a handout on resources. For the families that screen positive for depression/ mental health needs, domestic violence, or alcohol and drug abuse, the study investigators will notify the medical/clinical team and recommend an inpatient social work prior to discharge. Intervention participants will be called 1 week-2 months after enrollment to follow up on resources and will be called for a 6 month follow up structured telephone survey.</description>
