  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability (including incidence of
      central nervous system [CNS] related events such as lightheadedness and dizziness), of
      multiple oral doses of AL-794 in healthy volunteers (HV). Also, to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics of ALS-033719 and ALS-033927 in plasma after multiple oral doses of AL-794
      in HV.

             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;= 1.2*upper limit
             of normal (ULN); Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &gt;= 1.2*ULN; Total bilirubin &gt;= 1.2*ULN;
             Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or abnormalities which are deemed to
             interfere with the ability to interpret study data

          -  Creatinine clearance less than (&lt;) 90 milliliter per minute (mL/min) (using the
             Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration [CKD-EPI] equation)

          -  Positive screening test for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2
