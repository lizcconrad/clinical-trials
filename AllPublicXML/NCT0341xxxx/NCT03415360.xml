      Assessment of pain intensity on the NRS. Assessment of the quality of life by SF-36 and AIS.
      Diagnostic/prognostic nerve block with 5 ml of 2% lidocaine under real-time ultrasound
      control with confirmation of the correct position of the needle using a peripheral nerve
      stimulator.

      Reassessment of pain intensity on the NRS 30 minutes after local anesthetic block.

      Cryoablation under real-time ultrasound control if the NRS value is reduced by ≥ 2 points.

      If pain intensity on the NRS reduced by less than 2 points, reassessment 60 minutes after
      local anesthetic block.

      Cryoablation under real-time ultrasound control if the NRS value is reduced by ≥ 2 points.

      If pain intensity on the NRS reduces by less than 2 points 60 minutes after local anesthetic
      block cryoablation will not be performed.

      Cryoablation effect will be evaluated 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 3 months, 6 months post
      procedure.

    <description>Assessment of pain intensity pre- and post - cryoablation on the NRS (numeric rating scale).
Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. This is a 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' (minimum, &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' (maximum, &quot;pain as bad as one can imagine&quot;). The lower the NRS value, the better clinical outcome.</description>

    <description>Assessment of the quality of life pre- and post - cryoablation on SF-36. 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item questionnaire which measures quality of life across eight domains: physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, and general health.
For each of the eight domains that the SF36 measures an aggregate percentage score is produced. The percentage scores range from 0% (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100% (highest or best possible level of functioning).</description>

    <description>Assessment of the quality of life pre- and post - cryoablation on AIS. The Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS) consists of eight statements describing negative impact of poor health status and its consequences for patients' functioning. The scoring for each statement varies from 1 (poor adaptation to the disease) to 5 (full acceptance of the disease). The total score ranges between 8 and 40. The lower score, the poorer acceptance of disease and more severe restrictions caused by condition. A high score means acceptance of patient's own health status and lack of negative emotions related to illness.</description>

          -  Informed consent of patient to enter the study

          -  Reduction of pain after the diagnostic/prognostic anesthetic block of the relevant
             main peripheral nerves under ultrasonography guidance in an analogous fashion to the
