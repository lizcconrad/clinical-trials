  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glycemic control is naturally the principal topic of diabetes and complications that can be
      developed as a consequence of loss of sensitivity to perceive insulin signals by the cell.
      The glycemic control goals established by the ADA are: glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) &lt;7.0%,
      fasting plasma glucose 80-130 mg/dL and casual plasma glycemia &lt;180 mg/dL. The first-line
      treatment in patients of recent diagnosis is metformin, however, studies have shown that
      propolis, a resinous balsamic material collected by the Apis mellifera bee, from sprouts,
      exudates of trees and other parts of the plants, represents a very important and promising
      natural alternative in medicine, which can be considered as an antidiabetic agent.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of propolis or metformin administration on
      glycemic control in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus without pharmacological treatment.

      The investigators hypothesis is that propolis or metformin administration, modify the
      glycemic control in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus without pharmacological treatment.

      A double-blind, randomized clinical trial of three pharmacological groups in 36 patients with
      a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type 2 in accordance with the American Diabetes Association
      (ADA) without treatment.

      They will be assigned randomly three groups of 12 patients, each one will receive propolis
      300 mg, metformin 850 mg and placebo, two times per day before having break-fast and before
      having dinner during 12 weeks.

      The Area Under the Curve of glucose and insulin will be calculated, total insulin secretion
      (Insulinogenic index), first-phase of insulin secretion (Stumvoll index) and insulin
      sensitivity (Matsuda index).

      This protocol is already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed consent
      it's going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentages for
      variable qualitative. Qualitative variables will be analyzed by X2, will be used for
      differences inter-group Mann-Whitney U Test and Wilcoxon Test for the within-groups
      differences. It will be considered statistical significance p â‰¤0.05.
