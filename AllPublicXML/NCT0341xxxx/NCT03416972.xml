  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in Canada. For approximately 30% of
      patients that present with locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the standard
      treatment is curative-intent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Outcomes remain poor, with 5-year
      survival of only 20%. Despite the long-held belief that higher radiation doses lead to
      improved overall survival (OS), the landmark randomized trial (RTOG 0617) showed the
      opposite. The investigators hypothesize that the inferior survival observed may be due to
      unexpected heart toxicity as secondary analysis revealed that the heart dose was a strong
      predictor of inferior OS. Up to now, change in heart function is typically detected
      histologically, requiring autopsy tissue. Therefore, a non-invasive marker of early heart
      damage is required. Hybrid PET-MRI has become available in Canada only recently. The ability
      to simultaneously perform metabolic imaging with functional and tissue imaging allows for
      novel assessment of heart toxicity. The primary objective is to examine the utility of hybrid
      PET-MRI and DCE-CT to assess acute changes in heart function and to measure inflammation
      before, and six weeks after NSCLC radiotherapy. A pilot of 20 patients with Stage I-III NSCLC
      will be enrolled. The findings of this study will aid in the design of new studies to
      reassess dose escalation for locally advanced NSCLC while limiting the risk of heart
      toxicity. FDG PET will be used to simultaneously assess both cardiac inflammation and tumour
      response. Quantitative DCE-CT will also be used to measure ventilation and perfusion changes
      in the normal lung and tumour after radiotherapy, providing image data that can
      comprehensively assess both tumour response and potential toxicity in both the heart and
      lungs. Such information is crucial in understanding the disease and its response to
      treatment. This data will also aid in the design of radiation techniques that spare the heart
      in other patients with any thoracic malignancies, including breast cancer, lymphoma, and
      esophageal cancer.

    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a longitudinal imaging pilot study composed of 20 Stage I-III NSCLC
      patients before, and six weeks after standard radiotherapy using a hybrid 3T-PET/MRI system
      (Biograph mMR, Siemens Healthcare) and a GE Revolution 256-slice CT scanner. The imaging
      protocol is designed to detect acute changes in myocardial perfusion, inflammation, edema,
      left ventricular ejection fraction, normal lung and tumour perfusion, and tumour metabolism.
      During each imaging session, patients will receive an 18F-FDG PET scan to image
      macrophage-related inflammation and tumour metabolism, MRI to identify edema, mature fibrosis
      or scar, and Dynamic contrast enhanced CT (DCE-CT) imaging to image perfusion and (LVEF). All
      images will be fused and rendered with radiation treatment planning dose distributions.
      Parameters such as Standard Uptake Value (SUV) will be used to compare PET scans, while heart
      volume and presence of Gadolinium enhancement will be used to compare MRI scans. Blood flow,
      blood volume, and permeability will be used to compare CT scans. Blood tests including
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), high sensitivity C-reactive protein, and troponin at
      each timepoint will also be performed to detect cardiac inflammation. Comparisons between
      Stage I/II and Stage III patients will allow us to determine whether our metrics for heart
      changes is radiation related. Relative differences from the six-week time point to baseline
      will be correlated with the radiation dose distribution to attempt to define a dose-response
      relationship between radiation dose and cardiac toxicity.

        Ultimately, the sample size was based upon practical considerations and that 20 NSCLC
        patients (10 Stage I/II and 10 Stage III) could be accrued relatively easily from new
        patient clinics, while sufficiently providing enough evidence to validate the imaging
        techniques to be used as a non-invasive measure for future clinical trials aimed at
        reducing or mitigating radiation-induced cardiac toxicity.
