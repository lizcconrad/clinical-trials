  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to show that the Supraglottic Index (SGI) is an
      easily-collected index that accurately identifies the presence and severity of
      laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPF) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team hypothesizes the SGI will correlate more strongly with measures of IPF
      severity (at baseline and over time) than gastroesophageal reflux (GER) data derived from the
      esophageal detector channels of a pH/impedance probe.

    <measure>The supraglottic index (SGI) quantifies laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPF) and is associated with severity of pulmonary fibrosis.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation between the supraglottic index and forced vital capacity. The supraglottic index is an index derived by assigning scores for edema and erythema of five supraglottic structures (epiglottis, false cords, arytenoids, posterior commissure, piriform recess) as viewed through a fiber-optic scope. Scores range from 0-22, with higher scores indicating more severe LPR.</description>
