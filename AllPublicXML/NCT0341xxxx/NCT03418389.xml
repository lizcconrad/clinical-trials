  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypophosphatasia is a rare inherited metabolic disorder due to inactivating mutations of the
      ALPL-Gene. Particularly among adult patients, clinical manifestation exhibits a broad range
      of signs and symptoms, most commonly associated with musculoskeletal disabilities and
      compromised quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy with Asfotase alfa (AA) is available
      and approved for patients with pediatric onset of the disease.

      This single-center observational cohort study aims at collecting clinical routine data
      regarding the course treatment, quality of life and physical performance in patients treated
      with Asfotase alfa in line with the label for pediatric-onset hypophosphatasia.
