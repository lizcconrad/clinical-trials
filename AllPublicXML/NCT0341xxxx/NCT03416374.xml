  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of long-term
      administration of the oral proteasome inhibitor ixazomib as part of ixazomib in combination
      with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd) therapy in patients with relapsed and/or refractory
      multiple myeloma (RRMM) treated initially with an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat
      people who have RRMM. This study will look at the effectiveness and safety of IRd in
      participants with RRMM previously receiving an injectable proteasome inhibitor-based therapy.
      This study consists of two treatment periods, Treatment Period I and Treatment Period II.

      The study will enroll 47 patients. All participants will receive following treatment:

      - Combination therapy with Bortezomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (VRd) or combination
      therapy with Carfilzomib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (KRd), standard recommended dose
      according to the package insert of each drug, as Treatment Period I, followed by Combination
      therapy with Ixazomib 4.0 mg + Lenalidomide 25 mg + Dexamethasone 40 mg (IRd) as Treatment
      Period II

      At start of this study, combination therapy of VRd or KRd will be decided by investigator as
      Treatment Period I after the baseline evaluations. After the start of Treatment Period I, a
      participant's eligibility for Treatment Period II is then determined 3 cycles. Participants
      who meet these eligibility criteria II subsequently continue into Treatment Period II and
      receive IRd.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. It is anticipated that the treatment
      phase of this study will last up to 39 months, including 12 months for enrollment, and a
      27-month treatment period for the last participant enrolled. Participants will make multiple
      visits to the clinic in treatment period, and follow-up period including a follow-up
      assessment after last dose of study drug.
