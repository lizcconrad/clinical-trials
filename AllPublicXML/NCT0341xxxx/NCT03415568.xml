  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) and diacylglycerols (DGs) have
      effects on lowering circulating triglycerides (TGs). In this study, the mixture of MCTs and
      DGs (MCDGs) examined whether it has beneficial effects on postprandial lipids metabolism
      compared to long-chain triglycerides (TGs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blinded, controlled, cross-over trial was conducted to verify the
      effects of MCDGs. Twenty-eight healthy male and female subjects aged 21-29 years with normal
      body weight [18.5 kg/m^2 ≤ body mass index (BMI) &lt; 25 kg/m^2] were recruited. The subjects
      visited the research site twice over with a seven-day interval after an overnight fast at
      least 12 hr. On the first visit, the participants were randomly assigned to consume a test or
      placebo product [test product: muffins containing MCDG oil (MCDG muffin); placebo product:
      muffins containing LCT oil (LCT muffin)] and ingested the assigned product. On the second
      visit, the participants consumed the other product that they did not eat on the first visit.
      On both visit day, the 6-hr meal tolerance test was conducted and started at 8:00 in the
      morning; venous blood samples were collected before (0 hr) and after ingestion (2, 3, 4, and
      6 hr) of the products.
