  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted from a real-world perspective to describe treatment sequences
      involving radium-223 and chemotherapy in patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate
      cancer (mCRPC) and assess overall survival (OS) associated with treatment sequences involving
      radium-223 and chemotherapy. While clinical trials of radium-223 has demonstrated a survival
      benefit in the treatment of mCRPC, both pre and post- docetaxel, study lacked exposure to
      second generation androgens and hence could not assess outcomes pre or post abiraterone or
      enzalutamide.

      The specific objective of this study is to describe and compare the clinical outcomes between
      treatment sequences for patients with mCRPC where 1) radium-223 is used (alone or in
      combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide) prior to chemotherapy versus 2) radium-223 used
      after chemotherapy in the treatment of mCRPC. The secondary objectives are to describe the
      safety patterns of docetaxel use among mCRPC patients who received chemotherapy post
      radium-223.
