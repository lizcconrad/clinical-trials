    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to assess the validity of Nestlé reformulation criteria in
      two national dietary surveys: the US NHANES 2011, and the French INCA2 2006-07.

      Background: The Nestlé Nutritional Profiling System (NNPS) has been developed to guide food
      and beverage reformulation. It is not known whether products passing the NNPS standards have
      a higher overall nutritional density, and whether the higher consumption of NNPS Pass
      products is associated with a higher dietary quality.

      Objective: The objectives were (i) to compare the classifications derived from the NNPS and
      the validated UK Ofcom nutrient profiling system; and (ii) to assess the NNPS construct
      validity against healthy and unhealthy diets in French (Individual and National Survey on
      food Consumption 2006-2007) and the US (National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
      2011-2012) nationally representative dietary surveys.

      Design: NNPS outcomes (PASS, FAIL, Out-of-scope) of foods were compared to UK Ofcom outcomes.
      Contributions of NNPS outcomes to energy intakes were compared between diets nutritional
      quality classes defined by two methods: based on a food-based quality indicator (PNNS-GS in
      France, HEI-2010 in the US), or on a combination of three nutrient-based indicators (MAR,
      MER, energy density).
