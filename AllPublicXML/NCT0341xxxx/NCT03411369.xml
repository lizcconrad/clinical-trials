  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, researchers have paid attention to the development of new products such as
      supplements food and nutraceuticals for identify and develop integrative therapies to be used
      in cardiovascular disease. As suggested by literature, some nutritional components (creatine,
      ribose) can enhance the fundamental energy levels for the functioning of the heart muscle and
      can enhance the body's antioxidant capacity through the reduction in free radicals activity,
      one of the main pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases. In this context, the investigators
      have developed a research with the principal purpose to establish whether a supplement of
      creatine and ribose can improve the total work capacity during exercise in a population of
      patients with known ischemic heart disease.

      The investigators will enroll patients with previous acute coronary syndrome treated for at
      least 30 days by hospital discharge. The treatment regimen of all patients will be optimized
      in accordance with European Society of Cardiology guidelines. Standardized pharmacological
      treatment during cardiac rehabilitation period will include administration of angiotensin
      converting enzyme inhibition (ACE), beta-blockers and antiplatelet blockers. Furthermore, in
      order to keep patients free from angina symptoms, in some cases calcium channel blockers
      and/or nitrates will be used. The investigators will randomize participants into two groups,
      one receiving treatment Creatine, D-Ribose, B1 Vitamin, and B6 vitamin, and one receiving
      placebo in a double blind study design, for 6 months.
