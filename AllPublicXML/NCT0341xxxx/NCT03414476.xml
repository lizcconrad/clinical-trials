  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigator will try to highlight the presence of carbonyl compounds in
      the hair follicles of women with telogen effluvium (ET) linked to stress of various origins
      (fatigue, infectious diseases, emotional stress ...).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the cutaneous level, oxidative stress induces the formation of carbonyl compounds which,
      by binding to proteins, produce nonfunctional adducts inducing cutaneous aging. Is this
      mechanism, called &quot;Carbonyl stress&quot;, also present in the scalp and can it be one of the
      mechanisms involved in the occurrence of reactive hair loss ? To demonstrate this, samples of
      hair follicles are made. The proteins are extracted from the samples and then assayed. The
      oxidized (carbonyl) proteins are labeled with specific fluorescent probes.
