  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a leading cause of disability and health care costs in the United States,
      and treatments are ineffective for many patients. Epidural steroid injections are a common
      treatment, but their efficacy has been questioned and for many patients they do not provide
      complete relief. The investigators hypothesize, based on preclinical studies, that lack of
      complete efficacy may be due to the fact that clinically used steroids activate not only the
      intended drug target, the glucocorticoid receptor, but also the pro-inflammatory
      mineralocorticoid receptor. To test this hypothesis, this pilot study will recruit patients
      scheduled for lumbar epidural steroid injections for degenerative disc disease, and randomize
      them to receive a concurrent treatment with oral eplerenone (a clinically approved antagonist
      of the mineralocorticoid receptor) or placebo for 10 days starting just after the epidural
      injection. At several time points during the following year, subjects will answer the
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire, to report on both pain and functional outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with degenerative disc disease, who are recommended to have an epidural steroid
      injection as part of their routine clinical care, will be invited to participate in the study
      prior to their first epidural steroid injection. If they consent, they will complete the
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire (version 2) just prior to their first injection which
      captures the functional effects of back pain on various activities, providing a more
      meaningful picture than a simple static pain rating.

      The subjects will complete the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire again four weeks after
      their first injection, a time point at which patients routinely have a follow-up visit.
      Patients referred for a second injection at this time will complete an additional Oswestry
      just prior to that injection. Subjects will be asked to complete additional Oswestry Low Back
      Pain Questionnaires at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year after their epidural injection (or after
      their second epidural injection if this is recommended).

      Prior to receiving study medication (eplerenone or placebo), subjects will provide a blood
      sample to examine their creatinine and potassium levels, to ensure there are no
      contraindications to taking eplerenone.

      In addition to the pain questionnaires, data will be collected from the subjects' medical
      charts regarding basic clinical demographics and clinical outcome of the epidural steroid
      injection.
