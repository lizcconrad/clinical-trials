      The study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, open label observational study. The
      objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of the EyeBOX to a clinical diagnosis of
      abnormal ICP as determined by an external ventriculostomy drain (EVD) or ventriculostomy
      catheter.

        The study will enroll pediatric and adult patients with abnormal ICP. Subjects who meet all
        of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be considered for
        enrollment into the study. There will be no enrollment restrictions based on race, ethnic
        origin, gender, or pregnancy status and efforts will be made to ensure that the benefits
        and burdens of research participation are distributed in an equitable manner. Subjects must
        require ICP monitoring for clinical indications. At the time when eye tracking is performed
        all patients must be awake with spontaneous eye opening.
