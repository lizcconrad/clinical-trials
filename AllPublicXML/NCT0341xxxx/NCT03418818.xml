  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single centre, investigator initiated study to investigate the use of
      FAZA-PET in combination with MRI. FAZA is an investigational radiotracer used in PET scans.
      FAZA PET/MRI will be used to measure hypoxia in sarcoma tissues of 14 patients who plan to
      undergo neoadjuvant radiation/chemotherapy treatment.

      After the FAZA PET/MRI scan, patients will be followed up via telephone, 48 hours after the
      scan, to see if there are any side effects due to FAZA. Patients may also be requested to
      repeat the FAZA scan after their standard of care radiation treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mutliple studies show that hypoxia in sarcoma has been consistently associated with poor
      treatment outcomes. Subsequently, there has been a study that shows inhibition of
      hypoxia-induced transcription factor (HIF-1 alpha), with radiation, was effective in disease
      treatment in pre-clinical models. This shows how important hypoxia was in playing a role in
      overall disease outcome and survival.

      As a means of examining tumor features, such as hypoxia, hybrid PET/MR imaging combines the
      advantages of MRI's soft-tissue and contrast resolution with PET's functional metabolic
      capabilities. There have been few reports of using 18F-FDG in diagnostic PET/MRI. with the
      use of 18F-FAZA in this study, parameters such as diffusion, micro-perfusion, and contrast
      enhancement (as a surrogate marker for viable tumour tissue) can be simultaneously compared
      with the FAZA-derived pattern, in a single procedure.

      The study is being conducted to measure the volume of hypoxic tumor in high-risk STS
      patients, using FAZA-PET/MRI, before and after neoadjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy.
