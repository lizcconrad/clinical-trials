  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug called atezolizumab as a possible treatment
      HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that has spread to the brain.

      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Atezolizumab

        -  Pertuzumab

        -  Trastuzumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the
      combination of atezolizumab, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab for use in humans. The FDA has not
      approved atezolizumab for this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

        -  Atezolizumab is a protein that affects the immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway.
           The PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but for some types of
           cancer the immune system does not work as it should and is prevented from attacking
           tumors. Atezolizumab works by blocking the PD-L1 pathway, which may help the immune
           system identify and catch tumor cells.

        -  Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are targeted therapies approved by the FDA to be used alone
           or in combination with a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast
           cancer that hasn't been treated with either trastuzumab or chemotherapy yet.

        -  Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are called &quot;targeted therapies&quot; because they work by
           attaching themselves to specific receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known
           as HER2 receptors. When these targeted therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals
           that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for
           destruction by your immune system. This process allows pertuzumab and trastuzumab to
           help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer. Pertuzumab and trastuzumab target
           different areas of the HER2 cell, so they are believed to work together more
           effectively.

      In this research study, investigators are looking to see how well the cancer responds to the
      combination of atezolizumab in combination with pertuzumab and trastuzumab.

          -  Pathologically confirmed HER2-positive MBC by local laboratory with the following
             requirements: HER2 overexpressed or amplified (immunohistochemistry of 3+ or HER2 gene

             pregnancy test within 8 days of initiating protocol therapy.

          -  The effects of atezolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown and radiotherapy
             has known teratogenic effects so women of child-bearing potential and men must agree
             to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation and 4 months after completion
             of atezolizumab administration.

             unequivocal radiological evidence of clinically significant leptomeningeal
             involvement. CSF sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to
             exclude leptomeningeal involvement].

          -  Treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids defined as dexamethasone &gt; 2mg/day
             or bioequivalent within 7 days of initiating therapy.

          -  Patients unable to undergo gadolinium contrast-enhanced MRI or receive IV contrast for
             any reason (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme
             obesity, hypersensitivity).

          -  Chemotherapy or targeted therapy within 14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 of protocol
             therapy.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

          -  No washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on endocrine
             therapy within 28 days of study entry, that same endocrine therapy is permitted to be
             continued during protocol therapy, at the investigator's discretion, as is
             continuation of ovarian suppression in premenopausal women. Starting a new endocrine
             therapy during protocol therapy is not permitted

          -  Current use or history of receiving a non-approved, investigational treatment within
             14 days prior to cycle 1 day 1 of protocol therapy

          -  Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic
             composition to atezolizumab or any constituent of the product

          -  The subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris,
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association
             Class III or IV, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the
             previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, gastric or duodenal ulceration

          -  Participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or
             on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. For example, patients with
             autoimmune disease that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppression agents should
             be excluded. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic
             corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is
             not considered a form of systemic treatment.

             HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy
             are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             atezolizumab.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 28 days of planned start of study therapy.

          -  Known intolerance to trastuzumab or pertuzumab or atezolizumab.
