  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) affects approximately 100,000 Americans yearly.
      Up to 30-50% of ICH is fatal, and those patients who survive are often left with significant
      neurologic dysfunction. In the past, medical management (e.g., control of hypertension,
      reversal of antiplatelet or anticoagulants) had been the most effective treatment for these
      patients, given the morbidity and mortality associated with open surgical treatment for
      evacuation of ICH. However, recent trials have demonstrated that minimally invasive
      stereotactic neurosurgical procedures to evacuate ICH are safe and result in improved
      outcomes for these patients.

      Initial attempts to evaluate the efficacy of surgical evacuation of ICH found no significant
      difference between medical management and standard craniotomy for surgical evacuation.
      Indeed, open surgery was often discouraged for these patients due to the significant
      morbidity and mortality associated with the surgical procedure itself. However, research has
      demonstrated that minimally invasive, image guided stereotactic frame-based and frameless
      methods are effective and safe for the placement of catheters for clot aspiration and
      fibrinolytic therapy of ICH in the basal ganglia and other deep seated regions. Larger
      randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that these minimally invasive approaches also
      offer clinical benefit for these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of the ROSA stereotactic robot offers an image guided stereotactic approach
      with greater precision and accuracy than traditional frame-based and frameless methods. While
      the ROSA has never been used for the placement of intra-hemorrhage catheters, prior
      applications such as brain biopsies and abscess drainage represent similar surgical
      procedures which require the same planning, precision, and surgical technique. At the very
      least, ROSA offers an accurate image guided approach to deep lesions that should be
      comparable to competitive image guided platforms. At best, ROSA offers superior trajectory
      planning software, greater ease in planning multiple trajectories to large, irregular clots,
      and the potential for robot aided navigation into and out of the hematoma which is the
      greatest source of human error in these cases. For instance, the procedure often requires
      advancement of a larger aspiration catheter, slow aspiration as the catheter is withdrawn,
      and then re-advancement of a smaller catheter into the hematoma, which is left in place. The
      ability to advance and remove catheters in a fixed trajectory with robotic assistance may
      represent the greatest advantage of ROSA.
