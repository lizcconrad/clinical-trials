  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the expanded study is to examine the effectiveness of a &quot;Stand Up and Move
      More&quot; intervention to reduce sedentary behavior in older adults from underserved communities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on our successful pilot research in Rock County, WI, and the receipt of funding from
      the National Institutes of Health, we are expanding our research to additional counties in
      Wisconsin for a total of four counties (i.e., Dane, Iowa, Rock, and Vilas counties). Sample
      size will increase and participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group
      (Stand Up and Move More group) or a wait-list control group (who receive the intervention
      after 12 weeks). The Stand Up and Move More intervention/workshop involves sessions once/week
      for four weeks with a refresher session at 8 weeks. Assessments will be conducted before the
      intervention/workshop begins, and then again at 4 weeks and 12 weeks. We have added several
      questionnaires to examine potential mediators of behavior change (e.g., self-efficacy,
      self-regulation, outcome expectancies).
