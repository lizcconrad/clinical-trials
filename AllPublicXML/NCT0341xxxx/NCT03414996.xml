  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, no studies have evaluated the safety or efficiency (improvement of maximal oxygen
      uptake [VO2peak]) of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) program in post-acute coronary
      syndrome (post-ACS) patients. Heart rate variability (HRV) and recovery (HRR), QT dispersion
      (QTd) and ventricular arrhythmias are all indices associated with an increased risk of
      cardiac death. HIIT has been shown to improve these risk markers and be safe in coronary
      heart disease patients but not yet in post-ACS patients which are considered more at risks.

      The aim of this study was to compare a HIIT program to a moderate-intensity continuous
      exercise training (MICET) program on HRV, HRR, QTd parameters and occurrence of ventricular
      arrhythmias in post-ACS patients.

    <description>Following 5 min warm-up at 30 % of maximal aerobic power (MAP) obtained at the cardiopulmonary exercise test, patients performed 2 sets of 10 minutes of repeated phases of 15 seconds at 100 % MAP alternating with 15 seconds of passive recovery. The 2 sets were separated by 4 min of passive recovery (no pedalling). Patients performed 5-minutes of recovery period at 30 % MAP after the second set. Total time duration was 34 minutes.</description>

Following 5 min warm-up at 30 % of maximal aerobic power (MAP), patients performed continuous exercise at 60 % MAP during 24 minutes. Patients performed 5-minutes of recovery period at 30 % MAP after the second set. Total time duration was 34 minutes.</description>
