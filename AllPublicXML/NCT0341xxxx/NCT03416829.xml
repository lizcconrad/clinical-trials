  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first study will enroll 3 groups of patients with vocal fold nodules that will receive
      different schedules of ambulatory voice biofeedback (100% frequency feedback, 25% frequency
      feedback, summary feedback) to avoid their upper 15th percentile of vocal loudness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct this study (based on principles of motor learning) using novel
      smartphone-based ambulatory voice biofeedback systems aimed at improving the carryover of
      newly established vocal behaviors into daily life. This first study will determine which of
      three types of ambulatory feedback results in better learning/retention (100% frequency, 25%
      frequency, or delayed summary feedback every 2 minutes of voicing) of a new vocal behavior
      (reduced vocal intensity) in three groups of 15 patients with vocal fold nodules. Hypothesis:
      Patients receiving lower frequency or summary feedback will produce lower initial performance
      but higher short- and long-term retention than patients receiving feedback 100% of the time.

    <description>Some patients will be assigned (via block randomization) to receive ambulatory voice biofeedback (100% frequency - vibrotactile cueing every time the participant exceeds a vocal intensity threshold). Voice monitoring will be conducted for 3 days (device automatically turns off after 42 minutes of voicing): Day 1: biofeedback will be active all day , Day 2: the day after Day 1, no biofeedback, just monitoring to test short-term retention. Day 3: 7 days post-Day 1, no biofeedback, just monitoring to test longer-term retention.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be provided cues regarding their vocal behavior in daily life. The cues will either be: 100% feedback = a vibrotactile cue on a smartwatch every time the patient voices incorrectly... 25% feedback = a vibrotactile cue on a smartwatch every 4th time the patient voices incorrectly... Summary feedback = the patient's overall compliance (percentage of voiced time within desired limits) will be presented via a smartwatch every 2 minutes of voicing.</description>
