  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, the principal investigator plans to enroll 14 patients. If 2 or more
      responses are documented, the principal investigator will consider to start a new phase II
      study. If there is less than 2 responses in the 14 patients, it is unlikely that Eribulin
      will produce 15% or more response rate in patients with active brain metastases, thus
      indicating no need to study further. Based on Poisson distribution, there is 38% probability
      of observing 1 or 0 response even if the underlying response is 15%. There is no null
      hypothesis, hence no p-value of significance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of the
             breast.

          2. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who have received an
             anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin, epirubicin) and a taxane (e.g. paclitaxel,
             docetaxel), either in combination or in separate regimens. It can be used in
             neo-adjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting.

          3. Patients must have measurable brain metastases (minimum size of 10mm in long axis)
             which is asymptomatic and does not required any treatment or had failed to respond or
             progress after either radiation treatment or stereotactic radiosurgery.

          4. Patients who are deemed to have asymptomatic brain metastases should not be on
             systemic corticosteroid at enrolment. Patients who have brain metastases that have
             failed previous radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery are allowed to be on
             systemic corticosteroid at enrolment. Baseline dose of corticosteroid should be
             documented.

          5. Patients with known HER2 positive tumors may additionally have been treated with

             is available.

          6. Patients with known estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-expressing tumors may have
