  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, non-blinded, non-randomized, pilot trial for safety and efficacy of deep
      brain stimulation for PTSD. A substantial number of individuals continue to experience PTSD
      symptoms despite appropriate medical treatment. In psychotherapy-based studies, over 30% of
      patients that completed a full course of treatment continue to meet criteria for PTSD.
      Response rates to treatment with SSRIs are usually no higher than 60%. This study would be
      the first exploration of a surgical therapy for refractory PTSD. The subgenual cingulate
      plays a role in mechanisms of this disorders and has been successfully targeted with DBS for
      the treatment of depression. The development of a therapy that targets brain structures known
      to play a role in this disease would be a substantial step forward in the treatment and
      understanding of these conditions.

    <measure>Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report measure that assesses PTSD. The DTS yields a frequency score (ranging from 0 to 68), severity score (ranging from 0 to 68), and total score (ranging from 0 to 136). It can be used to make a preliminary determination about whether the symptoms meet DSM criteria for PTSD. Scores can also be calculated for each of the 3 PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., B, C, and D).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short PTSD Rating Interview (SPRINT)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>self-report measure that assesses the core symptoms of PTSD (intrusion, avoidance, numbing, arousal), somatic malaise, stress vulnerability, and role and social functional impairment. Symptoms are rates on five point scales from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression (CGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>CGI is a 3-item observer-rated scale that measures illness severity (CGIS), global improvement or change (CGIC) and therapeutic response. The CGI is rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale using a range of responses from 1 (normal) through to 7 (amongst the most severely ill patients). CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Treatment response ratings should take account of both therapeutic efficacy and treatment-related adverse events and range from 0 (marked improvement and no side-effects) and 4 (unchanged or worse and side-effects outweigh the therapeutic effects). Each component of the CGI is rated separately; the instrument does not yield a global score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Functioning Assessment (GFA)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>GAF assigns a clinical judgment in numerical fashion to the individual's overall functioning level. Impairments in psychological, social and occupational/school functioning are considered, but those related to physical or environmental limitations are not.
The scale ranges from 0 (inadequate information) to 100 (superior functioning).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>STAI is a commonly used measure of trait and state anxiety. It can be used in clinical settings to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndrome. All items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., from &quot;Almost Never&quot; to &quot;Almost Always&quot;). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0-56, where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe.</description>

    <measure>Sheehan disability scale (SDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SDS is a brief, 5-item self-report tool that assesses functional impairment in work/school, social life, and family life. Total score 0-30 (0 unimpaired, 30 highly impaired) Work/school (0-10) Social life (0-10) Family life/home responsibilities (0-10 Scores of ≥5 on any of the 3 scales; high scores are associated with significant functional impairment.</description>

Used as a psychometric scale, the PANAS can show relations between positive and negative affect with personality stats and traits. Ten descriptors are used for each PA scale and NA to define their meanings.
Participants in the PANAS are required to respond to a 20-item test using 5-point scale that ranges from very slightly or not at all (1) to extremely (5).</description>
