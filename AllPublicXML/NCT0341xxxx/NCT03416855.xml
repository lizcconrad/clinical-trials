  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about safety and effectiveness of
      Ryzodeg® FlexTouch® in participants with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy under
      routine clinical practice conditions with the aim of identifying or quantifying a safety
      hazard, early detection of unknown safety problems. Participants will attend the
      clinic/hospital/medical institution according to usual practice and receive medical care, as
      agreed with the study doctor.
