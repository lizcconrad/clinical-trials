  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the implementation and the effects of the
      Neighbourhood Team Development (NTD) Program, an innovative multi-component program that aims
      to provide resident centred care in long term facilities (LTC). As Canadians age, there is an
      increasing demand for LTC services. Older people residing in LTC homes and their families
      expect excellent care and services. However, literature and anecdotal evidence clearly
      indicate that LTC is not necessarily resident and family centred, nor are the care providers
      always collaborating as a team, thereby compromising the residents' quality of life.1-5
      Residents with Alzheimer's Disease or Related Dementias (ADRD), who may have difficulty
      voicing their concerns, are at particular risk of receiving poor resident centred care.6,7
      Decisions such as mealtimes in large dining rooms or early bedtimes are seldom in line with
      the residents' needs or wishes and add to the growing concern that the current LTC system is
      ill-designed and outdated. The NTD Program, designed by the investigators, aims to both
      enhance team development and resident centredness in LTC. The Program has three components,
      designed to modify the physical environment, the organization and delivery of services, and
      the alignment of staff members, to function independently and collaboratively in providing
      resident-centred care.
