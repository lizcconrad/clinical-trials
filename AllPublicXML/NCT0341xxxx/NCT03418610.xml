      This research study is being performed to evaluate the photographic evidence of the efficacy
      and tolerability of Azelaic Acid Foam 15% in the treatment of papulopustular rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, single arm open label study of Azelaic Acid foam 15% for the treatment
      of moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea. All patients will apply Azelaic Acid foam twice
      daily. At scheduled visits, high resolution equipment will be used to measure 3D
      topographical values for elevation of papules and pustules to objectively evaluate reduction
      of papulopustular lesions. Investigator and subject assessments will also be completed to
      assess the level of rosacea at weeks 4,8 and 12.
