  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For a long time, tricuspid valve disease has been considered as less important than
      left-sided valvular heart disease. If treated in an advanced stage and simultaneously with
      other cardiac diseases, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Hence,
      physicians tend to refer patients more aggressively to surgery (1).

      Transcatheter procedures are an attractive alternative in high-risk patients. The field of
      transcatheter tricuspid devices has rapidly advanced over the last few years (2). Limited
      knowledge is available regarding the epidemiologic and anatomical settings in which these
      therapies are preferentially applied.

      The main purpose of this registry is the collection of baseline clinical and anatomical data
      of the patients treated with transcatheter tricuspid valve therapies, and their outcomes,
      whenever feasible. Apart from more knowledge regarding the current status in this field, the
      results could also help the establishment of guidelines with respect to the choice of the
      transcatheter device selected and to understand which therapy can provide the better outcome
      in the different anatomies. Moreover, this study will provide important information about the
      epidemiology of severe tricuspid regurgitation, which is at the moment an undertreated
      disease.
