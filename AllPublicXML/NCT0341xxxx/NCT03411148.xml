  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low balance confidence occurs when an individual perceives they have limited ability to
      maintain their balance while performing a specific task of daily living. It is a prevalent
      problem in lower limb prosthesis users and is a strong predictor of prosthesis use and
      community participation. Balance confidence is not necessarily related to functional
      abilities. It is possible to improve functional ability as a result of rehabilitation,
      without concurrently improving balance confidence. Interventions to address low balance
      confidence may need to target both functional abilities as well as beliefs regarding these
      abilities. The purpose of this study is to test whether, for users of lower limb prostheses,
      an intervention combining physical therapy exercise to improve function with cognitive
      behavioral therapy to address fears and thoughts associated with low confidence can improve
      balance confidence and promote community participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb prosthesis users, with self-reported low balance confidence complete baseline gait
      analysis and balance testing, as well as a series of validated self-reported outcome scales
      addressing balance confidence, quality of life, and community integration. Participants are
      then provided a step activity monitor (SAM) and a global position sensing (GPS) tracker to be
      worn for one week, the data from which is linked and used to objectively quantify baseline
      community participation. At the conclusion of the one week, participants are randomized to
      one of two groups, each of which will last for 8 weeks. At the conclusion of the eight weeks,
      participants repeat baseline assessments and are again provided a SAM and GPS tracker to wear
      for one week. Baseline measures and activity monitoring occur again 8 and 16 weeks
      thereafter.

    <description>Eight weekly sessions integrating techniques from physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. At the start of each session participants play virtual reality games that target balance and functional gait and then discuss their balance confidence and activity avoidance behaviors with a behavioural counselor. Weekly homework assignments ask participants to report on thoughts causing them to avoid activities and to slowly engage in activities that present increasing levels of fear.</description>
