  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether different formats of medical informed consent documents can help
      improve understanding and confidence in decision-making for clinical trials. The study will
      be primarily run through an online survey.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate whether the same information can be communicated in
      different formats of an informed consent document in ways that improve participant
      understanding and confidence. Participants will review one of several different versions of
      the same informed consent document, and will be asked to complete a survey after reading the
      documents. The survey will ask participants their willingness to enroll in the clinical trial
      discussed in the document and their confidence in their decision. The survey will also test
      participants recollection of information from the informed consent document. Researchers will
      look at this data to see if there are ways to improve knowledge about the clinical trial and
      confidence in decisions without necessarily changing enrollment preferences.

    <description>Survey question of the following form:
'If you enrolled in the trial described in the consent form, what is the probability that the treatment could help control your asthma better, where 0% means &quot;no chance at all of helping&quot; and 100% means &quot;would definitely help&quot;?'
Participants provided with drop-down menu including values from 0% to 100% in increments of 1%.</description>

Participants are then provided with an free-response text box where they are allowed to enter whatever text they want, as long as they enter some text. These responses will be coded by two independent coders, blinded to the treatment arms, using an emergent coding system to identify different topics that participants may raise.</description>
