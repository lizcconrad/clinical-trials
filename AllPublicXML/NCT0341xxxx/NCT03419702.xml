  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to examine and understand the impact of
      long-term almond consumption on chronic glucose metabolism in subjects with impaired glucose
      tolerance.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      Secondary objectives are to investigate if improved chronic glucose metabolism in subjects
      with impaired glucose tolerance after long-term almond consumption translates into improved
      peripheral and brain vascular function, and enhanced cognitive performance. In addition, the
      investigators will address to what extent improved chronic glucose metabolism in subjects
      with impaired glucose tolerance after long-term almond consumption can be explained by
      (combined) effects of lowered hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, skeletal muscle
      characteristics, visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation, pancreatic function or fecal
      microbiota composition.

      Study design:

      The proposed study will be a 12 months randomised, controlled trial with a cross-over design.
      Two experimental periods of five months will be separated by a two months washout period.

      Study population:

      Forty-three impaired glucose tolerant subjects, with overweight and mild obesity (BMI 25-35
      kg/m2), aged 40-70 years.

      Intervention:

      During the intervention period of 5 months, subjects will receive daily 50 gr almonds, but
      not in the 2 months washout and 5 months control periods.
