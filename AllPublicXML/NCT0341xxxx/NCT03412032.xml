  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several approaches for summative assessment during Advanced Life Support courses are used.
      The most commonly used method during European Resuscitation (ERC) Council Life Support
      Courses is that 1 instructor is miming a whole team, and the candidate has to lead this
      &quot;team&quot; through a scenario; another variant of the summative assessment (mainly used by
      American Heart Association (AHA) Courses) is with a group of students, where one student is
      the team leader to be assessed and the others are his team not being assessed. The second
      approach might be more realistic; however there is no evidence around with regard to
      effectiveness (pass/fail rate, ability to test non-technical skills (NTS)) or
      participant/assessor satisfaction.
