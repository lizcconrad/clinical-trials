        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male between 18-50 years of age, inclusive, on the date of signing the Informed
             Consent Form (ICF).

          2. Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical safety
             laboratory tests prior to the initial study drug administration.

             Clinical safety laboratory test results must be within the laboratory reference ranges
             for males or test results that are outside the reference ranges for males need to be
             considered non clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator. One retest
             is allowed if deemed appropriate by the investigator.

          3. Liver function tests must meet the following criteria:

               1. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT or alkaline phosphatase (ALP) &lt;1.2x the
                  upper limit of normal (ULN)

               2. Bilirubin not greater than ULN, however documented Gilbert's syndrome is
                  acceptable. One retest is allowed if deemed appropriate by the investigator.

          4. Subject's screening ECG is considered normal or abnormal but clinically
             non-significant. QTcF must not exceed 450 msec. First degree heart block will not be
             considered as a significant abnormality.

          5. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) ≥ 80% of predicted normal for age, gender
             and height at screening.

          6. Discontinuation of all medications (including over-the-counter and/or prescription
             medication, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, vitamins and/or herbal supplements)
             except occasional paracetamol (maximum dose of 2 g/day and maximum of 10 g/2 weeks) at
             least 2 weeks prior to the first study drug administration.

          7. Negative drug and alcohol screen (opiates, methadone, cocaine, amphetamines [including
             ecstasy], cannabinoids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and
             alcohol) prior to dosing.

          8. Able and willing to comply with the prohibitions and restrictions as described in the
             protocol and with the contraceptive requirements as described in the protocol.

          9. Able and willing to sign the ICF as approved by the IEC, prior to any screening
             evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to study drug ingredients or a significant allergic reaction to
             any drug as determined by the investigator, such as anaphylaxis requiring
             hospitalization.

          2. Positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) or history of hepatitis from any cause with the exception of hepatitis A.

          3. History of or a current immunosuppressive condition (e.g., human immunodeficiency
             virus [HIV] infection type 1 and 2).

          4. Clinically significant illness in the 3 months before screening.

          5. Presence or having sequelae of gastrointestinal, liver (except for Gilbert's
             syndrome), kidney (creatinine clearance ≤ 80 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula:
             if calculated result ≤ 80 mL/min, a 24 hour urine collection to determine actual value
             can be done) or other conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion of drugs.

          6. History of malignancy within the past 5 years (except for basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has been treated and with no evidence of recurrence).

          7. Treatment with any drug known to have a well-defined potential for toxicity to a major
             organ in the last 3 months of 5-half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) before
             the initial drug administration.

          8. Active drug or alcohol abuse (an average intake of more than 21 glasses of wine or
             beer or equivalent/week) within 2 years prior to screening.

          9. Participation in a drug, drug/device or biologic investigational research study within
             12 weeks or 5 half-lives of the investigational drug, if the half-life is known
             (whichever is longer) prior to screening.

         10. Any condition or circumstances that in the opinion of the investigator may make a
             subject unlikely or unable to complete the study or comply with study procedures and
             requirements.
