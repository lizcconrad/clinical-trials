  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether channeling purposefully structured resources to
      patients at high risk of developing diabetic complications to interdisciplinary team clinic
      consultations, interspersed with closer remote follow-up and aided by simple technology will
      be more effective than usual care in controlling diabetes mellitus, controlling multiple
      cardiovascular risk factors and reducing clinical event rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of diabetes in Singapore is estimated to grow from 400,000 to 670,000 by 2030
      and an alarming one million by 2050 with the continuing rise in obesity prevalence. The
      current system currently has no formal stratification of patients for channelling of
      structured resources to patients that require more intensive treatment and follow-up (those
      at higher risk of progressing to having complications from diabetes due to poor glycemic
      control, or those who have signs of early complications).

      We will therefore be researching effective health system delivery strategies to improve
      achievement of treatment targets (eg. HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL) and reduce vascular
      complications of diabetes mellitus (retinopathy, proteinuria, end stage renal disease,
      ischemic heart disease). These include:

        -  Stratification and channelling purposefully structured resources to patients with poorly
           controlled diabetes mellitus defined as having an HbA1c &gt;9% on 2 or more occasions, and
           patients with diabetic complications (estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR
           30-60ml/min or proteinuria &gt;0.5g/day or urine microalbumin:creatinine ratio &gt;300mg/g)

        -  Training of all doctors/DNEs/dietitians involved in the counselling of patients in the
           field of motivational interviewing

        -  Providing easy accessibility to resources to allow patients to self-monitor their
           capillary blood glucose and blood pressure in between clinic visits - loaning of blood
           pressure units and glucometers for short (1-2 week) periods regularly

        -  Providing frequent telephone counselling by DNEs and Renal Pharmacists with regards to
           titration of medications, in particular ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers
           to reach treatment targets

        -  Utilisation of social media and smart phone/tablet applications for relevant patients to
           improve and increase patient-healthcare professional interaction with regards to
           diabetes, provide daily bite-sized education via tablet/smart phone media/social media
           and improve compliance to exercise targets

    <description>Patients randomized to the standard care group will receive usual care, which consists of clinic visits 4 monthly for review of BP, HbA1c and other investigations, and titration of medications;counseling with the diabetes nurse educator (DNE), and provision of educational materials on diabetes.</description>

    <description>Patient randomized to the intensive group will receive additional counselling and education by the DNE, medical social worker (MSW) on self-care and coping strategies for diabetes, and see the renal pharmacist for more intensive titration of antihypertensive medication between doctor visits. They will also be loaned blood pressure monitors and glucometers with test strips to perform self-monitoring at home in between outpatient visits. Smartphone and online technologies will be utilized to improve remote monitoring, education and self-care.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>

    <description>Patients are provided with a BP machine, glucometer and test strips, and instructed how to use either a written or smartphone logbook, photograph their meals and use smartphone apps to measure daily activity. DNEs will contact patients in between visits to reinforce adherence and self-monitoring.
MSWs will conduct at least 6 face-to-face sessions, at 3 weeks then less frequently, on essential self-care behaviours in people with diabetes: healthy eating; being physically active; monitoring of blood sugar; compliance with medications; problem-solving; healthy coping skills; and risk-reduction behaviour.
Renal pharmacists will see patients at 2-4 week intervals for 3 months after the first clinic visit, and subsequently every 3-6 months. They will review patient's compliance, laboratory results and home BP, educate patient and titrate antihypertensives to meet BP goal. Physician referrals will be made for severe hypertension or hypotension, or intolerable side effects.</description>
