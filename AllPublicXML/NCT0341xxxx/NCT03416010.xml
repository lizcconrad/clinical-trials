  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this application is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention
      designed to decrease health disparities in pregnant, emotionally distressed, minority women.
      This randomized controlled trial will test a six session (spaced over 18 weeks) cognitive
      behavioral skills building (CBSB) prenatal care intervention (specifically designed and based
      on prior research for pregnant minority women experiencing emotional distress) at two sites
      (Jacobi Medical Center, New York City and The Ohio State University Total Health and Wellness
      Clinic,Columbus, Ohio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will test a cognitive behavioral skills building intervention
      (COPE-P) in Black and Hispanic women experiencing emotional distress in two sites (New York
      and Ohio) to determine if the intervention leads to better health behaviors, better
      psychosocial health (anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms), and improved birth and
      post-natal outcomes in women experiencing emotional distress. Developing scalable prenatal
      interventions designed to improve birth outcomes as well as maternal physical and
      psychosocial health is essential to decrease health disparities in pregnant minority women.

    <time_frame>Timepoint 0 (Baseline at screening), T1 = 31 gestational weeks, T2= 6-8 week postpartum visit, T3 = at 6 month well baby visit</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy Lifestyle Beliefs Scale survey will be administered at each of the in-person meetings. This scale taps beliefs about various facets of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This 16-item is scored on a five point Likert-type scale that ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree. The higher the score the higher the beliefs of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.</description>

    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7) is a 7-item survey which measures anxiety will be administered at each of the in-person meetings. The GAD-7 is a 7-item, 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from (0) Not at all to (3). Scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating greater functional impairment related to the patient's experience of anxiety. A score greater than or equal to 10 indicates moderate and higher anxiety and will be used in this study,</description>

    <description>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a scale measuring stress will be administered at each of the in-person meetings. This scale is a standardized measure of global stress designed to elicit the degree to which respondents find their lives unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloading (three central components of stress). A score of 20 or greater is the high stress cut-off and will be used in this study.</description>

    <description>The Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale survey will be administered at each of the in-person meetings. Participants respond to each of the 15 items (e.g., I exercised regularly; I talked about my worries) on a 5-point Likert-type scale that ranges from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree. The higher the score the higher the healthy lifestyle behaviors are practiced.</description>

    <time_frame>Timepoint 0 (Baseline at screening), T1 = 31 gestational weeks, T2= 6-8 week postpartum visit, T3 = at 6 month well baby visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a scale measuring depressive symptoms will be administered at each of the in-person meetings. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is a 10 item self-report perinatal depression questionnaire. The scale asks participants to describe how they have felt in the previous week. Unlike other depression screening tools, the EPDS excludes questions regarding somatic symptoms of pregnancy and has been found to be equivalent to a structured interview in determining prevalence of depression. Scores range from 0-30 with higher scores signifying higher severity of depressive symptoms. A cut-off score of 10 on the EPDS will be used in this study to indicate moderate depressive symptoms.</description>
