  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to implement Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) at selected facilities in Addis
      Ababa and Oromia Regions to achieve high effective coverage in the catchment population.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To achieve the objective summarized above, the investigators will engage in an iterative
      process using program learning and quantitative data to continuously improve models in order
      to enhance uptake of KMC in two phases.

      In phase 1, the model will undergo an iterative process whereby every three months, the
      investigators will analyze the data collected and improve the model until it is reached at a
      model that achieves effective KMC coverage of at least 80%.

      In phase 2, we will scale the successful model to all selected facilities.

      The investigators' primary outcomes will be effective coverage of KMC at 7 days of age, and
      effective coverage of KMC at 7 days after discharge from the facility. Effective coverage
      will be defined as adoption of skin to skin care for at 8 least hours and exclusive
      breastfeeding in the 24 hours prior to assessment
