      As patients improve on one parametric result, the results on the other parametric may worsen,
      but the total score may not be affected. For this reason, it would be useful to make
      measurements that evaluate all the parameters of the patients. Thus, it would be more
      advantageous to score both pain and symptoms separately, as well as activity limitations.
      Therefore, neck specific surveys are needed to meet this need.

      For this reason, this study was planned to determine the validity of the questionnaire named
      &quot;Profile Fitness Mapping Neck Questionnaire&quot; in patients with neck pain.

      The translation of the original version of &quot;Profile Fitness Mapping Neck Questionnaire&quot; to
      Turkish will be translated by two independent professional translators. Afterwards, a person
      without a medical history and a native English speaker will be translated into English again.
      Once the translation stages are complete, the translators will be brought together to discuss
      the two versions of the questionnaire. Then the final state will be translated into the main
      language of the questionnaire and the compliance will be checked.

      First of all, people who have been suffering from low back pain for at least six months will
      complete the &quot;Profile Fitness Mapping NeckQuestionnaire&quot;, &quot;Neck Disability Index&quot;, &quot;SF-36
      health related quality of life questionnaire&quot; and &quot;Visual Analog Scale&quot;.

      Seven days after the questionnaire, the &quot;Profile Fitness Mapping Neck Questionnaire&quot; will be
      completed again.
