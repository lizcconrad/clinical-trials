  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, phase II study of intravenous (IV) SHR-1210 at 200mg,q2w
      in combination with Apatinib at one dose (375mg). Comparison of 3 different dose schedules in
      subjects with extensive-stage disease small cell lung cancer. SHR-1210 is a humanized
      monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a new kind of selective
      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

      The study is composed of two parts. Part 1 of the study will determine the safety and
      tolerability of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib in first 6 subjects of each arm. Part 2
      of the study will determine the safety and efficacy of SHR-1210 in combination with Apatinib
      in 45 subjects of each arm.
