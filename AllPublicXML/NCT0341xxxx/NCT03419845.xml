  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For some patients with mobility issues, a walking frame (commonly known as a zimmer frame -
      trademark of Zimmer Holdings), is provided to keep them on their feet and help them remain
      more independent in their home and when out and about. When patients are given the walking
      frame, they are given information on how to use it safely to protect them from hurting
      themselves. For a small group of patients, using the walking frame is difficult, and they
      will have a fall because they are unable to use the frame safely. For these patients, a fear
      of falling can then develop and they can then have more falls. It is thought that these falls
      with the walking frame happen because the patient steps too far into the frame, making them
      unstable. We have made an attachment for a standard walking frame, which we are calling the
      Step Right Buddy, that we think will help improve the stability of patients who step too far
      into the frame. We have attached a detachable elasticated band across the back legs of the
      frame to make patients aware that they have stepped far enough into the frame, to stop them
      stepping any further. In order to develop this further, we need to understand how people feel
      using this adapted frame and whether there are any new risks to the user.

      The investigators propose to ask patients who are considered to be at risk of falling because
      of the way they use their walking frame if they would like to use the adapted walking frame
      in their home, instead of their standard frame, for a week. At the end of this week,
      investigators will spend up to an hour with this patient, talking with them about their
      experience of the adapted walking frame, in order to understand things such as how they felt
      using the frame, were they more or less fearful of using it than their usual frame, did they
      think they were going to fall over more or less often, do they think they fall more or less
      often. In addition to this, patients will keep a written record of when they thought they
      nearly fell, or when they had an injury whilst using the adapted walking frame. This
      information will be used to explore whether or not the adaption to the frame introduces new
      risks to patients.

      Title: A pilot investigation into frequent fallers' experiences of an adapted walking frame,
      designed to reduce the walking aid's associated falls risk.

      Short title: The Walker Study

      Chief Investigator: Dr Sarahjane Jones

      Objectives:

      To qualitatively explore the user's experience of the Step Right Buddy after a one week pilot
      trial and to assess the introduction of new risks to the patient as a result of the
      adaptation.

      Trial configuration:

      Qualitatively assessed clinical trial of a novel product.

      Setting: Community care - patient homes.

      Sample size: 20

      Description of intervention: Application of the Step Right Buddy to the standard walking
      frame for patients to use as normal at home for one week.

      Study duration:

      Project length: March 2017 - July 2017

      Length of participation - 1 week from consent

      Randomisation and blinding: Single arm, open trial

      Outcome measures: Participants' experiences of using the Step Right Buddy and adverse event
      data.

      Analysis techniques: Framework analysis of textual data regarding the participants
      experiences and, where appropriate, root cause analysis of adverse events.

    <description>The Step Right Buddy, which is under investigation in this clinical study, is an elasticated band that attached by Velcro to the back legs of a standard walking frame. The purpose of the Step Right Buddy is to provide sensory feedback to standard walking frame users of how far to step in to the frame and to encourage them to move the frame forward.</description>
