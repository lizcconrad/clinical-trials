  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-phase research plan will develop and test a culturally relevant, web-based patient
      education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare. The intervention aims to empower Chinese
      cancer patients to effectively communicate with different providers in different healthcare
      settings.

      This two-phase study develops and tests the usability and efficacy of a culturally relevant,
      web-based patient education program, hereafter known as E-Talkcare, in improving Chinese
      immigrant breast cancer survivors' competence, perceived control, and self-efficacy in cancer
      care communication (intermediate outcomes), and patient-reported symptoms, adherence to
      breast cancer survivorship care guidelines, and quality of life (distal outcomes) versus the
      usual care control arm. In Phase I, we will use community-based participatory research (CBPR)
      principles to develop the intervention to educate participants about culture and
      communication by demonstrating how to ask for and verify information with doctors and use
      personalized symptom reports, and by providing question prompt lists for doctor visits. In
      Phase II, we will test the intervention in a pilot randomized control trial (RCT). Using Los
      Angeles cancer registry cases, we will enroll and randomize 118 Chinese immigrant women
      (diagnosed with stage 0-III breast cancer and 1-3 years post-diagnosis) to either the
      E-Talkcare intervention or a usual care control arm. We will conduct telephone interviews at
      baseline (i.e., pre-randomization), 3-, and 6-months post-randomization.

    <description>Women in the intervention group will receive the E-Talkcare web address, a user name, and a temporary password. The participant will be able to read or listen (through audio narration) to instructions on how to complete the intervention in order, though she can freely navigate between web modules. Each module will have an ever-present indicator (showing users' progress) and a link to for users to continue navigating through modules.We will ask participants to complete the full intervention within 3 months after intervention delivery and then complete a 3-month post-randomization interview (T1). The website will remain open for six months after intervention delivery to allow participants to use QPL if they wish. A 6-month post-randomization interview (T2) will then be administered.</description>

    <description>Survivors randomized to the usual care group will receive care from their doctors as usual, allowing us to compare the intervention against real-world practice to inform next steps. Since we do not know if the intervention will be efficacious, we decided not to provide a delayed intervention to control participants.</description>
