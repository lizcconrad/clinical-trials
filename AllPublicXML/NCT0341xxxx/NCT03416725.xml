  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tympanoplasty is the surgical operation performed for the reconstruction of the eardrum
      and/or the ossicles. Tympanoplasty is classified into five different types, originally
      described by Horst Ludwig Wullstein. 1,2 Type 1 involves repair of the tympanic membrane
      alone, when the middle ear is normal. A type 1 tympanoplasty is synonymous to myringoplasty,
      Type 2 involves repair of the tympanic membrane and middle ear in spite of slight defects in
      the middle ear ossicles, Type 3 when mallus and incus are absent graft place directly on
      stapes head., Type 4 describes a repair when the stapes foot plate is movable, but the crura
      are missing. The resulting middle ear will only consist of the Eustachian tube and
      hypotympanum, Type 5 is a repair involving a fixed stapes footplate.

      There are various prognostic factors reported in the literature that may influence the
      surgical success of tympanoplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some studies report significance for some of these factors whereas others report the
      contrary. The reported incidence of surgical success of tympanoplasty ranges from 60% to 99%
      in adults Belluci described four separate stages for prognosis of tympanoplasty 4 according
      to otorrhea

      . Austin proposed a prognostic stratification according to disease categories, stage
      categories, and disease descriptors.

      Black introduced the surgical, prosthetic, infection, tissues, and eustachian tube system
      (SPITE), and more recently Kartush developed middle ear risk index (MERI).

      Smoking is added as a middle ear risk. Furthermore, cholesteatoma and granulation tissue or
      effusion risk value has been increased in MERI 2001.

      Prognostic factors such as age, sex, presence of systemic diseases, location and size of
      perforation, duration of dry period, presence of myringosclerosis, presence of septal and
      conchal pathology, operation type, and status of the opposite ear and middle ear risk index
      were investigated. 9

    <description>Each risk parameter will take a numerical value; Ear discharge: 0-3, Perforation: 0-2, Cholesteotoma: 0-2, Ossicular chain status: 0-4, Middle ear granulation and history of previous surgery: 0-2.
