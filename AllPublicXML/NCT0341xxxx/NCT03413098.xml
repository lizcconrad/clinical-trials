      This investigation is a prospective, non randomized, non blinded study. This investigation is
      designed to evaluate the performance, comfort and ease of use with the F&amp;P trial nasal mask
      amongst Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) patients.

      Visit 1 will involve the participants consented in to the trial. Visit 2 will involve the
      participants being fitted with the F&amp;P trial nasal mask for use in-home.

      The participant will then come in to return the mask (Visit Three) and have a final
      interview, this ensures the maximum time participants will be exposed to the trial mask in
      home will be 14 ± 4 days from visit two.

      The mask will be returned to the Institution at the conclusion of the trial and the
      participant will return to their previous mask. The Institution will recruit all patients
      within 1 week of the beginning of the study.
