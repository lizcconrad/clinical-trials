    <textblock>
      The proposed project will examine how exercise counteracts metabolic disorders and type 2
      diabetes through regulating gene expression. The project is highly relevant to public health
      because of the global pandemic of diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic syndromes as
      well as the well-known metabolic benefit of physical exercise in correcting these disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, and exerts its beneficial effects not
      only by burning off energy but also by causing prolonged metabolic changes through changing
      gene expression. Genes are our genetic materials and the expression of genes determines our
      biology. In our previous study in animals, we identified some factors that drive
      exercise-induced gene expression changes. Here we would like to address whether the result is
      also true in human. This work will provide molecular insights into how exercise remodels our
      metabolism and will potentially find a way to maximize the benefit we get from physical
      exercise.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acute exercise activate certain molecular
      factors in human skeletal muscle. Participants will be asked to undergo an acute bout of
      aerobic exercise at ~ moderate intensity for about 2 hours. Before and after the exercise,
      the participants will undergo a muscle biopsy. The muscle tissues will be used for total RNA
      extraction and RT-qPCR analysis of genes that include but are not limited to de facto
      JunD/AP-1 target genes and will also be analyzed by Jun D Chip-qPCT to assess binding of Jun
      D on its de facto target genes.
