  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has become important risk factors for threatening human life and health. Lower
      extremity arterial occlusive are the common complications of diabetes.Sulfur amino acid is
      the indispensable amino acid in mammals, and its metabolites include Taurine, Hydrogen
      sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Taurine was first isolated more than 150 years ago
      from ox (Taurus) bile. Although the taurine can be synthesized in vivo by cysteine in the
      presence of cysteine dioxygenase, it is mainly acquired from dietary sources, such as eggs,
      meat, and seafood. H2S is a biologically relevant mediator and plays potential roles in
      several physiological processes and disease states in the body. H2S is synthesized from 2
      sulfur-containing amino acids, l-cysteine andl-methionine, by the 3
      enzymes,cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-β-synthetase(CBS), and3-mercaptopyruvate
      sulfurtransferase (3-MST). Previous studies have demonstrated that Taurine and H2S may play
      important roles in the development of the microangiopathy and lower extremity arterial
      occlusive.
