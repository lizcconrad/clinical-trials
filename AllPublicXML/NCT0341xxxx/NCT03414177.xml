  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct a 12-month randomized trial with 84 pediatric patients (aged 6-18
      years) with persistent asthma to compare outcomes among patients with follow-up visits
      managed via telemedicine (TM) vs. in-person (IP) visits.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis is that utilization of TM for asthma follow-up will result in
      improved clinical outcomes such as Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, lung function and
      medication adherence compared to participants receiving IP follow-up care. The Investigator
      also hypothesize that TM follow-up will result in higher caregiver satisfaction because
      families will be able to receive quality subspecialty care in their community (TM) compared
      to those who travel a distance to receive care (IP).
