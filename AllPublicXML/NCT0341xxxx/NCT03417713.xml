  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect feedback on imaging guidance adequacy from physicians
      who use the OEC™ Elite CFD Mobile Fluoroscopy System—Motorized Configuration to perform
      surgical procedures for which the use of mobile fluoroscopy is prescribed per standard of
      care.

      Up to 40 eligible subjects will be enrolled and have their clinically indicated procedure
      completed using the investigational device.

      Following completion of each subject's procedure, the investigators will complete a User
      Survey specific to the workflow and guidance adequacy of the OEC Elite device. The survey
      will consist of a series of questions on the use of the system as well as anonymized image
      data.

      After all subjects' procedures are completed at a given site, the site investigator will
      review survey data from the study subjects enrolled at the site and document his/her
      assessment of the overall acceptability of the system for use in a clinical environment.

      There is no statistical hypothesis being tested in this study. Results will be summarized
      using descriptive statistics.
