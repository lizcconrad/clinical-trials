  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PACE-Mobil-PBL is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The aim is to investigate the
      effect of a multimodal and exercise-based intervention among older patients with advanced
      pancreatic cancer, biliary tract cancer, or lung cancer during treatment with first-line
      palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy.

      The hypotheses: That the multimodal intervention will increase or maintain physical function
      levels and strength, reduce symptoms and side-effects, improve quality of life, reduce
      treatment-related complications and hospital admissions, and reduce risk of cancer cachexia
      and sarcopenia.

    <description>The multimodal and exercise-based intervention is comprised of:
Supervised and group-based exercise two times a week (60 minutes per session). The program consists of warm-up, exercises for balance and flexibility, progressive resistance training, and stretching and relaxation.
Individualized activity program based on step counts (with activity tracker). Based on each participant's starting point, preferences and motivation, an individualized program will be composed. Evaluation and goal-setting will be conducted once weekly.
Nurse-led supportive and motivational counseling; each participant will be invited to two sessions of counseling (in week 1 + 6). Each session will be based on a holistic assessment of each participant's life situation. Advice and counseling will be provided based on identified problems and needs.
A nutritional supplement (protein bar or drink) will be served to participants immediately after the supervised exercise session.</description>
