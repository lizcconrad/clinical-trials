  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry aims to collect informations about patients with endocrine tumors (Thyroid,
      Parathyroid, Adrenal, Endocrine Pancreas, Endocrine Digestive Tube) who undergo endocrine
      surgical procedures. This registry is part of the Eurocrine Project.

      The EUROCRINE project aims to decrease morbidity and mortality of rare endocrine tumours, by
      means of a pan-European database. Recording and accessing data at the European level, makes
      it possible to identify these tumours, which cannot be distinguished at local or national
      level, because of their extreme rarity. Dissemination of results aims to raise clinical
      standards and reduce differences in practise between clinics and member states, and thereby
      diminish morbidity and mortality. Comparison of practice and outcomes will be especially
      interesting for centres wanting to improve their standards to what is currently considered
      best practice. EUROCRINE will be a key means by which the medical profession, researchers,
      health policy makers, and not least patients, can benefit from an increase in knowledge
      related to diagnosis, treatment, and future clinical research in the field of rare endocrine
      tumours.
