  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The autonomic nervous system plays an important role in controlling the circulation.
      Increased sympathetic activity has detrimental effects in patients with heart failure.

      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that combined angiotensin receptor +
      neprilysin inhibition results in lower sympathetic activity than angiotensin receptor
      inhibition alone.

      Thirty-five heart-failure patients will be included in a prospective, monocentric,
      active-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study with randomized sequence of treatments
      sacubitril+valsartan or valsartan alone. After open-label dose finding and washout patients
      will be randomly assigned to the treatment sequence [sac+val --&gt; val] or [val --&gt; sac+val].
      The two treatment periods of 4 weeks duration will be separated by 2 weeks of washout. At the
      end of both treatments the state of the cardiovascular system and its control will be
      measured.
