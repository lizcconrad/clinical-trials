  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A health care initiative will be implemented December 4, 2017 in the Newborn Intensive Care
      (NICU) setting in an attempt to reduce the length of stay (LOS) for premature infants after
      standardizing the definition and approach to a clinically significant cardiopulmonary event
      (CSCPE). We would like to compare LOS in infants born &lt; 30 weeks gestation before and after
      standardization to see if LOS is reduced.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LOS of infants born &lt; 30 weeks prior to implementation of the standardized definition of
      a CSCPE (11/30/2015-11/30/2017) will be compared to the LOS for all infants who meet the
      inclusion criteria and born &lt; 30 weeks from 6/1/2018 - 12/31/20. Data collection will begin
      June 1,2018, seven months after implementing the CSCPE definition. This will allow time for
      the nursing staff, the physicians and nurse practitioners to become familiar with the new
      CSCPE definition and management.

      Following implementation of the new definition, the researchers will also do a 6 month audit
      on nursing response to a CSCPE based on the current alarm settings. Initially we do not plan
      to change the alarm limits but we may find the lower alarm limits for heart rate and oxygen
      saturation are set too high and may need to be lowered to more accurately assist nurses in
      recognizing when an infant is having a CSCPE. If the 6 month audit shows nurses are &quot;missing&quot;
      a CSCPE because the current lower alarm limits are set too high, or stimulating an infant
      inappropriately too early, the alarm limits will be changed at every bedside. If the alarm
      limits are reset, data collection will begin 6 months after the alarms are changed. This is
      expected to be starting 1/1/2019 and conclude 12/31/20. If it is decided the lower alarm
      limits will not need to be changed, data collection will begin 6/1/2018 and conclude 8/31/20
      instead of 12/31/20.
