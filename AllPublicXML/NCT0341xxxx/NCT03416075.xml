        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. They were clearly diagnosed as interstitial lung disease in hospital;

          2. They had progressive worsening of dyspnea and their oxygenation indexes were less than
             300 in ICU;

          3. They received at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation after being admitted into
             ICU.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We excluded patients who were admitted into ICU because of postoperative monitoring.
