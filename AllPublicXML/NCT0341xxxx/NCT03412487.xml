      25 women with Premature Ovarian Failure who attended Fayoum university hospital gynecology
      outpatient clinic (case group) and another group of 25 women with normal ovarian function
      (control group).Pelvic laparoscopy and ovarian biopsy To be examined histologically. All
      procedures were performed under general anesthesia the utero-ovarian ligament was stabilized
      with the round biopter introduced through the other. The round metal biopter 5 mm in diameter
      with an inner protective trocar.

      The tip of the biopsy instrument was placed on an area of the ovary free of cysts; the hilar
      area was avoided because it is deficient in small follicles. After correct placement was
      verified, the inner protecting trocar was removed to expose the sharp leading edge of the
      round sheath. Gentle circular movements were made cutting through the ovarian cortex to
      produce a 5-mm disk of 2-3 mm in thickness. The round biopter was removed, and a grasper was
      introduced to recover the excised tissue.

      Ovarian biopsy specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin forming tissue
      blocks. Two sections, 4Î¼ thick were cut from each block. One was stained with routine
      haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain while the other was immunostained with anti-Leukocyte
      Common Antigen (LCA).

      For assessment of autoimmune oophoritis, sections were immunostained with anti-LCA (CD45)
      monoclonal antibody
