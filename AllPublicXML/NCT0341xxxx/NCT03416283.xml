  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 3-arm randomized pilot trial aimed at comparing the effectiveness of different remote
      approaches to improving blood pressure (BP) control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to leverage the Way to Health (WTH) platform to develop and evaluate a
      new HTN service-delivery model that is integrated with routine clinical care at Penn Family
      Care (PFC), an academic family medicine practice in West Philadelphia. Among patients with
      poorly controlled HTN:

        1. The investigators will assess the effects of monitoring blood pressure and medication
           adherence with feedback to the patient and to the clinical practice, as needed if out of
           control.

        2. The investigators will also compare the impact of providing feedback to a social support
           partner with facilitated cheerleading.
