      Lights4Violence aims to promote adolescents' capabilities to improve their intimate
      relationships with peers through different participation approach activities. In order to do
      that, it is planned to perform a longitudinal quasi-experimental educational intervention
      study with a quantitative evaluation in 5 different cities: Alicante (Spain), Cardiff (UK),
      Porto (Portugal), Iasi (Romania) and Lublin (Poland) between 2018 and 2019.

      DESIGN: Longitudinal quasi-experimental educational intervention study with a quantitative
      evaluation.

      PILOT STUDY (June - July of 2018): Prior to the implementation of the program in the whole
      sample, an evaluation pilot study will be carried out with a minimum of 20 adolescents (10
      boys and 10 girls) who are finishing the same grade as those who will later receive the
      intervention in August-September 2018. This pilot study focuses on:

        -  Determining the competencies and capacities of the participants to carry out the on-line
           questionnaire.

        -  Calculating the time it takes the students to complete the questionnaire

        -  Carrying out an internal validation of the questionnaire (that is, are there different
           responses to similar questions?) among the study population by calculating internal
           consistency and validity indices.

      The obtained results will be shared among the members of the consortium in order to evaluate
      possible adaptations considered necessary.

      PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of students will be assigned either an intervention or control
      condition, respectively. The intervention group will be composed of boys and girls aged 13
      years or more, studying in secondary schools in the city. The control group will be made up
      of students from other centers with similar socioeconomic characteristics (relating to social
      characteristics and school location) to the centers. The evaluation survey will be given to a
      total of 300 students per country, 120 to 150 from the intervention group and 150 from the
      control group.

      The schools selection will be carried out by contacting different secondary education centers
      from the city as considered appropriate by the members of the research team (non-random
      sample). The program contents will be presented and the possibility to participate will be
      offered. The intervention group will be selected from among the students whose centers accept
      participation in the study. The control group will be made up of students from secondary
      education centers with social characteristics similar to the centers that will be implement
      the intervention. The students from the control and the intervention groups will have the
      same composition in terms of age, sex and academic course. It is recommended that the control
      and intervention groups belong to different educational centers in order to avoid
      contamination. It should be mentioned that this is a wait-list control study, that is, those
      centers that participate in the project as a part of the control group should be offered the
      possibility of participating in teacher training, access to guides and manuals generated by
      the project as well as carrying out the intervention in the future (i.e., when the
      intervention is finished in the intervention group) with Lights4Violence researchers' support
      if the participants consider it necessary and the research team have the capacity to do it.

    <intervention_model_description>Longitudinal quasi-experimental educational intervention study. The evaluation will be carried out using an on-line questionnaire distributed to an intervention and a control groups at three time periods: before starting the program (Baseline, time 0 or T0), after finishing the study - including the dissemination phase - (time 1 or T1) and six months after implementation (time 2 or T2). In addition, a process evaluation will be carried out with the intervention group.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Attitudes against sexism</measure>
    <time_frame>1-6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Ambivalent Sexism Inventory, a 22-item self-report measure of sexism. Respondents indicate their level of agreement, on a 6-point Likert-type scale, with various statements. It is composed of two sub-scales that may be independently calculated for sub-scale scores or may be averaged for an overall composite sexism score. The first sub-scale is the hostile sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items designed to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of dominative paternalism, competitive gender differentiation, and heterosexual hostility, as previously defined. The second sub-scale is the benevolent sexism scale, which is composed of 11 items that aim to assess an individual's position on the dimensions of protective paternalism, complementary gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy.</description>

    <description>Aggression Questionnaire-Refined measures four aspects of aggression: Physical Aggression and Verbal Aggression, which involve hurting or harming others and represent the instrumental or motor component of behavior; Hostility, which consists of feelings of ill-will and injustice and represents the cognitive component of behavior; and Anger, which involves physiological arousal and preparation for aggression and represents the emotional or affective component of behavior.</description>

    <description>The Maudsley Violence Questionnaire measures a range of cognitions, relating to violent behavior, drawn from clinical and theoretical perspectives. This measure integrates justification of violence in response to threatened self-esteem and the legitimization of violence as central elements. Participants are asked to rate as True or False a series of statements. The scale is comprised of two factors: 'machismo' (42 items) and 'acceptance of violence' (14 items).</description>

    <measure>Problem Solving capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>1-6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Problem-Solving Inventory-Revised Scale is scale of 25 items. Items are answered in a 5-point Likert-type scale, from &quot;this is not true&quot; to &quot;extremely true&quot;. Items are distributed in five sub-scales (5 items in each subscale) that evaluate functional and dysfunctional aspects of the ability to problem solve. The functional dimension is evaluated through two sub-scales: Positive Problem Orientation and Rational Problem Resolution; while the dysfunctional dimension is evaluated through the sub-scales Negative Problem Orientation, Avoidance Style and Impulsivity/Carelessness Style. These five dimensions allow obtaining a total score that corresponds to a general estimation of the ability to solve problems, in addition to the average scores in each of the dimensions.</description>

Respondents rate how well several statements describe them, on a 5-point Likert type scale from &quot;does not describe me well&quot; to &quot;describes me very well&quot;.</description>
