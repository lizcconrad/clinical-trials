  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the safety, including potential dose limiting toxicities, of
      ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ T cells and the duration of in vivo survival of ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ T cells in
      patients with relasped/refractory B-cell lymphoma. For patients with detectable disease, the
      study will also measure anti-tumor responses after ET190L1-ARTEMIS™ cell infusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ET190L-ARTEMIS™ is a novel chimeric T-cell therapy platform that in preclinical studies,
      functionally matches the efficacy of CAR T cells, but dramatically reduces the release of
      cytokines upon killing of target-positive tumors.
