  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if the use of patient-specific custom cutting blocks for implantation of total
      knee components results in improved limb alignment and component positioning compared to
      regular instrumentation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to have their knee
      implanted using either the patient-specific custom cutting blocks or the regular
      instrumentation system. Functional and radiographic outcomes will be assessed in a blinded
      fashion. The Smith and Nephew Legion PrimaryÂ® total knee system will be used in both groups;
      this is an implant with a good long term track record based on the Genesis II design. All
      surgeons have used and are familiar with the regular instrumentation. They will be instructed
      in the use of the patient-specific custom cutting blocks prior to study initiation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is male or female ages 18 and over.

          2. Patient is having primary total knee replacement

          3. Patient is willing to sign the informed consent and to come for all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Deformity of the femur preventing use of the intra-medullary guide utilized in the
             regular instrumentation set.

          2. Necessity for the use of constrained implants. These types of implants have
             intra-medullary stems, therefore all bone cuts need to be referenced off
             intramedullary guides, making image guided bone cuts inappropriate.

          3. Patients undergoing knee replacement revision surgery. Theses types of implants also
             have stems, making the use of image guided bone cuts inappropriate for the same
             reasons.

          4. Patients scheduled for bilateral knee surgery (simultaneous or staged)
