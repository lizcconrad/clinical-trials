  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that the current design and content provided by most biomedical research
      informed consent documents do not consistently meet the expectations researchers place on
      them to effectively inform research participants of information thought to be most important
      in facilitating their ability to make informed decisions about participation. The need for
      revisions to the informed consent document design is supported by empirical research.This
      pilot study will examine the effectiveness of the New Executive and Appendix Template (NEAT)
      form when used in the consent process for individuals participating in the Atherosclerosis
      Risk in Communities (ARIC) Neurocognitive Study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The importance of informed consent is to ensure that participants in clinical research are
      provided the opportunity to make autonomous choices is a paramount ethical premise in human
      research. The effectiveness of consent document design and consent process to accurately and
      fully convey the elements of informed consent is critical and deserves further study.
      Development of an improved informed consent document design for clinical studies would be a
      valuable contribution to human research. Chunking sentences or phrases in text into related
      groupings resulted in a positive significant improvement in reading comprehension among
      students with poor reading skills. Because the information contained in consent documents can
      be complex, detailed, and novel for potential research participants, the use of a modified
      form of chunking may be an effective and a low cost way of improving comprehension of the
      elements of consent. Specifically, the primary objective of the study is to determine if
      participants who receive the NEAT form report greater comprehension at the end of the consent
      process, than participants who receive a standard form.

    <description>Following the consent process, participants will be administered the Comprehension tool to measure their comprehension. The summary scores will be used to address the primary aim of whether or not the NEAT consent form improves participant comprehension. There are 7 questions, each question is rated 0-2 with a total scale of 0-14. Higher values denotes better outcomes.</description>

This is made up of IRB-approved wording from the regular consent form. More detailed information, such as specific clinic measures are provided as additional material and are discussed during the consent process after the general overview has been provided with the NEAT form.</description>
