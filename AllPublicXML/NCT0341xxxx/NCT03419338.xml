    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of newly forming bone graft (NFB) in the
      gain of bone volume in sinus lift procedures. For that, it will be compared the tomographic
      bone gain 6 months after surgery between a group that received inorganic bovine bone alone
      (n=8) and a group that received inorganic bovine bone associated with NFB (n=8).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of newly forming bone graft (NFB) in the
      gain of bone volume in sinus lift procedures. It will be recruited for this study individuals
      25-60 years of age, both genders, presenting a missing tooth at an upper premolar or molar
      region with 2-9 mm of remaining bone between alveolar ridge crest and sinus floor and the
      existence of an edentulous ridge or at least one tooth condemned to extraction. Sinus will be
      treated by NFB mixed to inorganic bovine bone - IBB (test; n= 8) or IBB (control; n= 8). The
      volume of bone tissue will be evaluated by computerized tomography obtained at baseline
      examination and 6 months after surgery. After this period, biopsies of hard tissue will be
      obtained during implant placement for histologic and histomorphometric analysis.
