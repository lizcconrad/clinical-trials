  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep is critical to human health, but insufficient and disrupted sleep caused by sleep apnea
      are common and have a major impact on brain health. However, there is still much that is not
      known about how sleep apnea damages the brain and what can be done to fix this. The Brain
      Changes in Sleep Apnea Study will look at the brain health of people with severe sleep apnea
      both before and after 4 months of treatment with a CPAP machine. Pre- and post-CPAP
      treatment, 80 participants with severe sleep apnea will undergo cognitive testing, blood and
      urine tests, a pulse wave velocity test, and an MRI. Also pre- and post-CPAP treatment,
      participants will wear a blood pressure monitor for 24 hours, wear an accelerometer watch for
      7 days to track the duration and quality of their sleep, and wear a device for 1 night of
      sleep to assess their breathing and blood oxygen levels. It is expected that there will be
      improvements in participants' brain health after 4 months of CPAP treatment.

      Between January 2018 and February 2020, the Brain Changes in Sleep Apnea Study will recruit
      80 adults with newly diagnosed severe sleep apnea attending the sleep clinics at Sunnybrook
      Health Sciences Centre (n=40) or the University of Edinburgh (n=40). Participants will
      undergo home-based assessment with 3 wearable devices (24 hours of ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring, 7 days of actigraphy to assess sleep duration and fragmentation, and 1 night of
      finger-probe peripheral arterial tonometry and oximetry to assess cardiorespiratory
      physiology including sleep apnea), completion of a sleep and health questionnaire, 24-hour
      collection of urine for assessing sympathetic nervous system activity, blood banking for
      endothelial biomarkers, cognitive evaluation, pulse wave velocity test, and an MRI of the
      brain, at 2 time points: 1) after initial polysomnographic diagnosis of sleep apnea but
      before the initiation of CPAP, and 2) after 4 months of CPAP treatment.

    <description>Participants will undergo 3-Tesla MRI. Scan time will be about 1 hour and 15 minutes per subject per session at the Sunnybrook site. The protocol is designed to image SVD burden by quantifying PVS and WMH volumes, and image various physiological estimates on the brain.
Participants will undergo the following cognitive tests: Behavioural Neurology Assessment‐R (BNA-R), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and BrainScreen.
Blood samples will be assayed for inflammatory and endothelial function. Classical vascular risk factors will also be assessed. Once data collection is complete, DNA will be extracted from the frozen PBMC fraction and will be genotyped for APOE genotype and a panel of other single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with cognition and cerebrovascular disease.</description>

      Phlebotomy will be performed following an overnight fast, and samples will be banked for
      assessment of cytokines and endothelial biomarkers. Blood samples (25-30 ml) will be
      collected in plasma vacutainer tubes. Plasma will be separated and preserved in a freezer.
      The peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction will also be kept in a freezer for
      genetic evaluation. All samples will be de-identified and preserved at -80oC and assayed
      together in a batch after the collection of the last sample (in 2020). Samples will be
      assayed for inflammatory and endothelial function by ELISA. Classical vascular risk factors
      will also be assessed.
