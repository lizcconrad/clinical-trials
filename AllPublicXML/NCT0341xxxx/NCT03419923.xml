    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to assess three anticoagulation strategies for intermittent
      hemodialysis(IHD) in patients at risk of hemorrhage. A registry of consecutive hemodialysis
      patients with high risk of hemorrhage were conducted at the Guangdong General Hospital, the
      First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, the Second Affiliated
      Hospital of Guangzhou Medicine University or Guangzhou Hospital of Chinese Medicine, between
      October 1st, 2017 and June 30th,2018. In this multi-center prospective and randomized study,
      participants were randomly divided into three groups during IHD according to different
      anticoagulation, including with regular saline flushes, one stage regional citrate
      anticoagulation (RCA) and two-stage RCA.

      Briefly, there are two parts in this study. The first part of the study is to compare
      two-stage RCA with regular saline flushes during IHD, and the second part is to compare
      two-stage RCA with one stage RCA, with estimated total procedures, 48 and 78, respectively.
      The primary clinical end point was serious clotting in either arterial bubble trap, venous
      bubble trap or dialyzer through study completion. The secondary clinical end point is the
      venous pressure higher than 200mmHg or two fold compared to beginning continually for more
      than 5 minutes through study procedure.Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, blood
      pressure, hemoglobin and dialysis parameters, were collected.
