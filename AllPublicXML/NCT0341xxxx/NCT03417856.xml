  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ichthyosis is a group of genetic skin disorders that present with dry, thickened, scaly, or
      flaky skin. As of today, there is no cure or treatment. Doctors can only treat the dry skin
      with different types of emollients to soften the scale. A deeper understanding of this
      disease is required to develop better treatments. There are different types of cells and
      cell-produced signals (biomarkers) that are being studied in order to help find these new
      treatments. Looking at biomarkers has been successful in helping us to understand other skin
      disorders better. The purpose of this study is to determine which blood and skin biomarkers
      characterize ichthyosis.

      Hypothesis: We predict that the biomarkers correlating with disease activity in Netherton
      syndrome will be different than the biomarkers found to correlate with the lamellar and other
      ichthyosis phenotype.

      Objectives:

        1. To define a panel of skin and blood biomarkers associated with disease activity and
           pruritus in Netherton syndrome, lamellar ichthyosis, and other ichthyosis subtypes.

        2. To determine if blood samples can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and
           will correlate with disease severity.

        3. To determine FLG, SPINK5, TGM1, or other mutation via buccal/saliva samples in
           ichthyosis subjects

        4. To determine differences in alterations of epidermal lipids and proteins in the outer
           stratum corneum of epidermis collected from tape strips in patients with ichthyosis
           compared to the general population. There will also be a difference detected in
           epidermal lipids from blood samples.

        150 subjects (1 year to 60 years of age) with diagnosis of Netherton Syndrome or ichthyosis
        will be enrolled. Approximately 50 healthy controls will be enrolled. The blood sample,
        skin biopsy, and buccal/saliva sample may be obtained from the same ichthyosis subject.
        However there will be separate groups of control patients for the skin biopsies and blood
        sample studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Control and ichthyosis subjects may be of either sex and must be between 1-60 years of
             age at the time of enrollment

          -  Ichthyosis subjects include individuals with a diagnosis Netherton syndrome, lamellar
             ichthyosis, or other ichthyosis subtypes

          -  Ichthyosis subjects should not have administered systemic immunosuppressant therapy in
             the month before the study

          -  Ichthyosis subjects should not use topical immunosuppressants in the week before the

          -  Ichthyosis subjects should not have applied emollients to the planned biopsy sites
             within 12 hours before biopsy, but can be applied elsewhere

             allergy, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, asthma)

          -  Controls for skin sampling may have no observable abnormality in the sampled skin and,
             to further assure the normality of the &quot;normal&quot; skin edges, must not have evidence of
             inflammation or epidermal change in the lesion to be surgically removed

             initiation of the study protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are unable to give informed consent or assent

          -  Subjects who administered anti-inflammatory systemic and topical therapy or emollients
