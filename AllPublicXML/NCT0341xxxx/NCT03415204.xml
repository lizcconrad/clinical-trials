  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post operative pain (POP) is a major obstacle on the road to healing, despite the increasing
      interest in postoperative pain management and development of pain control modalities (1).
      Postoperative pain is still insufficiently treated with more than 50% of patients suffering
      from moderate to severe pain early after surgery .Pain after orthopedic surgery is considered
      especially difficult to manage. Approximately half of total knee or hip arthroplasty patients
      present with extreme pain immediately after surgery. Total knee and hip arthroplasty often
      results not only in severe perioperative pain and debilitation, but chronic pain, joint
      stiffness, and functional disability many months or even years following the procedure.
      Various modalities of treating orthopedic POP exist, but the optimal management of
      postoperative pain remains controversial with no clear consensus of the best method.We
      suggest that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for post operative pain after total
      knee or hip arthroplasty.
