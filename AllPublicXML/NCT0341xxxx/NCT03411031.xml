  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine Time-to-Progression with elotuzumab plus lenalidomide
      when elotuzumab is added to multiple myeloma participants with serologic relapse/progression
      while receiving lenalidomide maintenance for each study arm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized parallel 2-cohort phase 2 study of elotuzumab given at 10 mg/kg weekly
      during induction in combination with lenalidomide (either 25 mg or 10 mg) in patients with
      multiple myeloma who progress or relapse serologically while on single agent lenalidomide
      maintenance.

      The combination therapy with elotuzumab and lenalidomide will be continued until further
      progression of myeloma (based on response criteria) or intolerability.

             relapse/progression while on lenalidomide maintenance given as part of first line
             therapy (including upfront high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic
             cell transplantation (HCT)) without symptomatic relapse/progression. Lenalidomide

             baseline testing for HIV and hepatitis C is not required

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly,
             endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, and skin changes) or plasma cell leukemia (&gt; 2.0 ×
