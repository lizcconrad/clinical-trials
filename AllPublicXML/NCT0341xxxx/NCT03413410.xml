  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test the feasibility and tolerability of the metoprolol optimal dosing
      pathway by observing the percentage of patients achieving target dose followed the pathway on
      ACS patients during hospitalization.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome(ACS) is one of the main manifestations of cardiovascular disease and
      one of the main causes for hospitalization in adults.

      Previous studies showed that β-receptor blockers can reduce ACS patients' cardiovascular risk
      in both acute phase and secondary prevention. We summarized the metoprolol optimal dosing
      pathway based on Chinese and foreign guidelines as well as Chinese clinical practice.

      Primary endpoint is the percentage of patients achieving target dose at time of discharge.

      Secondary endpoints are the mean HR &amp; BP at discharge and during the follow up period of the
      Patients who have achieved target dose at discharge.
