      This study is conducted in order to determinate the faisability of an intraoperative
      ultrasound to mesure the positioning of prostheses during laparoscopic promontofixation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genital prolapse is a very common functional pathology that affects 30% of women. The
      functional impact of prolapse is highly variable and may lead patients to consider surgery.
      Surgery for laparoscopic genital prolapse (laparoscopy) is a common practice. The placement
      of prostheses on the anterior and posterior walls of the vagina is sort of &quot;estimated&quot;,
      performed without any quality control . This technique is associated with a high rate of
      patient satisfaction (90% satisfaction), but a risk of anatomical recurrence in 20-30% of
      cases and a risk of reoperation for relapse in 3% of cases. It is likely that the lower the
      intervesico-vaginal prosthesis, the lower the risk of cystocele relapse is important.The
      postoperative ultrasound visualization of prostheses placed in promontofixation is possible:
      they appear hyperechoic. In particular, in anterior, where a prosthesis is placed between the
      vagina and the bladder, it is possible to verify that this prosthesis supports the entire
      bladder base.Thus, it may be possible to check the correct position of the prostheses
      intraoperatively. If studies were conducted postoperatively, to the best of our knowledge, no
      study has been conducted on the value of an intraoperative ultrasound control.

    <description>An ultrasound of the position of the prosthesis during surgery, under general anesthesia, is performed. A follow-up visit will be carried out 2 months (± 1 month) after the surgery as part of the usual care. An ultrasound of the position of the prosthesis is performed without anesthesia, either as part of the treatment or as part of the research. This measurement is performed without the intraoperative measurement by an independent sonographer.</description>
