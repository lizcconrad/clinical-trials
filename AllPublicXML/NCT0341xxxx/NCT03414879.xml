    <textblock>
      Difficult airway is one of the major challenges facing anesthesiologists. This challenge is
      compounded when the patient is treated while awake. The additional burden is to complete this
      procedure comfortably thus ensuring patient cooperation which is a vital part of successful
      performance. Several methods have been tried in literature to facilitate awake intubation by
      fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB)

    <description>Patient tolerability during the procedure will be rated as 4-point scale where 0= procedure totally intolerable with severe patient resistance (struggling/withdrawal movements).
procedure partially tolerable with moderate patient resistance (restlessness/ verbal objection).
procedure quiet tolerable with minimal patient resistance (just grimacing).
procedure tolerable with no patient resistance. this score will be recorded at points during the intubation procedure: nasal passage, oro/hypopharynx, glottis and tube insertion.</description>
