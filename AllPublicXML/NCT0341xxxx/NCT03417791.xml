    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to assess the mortality in the in-hospital patients who have elevated
      serum creatinine. A registry of patients with increased serum creatinine during hospital was
      conducted at the Guangdong General Hospital from January 1st, 2007 to December 30th, 2013.
      The primary clinical outcome is all-cause mortality, followed from the date of hospital
      discharge to Dec 30th 2018. Patients were divided into three groups, according to the serum
      creatinine recovery ratio (discharge/max serum creatinine). All-cause mortality, including
      the date of death, was identified from the electronic hospitalization data, phone follow-up,
      and confirmed by the household registration (HUKOU) system, a record of registration required
      by law in China. Baseline characteristics, including primary disease diagnosis, blood
      pressure, major treatment, drug use and et al, were collected. Demographic data were
      collected from the electronic hospitalization data and electronic hospital discharge records.
      All co-morbid conditions were identified using International Statistical Classification of
      Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), coding algorithms applied to electronic physician claims
      and electronic hospital discharge records.
