  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to determine the safety and value of Hypoxyprobe-1
      (pimonidazole hydrochloride (-HCl)) to detect levels of tissue hypoxia in patients presenting
      with ascending aortic aneurysm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to identify the level of tissue hypoxia in patients presenting
      with ascending aortic aneurysm. Ascending aortic aneurysms affect approximately 15,000 people
      in the United States each year, and represent a serious clinical problem because there is a
      known, but unspecified risk of aortic rupture or dissection. Despite progress made in the
      surgical management of ascending aortic aneurysms, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
      involved remain elusive. However, indirect evidence of tissue hypoxia have recently been
      described in the literature.

      This pilot study will use pimonidazole-HCl, a compound that is retained by hypoxic cells and
      that has been used for detection of tissue hypoxia in human since the early 2000s. This pilot
      study will involve twenty patients who are candidates for aortic replacement due to aneurysm
      and twenty non-aneurysmal patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (controls).
      Patients will be administered pimonidazole-HCl orally in a single dose (0.5g/m2) 24 hours
      prior to scheduled surgical time. During surgery, the resected aneurysmal aortic specimens
      (for patients undergoing aortic replacement) or aortic punch (for patients undergoing
      coronary artery bypass graft) will be harvested. Tissue hypoxia will be qualitatively and
      quantitatively assessed in the investigator's research laboratory. Based on previous
      toxicological animal studies and previous use in human studies, the anticipated risk of
      severe or serious side effect will be relatively minimal.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults ≥ 18 years of age who require one of the following open surgery:

               -  Ascending thoracic aorta repair due to aneurysm;

               -  Aortic valve replacement due to aortic valve insufficiency;

               -  Coronary artery bypass graft procedure due to coronary heart disease. Imaging CT
                  scans and echography defining the presence of ascending aortic aneurysm will be
                  centrally reviewed prospectively to ensure adherence to subject inclusion
                  criteria.

          2. Adequate hematologic functions:

               -  White blood cells &gt; 2500/µ;

               -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/µL;

               -  Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl.

          3. Adequate renal functions: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl.
