  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, open-label study of PKU Sphere in patients with PKU following a phenylalanine
      restricted therapeutic diet.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is to assess acceptability, adherence and metabolic control in
      individuals with PKU consuming PKU Sphere, a GMP-based medical food.

      The sponsor developed PKU Sphere in response to growing interest in GMP medical foods for the
      purpose of improving adherence and quality of life by offering an alternative to amino acid
      based medical foods. PKU Sphere is a powdered, low phenylalanine medical food containing a
      balanced mix of casein glycomacropeptide (GMP) isolate, essential and non-essential amino
      acids, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals and the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid
      (LCP); docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). PKU Sphere has been designed for use in the dietary
      management of Phenylketonuria. It is available in two flavors, Red Berry and Vanilla,
      packaged in individual serving sachets of 35g and containing 20g protein equivalent (PE).

    <description>Phase 1: 1 week To evaluate the acceptability of PKU Sphere during a short-term (1 week) period. Individuals with PKU will aim to consume a minimum of 30% of the medical food component of the diet as PKU Sphere. The amount will be assessed and advised on an individual basis.
Phase 2: 4 weeks To evaluate longer-term acceptability and metabolic control in individuals with PKU consuming an agreed target of 50 - 100% of their medical food component of the diet as PKU Sphere for 4 weeks. Some individuals, particularly young children between the ages of 3 - 6 years, may require a 1 - 3 week build up period to reach target volume which will be assessed on an individual basis.</description>
