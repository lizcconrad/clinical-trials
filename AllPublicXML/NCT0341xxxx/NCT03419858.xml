  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this psychophysical and pharmacologic study is to determine if slow-breathing
      induced pain relief is mediated by endogenous opioids in response to intravenous (IV)
      administration of the opioid antagonist naloxone during noxious heat stimulation. We were
      also interested in disentangling the endogenous analgesic mechanisms supporting
      mindfulness-based analgesia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will employ a graded analytical approach to compare mindfulness to
      placebo-meditation and a slow-breathing exercise in response to double-blind intravenous
      administration (IV) of naloxone/placebo-saline and noxious heat stimulation. The aim of this
      study is to determine if slow-breathing induced analgesia is associated with the release of
      endogenous opioids. The proposed study will disentangle the specific stage of cognitive
      and/or respiration-based involvement (if any) of opioidergically mediated pain relief, a
      critical step in identifying the specific analgesic mechanisms corresponding to mindfulness
      based cognitive techniques.

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The study employed a double blind 3x2x2 crossover factorial design. Baseline pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were assessed using visual analog scales (11 point) obtained before and after four, 5-minute noxious heat stimulation series (49°C). Study volunteers (20/group; 60 total) were randomized and subsequently participated in a four session (20min/session) mindfulness meditation, placebo-meditation, or slow-breathing training regimen. After training completion, subjects reported to the Wake Forest Clinical Research Unit to test the study hypotheses across two separate experimental sessions. Half of the study volunteers (n=10) from each group were administered naloxone (opioid antagonist; 0.15 mg/kg bolus+ 0.1mg/kg/hour infusion) and in the subsequent session were administered IV placebo-saline and vice versa.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale Pain intensity and Unpleasantness ratings as a function of each respective cognitive manipulations and activation in response to naloxone and/or saline.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) measures pain ratings that are assessed in response to noxious (49°C) thermal stimuli applied to the back of the right calf muscle.
Pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale. The minimum rating (&quot;0&quot;) is designated as &quot;no pain&quot; whereas the maximum (&quot;10&quot;) is labeled as &quot;most intense imaginable&quot; or &quot;most unpleasant imaginable&quot;. Higher values corresponded to higher perceived pain ratings.
Pain ratings were assessed at baseline (session 1) and again at sessions six and seven to determine the impact of the mental training regimens. At session six and seven, subjects were given an infusion of either naloxone or saline to address the potential contribution of the opioidergic system in the cognitive modulation of pain.</description>

    <measure>State Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This inventory is a 20 question test used to measure a subject's state of anxiety. A numeric value between 1 (Not at all) and 4 (Very Much So) is provided in response to each statement. The range of scores for this test is between 20 and 80, with higher scores reflecting higher estimates of anxiety.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is a 13 item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale between: 0 (Not at all) and 4 (all the time). The PCS is broken into three subscales including: magnification, rumination, and helplessness. The total range of scores is between 0-52 with higher values reflecting more salient impacts of pain on one's day to day experience.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (CPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CPS is a series of 10 temporally constrained (i.e. in the last month) questions meant to ascertain the relative frequency of stressors in one's life, ranging from never (scored as 0) to very often (scored as 4). All positively stated questions are reversed scored and then all items are summed to yield a final estimate of stress. The higher the score the higher the level of stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Effectiveness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A VAS assessed the effectiveness of the study's intervention. Values on this scale vary continuously between 0 (not effective) and 10 (most effective imaginable). Higher values indicate a subject's greater confidence in the perceived treatment effectiveness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Attitude Toward Treatment Scale (ATTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ATTS was used to monitor a participant's impressions and attitudes about the interventions used in this study. It supplies 5 multiple-choice questions answered on a 10 point scale, ranging from 0 (not logical) to 9 (very logical). Higher scores reflect more positive subject impressions about the therapeutic interventions.</description>

    <measure>Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a brief self-report questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive symptoms. The CES-D is an inventory of 20 self-report items regarding depressive symptoms. Each question is graded on a 0 to 3 point scale with 0 representing &quot;not at all&quot; and 3 representing &quot;a lot&quot;. Four questions (4,8,12, and 16) are reverse scored. A score of 15 or higher indicates a risk for depression.</description>
