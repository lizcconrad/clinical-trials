    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled post-market surveillance study. The
      primary objective of this study is to confirm the safety and performance of the CLS Brevius
      stem with Kinectiv technology by obtaining implant survivorship and clinical outcomes data
      for the commercially available stem.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CLS Brevius Stem with Kinectiv Technology (also referred to as CLS Brevius Kinectiv Stem)
      is a straight, cementless stem which is based on the successful anchoring philosophy of the
      CLS Spotorno Stem. In order to be more bone-conserving, the stem was distally shortened by
      20% compared to the CLS Spotorno Stem. To restore individual patients' anatomies more
      accurately, the CLS Brevius Stems are fused with the existing Zimmer Kinectiv Modular Neck
      Technology.

      The objectives of this study are to confirm the safety and performance of the CLS Brevius
      Kinectiv Stem when used in primary total hip arthroplasty. Safety will be evaluated by
      monitoring the frequency and incidence of adverse events. Performance will be determined by
      analyzing the implant survival, overall pain and functional performances, subject
      quality-of-life and radiographic parameters of study subjects who received the CLS Brevius
      Kinectiv Stem.

      In addition, metal ion levels (titanium and aluminium) will be analyzed pre-operatively and
      at 6 months, 1, 2 and 5 years in a subset of 70 to 80 patients (30 to 35%).

      The primary endpoint is defined as the implant survival at 10 years. Indication: Patients
      suffering from severe hip pain and disability requiring total hip arthroplasty and who meet
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Study design: multi-center, prospective, non-controlled. Length of Study: 12 years (20 months
      enrollment plus 10 years follow-up): follow-up visits at 6 months, 1,2,3,5,7 and 10 years
      post-operatively.

      A maximum total of 230 patients will be enrolled in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is 18 years of age minimum.

          -  Patient is suffering from severe hip pain and disability requiring primary unilateral
             or bilateral total hip arthroplasty based on physical exam and medical history.

          -  Patient is willing and able to cooperate in the required post-operative therapy.

          -  Patient is willing and able to complete scheduled follow-up evaluations as described
             in the Informed Consent.

          -  Patient has participated in the Informed Consent process and has signed the Ethics
             Committee approved 'Informed Consent'.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to give consent or to comply with the follow-up
             program.

          -  Patient has a total prosthetic hip replacement device (including surface replacement
             arthroplasty, endoprosthesis etc.) or femoral and/or acetabular osteosynthesis of the
             affected hip joint(s).

          -  Patient is: a prisoner, mentally incompetent or unable to understand what
             participation in the study entails, a known alcoholic or drug abuser, anticipated to
             be non-compliant

          -  Acute, chronic local or systemic infections.

          -  Severe muscular, neural or vascular diseases that endanger the success of the
             procedure.

          -  Lack of bony structures proximal or distal to the joint, so that good anchorage of the
             implant is unlikely or impossible.

          -  Total or partial absence of the muscular or ligamentous apparatus.

          -  Any concomitant diseases that can jeopardize the functioning and the success of the
             implant.

          -  Allergy to the implanted material, above all to metal (e.g. Vanadium).

          -  Local bone tumors and/or cysts.
