      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in acute sickle cell pain crisis. The purpose of this study is to
      explore if hyperbaric oxygen therapy would decrease hospital length of stay and pain
      associated with acute sickle cell pain crisis. Eligibility criteria include both female and
      males age 19 years or older with sickle cell who are in an acute pain crisis. Exclusions
      include pregnancy and a sickle cell crisis complicated by any acute significant concomitant
      factors/conditions (i.e., acute chest syndrome, acute MI/stroke). Interventions would be 1-3
      hyperbaric oxygen sessions depending on response to the therapy. Each treatment session will
      be approximately two hours in length. Evaluation would be through patients' self assessment
      via the visual analog scale for pain level before and after treatments as well as tracking
      length of stay in the hospital.
