  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvulopathy in Western countries. The prevalence
      of AS is constantly increasing due to the aging of the population. Although significant
      progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the
      onset and progression of AS, there is no medical treatment to slow or prevent its
      progression. The only treatment available is Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR) performed by
      surgery or by catheterization (TAVI).

      AS is associated with an increase of post-load which leads the left ventricular myocardium to
      hypertrophy. Associated with hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis will gradually develop. Despite
      interesting data, many unknowns persist and remain to be identified.

      The aim of the study is to characterize prospectively the left ventricular remodeling and
      assess its changes after AVR and within 1 year in 500 patients using clinical, biological,
      echocardiographic and MRI parameters.
