  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A clinical observational study for patients with HIV co-infected with hepatitis C that
      investigates the levels of their health literacy, hepatitis C and HIV knowledge. Participants
      will complete a one-time assessment of these studied domains and categorized in three groups
      defined by their hepatitis C treatment referral status: not-referred, referred-attended,
      referred and no-show.

      The main purpose of this research study is to investigate the prevalence of inadequate health
      literacy and hepatitis C knowledge and their determinants among people living with HIV/AIDS
      co-infected with hepatitis C. The observation will determine if health literacy and/or
      hepatitis C knowledge are predictors of patient willingness and intention to be treated for
      HCV in the overall cohort and stratified according to study groups as noted above.
