  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to study the effect of chemotherapy on regulatory T cells (Tregs) in
      children with precursor B (PreB) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at 15 and 33 days of
      malignity directed therapy. The investigators will analyze peripheral and bone marrow blood
      samples of the participants, obtained at diagnosis, 15 and 33 days of treatment, about Treg /
      non Treg cells and interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta
      levels. By this means, investigators will search response to chemotherapy. Also,
      investigators will analyze correlation between Treg population-Treg related cytokines with
      demographic, clinical and laboratory findings of the participants with ALL at these certain
      time points. Additionally, the investigators will compare Treg population and minimal
      residual disease at 15-33 days of malignity directed therapy. Also investigators will compare
      these Treg-Treg related cytokines obtained from the participants with ALL and a healthy
      children control group whom are voluntary donors for bone marrow transplantation.
