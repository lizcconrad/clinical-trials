  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational cross sectional study to evaluate the impact of a 4CMenB vaccination
      program on oropharyngeal N. meningitidis carriage in vaccinated and unvaccinated school
      leavers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This carriage study of a cohort of school leavers in South Australia (SA) will provide an
      opportunity to assess carriage rates in the young adult population (school leavers) following
      introduction of a 4CMenB vaccination program in senior school students from 2017-2018.This
      will allow a comparison of carriage prevalence in the two years (2018 and 2019) following
      implementation of the school program to assess impact on carriage at a population level and
      compare carriage prevalence in vaccinated versus non-vaccinated groups. Assessment of any
      association between risk factors and prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage in school leavers
      will be made and compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated students.

      School leavers are defined as students who were enrolled in year 12 at school in the
      preceding year of recruitment and have been chosen as they are likely to have the highest
      carriage rates. A high proportion (approximately two thirds) of students will be immunised by
      the time of throat swab collection in years 2018 and 2019. Assessing carriage in both
      vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts will further inform the effect of 4CMenB vaccine on
      carriage at a population level. This will help determine any herd immunity impact of 4CMenB
      vaccine and persistence of any effect.
