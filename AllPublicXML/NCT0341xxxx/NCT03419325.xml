  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clopidogrel is a prescription medicine used to minimize blood clot formation in patients with
      cardiovascular disease, particularly those undergoing heart catheterization and stroke. A
      substantial amount of medical evidence has proven that patients with stroke or heart diseases
      can benefit from this medicine. However, significant variability in such expected benefits
      has been found among individuals receiving Clopidogrel, with some patients not having the
      benefit of reduced complications and adverse cardiovascular events. Prior studies have
      demonstrated a significant association between certain variants on patient's genes (e.g.,
      CYP2C19) and poor response to Clopidogrel and, therefore, major adverse cardiovascular
      events. Variation in other genes and other factors such as platelet activation, weight,
      diabetes mellitus (a medical condition that produces high blood sugar), concomitant use of
      other drugs and smoking status have also been proposed to be related with the same adverse
      outcomes. In this study the investigators would like to determine a possible association
      between these genes and the response to the medication among Caribbean Hispanic
      cardiovascular patients on Clopidogrel. In other population, it is known that patients with
      certain genetic variants have lower or magnified response to this medication when compared to
      those individuals taking the same dose and not carrying the genetic variations. However, a
      fundamental gap remains in understanding whether the genomic diversity of Caribbean Hispanics
      accounts for the observed high inter-individual variability of clinical outcomes to
      preventive dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with Clopidogrel.

    <textblock>
      Despite the substantial work in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics published over the past
      decade, a fundamental gap remains in understanding whether the genomic diversity of Caribbean
      Hispanics accounts for high inter-individual variability of clinical outcomes to preventive
      dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with Clopidogrel. Caribbean Hispanics are disproportionately
      affected by cardio-metabolic disorders, but with a limited expectation of benefits from
      existing genomic-based algorithms. The investigators will focus on Clopidogrel to develop
      urgently-needed genomic-driven prescription guidelines for this population. To this purpose,
      the investigators propose to perform the first ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a
      pharmacogenetically actionable prescription drug in Caribbean Hispanics. This proposal will
      also take a novel approach to definitively assess the admixture component and is also highly
      practical for the development of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool. The investigators
      will implement a treatment algorithm to guide DAPT in Caribbean Hispanics and will create a
      repository of genomic DNAs and fully annotated clinical and genomic dataset from Caribbean
      Hispanics with cardiovascular diseases. The investigators will test the following hypothesis:

      There are unknown genetic variants that uniquely contribute to Clopidogrel responsiveness in
      Caribbean Hispanics to such extent that a developed CDS tool that incorporates personal
      ethno-specific genotypes and ex vivo pharmacodynamics (PD) testing will help enable more
      precise recommendations for optimizing medical outcomes to antiplatelet therapy in this
      population. This hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims:

      1) To conduct a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of residual on-treatment platelet
      reactivity in Clopidogrel-treated Caribbean Hispanic patients of Puerto Rico. 2) To implement
      a treatment algorithm based on ex vivo PD and genetic test results to guide DAPT in Caribbean
      Hispanics. 3) To create a repository of biological specimens and fully annotated clinical and
      genomic dataset (relevant genotypes and phenotypes) from Caribbean Hispanics with
      cardiovascular diseases.

      The study will be conducted over 5 years in 1,000 cardiovascular patients treated with
      Clopidogrel for secondary prevention of thromboembolic events. It is expected that this study
      advances the adoption of a Precision Medicine (PM) paradigm for the benefit of Hispanic
      patients. The richer genetic variance in Latinos is likely to contribute substantially to
      variability in response to drug treatments, a component that will be missed by traditional
      studies in homogeneous populations. This addressable oversight is of great concern, since it
      will tend to exacerbate the healthcare disparity already experienced by Hispanic populations
      in the US. Hispanics have been largely excluded from Precision Medicine initiatives, which
      increase dramatically the disparities in translating benefits from new findings in
      pharmacogenomics to this medically underserved population, exacerbating the existing inequity
      in healthcare services. Accordingly, the proposed research will expand current understanding
      on the pharmacogenomics of Clopidogrel. Advancing knowledge in the under-investigated area of
      pharmacogenetics in minority populations will generate results that apply to personalize DAPT
      in the wider population as it moves, inevitably, toward increasing heterogeneity through
      admixed genomes.
