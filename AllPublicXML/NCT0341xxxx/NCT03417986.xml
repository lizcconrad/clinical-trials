  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-mechanism clinical trial study will test the efficacy and safety of
      thiethylperazine (TEP) in subjects with early onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). There is a
      strong scientific rationale for this study: TEP is a very well-known substance that has been
      available since 1961 and approved for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting as
      well as vertigo. Therefore, it has a well understood pharmacologic background and promising
      safety data. Using AD mouse models, it has been recently discovered and confirmed that TEP
      promotes transport of toxic Aβ from the brain into the blood. More importantly, it has also
      been demonstrated to improve learning deficits in mice. The striking biological effect of TEP
      in preclinical testing and its known safety and toxicity profile encourages the investigators
      to investigate this in a multicenter clinical trial in subjects with early-to-mild AD in
      comparison to healthy volunteers. The investigators will assess whether TEP is able to
      enhance the transport of Aβ peptides from the brain into the blood in subjects with
      early-to-mild AD and improves cognitive efficacy.

    <description>For safety reasons the clinical trial will first enroll 14 subjects (7 patients and 7 healthy volunteers) for Group 1a receiving 26 mg TEP daily for 4 days with subsequent safety evaluation, based on adverse events and the safety parameters discussed in the protocol. A second set of patients (Group 1b), which will receive a higher dosage of 52 mg per day for 4 days will be enrolled optionally after recommendation to continue and subsequently treatment Group 2 with a treatment paradigm of 26 mg TEP daily for 54 days will start.
Subjects eligible for participation are subjects with newly diagnosed (within last 12 month) early-to-mild dementia due to AD and healthy volunteers who fulfill all inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria present at screening.</description>
