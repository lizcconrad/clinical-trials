  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation, phase I clinical trial study to investigate the
      safety and tolerability of HWH340. In addition, the pharmacokinetic characteristics will also
      be investigated. Two parts are included in this study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part one is a single-dose study on tolerance and pharmacokinetics, in which 21-42 patients
      with advanced solid tumors would be enrolled. Patients will receive escalating dose groups of
      HWH340 tablet.

      Part two is a multiple-dose study on tolerance and pharmacokinetics. Based on the safety
      assessment, three or four groups would be chosen to conduct the study. 9-24 patients with
      advanced solid tumors will be enrolled.
