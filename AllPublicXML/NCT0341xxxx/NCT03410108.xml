  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy and safety of Brigatinib in Japanese
      patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive NSCLC that has progressed after 1 or
      2 lines of prior ALK inhibitor therapy.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Brigatinib. Brigatinib is being tested in
      patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in order to evaluate efficacy and safety of oral doses of
      Brigatinib in Japanese patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.

      The study will enroll approximately 80 participants. Participants will be enrolled in
      non-randomized and opened manner:

      - Brigatinib 90 mg for the first 7 days, followed by Brigatinib 180 mg of Brigatinib tablets,
      once daily in a 28-days cycle.

      All participants will be asked to take tablets of Brigatinib once daily with or without food
      throughout the study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 41 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic during
      the treatment period, and posttreatment period including a follow-up assessment after last
      dose of study drug.

          1. Male or female Japanese patients aged &gt;=20 years on the day of consent.

          2. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          3. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB, stage IIIC (locally

             stage IV NSCLC.

          4. Must meet 1 of the following 2 criteria:

               1. Have documentation of ALK rearrangement by a positive result from the Vysis ALK
                  Break Apart FISH [fluorescence in situ hybridization] Probe Kit, the Nichirei

                  prior disease course.

               2. Had a documented ALK rearrangement by a different test at any time during prior
                  disease course, and adequate tissue available for central laboratory testing by

          5. The expansion part only: had documented progressive disease (PD) during treatment or
             within 30 days after treatment with ALK inhibitor.

               -  Note 1: The expansion part consists of the main cohort and a subcohort based on
                  prior ALK inhibitor treatment. The main cohort includes patients who had
                  previously received alectinib (as their only ALK inhibitor) or both crizotinib

                  will be limited to 20.

               -  Note 2: Patients who will be included in the main cohort should have documented

             as target lesions if they were 1) previously treated with whole brain radiation
             therapy (WBRT) within 3 months, or 2) previously treated by stereotactic radiosurgery

             evaluation lead-in part allows patients with any line of prior ALK inhibitor which
             includes treatment-naïve patients; however, ALK inhibitor-naïve patients may be
             enrolled after the confirmation of first 3 DLT evaluable patients to have no more than
             1 DLT during Cycle 1 by investigator's judgement.

             counted if it is administered over at least 1 cycle. A new anticancer agent used as
             maintenance therapy will be counted as a new regimen unless it was previously used as
             initial anticancer therapy. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic anticancer therapy will
             be counted as a prior regimen if completion of (neo) adjuvant therapy occurred &lt;12
             months before the first dose of Brigatinib.
