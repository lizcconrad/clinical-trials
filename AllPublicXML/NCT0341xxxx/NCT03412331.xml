    <textblock>
      Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) is a distinct type of periodontal disease
      characterized by rapid loss of attachment and alveolar bone occuring in young individuals.
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was introduced in periodontology as an adjunctive approach to
      non-surgical periodontal treatment (NPT) in periodontitis patients. In this trial, it was
      aimed that to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of adjunctive PDT to NPT in
      patients with GAgP. In this prospective controlled clinical study, 24 systemically healthy,
      non-smoking subjects with GAgP were enrolled. Subjects were randomly assigned to a control
      group (n=12) treated with NPT only or to a test group (n=12) treated with NPT and PDT. Plaque
      index, sulcus bleeding index (SBI), pocket depth (PD), relative attachment level, gingival
      recession, mobility were recorded at baseline and on day 63. Microbiological samples were
      obtained fom the sites with PD ≥5 mm at the same time points and evaluated for
      Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia,
      Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola using micro-IDent test.

    <description>Following NPT, toluidine blue O mediated PDT was performed with a LED source (625-635 nm wavelength) (FotoSan®, CMS Dental, Denmark) to 12 subjects. The dye (0.1 mg/ml) was applied with a canula into the periodontal pockets. After 3 minutes, the subjects rinsed their mouths with sterile saline solution for removal of excessive dye. Then, the applicator of photosensitizer was inserted until the bottom of the periodontal pocket and photoinactivation was performed in 6 sites per tooth for 10 seconds of each sites with a total of 60 seconds per tooth.</description>
