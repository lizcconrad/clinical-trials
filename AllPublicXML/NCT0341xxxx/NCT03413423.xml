      Summary of the Project :

      Quitting smoking following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) can reduce mortality up to 50%.
      However, depression and smoking are highly co-morbid and depressed mood may interfere with
      cessation and independently predicts mortality. Thus, a single, integrated treatment for both
      smoking and depression could be highly effective in reducing post-acute coronary syndrome
      mortality. Behavioral Activation (BA) is a well established treatment for depression and has
      recently shown promise as a treatment for smoking cessation. The investigators systematically
      developed an intervention integrating gold standard smoking cessation counseling with
      existing BA based mood management techniques for post-ACS smokers; Behavioral Activation
      Treatment for Cardiac Smokers (BAT-CS).

      Objective: For this R01 the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of using a single,
      integrated treatment that targets both depressed mood and smoking (BAT-CS).

      This project will implement a fully powered efficacy trial enrolling 324 smokers with ACS and
      randomize them to 12 weeks of either Behavioral Activation Treatment for Cardiac Smokers
      (BAT-CS) or control condition (including contact match). BAT-CS interventions will focus on
      smoking cessation and mood management, while the control condition will focus on smoking
      cessation and general health education. Both groups will be offered the nicotine patch if
      medically safe. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at end-of-treatment (12 weeks
      post-discharge for index event), and 6, 9, and 12 months after hospital discharge. The
      occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and all-cause mortality will be tracked for up to
      60 months post discharge.
