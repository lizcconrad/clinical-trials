  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The restorative and surgical odontological department at the Nantes University Hospital
      frequently hosts patients with a severely degraded oral condition who has never benefited
      from a removable prosthetic rehabilitation. The chosen treatment plan consists most of the
      time in extracting all the residual teeth at one or both arches with the immediate insertion
      of a complete removable prosthesis performed prior to the extractions. This prosthesis is
      adapted by regular relining during the osteomucosal healing and is replaced by a usage
      removable prosthesis on average 6 months after the extractions.

      The transition from dentate state (even dilapidated) to toothless state can be a source of
      discomfort and impairment and lead to a decrease of life's quality for patients. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate oral health of the patients at the different stages of
      prosthetic rehabilitation by using GOHAI (Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are selected at the beginning of their prosthetic rehabilitation and selected
      patients give their consent for the participation at the clinical trial. The filling of the
      GOHAI questionnaire is performed in 3 steps:1- before treatment, 2- after teeth extractions
      and the delivering of immediate complete denture or without immediate prosthetic
      rehabilitation and 3-during inspection visits after the delivery of the definitive denture.
