  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug regimes in treating ankylosing spondylitis(AS) have limitations. The tumor necrosis
      factor inhibitors(TNFi) was effective but expensive. Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs) were cheap but insufficient. This study proposed a sequential usage of TNFi, the
      Yisaipu®, and DMARDs, and aims to evaluate the mid-term therapeutic effect of this new scheme
      in treating the mild-to-moderate AS.

There are 5 to 8 questions in every dimension. The score ranges are 8 to 40 for physiological function, 6 to 30 for psychological state, 5 to 25 for social adaptation and 6 to 30 for self-awareness. The more score that patients got means the better state they were in that dimension, namely, the batter quality of life.</description>
