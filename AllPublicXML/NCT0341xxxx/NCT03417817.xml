  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First introduced over 40 years ago, the 24-hour catheter-based pH studies have previously
      been found to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of acid reflux. In 2003, the Bravo™ pH
      wireless monitoring revolutionised the study of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD),
      allowing patients an improved comfort and ability to perform activities of daily living.
      Normal ranges for acid exposure are established for 48-hour studies. However, the
      investigators' studies have shown that extending the duration of recording to 96 hours
      further improved diagnostic yield and consistency in patients with negative 24-hour
      catheter-based studies. The 96-hour recording is the current standard of care, despite the
      lack of normal ranges for this duration of the recording. The basis for the diagnosis of GORD
      in 96-hours studies is based on the 48-hours normal controls. The objective of this study is
      to determine the normal values for oesophageal acid exposure using the wireless pH recording
      apparatus over 96 hours in asymptomatic healthy subjects with unrestricted activity and diet.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, investigator-led study on healthy subjects to determine the normal
      values for oesophageal acid exposure using the wireless pH (potential of hydrogen) monitoring
      over 96 hours. The investigators anticipate the recruitment of 25 participants over 6 months.
      Bravo capacity is 16 procedures/week which is not fully utilised. Up to 2 research cases/week
      can be allocated to these &quot;free&quot; slots.

      Healthy volunteers and people without reflux referred for gastroscopy in context of other
      conditions (e.g. iron deficiency anaemia, coeliac disease) will be recruited and an interview
      will be arranged where the subjects will be assessed for gastro-oesophageal symptoms using
      the Montreal GORD consensus definition and dysphagia based on the Hospital Odynophagia
      Dysphagia Questionnaire. Once confirmed asymptomatic, participants will be offered an
      appointment for enrolment. If candidates are asymptomatic, the subjects will be invited to a
      further interview where the procedure, risks and benefits will be discussed in detail. If
      participants fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria then participants will be given the
      option to enrol in the study. It will be stated that the participant is free to withdraw from
      the study at any time and with no obligation to give the reason for withdrawal.

      Once recruited the following assessments and interventions will take place:

        1. Endoscopy and Bravo capsule placement under conscious sedation. The procedure will be
           performed by a trained endoscopist in using Bravo delivery system and dealing with any
           complications that may arise. Photographic documentation of capsule attachment will be
           taken.

        2. 96-hour pH monitoring. Study subjects will be asked to document food intake, periods of
           sleep and occurrence of symptoms in a diary. After 96 hours, participants will return to
           the Oesophageal Laboratory to hand back in the receivers and diaries. The data captured
           on the recorder during the procedure will be downloaded to a computer.

        3. Subjects will be offered a questionnaire detailing participants satisfaction with the
           overall study and an assessment of discomfort and interference with activities of daily
           living (diet, activity level) using a 5-point grading scale (1 = very
           unhappy/intolerant, 5 = very satisfied). A yes/no evaluation of participants ability to
           go to work or study on the day following the procedure and whether the participants
           would recommend this test to another person is also included.

        4. Data analysis will include the standard components of oesophageal pH monitoring - acid
           exposure, number and duration of reflux episodes over 96 hours and 72 hours.

        5. Statistical analysis will involve standard deviation, mean, median, 95th/5th percentiles
           and 25th/75th percentiles, paired nonparametric test to compare median data and t-test
           for averaged data. Considering a 20% of drop-out rate (participants who cannot complete
           the test or participants' data is not useful), the investigators will recruit 25
           subjects to achieve a sample size of 20.
