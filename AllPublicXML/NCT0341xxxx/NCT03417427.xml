  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is often impossible to find therapeutic target in intermediate-risk AML, so it is very
      important to select appropriate chemotherapy protocol to eliminate minimal residual disease
      (MRD) in these AML patients. Recent studies demonstrated that leukemia microenvironment is
      the shelter nich for leukemia stem cells and the essential reason for impossibly eliminating
      MRD. Demethylation drug not only prove the effect of chemotherapy, but also change leukemia
      microenvironment through epigenetics modification. Both of them will result in eliminating
      MRD in patients with AML. The investigators designed a multicenter randomized control
      clinical trail to evaluate the effect of demethylation drug combined with chemotherapy in AML
      patients with intermediate-risk factors after hematological complete remission. Efficacy will
      be evaluated through MRD detected by flow cytometry every 1 month. Continuous negative MRD
      indicates a good prognosis. The patients with continuous negative MRD can select auto-HSCT or
      consolidation chemotherapy, those with continuous positive MRD should be considered as
      candidates of allo-HSCT. Overall survival and relapse free survival will be recorded after
      follow-up every 3 months. It will provide a basis for precision therapy and a new way for
      designing a novel protocol for intermediate-risk AML. This clinical trail will benefit to the
      AML patients with intermediate-risk factors.
