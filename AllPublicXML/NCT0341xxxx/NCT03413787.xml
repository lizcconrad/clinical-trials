  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The freezing of gait (FOG) is one of the disabling symptoms in Parkinson's disease. The
      diagnosis and assessment of the FOG may be diffucult, but it is absolutely necessary. The aim
      of this study was to develop a Türkish version of the freezing of gait questionnaire (FOG-Q)
      and assess the validity and reliability of this Türkish version.

      The researchers firstly communicated with the developers of the FOG-Q. The permission for
      Turkish version was received by Giladi. Then, the FOG-Q will be adapted into Türkish using
      forward-backward translation by three native Türkish-speaking forward translators and one
      native English-speaking backward translator. The internal reliability of the FOG-Q Türkish
      version will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and item analyses will be conducted by
      examining the effect on Cronbach's alpha of excluding each of the six FOG-Q items
      individually. The test-retest reliability will be assessed using intraclass correlation
      coefficient (ICC).

      Convergent validity will be evaluated by means of Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs).
      In this section will be determined the correlation between the FOG-Q scores and scores of the
      UPDRS motor section , Berg Balance Scale, Timed up and go test, Falls Efficacy Scale and
      Hoehn and Yahr stages.

    <measure>Türkish version of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Türkish version of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire determine the episode of the freezing and the severity of the freezing by six items. Each items with five response categories (scored from 0 to 4) that are summed into a total score (range 0-24; higher scores = more severe FOG).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-part III</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Türkish version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) will be used. UPDRS-part III evaluate the motor symptoms observational by neurologist. (UPDRS) scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (maximum disability); the total score change between 0 and 56. High scores mean worse motor function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The balance will be evaluated observational during 14 different balance activities. Each item will be scored between 1 and 4. The test score change between 0 and 56. The high score indicates better balance ability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to measure the progress of balance, sit to stand, and walking. The participants stands up upon therapist's command walks 3 meters, turns around, walks back to the chair and sits down.
The time stops when the patient is seated. Time will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fall Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>7 item-Fall Efficacy Scale (FES) will be used. FES is a questionnaire that assesses fear of falling. The score of the scale change 0-100 and the score above 70 indicates the fear of falling.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hoehn and Yahr Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Hoehn and Yahr Scale (HYS) will be used to assess the severity in Parkinson's Disease based on clinical findings and functional disability. In HYS is a rating scale measured in an ordinal level. Here higher rates describe an increase severity of the disease.</description>
