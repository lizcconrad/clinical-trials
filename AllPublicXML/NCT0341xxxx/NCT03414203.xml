  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on the
      clinical and cognitive function in patients with chronic migraine.

    <textblock>
      The patients will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups: active tDCS for 15 minutes, active tDCS
      for 15 minutes, with an interval of 20 minutes and more 15 minutes os stimulation, sham tDCS
      for 15 minutes. The tDCS will be applied for 10 days over 2 weeks.

    <description>Transcranial Current Stimulation equipment consists of an ammeter (measured with current intensity), a potentiometer (voltage controller between the electrodes), a generator (two 9-volt batteries) and two electrodes (anode and cathode). The direct low-amplitude currents released by the electrodes reach the cortex and modify the neuronal potentials.</description>
