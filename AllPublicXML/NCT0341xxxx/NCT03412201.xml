      STRONG-HF is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of up-titration of standard oral heart failure medications during
      hospitalization for acute heart failure. Patients admitted for acute heart failure will be
      randomized 1-2 days before discharge to either usual care or intensification of treatment
      with a beta-blocker, a renin-angiotensin system blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor
      blocker (&quot;high intensity care&quot; arm). In the &quot;high intensity care&quot; arm, patients' clinical
      signs and symptoms of heart failure will be assessed, and routine laboratory measures and
      biomarkers will be measured, at frequent post-discharge visits. When these measures indicate
      that it is safe to do so, the doses of the oral heart failure medications will be increased
      to optimal levels. Patients will be followed through 90 days from randomization. Patients
      assigned to the usual care group will be followed by their general physician and/or
      cardiologist according to local medical standards. All patients, including those who were
      screened but did not meet eligibility criteria, will be followed for 90-day outcome.

      STRONG-HF is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of up-titration of standard of care medical therapy including
      beta-blockers; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or
      angiotensin receptor neprolysin inhibitor (ARNi); and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
      (MRAs), on morbidity and mortality when initiated and up-titrated early during
      hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF). Optimal safety conditions will allow
      physicians to introduce and/or continue oral HF therapies during this &quot;vulnerable phase&quot; in
      AHF patients. Patients admitted for AHF with clinical signs of congestion and elevated
      circulating N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and who are not treated
      with optimal doses of oral heart failure (HF) therapies 1-2 days before hospital discharge
      for AHF and who are hemodynamically stable will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either usual
      care (named &quot;usual care&quot; arm) or intensification of treatment with beta-blockers, and ACEi
      (or ARB) or ARNi and a MRA (named &quot;high intensity care&quot; arm). In the latter arm, repeated
      assessments of clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure, routine clinical laboratory
      measures including potassium, sodium, and creatinine as well as biomarkers including
      NT-ProBNP and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) will foster, encourage and ensure the
      safety of the optimization of oral heart failure therapies. Patients will be followed through
      90 days from randomization. AHF patients who were screened but did not meet inclusion
      criteria, including low circulating NT-proBNP at visit 2, will also be followed for 90-day
      outcome.

             as forced expiratory volume during the 1st second (FEV1)&lt; 1 liter or need for chronic
             systemic or nonsystemic steroid therapy, or any kind of primary right heart failure
             such as primary pulmonary hypertension or recurrent pulmonary embolism.

          6. Myocardial infarction, unstable angina or cardiac surgery within 3 months, or cardiac
             resynchronization therapy (CRT) device implantation within 3 months, or percutaneous
             transluminal coronary intervention (PTCI), within 1 month prior to Screening.

          7. Index Event (admission for AHF) triggered primarily by a correctable etiology such as
             significant arrhythmia (e.g., sustained ventricular tachycardia, or atrial

             and brisk diuresis after admission. Troponin elevations without other evidence of an
             acute coronary syndrome are not an exclusion.

          8. Uncorrected thyroid disease, active myocarditis, or known amyloid or hypertrophic
             obstructive cardiomyopathy.

             admission and at 1-2 days prior to anticipated discharge.

         19. Inability to comply with all study requirements, due to major co-morbidities, social
             or financial issues, or a history of noncompliance with medical regimens, that might
