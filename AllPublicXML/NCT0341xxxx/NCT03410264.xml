  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the efficacy of exposure and response prevention (ERP) for anxiety and phobias,
      recent theoretical research on fear extinction via inhibitory learning suggests that
      cognitive restructuring (CR)--the explicit challenging of maladaptive beliefs (e.g,.
      overestimation of threat)--may actually attenuate exposure outcomes during an exposure trial.
      That is, by verbally disputing certain beliefs (e.g., &quot;the spider will jump on me and attack
      me and I will faint from the anxiety&quot;) before an exposure task (e.g., gradually approaching a
      non-venomous spider), anxious individuals may experience less &quot;surprise&quot; from the
      non-occurrence of feared outcomes, and consequently experience less inhibitory learning
      (e.g., learning that spiders are not inherently dangerous). Thus, the investigators aim to
      empirically test the conventional (yet recently challenged) assumption that cognitive
      restructuring is a necessary component for psychosocial interventions for phobias.

      90 participants recruited from the Psychology Department Participant Pool and the community
      will participate in this study. All participants will meet DSM-5 criteria for spider phobia.
      Following consent, participants will complete a pre-test assessment of various aspects of
      spider phobia. Participants will then receive education about the nature of anxiety/spider
      phobia and be randomly assigned to one of three 45-min intervention conditions: (a) CR before
      EXP, (b) EXP before CR, and (c) stress management (a control condition that involves neither
      CR nor EXP). Following the intervention, participants will complete a 10-minute post-test
      assessment and be scheduled to return for a follow-up assessment a month later.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent conceptualizations of the mechanisms by which exposure therapy (EXP; i.e., confronting
      one's fear in a systematic and therapeutic way) works in the treatment of phobias focus on
      the importance of extinction learning). This &quot;inhibitory learning model&quot; proposes that EXP
      helps the phobic individual learn that phobic stimuli are not dangerous; yet older
      danger-related learning is not &quot;erased&quot;, and so must be inhibited by the new &quot;safety
      learning.&quot; Research indicates that incorporating surprise into EXP (e.g., the patient is
      surprised that the spider didn't bite) maximizes this type of inhibitory learning and would
      correspond to better outcomes for phobias then when there is no surprise at the outcome of
      EXP.

      Traditionally, EXP is used with the addition of cognitive restructuring (CR), which involves
      discussing and disputing exaggerated beliefs that underlie one's fears (e.g., &quot;spiders are
      very dangerous&quot;). CR encourages phobic individuals to re-evaluate their expectations of
      danger when encountering phobic stimuli, and therefore might rob the individual of the
      opportunity to be surprised when actually facing their fear.

      Despite the theoretical plausibility of the importance of surprise during EXP, this question
      has yet to be investigated empirically. The aim of the present study is to test the
      hypothesis that incorporating surprise into EXP (by postponing CR until after EXP) will
      enhance immediate and long-term outcome of EXP for spider phobia.

    <measure>Change from baseline Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) at 1-month follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavioral Approach Task (BAT) includes 13 rank-ordered steps ranging from standing at the opposite end of a room containing a tarantula enclosed in a closed terrarium covered with a sheet to allowing the tarantula to crawl up one's bare arm. A participant must perform a BAT step for 10 consecutive seconds for the step to count as completed. BAT scores are recorded as the number of the highest step completed. Immediately after completing each step of the BAT (at the baseline and post-treatment assessments), participants are asked to verbally report their (a) anxiety and (b) disgust, using a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (maximum).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SBQ is a 78-item scale measuring one's concerns related to encounters with spiders. Items are rated on a 0-100 scale (0= I do not believe it at all (0%); 100= I absolutely believe it (100%)). Total scores range from 0-7800.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Spider Self-Efficacy Scale (SSES) is a self-report measure of the strength of self-efficacy about performing behaviors related to spiders. The scale consists of 26 items describing approach behaviors towards spiders, on which respondents rate the strength of their self-efficacy about performing that behavior on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (no confidence/highly uncertain) to 10 (total confidence/complete certainty). Total scores range from 0 to 260. Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy.</description>

Each item is rated from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) and total scores range from 10 to 70. The scale assesses experiential avoidance, also known as ''psychological flexibility,'' which is a core construct of the acceptance and commitment therapy model of psychopathology. Higher scores on the AAQ-II indicate greater psychological flexibility (less pathology).</description>
