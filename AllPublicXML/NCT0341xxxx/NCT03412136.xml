  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of acute protein and glucose intake on
      testosterone levels measured in adolescent boys and determine whether changes in testosterone
      levels are associated with alterations in short-term food intake. It was hypothesized that 1)
      ingestion of a protein beverage would result in no change of testosterone levels whereas
      glucose would result in a significant decrease of testosterone levels 60 minutes after
      ingestion and 2) decreases of testosterone levels as a result of the glucose preload would
      predict food intake for boys of similar body size. The first objective was to investigate the
      effect of an acute protein or glucose drink on testosterone levels and the second objective
      was to determine whether changes of testosterone levels associate with food intake.

    <intervention_model_description>In a randomized, crossover study, sixteen 9-18 y old males were given beverages containing either: 1) whey protein (1g/kg bodyweight), 2) glucose (1g/kg bodyweight) or a calorie-free control (C). Serum testosterone, appetite biomarkers and subjective appetite were measured prior (0) and at 20, 35 and 65 minutes after the consumption of the beverage. Food intake at an ad libitum pizza meal was assessed 20 min later (65-85min).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The experimental beverages contained either 1g of glucose monohydrate (BioShop Canada Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada) or 1g of protein (plain whey-protein isolate; BiPro USA., Eden Prairie, Minnesota, U.S.A) per kg of bodyweight. A non-calorie drink was used as control. All beverages were flavoured with 1.5ml of chocolate extract (Vanilla Food Company, Markham, Ontario, Canada) to account for the flavor differences and mixed with 500ml of water. The whey protein and control beverages were sweetened with 0.2g sucralose (Tate &amp; Lyle, Stoney Creek, Ontario, Canada) in order to match sweetness with the glucose beverage.</masking_description>

    <description>Participants were provided an ad libitum pizza meal. The participants were instructed to eat during the next 20 min until they were comfortably full. Based on the participant preferences determined during screening, two varieties of Deep 'N Delicious 5-inch-diameter pizza were provided for consumption; pepperoni and three-cheese pizzas (McCain Canada Ltd., Florenceville, Ontario, Canada). Units were measuring in kcal.</description>
