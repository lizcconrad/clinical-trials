      To compare the effect between the exercise intervention (strengthening exercise and
      stretching exercise) and exercise intervention with taping on decreasing round shoulder
      posture and improving symptoms in subjects with shoulder impingement syndrome/round shoulder
      syndrome.

      Background: Poor posture and abnormal scapular kinematics have been suggested as possible
      primary factors in developing Shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS) and also as secondary
      observed phenomena of SIS. Round shoulder posture (RSP) is major and common posture
      contributing to increase the potential for subacromial impingement or exaggerate the symptoms
      of SIS. Objective: To compare the effect between the exercise intervention (strengthening
      exercise and stretching exercise) and exercise intervention with taping on decreasing RSP and
      improving symptoms in subjects with SIS/RSP. Methods: Forty subjects with impingement age
      between 20 and 75 are recruited and measured on acromial distance, pectoralis minor index
      (PMI), posterior and anterior shoulder tightness, distance of scapular medial border, pain
      score and flexilevel scale of shoulder function (FLEX-SF). Clinical significance: Shoulder
      impingement syndrome (SIS) have been identified as the majority of reported shoulder
      complaints. The project will provide an effective intervention for subjects with SIS/RSP.
