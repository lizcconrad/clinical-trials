  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiangiogenics (AAs) which are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor
      (VEGFR) inhibitors might have high grade adverse events (AEs) on the cardio-vascular system.
      This study investigates reports of cardio-vascular toxicity with treatment including VEGF and
      VEGFR inhibitors using the World Health Organization (WHO) database VigiBase.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AAs have dramatically improved clinical outcomes in multiple cancer types and are
      increasingly being tested in earlier disease settings and used in combination. However, AEs
      can occur. Here the investigators use VigiBase (http://www.vigiaccess.org/), the World Health
      Organization (WHO) database of individual safety case reports, to identify cases of
      cardiovascular adverse drug reaction following treatment with AAs.
