  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify ways to follow progression of Friedreich's Ataxia
      (FA) and be able to measure changes over time in children with FA. Participants will have
      biannual visits to observe how the disease progresses over time and determine the rate of
      progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators seek to identify biological and clinical tests to be used in future clinical
      trials. The purpose of this research study is to learn more about Friedreich's Ataxia (FA)
      progression in children. There will be biannual visits which will include a core set of tests
      and procedures. These include: a collection of medical history, detailed neurological exam,
      ataxia scales, and health questionnaires. At each visit, blood and cheek swab samples will be
      obtained to monitor frataxin levels.

      A select number of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) participants will have the
      opportunity to participate in further procedures to better understand how FA affects
      different tissues. These include a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan and a Motor Evoked
      Potentials (MEP) procedure.

      The MRI scan analyzes how muscle activity is affected in FA. The magnet will be used to
      capture images of the calf muscle before and after exercising on an ergonomic foot pedal.

      The MEP procedure measures how strong the connection is between the brain's motor cortex and
      a selected body part, specifically the participant's dominant hand.

        This study will primarily take place at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP),
        with a select number of subjects only participating in the clinical testing at the
        University of Florida and University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). The investigators
        expect to recruit approximately 100 children across all three sites and study each of them
        over a 3 year period. Children with a genetically or clinically confirmed diagnosis of
        Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) will be offered participation.
