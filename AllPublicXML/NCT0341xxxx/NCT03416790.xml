  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IMPAACT 2015 is a cross-sectional, exploratory study that will investigate the central
      nervous system (CNS) reservoir in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults on
      effective antiretroviral therapy with neurocognitive impairment. The study will assess the
      frequency with which HIV is detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in this population
      and assess whether detectable HIV in the CSF correlates with markers of inflammation and
      neuronal injury. Findings from this study will advance understanding of the role of the CNS
      in HIV-1 persistence and its implications for future HIV-1 remission research.

      IMPAACT 2015 is a cross-sectional, exploratory study aiming to investigate the central
      nervous system (CNS) reservoir in perinatally HIV-infected adolescents and young adults on
      effective antiretroviral therapy with neurocognitive impairment. The study will assess the
      frequency with which HIV is detected in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in this population
      and assess whether detectable HIV in the CSF correlates with markers of inflammation and
      neuronal injury. CSF will be examined for persistence of HIV-1 RNA or DNA despite
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) and for evidence of intrathecal inflammation.
      Perinatally-infected youth and young adults are of particular interest because there are very
      limited CSF data available in this population and reasons to be concerned about the CNS
      reservoir. In addition, measures of HIV-1 RNA in the CSF and associated biomarkers have not
      previously been explored in this population. A better understanding of viral persistence in
      the CSF, as well as CSF biomarker profiles, will provide preliminary data to move the field
      forward in understanding the role of the CNS in HIV-1 persistence and will have implications
      for future HIV-1 remission research.
