      A phase I/II open label study to assess the efficacy and safety of ABTL0812 in combination
      with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer at
      first line therapy and as maintenance therapy after chemotherapy
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized phase I/II multicenter study to evaluate ABTL0812 in
      combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel at first line therapy and as maintenance
      therapy after chemotherapy. Patients will be assigned to the following groups during the
      study conduct:

      Phase I: A 3+3 de-escalation design followed by an expansion phase will be performed

        -  ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily. Potential dose levels are 1300 mg tid,
           1000 mg tid, 650 mg tid and 500 mg tid. Intrapatient escalation or de-escalation is not
           permitted. A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first
           cycle of chemotherapy.

        -  Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 +
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15.

        -  If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for
           any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance
           therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or
           patient/physician's request to discontinue.

      Phase II:

        -  ABTL0812 will be administered chronically daily at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).
           A run-in period of one week for ABTL0812 is planned before starting the first cycle of
           chemotherapy.

        -  Chemotherapy will be administered on 28-day cycles: gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV +
           nab-paclitaxel 125 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8 and 15

        -  If any, or all, the components of the chemotherapeutic regimen must be interrupted for
           any reason (excluding disease progression), ABTL0812 will be administered as maintenance
           therapy until disease progression, onset of unacceptable drug toxicities, or
           patient/physician's request to discontinue.

             with the protocol

          -  Patient has histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be
             made by integrating the histopathological data within the context of the clinical and
             radiographic data. Patients with islet cell neoplasms are excluded. Initial diagnosis

          -  Patient has not received previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or
             investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior treatment with
             5-FU or gemcitabine administered as a radiation sensitizer in the adjuvant setting is
             allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since completion of the last dose and
