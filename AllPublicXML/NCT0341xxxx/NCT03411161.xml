      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety profile, the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and the associated dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of S 81694 in combination with
      paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients, and to investigate the antitumour
      activity of the combination in metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) patients.

a dose escalation phase I part, which is a single arm, non-randomised and non-comparative study in patient with mBC
a randomised phase II part, which is a two-arm, randomised study at RP2D (recommended phase II dose), to evaluate the efficacy and the safety of S 81694 in combination with paclitaxel (experimental arm) versus paclitaxel alone (comparator arm) in untreated mTNBC</intervention_model_description>

          -  Any prior cancer therapy within 4 weeks before the first IMP administration;

          -  Participant with current, serious, uncontrolled infections;

          -  Participant with brain metastasis or leptomeningeal metastasis (except patients with
             brain metastasis that have been stable post-radiation therapy and who are off steroids
             for &gt; 2 months);

          -  History of cardiac disease;

          -  Uncontrolled arterial hypertension;

          -  Presence of risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g. heart failure, hypokalaemia,
             family history of long QT syndrome);

          -  Any clinically significant medical condition (e.g. organ dysfunction) or laboratory
             abnormality likely to jeopardize the patient's safety or to interfere with the conduct
