      The study is an investigator initiated study (IIS) single arm treatment, single center where
      patients will receive active treatment with ActharTM 80 units twice weekly for 4 weeks
      followed by 40 units twice weekly until week 12.

      2-End points:

      1.Primary Clinical Endpoint

      1. To demonstrate the efficacy of Acthar for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic
      arthritis and who have not had an adequate response to non-biological DMARDs based on the
      proportion of subjects achieving a 20% improvement in the number of tender and number of
      swollen joints, and a 20% improvement in three of the following five criteria: patient global
      assessment, physician global assessment, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), visual analog
      pain scale, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein (CRP) as described by
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 at week 12.

      [Time Frame: 12 weeks]

      2.Primary Imaging Endpoints

        1. The improvement of the total DEMRIQ*-Volume score of synovial inflammation measured in
           the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and the distal
           interphalangeal (DIP) joints. [Time Frame: baseline to week 24]

           [Time Frame: baseline to week 24]

        2. Secondary Outcome Measures:

      Secondary Imaging Endpoints

      1. The improvement in PSAMRIS* Synovitis score in the Metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal
      interphalangeal (PIP) and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. [Time Frame: baseline to

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed written informed consent before any study-related procedure is undertaken that
             is not part of the standard subject management

          2. Subjects are willing to comply with the structure of the study, such as visits,
             treatment plan, laboratory and imaging studies.

             Clinical evidence of psoriatic arthritis defined by at least 6 months of CASPAR
             defined criteria (evidence of current psoriasis, a personal history of psoriasis, or a
             family history of psoriasis. Current psoriasis is defined as psoriatic skin or scalp
             disease present today as judged by a rheumatologist or dermatologist. A personal
             history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis that may be obtained from a
             patient, family physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other qualified health
             care provider. A family history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis in a
             first- or second-degree relative according to patient report, and the number of tender
             and swollen joints as later specified. Typical psoriatic nail dystrophy including
             onycholysis, pitting, and hyperkeratosis observed on current physical examination.

             c. A negative test result for the presence of rheumatoid factor by any method,
             according to the local laboratory reference range.

             d. Either current dactylitis, defined as swelling of an entire digit, or a history of
             dactylitis recorded by a rheumatologist.

             e. Radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new bone formation, appearing as
             ill-defined ossification near joint margins (but excluding osteophyte formation) on
             plain radiographs of the hand or foot.

             Current psoriasis is assigned a score of 2; all other features are assigned a score of
             1.

             The subject must have active arthritis at both screening and baseline, as defined by
             having both:

               -  Tender/painful joints on motion (out of 68 joints assessed); and;

               -  Swollen joints (out of 66 joints assessed). The subject must have active Plaque
                  Psoriasis, which has been diagnosed, or confirmed by a rheumatologist or
                  dermatologist and the ability to use skin biopsy as a diagnostic method.

          3. Previous use of DMARDS:

             The practices for the administration of DMARD therapy, including laboratory testing,
             contraceptive requirements, follow-up care and contraindications should be performed
             according to local standards of care such as the ACR recommendations for monitoring
             for the duration of the study. Subjects should remain on a stable dose of that
             traditional DMARD throughout the course of the study.

             Methotrexate: Maximum dose of 15 mg/week. Minimum duration of therapy 3 months and
             dose stable for 4 weeks prior to first dose of the study. Subjects on methotrexate
             should be on an adequate and stable dose of folate supplementation.

             Sulfasalazine: Maximum dose of 3 gm/day. Minimum duration of therapy 2 months and dose
             stable for 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

             Leflunomide: Maximum dose of 20 mg/day. Minimum duration of therapy 4 months and dose
             stable for 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

             Plaquenil Azathioprine

          4. Concomitant treatments:

             Corticosteroids up to 10 mg/day prednisone or prednisone equivalent are allowed for 4
             weeks stable dose before the study and can be tapered according to the investigator
             criteria of clinical response. NSAIDS and COX 2 medications can be used in clinically
             accepted doses and in stable doses 4 weeks prior to screening. Topical keratolytics
             such as corticosteroids, tars, anthralin, vitamin D analogs, and retinoids must be
             discontinued 2 weeks prior to the screening date. Non-medicated emollients including
             1% hydrocortisone for palms and soles are allowed. UV light therapy needs to be
             discontinued 2 weeks prior to screening, and PUVA 4 weeks prior to screening.

          5. A male participant must agree to use and to have their female partners use a highly
             effective form of contraception, one day before the first dose of study treatment (as
             appropriate), during the treatment period, and refrain from donating sperm during this
             period.

          6. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies: age related

             pregnancy testing.

        A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a female capable of becoming pregnant. It
        is also defined as any female who has experienced menarche and is not permanently sterile
        or postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses
        without alternative medical cause.

        Women of childbearing potential must agree to at least one method of birth control: a
        barrier method together or alone with a highly effective method to prevent pregnancy four
        weeks prior to randomization, throughout the study.

        The definition of highly effective contraception includes:

          -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation; oral, intravaginal or transdermal,

          -  Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide, c. Men must agree to use and have their
             female partners use a barrier method together with a highly effective contraceptive
             method as defined above.
