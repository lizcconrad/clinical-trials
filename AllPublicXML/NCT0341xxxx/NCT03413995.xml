  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to find out if the study drug rucaparib leads to lowering of PSA
      levels in men with metastatic prostate cancer that has not yet been treated with androgen
      deprivation therapy (also referred to as metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer) and
      who have an inherited mutation in a gene involved in repairing DNA damage. The research will
      also examine if rucaparib is safe in individuals with metastatic prostate cancer.

      Prior research studies have shown that drugs like rucaparib can be of benefit to patients
      with advanced metastatic prostate cancer who are resistant to androgen deprivation therapy
      AND who carry a mutation in a DNA repair gene. We are studying if rucaparib will be an
      effective treatment for these patients earlier in their treatment course (for example, prior
      to the start of medicines that lower testosterone level). It is unknown whether rucaparib
      will have the same benefit in men with metastatic prostate cancer carrying a mutation in a
      DNA repair gene, prior to the use of medicines that lower your testosterone level.

    <textblock>
      With respect to germline mutations, a recent study found that the incidence of inherited
      DNA-repair gene alterations in metastatic prostate cancer to be significantly higher (11.8%)
      than in both men with localized prostate cancer (4.6%) and in the general population at large
      (2.7%). Specifically, mutations in 7 genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51D, GEN1)
      were significantly enriched in patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared to the
      general population. These findings suggest that a subset of men are more likely to develop
      metastatic prostate cancer (i.e. those with germline mutations in DNA-repair genes) and may
      potentially benefit from PARPi therapy.

      The clinical activity of PARPi in patients with DNA-repair mutations and metastatic prostate
      cancer has now been established. Focusing specifically on patients with a germline mutation
      in a pre-specified group of DNA-repair genes, we hypothesize that targeted therapy with PARPi
      should be sufficient to induce a clinical response irrespective of hormonal
      (castration-sensitive or castration-resistant) status. Our hypothesis is based largely on the
      data from Mateo et al showing a clinical response rate of 88% in a heavily pre-treated
      population of mCRPC patients with a DNA repair mutation, with the most pronounced responses
      being in men with germline inactivation.

      For men with mHSPC, this trial would also provide an alternative to ADT. Identification of a
      non-hormonal based therapy is warranted as ADT is associated with a shorter time to
      castration resistance in men harboring a germline DNA repair mutation versus those with
      intact DNA repair. However, given that primary ADT (in mHSPC) is a standard first-line
      therapy, all patients on trial must be ineligible for or decline standard-of-care hormonal
      treatment. For patients with mHSPC who do not respond to PARPi, we will build safety rules
      into the trial design to take patients off study at first signs of progression. Primary ADT
      (mHSPC) would still remain a treatment option upon progression.
