  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess whether, in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, a
      low-fat, vegan diet improves pain and other subjective symptoms more effectively than a
      control supplement or a placebo. The principal measure is pain as measured by Visual Analog
      Scale (VAS) and disease activity as measured by number of painful swollen and tender joints,
      respectively. The study duration is 36 weeks.

      This study tests that a low fat, plant-based (vegan) diet free of foods commonly identified
      as triggers improves mood, using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
      Scale-Revised (CESD-R), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II).

      Preliminary evidence suggests that low-fat, vegetarian diets and certain nutritional
      supplements can help reduce pain and also reduce the need for pain medications for some
      people. The investigators will ask about 100 people to participate. All of them will get a
      low-fat, vegan diet and a nutritional supplement (mixture of omega-3 oils and vitamin E or a
      placebo), although some will get the diet first, and others will get the supplement first.
      This order in which they will get the diet and the supplement will be determined randomly,
      that is, by chance (like the toss of a coin). The principal measure is pain as measured by
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and disease activity as measured by number of painful swollen and
      tender joints, respectively. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)will be used to measure
      changes in mood. The study duration is 36 weeks.

          -  A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis based on 2010 ACR / EULAR Rheumatoid Arthritis
             Classification Criteria. Classification as &quot;definite RA&quot; is based on:

          -  the confirmed presence of synovitis in at least 1 joint

          -  absence of an alternative diagnosis that better explains the synovitis
