      conditions such as unwanted tattoos and benign pigmented lesions.

    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will evaluate the capability of the Lutronic PicoPlus technology to
      remove unwanted tattoos and benign pigmented lesions. This trial is designed as a
      multi-center exploratory, open-label clinical trial comparing each subject's condition before
      and after treatment. Subjects meeting all entrance criteria will be assigned to Group A for
      treatment of unwanted tattoos and Group B for treatment of unwanted benign pigmented lesions,
      melasma, or other skin conditions such as skin rejuvenation. Subjects in each treatment group
      will receive a series of treatments, e.g., 2-5, and will be asked to complete 1 and 3 month
      follow-up visit(s) following each treatment to assess treatment efficacy and safety. At
      investigators' discretion, additional follow-up visits, e.g., at 6 months following
      treatment, may take place to observe the time course of reactions after treatment and/or
      assess efficacy. Outcome measures include clinician grading and subject satisfaction
      post-treatment. Pre-treatment study photos will be obtained at baseline; post-treatment study
      photos will be obtained at each post-treatment follow-up visit.

Each reviewer will be asked to determine the temporal order (before and after) of each photo pair, and then rate the degree of tattoo clearing or reduction in benign pigmentation in the post-treatment photo using the following scale:
3 = Very significant or complete clearing (75-100%)

Each of four regions (forehead, right malar region, left malar region and chin) will be assessed based on three variables: percentage of the total area involved (A), darkness (D), and homogeneity (H).</description>
