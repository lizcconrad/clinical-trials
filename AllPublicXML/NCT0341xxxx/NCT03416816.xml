  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multi-center study of orally administered DSP-0337 in adult
      subjects with advance solid tumors that are refractory to standard treatment, or for whom no
      effective therapy exists.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is comprised of two parts: an initial dose escalation phase utilizing a 3 + 3
      design to determine maximum tolerated dose followed by a dose expansion cohort in
      approximately 40 additional subjects. Study participants will initially receive DSP-0337
      orally for 28 days (one cycle of treatment). If clinical benefit is seen, treatment can
      continue until disease progression.

An additional subset of patients will be treated to assess the effect of food intake on the PK of DSP-0337 administration at the MTD level. Once the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) has been established, patients will be treated with the RP2D to explore preliminary antitumor activity and safety profile.</description>

                  drug.

          8. Life expectancy must be ≥ 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria

             trial.

          2. Has received radiotherapy within the 28 days prior to first dose or within 12 weeks
             for patients with glioblastoma, with the exception of palliative radiotherapy to focal
             lesions for pain or other symptom control.

          3. Has received major surgery within the 4 weeks prior to starting the trial.

          4. Has significant inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             the study requirements.

          5. Clinically active known brain metastasis unless the brain metastases have been
             previously treated and are considered stable. Stable brain metastases are defined as
             no change on computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for a
             minimum of 2 months and no change in steroid dose for a minimum of 4 weeks prior to

             years previously with no subsequent evidence of recurrence. If the patient has a
             medical history of a previous tumor that is not included in this criteria and that the
             Investigator feels is irrelevant for the objectives of the study, it should be
             evaluated with the Sponsor or Medical Monitor.

          8. Has a corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt; 470 ms or has an electrocardiogram (ECG) with a
             new abnormal finding that is clinically significant.

          9. Has a known clinically significant GI disorder(s) including, but not limited to,
             inflammatory bowel disease or a history of extensive gastric resection and/or small
             intestinal resection.

         10. Has inability to take oral medications and/or has clinical or radiological diagnosis
             of bowel obstruction.
