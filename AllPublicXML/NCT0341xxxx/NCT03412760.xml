    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective study designed to investigate the genetic etiologies of
      non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) and other birth defects. In the setting of NIHF, up to
      40-50% of prenatally diagnosed cases remain of unknown etiology after standard work up, and a
      substantial proportion of other birth defects remain of unknown etiology as well. The
      investigators will perform whole exome sequencing (WES) for the fetus or neonate, as well as
      both biological parents, in each of these cases to investigate the underlying genetic
      etiology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1:1700 and 1:3000 pregnancies are affected by non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF), and
      this condition is associated with significant perinatal risks, ranging from preterm birth to
      Ballantyne (maternal mirror) syndrome, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Birth defects affect
      1:33 pregnancies, and are the leading cause of infant death (contributing to approximately
      20% of infant deaths). The investigators will perform whole exome sequencing (WES) for the
      fetus or neonate, as well as both biological parents, in each of these cases to investigate
      the underlying genetic etiology.

      The centers involved in this prospective cohort study are all a part of the University of
      California Fetal-Maternal Consortium (UCfC), which is a collaborative network of
      investigators with representatives from five UC medical centers (UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Los
      Angeles, UC San Diego, UC San Francisco). In addition to performing trio whole exome
      sequencing (WES), the investigators will also collect clinical data prospectively on all
      cases of NIHF and other birth defects, including demographics, medical and obstetric history,
      prenatal and delivery course, and postnatal outcomes until the infant is discharged from the
      hospital.

      The specific research aims include:

        1. Create a multi-center registry to collect clinical data for cases of non-immune hydrops
           fetalis (NIHF) and other birth defects.

        2. Investigate the genetic etiologies underlying NIHF and other birth defects via whole
           exome sequencing (WES).

        3. Develop a precision-based approach to antenatal and neonatal care in cases of NIHF and
           other birth defects by i) understanding not only the type of disease process, but also
           the implications of a particular genotype, and ii) improving the ability to predict
           prognosis, counsel patients, and tailor antenatal and postnatal management.

      This research will contribute novel information about the frequency and types of genetic
      disorders in fetuses and newborns with a diagnosis of NIHF and other birth defects, enabling
      providers to more accurately counsel about prognosis and individualize perinatal care. This
      information will also facilitate informed decision-making for parents, allow the care team to
      anticipate specific perinatal needs, and enable more precise counseling for the parents about
      recurrence risks for NIHF and other birth defects. Further, examining genotype-phenotype
      correlations will facilitate a precision-based approach to again individualize counseling and
      also enable targeted neonatal (and in the future, antenatal) therapies such as enzyme
      replacement and stem cell transplantation. The NIH has recognized the importance of such a
      precision-based approach to medical care.

    <intervention_model_description>All cases of non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) or other birth defects enrolled in the study will be offered whole exome sequencing (WES). This will be trio WES ideally, meaning that WES will be offered for the affected fetus as well as for both of the biologic parents. If one or both of the parents are unavailable, then duo or proband-only WES could be done, respectively.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Both NIHF and birth defects can be caused by a variety of genetic mutations that researchers are continuing to learn more about. Whole exome sequencing will yield information about the specific genetic mutations present in cases of NIHF and other birth defects, and about the specific diseases caused by these mutations. Investigators will determine the proportion of cases caused by particular genetic mutations, and will correlate phenotypic outcomes with specific genotypes.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Singletons or dichorionic twin pregnancies that are diagnosed prenatally with
             non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) or another birth defect. Cases with chromosomal
             abnormalities, postnatal samples, and stillbirths will still be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Monochorionic twin pregnancies and cases of hydrops fetalis that are attributed to red
             cell alloimmunization (due to hydrops fetalis caused by different pathophysiologic
             processes).
