  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well accepted that the greatest contributor to the health of the periodontium and
      dentition is regular and thorough dental plaque removal, typically by means of adequate
      toothbrushing. Although patients are typically informed about the risks of substandard oral
      hygiene and the contributing factors in oral/dental disease by dental professionals, research
      has shown that an undesirably high proportion of adults find thorough toothbrushing with a
      standard manual toothbrush to achieve a plaque-free state challenging, as evidenced by high
      worldwide levels of gingivitis and/or periodontitis.

      The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the plaque removal efficacy of two
      electric powered toothbrushes after a single use, as well as the effect on plaque
      accumulation and gingivitis after 14 days and 30 days period. Simultaneously, a comparison
      against a manual toothbrush will be made.

      Study design: randomised, single blinded, parallel.

      After the screening procedure and based on inclusion requirements, all subjects will receive
      oral prophylaxis (T0) to ensure a baseline of 0 Plaque Index (PI) prior to the first
      appointment (T1). The subjects will be instructed not to use a tooth brush or any mechanical
      cleaning device until the initial PI and Gingival Indexes (GI) are taken at 24 hours after
      T0.

      The subjects will be randomized into 3 groups, and the will be provided one of the three
      evaluated toothbrushes, as well as toothpaste. All subjects will be using identical
      toothpaste and will receive oral hygiene instructions based on the manufacturer's
      recommendations.

      At T1 initial GI and PI will be taken prior to brushing followed by a second PI reading
      immediately after the first use of the power driven toothbrush.

      The subjects will be instructed to brush twice a day for a period of 2 minutes (following the
      programmed toothbrush timer) and refrain from using dental floss, tooth pick or any
      mechanical oral hygiene aid for the period of the study.

      On the second visit at 14 days (T2) and third visit at 30 days (T3), additional GI and PI
      readings will be taken and data will be recorded. All measurements and clinical examinations
      will be performed by a single blinded examiner. Evaluation on teeth will be made on six teeth
      #3,7,12,19,23 and 28 (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-buccal and mesio-lingual, lingual,
      disto-lingual) following the Silness-Loe Index.
