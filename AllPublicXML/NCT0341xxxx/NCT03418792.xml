  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is an attempt to improve patient xerostomia (dry mouth) after definitive
      radiation therapy treatment for head and neck cancer. Xerostomia is a frequently experienced
      symptom for those receiving radiation therapies to the head and neck that persists after
      treatment, potentially indefinitely. It has been shown that stem/progenitor cells
      preferentially reside in large ducts of salivary glands and that these cells have the ability
      to repair radiation induced salivary damage. Current practice does not specifically attempt
      to spare these regions and considers the entire salivary gland to have equal importance and
      function. This study will involve the acquisition of pre-treatment MRI sialogram images which
      enable visualization of salivary ducts (using saliva itself as a contrast agent) that can
      then be avoided during radiation treatment planning. The primary objective will be to obtain
      patient reported outcomes (PRO) measure of xerostomia related symptoms for comparison with a
      historical cohort. Xerostomia symptom information will be obtained by use of a patient
      reported quality of life survey administered prior to treatment, six months after treatment,
      and one year after treatment. The secondary objectives will be to quantitatively assess
      post-treatment changes in salivary gland volume as well as ductal visibility using MRI
      sialograms. The study team hopes to acquire pre- and post-treatment images from 40 patients.
      The investigator hypothesizes that reducing the dose to these stem cell containing salivary
      ducts will facilitate improvements in patient reported symptoms as well as improved recovery
      of salivary gland volume and intra-glandular ductal visibility using MRI sialograms.
