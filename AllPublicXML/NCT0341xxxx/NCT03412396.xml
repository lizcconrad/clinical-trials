  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if giving apalutamide before surgery
      affects the prostate cancer and makes it less likely that patients will have to receive
      radiation therapy after having surgery to remove the prostate.

      The safety of the drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Apalutamide is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 45 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in the study, you will take 4 tablets of
      apalutamide by mouth each day for a total of 24 weeks (about 6 months) leading up to your
      standard-of-care prostate surgery. You should take apalutamide at about the same time every
      morning. Apalutamide may be taken with or without food. If you miss a dose, you should NOT
      take another dose until the next day. You should tell the study doctor as soon as possible if
      you miss a dose.

      Your dose may be changed, delayed, or stopped at any time that the study doctor thinks is in
      your best interest based on your reaction to the study drug. If at any time your dose has
      been delayed for more than 30 days, the study treatment will be stopped.

      You will be given diaries to record your apalutamide dose. Missed doses should also be
      recorded. You should bring these diaries to the clinic at each study visit.

      If treatment needs to be stopped for any reason, you will still have surgery within 2 weeks
      after your last dose of study drug, if the study doctor thinks it is the best treatment
      option for you.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may continue taking the study drug for up to 24 weeks leading up to surgery. You will no
      longer be able to take the study drug if your disease gets worse, if you have intolerable
      side effects, if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, if you are unable to
      follow study directions, or if you take certain drugs. A list of drugs that you should not
      take will be provided to you by the study nurse. Study treatment will also be stopped if
      during the week 9 visit your PSA level fails to drop 50% of its value.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      Before Surgery:

      At Weeks 1, 5, and 9 (+/- 3 days), the following will be performed. If any of these were
      performed within 14 days before your first dose of study drug, they may not need to be
      repeated:

        -  You will have a physical exam. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this will include a
           rectal exam. During Week 9 only, this physical exam must include a rectal exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check how well your blood
           clots, and to check your thyroid function, PSA, and testosterone levels.

      The study doctor will discuss the Week 9 test results with you. If the tests show that you
      are eligible to continue on in the study, you will. If not, other options will be discussed
      with you.

      At Week 12 (+/- 3 days), if the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an image-guided
      biopsy to check the status of the disease. To perform an image-guided biopsy, a needle is
      inserted into the affected area using imaging such as CT, ultrasound, or MRI to collect cells
      or tissue from an organ, lymph node, or suspected tumor mass. The doctor will use the imaging
      to guide the needle into the area. Two (2) types of samples may be collected. It will either
      be a fine needle aspirate (FNA) that collects cells and/or a core biopsy that collects a
      small piece of tissue.

      If you are not able to return to the clinic for a Week 12 visit, this procedure could take
      place at Week 9 or Week 17 instead.

      At Weeks 17 and 24 (+/- 3 days):

        -  You will have a physical exam. If the doctor thinks it is needed, this will include a
           rectal exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your thyroid
           function, PSA, and testosterone levels. This blood will also be used for biomarker
           testing.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

      Surgery:

      You will have a prostatectomy about 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug. You will be
      asked to sign a separate consent form for this surgery, and the risks will be discussed with
      you.

      Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) and tissue will be collected during this surgery for biomarker
      testing, which may include genetic biomarkers.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      Within 30 days (+/- 3 days) after surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a rectal
           exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PSA and testosterone testing.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

      At Months 6 and 12 (+/- 4 weeks) after surgery:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PSA and testosterone testing.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your quality of life.

      At Months 24, 36, 48, and 60 (+/- 4 weeks) after surgery, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be
      drawn to check the status of the disease and for PSA testing.

             on the evaluation of co-existent medical diseases and competing potential causes of
             death (such as but not limited to, unstable angina, myocardial infarction within the
             previous 6 months, or use of ongoing maintenance therapy for life-threatening
             ventricular arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension)

         12. History of seizure, seizure disorder, or any condition that may predispose to seizure
