      Primary Objective:

      To collect real-use (usability) data assessing the robustness and user interaction of the new
      alirocumab auto-injector device (which is referred to as SYDNEY), in unsupervised settings.

      Secondary Objective:

      Device-related:

        -  To collect real-use (usability) data assessing the robustness and user interaction of
           SYDNEY and the current alirocumab auto-injector device (which is referred to as AI) in
           supervised settings.

      Pharmacokinetics:

        -  To compare alirocumab pharmacokinetics (PK) administered using SYDNEY and AI.

        -  To evaluate alirocumab PK administered using SYDNEY.

      Anti-drug antibodies:

        -  To evaluate the development of anti-drug (alirocumab) antibodies (ADA).

      Efficacy/pharmacodynamics:

        -  To compare the percent and absolute change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
           (LDL-C) using SYDNEY and AI.

        -  To evaluate the percent and absolute change in LDL-C using SYDNEY.

      Safety:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab using both SYDNEY and AI.

               -  B. Non-FH patients at high or very high cardiovascular (CV) risk. High and very
                  high cardiovascular risk patients include patients with coronary heart disease

          -  Currently taking a daily dose of statin that is not atorvastatin 20 mg or 40 mg, or
             rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg.

          -  Not on a stable dose of LMT (including statin) for at least 4 weeks, prior to the
             screening visit and from screening to randomization.

          -  Having previously used any device for the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type
             9 (PCSK9) inhibitor administration, or having participated in any clinical trial for a
             PCSK9 inhibitor.

          -  Fasting serum Triglyceride (TG) &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.52 mmol/L) at the screening visit.
