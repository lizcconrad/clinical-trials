        Inclusion Criteria:

        Investigators included term newborns with critical structural CHD (of different types) who
        required surgical or transcatheter procedure in the first year of life. CHD were diagnosed
        by pediatric cardiologist by clinical examination and echocardiography.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria were pulmonary or neurological disease, perinatal asphyxia, acute
        illness, prematurity and congenital abnormality other than CHD.
