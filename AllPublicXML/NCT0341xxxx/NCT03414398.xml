  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine what influences the patient and caregiver
      perception of care, and if this perception associates with the percentage of and what quality
      metrics are being met and outcomes. The investigators also plan to capture the cost of
      providing quality metrics and the cost of monitoring adherence to quality metrics.

      This study will be conducted using mixed-methods. The qualitative part will consist of in
      person, 1:1, open ended in depth interviews using a standard interview guide with probes. The
      quantitative part will document subjects meeting or not meeting the quality metrics supported
      by strong evidence, clinical outcomes, and medical bills.

    <description>We will explore adherence with proposed portal hypertension quality metric (physician follows the management (yes/no)) to see if there is an association with survival. The quality metric will be identified as either being met or not met, and survival will also be identified as having occurred or not.</description>
