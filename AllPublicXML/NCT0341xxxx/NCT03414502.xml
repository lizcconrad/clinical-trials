      This is an open-label, prospective study of methotrexate in patients with early rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) designed to characterize the subset of RA patients that respond best to
      methotrexate monotherapy. Eligible patients will be adults with RA who are naïve to prior
      methotrexate or combination disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy. Patients
      will be started on methotrexate at 15 mg once weekly, with the dose escalated to 20 mg once
      weekly at 8 weeks for patients not in remission. Patients will be assessed with joint counts
      and laboratory monitoring at study entry, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks. Primary endpoint will be
      achievement of ACR 50 (American College of Rheumatology 50) criteria. Investigators will
      collect serum for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibody isotyping and, in patients who
      sign a separate consent, DNA for genotype analysis. This should allow Investigators not only
      to evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate monotherapy but also to identify predictors of a
      good therapeutic response and evaluate the tolerability of a more aggressive dosing regimen.

      The purpose of the study is to gather, in a prospective manner, information on patients with
      early rheumatoid arthritis and their response to methotrexate therapy. Specific aims of this
      study are:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate monotherapy as defined by attaining ACR 50
           response after 16 weeks of therapy.

        -  To identify predictors of methotrexate response in patients with RA.

        -  Does presence of the shared epitope predict methotrexate response

        -  Does evidence of periodontal disease predict methotrexate response

      A maximum of 120 RA patients will be consented for this protocol. This subject accrual will
      include UNMC and the RAIN (Rheumatoid Arthritis Investigational Network). Investigators have
      examined the discriminatory characteristics of several clinical and biologic parameters in
      predicting treatment response (at least 50% improvement based on ACR criteria) in initial
      analyses involving 54 participants with early RA treated with methotrexate monotherapy in
      past RAIN clinical trials. In the initial analyses, factors showing discriminatory
      characteristics have included rheumatoid factor (RF) isotypes (particularly IgA and IgM),
      matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (SE)-containing alleles, C-reactive
      protein, and interleukin (IL)-1. For instance, we have found that subjects with low serum
      concentrations of RF-IgM (&lt; 27 IU/ml) are more likely to be non-responders than those with
      higher (&gt; 27 IU/ml) serum concentrations (79% vs. 43%).

      Males and females will participate in this protocol. As RA is approximately three times more
      common in females, it is anticipated that a higher percentage of the study subjects will be
      female. Subjects will be &gt; 19 years of age. This age range was chosen because the age of
      majority in Nebraska is 19. RA diagnosed before the age of 19 may not have the same disease
      characteristics as defined by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criterion for RA.
      Pediatric subjects will not be enrolled in this study. Rheumatoid arthritis occurs in all
      races. No enrollment restrictions have been based on race or ethnic origin.

    <description>This study is a 16-week, open-label study designed to identify the subset of RA patients that respond to methotrexate monotherapy. All patients will receive methotrexate at a starting dose of 15 mg once weekly plus folic acid 1 mg daily. If a patient is not in remission by 8 weeks, then the dose will be escalated as tolerated to 20 mg once weekly. Both oral and injectable methotrexate are acceptable.
If the patient is unable to tolerate the Methotrexate at 15 mg, it is allowed to titrate the dose as tolerated as long as patient remains on Methotrexate.</description>
