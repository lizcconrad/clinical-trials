  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Overweight and obesity affect health, quality of life and ability to work.
      Therefore, the scientifically evaluated program &quot;SHAPE AND MOTION - medically ◦ accompanied ◦
      slimming&quot; was developed to support overweight and obese people in weight loss.

      Method: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, the effect of a lifestyle intervention
      with meal replacement by formula diet, exercise stimulation, and telemedicine coaching is
      examined compared to a control group with routine care. The learning contents are taught in 7
      group trainings, a practical unit with shopping and cooking training, as well as in 4
      individual telephone conversations. The state of health is examined at the beginning, after
      12 and 26 weeks.

      Objective: The aim is to develop a training and counseling program for overweight or obese
      individuals with diabetes risk or type 2 diabetes, which can be used both for primary and for
      tertiary prevention of overweight-related diseases.
