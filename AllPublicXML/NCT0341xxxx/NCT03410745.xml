  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of exercise on the turnover of collagen in articular
      cartilage and the content of cytokines in the synovial fluid from human adults with
      osteoarthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By using stabile isotope labelling, this study will track the formation and destination of
      newly formed cartilage collagen in adult humans scheduled for knee replacement surgery due to
      osteoarthritis. The collagen formation as well as the effect on the cytokine content of the
      synovial fluid will be examined both at rest and in response to 4 weeks of exercise/training.
      Overall the project aims to improve the basic understanding of cartilage development and
      function in relation to osteoarthritis prevention.
