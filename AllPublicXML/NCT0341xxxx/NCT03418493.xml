  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well LY3316531 is tolerated and what side
      effects may occur in healthy participants and participants with psoriasis. The study drug
      will be administered either subcutaneously (SC) (under the skin) or intravenously (IV) (into
      a vein in the arm).

      This is a three-part study. Participants will enroll in only one part. Parts A and B are for
      healthy participants and Part C is for participants with psoriasis. Participation could last
      between 16 and 57 weeks.
