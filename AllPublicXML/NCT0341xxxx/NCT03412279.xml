  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), SF-12
      Health Survey, Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ) are
      important and widely used validated patient self-reported measures commonly used in clinical
      trials and health research involving patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.
      However, till date, validated Hausa versions of these tools are unavailable for use despite
      not only Hausa language is commonly spoken in Nigeria but in other parts of the world.

      The purpose of this study is to perform, using evidence-based guidelines, translation,
      cultural adaptation and validation of the ODI, RMDQ, SF-12 health survey, PCS, and BBQ into
      Hausa language among CLBP patients in Northern Nigeria.

    <textblock>
      This study will test the psychometric properties (i.e validity; reliability, and ceiling
      effect) of the ODI-H, RMDQ-H, SF-12-H, PCS-H and BBQ-H in Hausa speaking CNLBP individuals.
      Rural and urban participants with CNLBP will be recruited purposively. Copies of the
      translated Hausa versions of the ODI, RMDQ, SF-12, PCS, BBQ, and FABQ as well as VAS for pain
      and disability will be self or interviewer-administered. Lumbopelvic mobility using
      finger-floor distance test (FFD) will be also measured.The Hausa versions of the ODI, RMDQ,
      SF-12, PCS, and BBQ will be administered again a week after.

      Data will be analysed using descriptive and correlation analysis using SPSS (version 24.00)
      at alpha level of 0.05.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability will be measured by the Hausa Oswestry disability index (ODI-H). The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having six statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in functional disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Functional disability will be measured by the Hausa Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ-H). The score ranges from 0 to 24, with 0 indicating no disability and 24 maximum disability.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be measured using the Hausa SF-12 Health Hurvey (SF-12-H). The questionnaire consists of 12 items questioned weighted and summed to provide physical and mental health scores (PCS and MCS). The two composite scores are computed using the scores on twelve questions that range from 0 to 100, with higher score indicating better health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain catastrophization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophization will be measured by the Hausa Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS-H). The scale consists of 13 items rated on 5-point ordinal scale (0-5).The total score ranges from 0-52 with higher score indicating more catastrophic thoughts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in back beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Back pain beliefs will be evaluated by the Hausa Back Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ-H). The questionnaire consists of 14 items with 9 items ranked on a 5 point scale and used to calculate a final score from 9 to 45. Higher scores are indicative of better LBP beliefs and indicate the potential of a better ability to cope with LBP.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fear avoidance beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 week after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Fear avoidance beliefs will be measured by the Hausa fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FABQ-H). The questionnaire consists of 16 self-response items, rated on a seven-point ordinal scale from 0 to 6. It also contains two subscales, a 7-item subscale concerning work, and a 4-item subscale concerning physical activity. Each subscale scores are summed giving possible ranges for the physical activity subscale of 0-24 and for the work subscale between 0-42. Higher score indicate greater fear and avoidance beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Intensity will be measured by 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-P), in which 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>Disability will be measured by 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-D), in which 0 represents &quot;no disability&quot; and 10 represents &quot;severe disability&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in mobility of the spine and pelvis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
