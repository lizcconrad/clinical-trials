  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In type 2 diabetes (T2D), physical activity is an important modifiable risk factor of
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Unfortunately (long-term) compliance to exercise programs in
      patients with T2D is poor. Light-intensity physical activity (LiPA) such as walking slowly,
      household activities or taking a flight of stairs might be a potential target for lowering
      the CVD risk in patients with T2D since it can perhaps be more be incorporated into daily
      life. To assess cardiovascular disease risk in this single-blinded RCT, the investigators
      settled on measuring arterial stiffness as the primary outcome. Arterial stiffness has
      independent predictive value for cardiovascular events and can be measured reliably and
      non-invasively. The investigators hypothesize that light intensity physical activity
      intervention program based upon increasing LiPA by replacing sedentary time is effective in
      lowering arterial stiffness as estimated by aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid
      distensibility in individuals with T2D.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total duration of the RCT is 12 months, with the first 6 month as the intervention period and
      the last 6 months as follow-up.

      Community-dwelling individuals with type 2 diabetes are eligible for participation in the
      trial, taking into account the in- and exclusion criteria described below, 160 participants
      will be included, 80 in each study arm. Study measurements of all participants will take
      place at baseline (month 1 (t = 0)), month 3 (t = 3), month 6 (t = 6, and month 12 (t = 12)
      at the Maastricht UMC+.

      Participants in the intervention group will be instructed to increase their LiPA by
      decreasing sedentary time. Participants will follow 4 workshops in group sessions on
      strategies to change their physical activity behaviour and will receive a feedback physical
      activity monitor that will be worn continuously on the wrist and provide e-feedback on
      activity behaviour.

      Participants in the control group will receive 4 workshops in group sessions on healthy
      lifestyle including information and strategies to increase LiPA and reduce sedentary time
      similar to the intervention group, but will not receive a feedback-activity monitor.

      Screening A preliminary screening will be carried out by telephone interview. If eligibility
      criteria are met the participant will attend the baseline visit which starts with the
      informed consent procedure. Afterwards, a standard physical examination will take place and
      an ultrasound scan will be performed to screen for large atherosclerotic plaques of the
      carotid arteries. If the participant is indeed eligible for inclusion, the investigational
      baseline measurements are performed after which randomization will take place. From then on
      participants will run through the protocol either being part of the intervention or control
      group.

      Measurements at the four investigational visits (t = 0, 3, 6 and 12)

        -  sociodemographic data

        -  medical history &amp; medication use: by means of an interview

        -  lifestyle factors (alcohol use and smoking behaviour), quality of life, depressive
           symptoms - by means of questionnaires

        -  Sedentary and physical activity monitoring: by means of the activPAL® activity monitor
           for 7 days

        -  venous sampling (approx. 25 ml per person per visit; 5 collecting tubes of 5 ml) for
           fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1c, lipid profile, creatinin, albumin and
           biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (vWF, s-VCAM-1, sE-selectin, sTM, SICAM-1) and
           low-grade inflammation(CRP, SAA, IL-6, TNF-alfa, IL-8)

        -  Anthropometric data (height, weight, waist and hip circumference and bio-electrical
           impedance measurements)

        -  vascular measurement (arterial stiffness and blood pressure)

        -  physical function measurements (grip strength and timed chair test)

        -  Objective measurement of light-intensity physical activity through activPAL ® activity
           monitor that will be worn for 7 days continuously at baseline, month 3, month 6, and
           month 12. This device is blinded to the participant. Data from the activPAL provide
           detailed and accurate information on the participants' sedentary, standing, and stepping
           time for each day.

      Sample size calculation In order to be able to detect a 10% difference in PWV and similarly a
      10% difference in carotid distensibility (the primary objectives of the study) after the
      intervention between the intervention group and the control group, both groups should consist
      of at least 73 participants each if assuming a probability of a type 1 error at 0.05 (i.e.,
      alfa) and an 80% (i.e., beta) ability to detect a true difference between the intervention
      group and the control group. These estimates are conservative taking into account only PWV
      values at entry and exit of the trial. The 10% difference is speculative and based upon a
      mean PWV estimates from 'The Maastricht Study' data as there is currently no data available
      on LiPA and arterial stiffness. In order to correct for potential drop out (roughly estimated
      at 10%) 80 participants will be included in each group.

      Statistical analysis The significance levels used in the statistical analyses will be 0.05.
      The validity of the normality assumption will be checked for all outcomes. Baseline
      characteristics will be compared between the intervention and the control group. For
      continuous variables (e.g. age, BMI) mean and standard deviations will be presented; numbers
      and percentages will be shown for categorical variables (e.g. smoking, medication use).
      T-tests will be used to compare differences in continuous baseline characteristics between
      the intervention and control group and chi-square test will be used for categorical
      variables. Assuming that the randomization was successful, no differences are expected.
      Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputations techniques.

      Primary study parameter(s) The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome PWV at month
      6 will be analysed using intention-to-treat (ITT) approach according to randomization
      assignment. The ITT analyses will be used as primary method for our statistical analyses and
      any outcomes in our reports will be primarily based upon these ITT analyses. In addition, a
      per protocol analysis will be performed for those who attended the workshops. These analyses
      will be used to gain some insights into any potential non-response / drop out. These per
      protocol analyses will not be the primary source for reporting outcomes. General linear
      models will be used to analyse the effect of the intervention on PWV at month 6. In addition,
      repeated measures will be taken into account, baseline, month 3, and month 6 using mixed
      models in SPSS. In these models, subject is entered as a random effect and intervention
      (categorical variable with 2 levels: 1: intervention; 2: control group) as a fixed effect
      .The baseline value of PVW and sex will be used as covariates in analyses.

      Secondary study parameter(s) Sedentary time, as measured by the activPAL will be analysed as
      total sedentary minutes on an average day as well as the percentage of sedentary during wake
      time. Similarly, time standing and stepping, also derived from the activPAL data will be
      analysed. All metabolic health parameters will also be analysed as continuous variables.
      Quality of life and mental functioning are also analysed as continuous variables. Finally,
      measures of body composition measures are also all continuous outcomes variables. Similar to
      the primary outcome analyses, general linear mixed models will be used the analyses the
      change the secondary outcome measures from baseline to month 6. Using mixed models, the
      repeated measures will be taken into account similar the analyses with the primary outcome.

      All analyses, for the both primary and secondary outcomes will also be conducted for the
      follow-up (month 12 data) to examine the long-term effect of the intervention, taking into
      account all repeated measures (baseline, month 3, month 6) in a mixed model.

      Primary study parameter(s) The effect of the intervention on the primary outcome PWV at month
      6 will be analysed using intention-to-treat (ITT) approach according to randomization

      Secondary study parameter(s) Sedentary time, as measured by activPAL will be analysed as
      total sedentary minutes on an average day as well as the percentage of sedentary time during
      wake time. Similarly, time standing and stepping, derived from activPAL data, will be
      analysed. All metabolic health parameters will be analysed as continuous variables while
      quality of life and mental functioning are analysed as continuous variables. Finally,
      measures of body composition measures are all continuous outcomes variables.

      Similar to the primary outcome analyses, general linear mixed models will be used to analyse
      the changes in secondary outcome measures from baseline to month 6. Using mixed models, the
      repeated measures will be taken into account.

      Additionally, all analyses, for both primary and secondary outcomes, will be conducted for
      the follow-up (month 12 data) to examine the long-term effect of the intervention, taking
      into account all repeated measures (baseline, month 3, month 6) in a mixed model.
