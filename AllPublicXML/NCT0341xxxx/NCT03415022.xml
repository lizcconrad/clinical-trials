    <textblock>
      The present study is an open trial that seeks to examine the feasibility, acceptability,
      mechanism, and efficacy of a recently developed computer-based therapy in individuals with
      social anxiety disorder (SAD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial examines the feasibility, acceptability, mechanism, and
      relative efficacy of two &quot;doses&quot; (standard 4-week/8 session vs. extended 8-week/12-session)
      of a recently developed computer-based therapy in individuals with social anxiety disorder
      (SAD). The purpose of this study is to assess whether a brief computer-based research
      treatment, provided in 30 minutes sessions, helps improve social anxiety symptoms, and by
      what mechanism. The study will also assess the effect of research treatments on brain
      activity using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
