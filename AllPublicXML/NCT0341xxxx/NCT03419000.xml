  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden and unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) has become a major issue for patients with
      epilepsy and their physicians. SUDEP is a nontraumatic and non-drowning death in patients
      with epilepsy, unrelated to a documented status epilepticus, in which postmortem examination
      does not reveal a toxicologic or anatomic cause of death. It primarily affects young adults
      with drug-resistant epilepsy, with an incidence of about 0.5%/year. A recent study reported
      that up to 20% of patients with childhood onset drug resistant epilepsy will die of a SUDEP
      by the age of 45. Apart from optimizing antiepileptic drugs, no preventive treatment is
      available to prevent SUDEP. As underscored by the World Health Organization (WHO), there is
      an urgent need to develop specific therapeutic approaches to tackle this issue.

      The primary objective of the proposal is to evaluate the diagnostic value of a set of
      circulating microRNAs pre-selected because of their implication in the regulation of
      molecular pathways involved in the respiratory regulation to identify patients with
      seizure-related respiratory dysfunction, as defined by occurrence ictal/peri-ictal pulse
      oxymetry &lt; 90%.

      A total of 50 patients will be included over a period of one year. Patients undergoing
      long-term video-EEG/SEEG monitoring will be recruited in the epilepsy monitoring unit of the
      Department of Functional Neurology and Epileptology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.

      It will be a case-control study in a cohort of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy
      undergoing long-term video-EEG monitoring, in which patients who demonstrate ictal/post-ictal
      hypoxemia (cases) will be compared with those without seizure-related respiratory dysfunction
      (controls).
