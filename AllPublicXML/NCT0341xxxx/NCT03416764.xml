  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to explore the relationship between estrogen-related plasticity in
      limbic circuits and response to amygdala-electrical-fingerprint focused neurofeedback
      (EFP-NF) among women with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Treatment groups will
      differ by phase of cycle where treatment is given, and effects are expected to differ based
      on estrogen levels during treatment. Greater effects are expected in the high-estrogen phase
      treated group on both symptoms and neural changes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women are twice as likely as men to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following
      trauma. Particularly, women with a history of sexual abuse have shown sustained impairment,
      including difficulties in emotional regulation and poor response to existing treatments.

      Novel, neuroscience-informed treatment such as amygdala-focused, electrical fingerprint based
      neurofeedback, has shown promise in deficits associated with PTSD, as it trains patients to
      control activation of amygdala, a major neural system involved in emotional regulation and
      response, in real time and in a non-invasive manner. This treatment has shown results
      including sustained modulation of limbic circuits and improvement in emotional regulation,
      suggesting particular promise for women with a history of sexual abuse.

      In recent years, female-specific mechanisms of response to trauma, and particularly the role
      of estrogens, began receiving research attention. Particularly, estrogen-related effects on
      fear processing have been explored, delineating different processing depending on time in
      cycle among women with PTSD. However, the neural substrates of these patterns, likely to
      involve limbic circuits, have yet to be tested, and relevance to treatment planning has not
      been investigated.

    <description>Using fMRI, specific changes in limbic system connectivity will be assessed. Changes in areas in the PFC, specifically rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), ventromedial PFC/subgenual ACC (vmPFC/sgACC), and between rACC and hippocampus, and mygdala synchronicity with medial prefrontal regions, all will be measured at post- vs. pre-treatment times.</description>
