             method of contraception as outlined in Section 11.7, for the course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including current active infection requiring
             systemic therapy or symptomatic congestive heart failure within 6 months

          -  Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include
             carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.

          -  Evidence of clinically significant immunosuppression such as the following:

               -  Primary immunodeficiency state such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease

               -  Receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy (&gt; 2 weeks) including oral steroid
                  doses &gt; 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent within 7 days prior to enrollment.
                  However, in the setting of non-immune mediated indications for steroid use,
                  chronic/active low dose steroid use may be permitted at the discretion of the
                  principal investigator. The dose of steroid allowed in this setting is also at
                  the discretion of the principal investigator. (Use of inhaled or topical steroids
                  is permitted.)

             glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or other), or history of active autoimmune disease
             that has required systemic treatment (i.e., use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive
             drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past 2 years
             prior to enrollment. Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin
             for diabetes or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or
             pituitary insufficiency) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune

             planned study therapy. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the
             following: measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus
             Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for
             injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal
             influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not
             allowed.

          -  Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study

             device within 2 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has had a prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biological therapy, targeted small
             molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 3 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has

                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy
                  events due to a previously administered agent.

          -  Subjects expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the
             trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit through 120 days after the
             last dose of study treatment(s).

          -  Inability to comply with protocol required procedures

          -  Subjects receiving Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) or drug which has significant

             opinion, is clinically meaningful. Screening QTc interval 480 milliseconds is
             excluded. In the event that a single QTc is ≥ 480 milliseconds, the subject may enroll
             if the average QTc for the 3 ECGs is &lt; 480 milliseconds. For subjects with an
             intraventricular conduction delay (QRS interval &gt; 120 milliseconds), the JTc interval
             may be used in place of the QTc with the approval of the principal investigator. The
             JTc must be &lt; 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTc. Subjects with left
             bundle branch block are excluded.

        Note: QTc prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal.

          -  Use of any UGT1A9 inhibitor from screening through follow-up period, including the

             therapy or single agent IDO1 inhibitor will be eligible for this study.
