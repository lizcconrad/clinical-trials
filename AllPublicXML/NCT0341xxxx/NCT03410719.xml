      the aim of this study is to evaluate whether a Mediterranean diet rich in pasta and other
      starchy foods with a (Low-GI), as compared with a similar Mediterranean diet containing very
      little pasta and based on starchy foods with a (Hi-GI) is able to reduce insulin and glucose
      concentrations during a prolonged test study meal.

      The overall aim of this study is to evaluate whether a Mediterranean diet rich in pasta and
      other starchy foods with a low glycemic response (Low-GI), as compared with a similar
      Mediterranean diet containing very little pasta and based on starchy foods with a high
      glycemic response (Hi-GI) is able to reduce insulin and glucose concentrations during a
      prolonged test study meal.

    <time_frame>15weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will consume the same quantities of metabolizable carbohydrate (270 g/d) with 135 g of carbohydrates assigned to the GI intervention foods. The 135 g of carbohydrates will be distributed as 35 g GI breakfast product, 40 g GI lunch product, and 60 g GI dinner product. Fiber is set as 35 g/d for both intervention groups. Assuming an average 2400 kcal/d total energy requirement among subjects, the 270 g/d metabolizable CHO equates to 40% of total energy intake (1080 kcal/d). One-half of daily CHO intake (135 g/d) will be the same between the Hi-GI and Low-GI groups, including CHOs in fruits, vegetables, and other foods that all subjects will consume. The other one-half of daily CHO intake (135 g) will be different between the Low-GI and Hi-GI groups. Specifically, the GI values of these foods will either be &lt;55 (Low-GI group) or &gt;70 (Hi-GI group).</description>
