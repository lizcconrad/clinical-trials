      Objective: The study aims to understand the physical function, body composition, mental
      state, behavior, depression, and life quality change of the elderly in a long-term care
      before and after the intervention. Four interventional activities are sitting strength
      training, games, sitting strength training with games, and health education.

      Expected results: (1) The program will facilitate arrange activities that are beneficial to
      the body and mind, activate bodily functions, and promote the quality of life of the elderly
      in Taiwan. (2) The program can compare the effectiveness of different trainings for the
      elderly and provide a reference for future implementation planning. (3) Evidence of the
      empirical study of this program can provide future comparisons with other domestic and
      foreign studies.
