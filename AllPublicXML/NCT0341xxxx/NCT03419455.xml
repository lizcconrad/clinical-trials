  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased risk of several cancers. Suggested mechanisms mediating
      the obesity-cancer associations include hyperinsulinemia and altered IGF signaling, changes
      in sex hormone levels as well as altered secretion of adipokines and inflammatory proteins.
      However, little is known about the influence of lifetime adiposity on the relevant
      biomarkers. Moreover, although diet has been suggested to ameliorate the adverse metabolic
      effects of obesity, convincing evidence regarding how dietary factors may influence
      obesity-related carcinogenic pathways remains lacking. Thus, in the current project, the
      investigators aim to 1) examine the associations between trajectories of body fatness and
      plasma biomarker levels of the insulin/IGF system, sex hormones and biomarkers of
      inflammatory response including adipokines; 2) investigate how nutritional factors may
      modulate these obesity-related biomarkers. The investigators propose to utilize two large
      ongoing cohorts of US men and women, the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals
      Follow-up Study.

    <textblock>
      According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there is sufficient
      evidence that avoidance of weight gain reduces the risk of several cancers, including
      colorectal, breast (postmenopause), pancreatic, endometrial, kidney (renal-cell), liver,
      gallbladder, oesophageal (adenocarcinoma), multiple myeloma, meningioma, ovarian, thyroid and
      stomach (cardia) cancer. Several mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the obesity-cancer
      association, including increased insulin levels and bioavailability of insulin-like growth
      factor (IGF)-1, low-grade chronic inflammation, and changes in sex hormone levels.

      In previous studies, the investigators have identified five heterogeneous trajectory groups
      of body fatness from age five and up to 60 years (lean-stable, lean-moderate increase,
      lean-marked increase, medium-stable, and heavy-stable/increase). These trajectories have been
      associated with distinct patterns of cancer incidence and mortality. Having excess body
      weight at any life period have been associated with increased risk of total and obesity
      related cancers. How the various trajectories of body shape relate to cancer relevant risk
      biomarkers is however yet to be determined.

      To gain a better understanding of the complex interplay between obesity, obesity-related risk
      biomarkers and cancer development, the investigators aim to examine the associations between
      trajectories of body fatness and cancer relevant risk biomarkers in the Nurses' Health Study
      and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Moreover, the investigators will examine how
      nutritional factors, such coffee intake, may modulate the levels of these biomarkers.

      The investigators hypothesize that in general individuals who have excess body weight at any
      life period will have a more unfavorable biomarker profile than those who are lean across the
      lifespan, although a different pattern may be expected for some markers. Also, the
      investigators hypothesize that some nutritional factors, such high intake of coffee, may
      ameliorate the adverse metabolic effects of obesity by modulating the levels of these
      biomarkers.

        The current project uses data from two large US cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study
        (NHS) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS). The NHS recruited 121,701
        registered female nurses aged 30 to 55 years at baseline in 1976, and the HPFS enrolled
        51,529 male health professionals aged 40 to 75 years at baseline in 1986. Since enrollment,
        questionnaires have been administrated every two years to collect updated lifestyle and
        medical information. Blood samples were collected in 1989-90 in the NHS and 1993-95 in the
        HPFS. A total of 32 826 blood samples were returned in the NHS and 18 159 in the HPFS.
