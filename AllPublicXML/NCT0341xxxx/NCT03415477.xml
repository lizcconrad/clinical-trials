  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of traditional therapeutic approaches for aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC), such as
      surgery, embolization, sclerotherapy and radiotherapy, are often compromised for lesions in
      axial skeletons and adolescents complicated with pathological fracture. Therefore, denosumab,
      a new drug that has been successfully used in giant cell tumor of bone but has seldom used in
      ABC, was used to treat ABC in this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary ABC treated with perioperative denosumab in the Musculoskeletal Tumor
      Center of Peking University People's Hospital between January 2014 and December 2016 will be
      reported in this trial.Approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking University People's
      Hospital and with the full informed consent from the patients or their families, all patients
      received surgery and treatment with denosumab perioperatively. Denosumab 120 mg was given
      subcutaneously (abdomen wall or upper arms) every 4 weeks (Q4W), with a loading dose on both
      Day 8 and Day 15 of the first cycle. Meanwhile, all patients were suggested to take 800mg
      oral calcium supplement every day and avoid any dental or oral surgery (tooth extraction,
      tooth filling, etc.). Patients were followed once a month since the date of surgery. On
      follow-up visits, patient-reported adverse reactions, X-ray image of jawbone, serum calcium,
      alkaline phosphatase, renal and hepatic function, hemoglobin, white blood cell, and platelet
      count were collected, and histological examinations, radiological examinations (such as
      X-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emission
      tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and postoperative functional status evaluations by
      MSTS（Musculoskeletal tumor society） score were conducted.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. pathologically diagnosed with primary aneurysmal bone cyst

          2. lesions in axial skeletons (i.e. spine, pelvis) which are difficult to reach a
             satisfactory surgical margin, and surgery can lead to very high incidence of
             complications.

          3. pathological fracture

          4. recurrence cases

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. metastases or multi-focal lesions

          2. malignancy
