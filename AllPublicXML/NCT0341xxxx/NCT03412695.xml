  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of disease-related malnutrition among hospitalized patients is 30-50%. There
      is a lack of tools to follow up the nutritional treatment of these patients. The
      investigators develop the decision support system &quot;MyFood&quot; which can be used to assess
      patients' dietary intake, evaluate intake against individual needs, and propose nutrition
      related measures and an individual nutrition plan for each patient. The investigators will
      study the clinical effects of using MyFood among hospitalized patients. In addition the
      implementation of the tool among healthcare workers will be studied.

      The prevalence of disease-related malnutrition among hospitalized patients is 30-50%.
      Disease-related malnutrition increase the morbidity and mortality among patients and leads to
      longer length of stay. There is a lack of tools to follow up the nutritional treatment of
      patients at nutritional risk. The decision support system &quot;MyFood&quot; are developed in the
      project with the purpose to prevent and treat disease-related malnutrition. MyFood includes 4
      modules: 1) A function to register patient needs and symptoms, 2) Dietary assessment
      function, 3) Automatic evaluation of dietary intake compared to individual needs, 4)
      Feedback, including a report on intake of energy, protein, and liquids compared to individual
      needs, and recommendations for nutritional measures and an individual nutrition plan.

      Clinical effects of using MyFood among hospitalized patients will be studied in a randomized
      controlled trial. In addition, the implementation of the tool among nurses and other
      healthcare workers will be explored.
