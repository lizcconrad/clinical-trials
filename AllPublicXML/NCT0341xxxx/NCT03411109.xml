    <textblock>
      Multimodal analgesia, sometimes including intrathecal analgesia (IA), is essential in any
      enhanced recovery pathway (ERP). This study aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and
      optimal IA regimen in colorectal surgical patients.

    <description>All intrathecal injections were performed preoperatively using a 22g or 25 g Whitacre or 24g Sprotte spinal needle. The IA regimen, medication(s) and dose(s), was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist, and consisted of one of the following regimens: (1) hydromorphone + local anesthetic (IA-L), or (2) hydromorphone only (IA-O). In patients receiving IA, no other interventional locoregional analgesic techniques (such as rectus sheath blocks or transversus abdominis plane blocks) were utilized.</description>
