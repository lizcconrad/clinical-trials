    <textblock>
      Chidamide，a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of
      relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in China. The aim of this study was to
      observe the efficacy and safety of Chidamide as a single-agent treatment in patients with
      relapsed or refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Follicular Lymphoma (FL).
      Moreover, the aim was to study the correlation of clinical efficacy to mutation of certain
      genes as well.
