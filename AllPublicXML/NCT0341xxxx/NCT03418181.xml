  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who start haemodialysis usually retain some natural kidney function for months or
      years after starting dialysis. Even a small amount of this natural kidney function can be
      helpful in reducing the need for dietary and fluid restriction. There is also good evidence
      that retaining a small amount of natural kidney function may provide a survival benefit for
      patients on dialysis.

      Most patients who commence haemodialysis start three times per week for 3.5-4 hours per
      session, irrespective of the amount of natural kidney function they may have. An alternative
      approach used in some kidney units is to take account of the natural kidney function in
      prescribing the amount of dialysis. This may allow patients to start treatment needing to
      spend less time on dialysis or even to start just twice weekly. The amount of dialysis can be
      adjusted over time as natural kidney function declines. This is called &quot;incremental
      haemodialysis&quot;. Both of these approaches are considered to be standard care although it is
      not known which approach is more beneficial to patients.

      There are some suggestions that the frequency of dialysis may influence the rate of decline
      of natural kidney function but this need to be tested in a large randomised study. To inform
      the design of such a study, a smaller scale feasibility study is required.

      We intend to randomise fifty new starters on haemodialysis with adequate natural kidney
      function into two groups - a group who will have dialysis prescribed in the standard fashion
      - three times weekly for 3.5-4 hours per session or a group who will have an incremental
      start beginning with twice weekly treatment. We will investigate how many patients have
      sufficient natural kidney function to be eligible, whether patients are willing to
      participate and continue in the study, compare the rate of loss of kidney function between
      groups, and ascertain whether this individualised dialysis approach is less intrusive to
      patients. The results will be used to design a larger definitive study.

    <textblock>
      This study is feasibility randomised controlled trial.

      50 patients who have newly started on haemodialysis will be recruited into the study from 4
      UK centres.

      Eligible patients will be approached prior to initiation of dialysis or after starting
      dialysis. The details of the study will be explained to them and a Patient Information sheet
      will be provided. Interested participants will be invited to the study and a written consent
      will be obtained.

      The participants will be randomly allocated to 2 groups.

        1. Thrice weekly dialysis (control arm)

        2. Incremental dialysis - Twice weekly dialysis to start with and slowly increasing the
           duration and frequency of dialysis to thrice weekly depending on their native kidney
           function.

      All participants will be monitored at least once monthly by performing dialysis related blood
      tests, urine tests, clinical evaluation, medications, weight, dialysis adequacy, adverse
      events.

      Questionnaire involving quality of life, mood, illness intrusiveness, functional status,
      cognitive function will also be performed.

      Participants will be recruited in the first year and all participants will be followed up for
      12 months. All participants may withdraw at any time without any change in their dialysis
      care.

      To ensure independence, the University of Hertfordshire will perform randomisation, and
      assist with data monitoring and data analysis.

      A 6 month rate of loss of native kidney function between the 2 groups will be analysed.
