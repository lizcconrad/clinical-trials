  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing bariatric surgery will be divided randomly into two groups: the first
      will have TAP block upon completion of surgery and the second groups will not have TAP block.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon completion of the laparoscopic bariatric procedure to be performed for every patient and
      just before recovery from general anesthesia, an ultrasound-guided TAP block will be
      conducted in the operative theater by the anesthetist for group I patients whereas group II
      will be recovered from anesthesia without having a TAP block.

      The ultrasound probe will be placed on the lateral abdominal wall in the mid-axillary line
      between the lower costal margin and iliac crest. Using ultrasound will allow accurate
      deposition of the local anesthetic in the correct neurovascular plane. A spinal needle will
      be advanced using in-plane technique between the aponeurosis of the internal oblique and
      transversus abdominis muscles. With intermittent aspiration, 20 mL of local anesthetic (0.5%
      bupivacaine) will be deposited in the TAP on each side and seen as a hypoechoic shadow
      pushing the two layers apart.

             endocrine disorders, patients with psychiatric disorders, patients with drug abuse or
             history of opioid intake or chronic pain disorder, patients with contraindication to
             peripheral nerve block such as allergy to local anesthetics and coagulopathy.
