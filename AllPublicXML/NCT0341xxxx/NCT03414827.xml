      Recruitment of participants to the study takes place at the urological department at Zealand
      University Hospital, Roskilde, Feb. 2018-April 2018. 10 people with diagnosis of renal cancer
      should be recruited in phases 1. Subsequently, biological materials from 100 patients with
      kidney cancer will be used from the national Biobank. In phase 3, 10 patients will be
      recruited for the final gene test.
