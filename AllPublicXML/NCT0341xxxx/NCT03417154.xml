    <textblock>
      This is a phase II trial of nivolumab and low dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) when given in
      combination to patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and higher-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who are not eligible for or decline hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant. It includes a randomized pilot sub-study during stage 1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥18 years of age

          -  Meets one of the following disease criteria:

               -  Primary (de novo) AML or higher-risk MDS with induction failure: No CR after 2 or
                  more induction attempts with high dose chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents ±
                  other agents. Higher risk MDS defined as risk score &gt; 4.5 based on the revised
                  IPSS criteria.

               -  Secondary AML (from antecedent hematologic malignancy or treatment-related): Not
                  in CR after 1 or more cycles of chemotherapy.

               -  Relapsed AML: Blast count ≥5% in bone marrow or peripheral blood after prior
                  attainment of CR; relapse at any time but ≥100 days following allogeneic HCT.

               -  Relapsed MDS: Morphologic evidence of relapse or increase in blasts ≥5% in bone
                  marrow or peripheral blood after prior attainment of CR; relapse at any time but
                  ≥100 days following allogeneic HCT.

          -  ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 - refer to Appendix II

          -  Sexually active females of child bearing potential and males with partners of child
             bearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during therapy and
             continuing (23 weeks for females, 31 weeks for males) after the last dose of nivolumab

          -  Voluntary written consent

             an increased incidence of human fetal malformations or irreversible damage. Women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 7
             days of study drug administration.

          -  Prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within previous 100 days
