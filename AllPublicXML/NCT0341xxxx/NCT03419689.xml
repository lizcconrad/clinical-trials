      This is a sample study that will collect biological samples (blood, tumor tissue, ascites,
      and/or other fluids) from gynecological cancer patients for biomarker research. In addition,
      the results of the testing done on the samples will be given to the participant's treating
      physician who may use the information to guide treatment decisions.
