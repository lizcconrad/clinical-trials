  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a registry, which is a &quot;bank&quot; of information about
      patients who have had similar medical conditions and treatments. The registry will be used by
      researchers to learn more about long term outcome of patients with bladder cancer, how
      bladder cancer tissues are related to tumor development, recurrence and survival.
