  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of work done over the past few decades has established that adipose tissue as
      an active endocrine organ which secretes a wide range of metabolic and immunological factors
      collectively called &quot;adipokines (1).&quot; Importantly, these secreted factors enter into the
      circulation and have paracrine and autocrine actions, which profoundly impact systemic
      metabolism (e.g., insulin sensitivity). Additionally, in animals, loss of ovarian hormone
      production via ovariectomy (similar to menopause in humans) leads to increases in both in
      adipose tissue mass and in adipose tissue inflammation (2) making this tissue less healthy
      than that from premenopausal animals. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of
      menopause on abdominal fat in overweight individuals. Knowing if adipose tissue-specific
      changes occur with menopause may potentially lead to recommendations or therapeutics to
      improve women's health post menopause.

      Subjects will just have to agree to having a small amount of adipose tissue being removed
      during the bariatric surgery. The investigators will also collect a blood sample at that
      time. There will be no other visits for the subject.
