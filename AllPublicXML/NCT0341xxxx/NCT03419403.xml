  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of several ophthalmologic prophylactic treatment
      strategies for the management of ocular side effects (OSEs) in participants with epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR)-amplified glioblastoma (GBM) who are being treated with
      depatuxizumab mafodotin (ABT-414). The study will include 2 phases during the treatment
      period: chemoradiation therapy (radiation plus temozolomide [RT/TMZ]) and adjuvant therapy
      (TMZ ). All participants will receive depatuxizumab mafodotin during both phases of the
      treatment period plus 1 of 3 prophylactic ophthalmologic treatments (standard steroids [SS],
      standard steroids with vasoconstrictors and cold compress [SS/VC], and enhanced steroids with
      vasoconstrictors and cooling compress [ES/VC]).

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 18 weeks after initial dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular Side Effect (OSE) management is defined as a participant with &gt;= 3-line loss (+ 0.3 on LogMAR scale or equivalent) of best corrected visual acuity from baseline (with prescription at baseline for those using corrective lens), or &gt;= Grade 3 OSE severity on the Corneal Epithelial Adverse Event [CEAE] scale.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 18 weeks after initial dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin</time_frame>
    <description>Change on LogMAR Scale from last assessment prior to BCL intervention to 2 weeks after BCL intervention. The LogMAR scale measures visual acuity on a continuous scale, with a LogMAR value of 0 equivalent to 20/20 visual acuity. Normal vision is considered to be from -0.2 - 0.1; higher values indicate visual impairment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Epithelial Adverse Event (CEAE) Grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 3 years after initial dose of depatuxizumab mafodotin</time_frame>
    <description>The corneal epithelial adverse event (CEAE) rating scale is designed to record symptoms associated with corneal epitheliopathy caused by antibody-drug conjugates and to grade the severity of findings. The overall CEAE grade is measured on a scale of 0 to 5, with higher values being more severe, reflecting the impact of corneal abnormalities on visual activities of daily living (ADLs). Additional detailed information is collected for specific domains that are commonly affected, with the following ranges (each in order of increasing severity): ocular discomfort (0 - 4), photophobia (0 - 3), and reading (1 - 3).</description>
