  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in combination with
      lymphodepletion and high-dose interleukin 2.

      Most TIL ACT trials have been conducted as salvage therapy for patients who already had
      failed numerous treatments; many study participants presented with multiple metastases,
      frequently in visceral organs and even in the brain. The effectiveness of TIL ACT in
      eradicating metastatic tumors of the responding patients underlines the value of this
      immunotherapeutic approach.

      Recent developments in the identification and selection of tumor-specific T-cell populations
      have facilitated the implementation of TIL ACT also in nonmelanoma malignancies. Building on
      the experience of Ella Lemelbaum Institute, Sheba Medical Center with ACT TIL in the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma, the Dept. of Oncology, Tel HaShomer has expanded the use of
      TIL ACT following a reduced intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen
      to metastatic Melanoma, Ovarian (OC) and Cervical cancer patients. The rationale supporting
      these studies is to further develop the ACT TIL procedure and expand its applicability to
      metastatic OC and cervical cancers.

      The Sponsor is developing the ex-vivo expanded autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes
      (TIL) as the Investigational Product (IP). Yet, the administration of the TIL cellular
      product can only be accomplished in the context of an Autologous, Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT)
      procedure which is composed of the following steps:

        1. Reduced Intensity, non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction regimen using
           Fludarabine (25 mg/m2 for 3 days) followed by Total Body Radiation (TBR) (2 Gray as a
           single treatment) for 1 day

        2. Preparation and administration of unselected or 4-1BB enriched TIL

        3. Bolus high-dose (720,000 IU/kg) IL-2 will be administered to each patient every 8 hours,
           to tolerance. A maximum of 10 doses will be administered per patient.

        4. Early-stage follow-up until 30 days post-discharge

        5. Late-stage follow-up, such as CT scans, will be carried out four and twelve weeks after
           TIL administration, and then every 3 months thereafter for the first year after TIL
           therapy; for the second year and onwards, as clinically indicated.

             WBC greater than 3000/mm3. Hemoglobin greater than 9.0 g/dL Platelet count greater
             than 100,000/mm3

             Serology:

             Seronegative for HIV antibody. Seronegative for Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C (patients
             who recovered from previous infection and have no detected HBSAg or HCV RNA are
             allowed).

             Chemistry:

             Serum ALT/AST less than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Serum creatinine
             less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dL Total bilirubin no more than 1.5 times the ULN, except
             in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3 mg/dL.

         13. Negative pregnancy test in women of child bearing potential.

         14. More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).
             Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures with the past 3 weeks, as long
             as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less.

        Note: As described in the Study Population section in the synopsis, before entering the
        trial, the medical team will present other available experimental therapies to the patient
        for her consideration.

        SUBJECT EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting induction
             regimen on the fetus or infant. (Note: Pregnancies occurring in patients with Ovarian
             cancer are very rare, but possible. For this reason, ELIM has decided to retain the
             sections dealing with possible cases of pregnancy during the study.)

          2. Systemic steroid therapy required (patients who require replacement therapy for
             adrenal insufficiency may be enrolled if steroid treatment dose do not exceed 10 mg of
             prednisone or equivalent).

          3. Active systemic infections, coagulation disorders or other active major medical
             illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, as evidenced by a
             positive stress thallium or comparable test, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.

          4. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease
             and AIDS).

          5. Opportunistic infections (the experimental treatment being evaluated in this protocol
             depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune competence may
             be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its
             toxicities.)

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study , including history of an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin or gentamicin

          7. History of coronary revascularization or ischemic heart disease.

          8. Any patient known to have an LVEF less than or equal to 50 percent.

          9. Documented LVEF of less than or equal to 50 percent tested in patients with clinically
             significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias including but not limited to: atrial
             fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, second or third degree heart block

         10. Documented FEV1 and DLCO (relative to predicted) less than or equal to 60 percent.
