  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate Pediatric Balance Scale and quantitative balance and gait
      parameters assessed by Balance Master force plate in Cerebral Palsy (CP) patients who are
      ambulatory without an assistive device in daily life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CP refers to a group of motion and posture disorders that limit activity and participation
      which is attributed to non-progressive disturbances in the developing fetus or infant brain.
      In CP, motor and sensory disorders are often accompanied by poor balance control. Impaired
      balance control leads to increased risk of falling, which is a major kinesiologic problem in
      children who are ambulatory without an assistive device.

      Functional balance in children is defined as the ability to maintain the center of gravity
      according to the base of support during typical childhood activities of daily living, school
      and play. The Pediatric Balance Scale, a modification of the Berg Balance Scale, was
      developed as a functional balance measure for children, easily administered without
      specialized equipment in a relatively short time.

      Balance Master® (Neurocom International Clackmas, Oregon, USA) is a device consisting of a
      system that processes signals from an 18x60 inch plaque that transmits the vertical forces
      exerted through patient's feet to measure center of gravity position and postural control
      through a software program.

      The aim of this study is to compare PBS results with quantitative balance and gait parameters
      obtained from Balance Master in spastic CP patients who are independently ambulatory. The
      level of correlation between these measurement methods will be examined and superiority to
      each other in assessing balance problems in this patient group will be evaluated.

    <measure>Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 min</time_frame>
    <description>PBS is a functional balance scale adapted and customized from Berg Balance Scale for use with children. The PBS has been used initially to measure the balance functions for school-age children with mild-to-moderate motor impairments. A recent study has shown that PBS is also sensitive in assessing functional balance differences in children aged 4-10 with a rough motor function classification system (KMFSS) level 1-2
The PBS is a 14-item, criterion-referenced measure, which examines functional balance in the context of everyday tasks. It can easily be administered and scored in less than 20 minutes using equipment commonly found in schools and clinics. Scoring (0-4) is based on how long a specific movement or position is performed, how long the position can be maintained, or how much assistance it requires. The highest score in PBS is 56.</description>

    <measure>Selective Control Assessment of the Lower Extremity (SCALE)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 min</time_frame>
    <description>The SCALE tool was designed for clinical administration and scoring by healthcare professionals, to be used in less than 15 minutes without specialized equipment. The tool includes 'Directions for Administration,' 'Instructions for Grading,' and a 'Score Sheet.' Hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and toe joints are assessed bilaterally. The following factors were used to develop the assessment and grading criteria: (1) ability to move each joint selectively; (2) involuntary movement at other joints including the contralateral limb; (3) ability to reciprocate movement; (4) speed of movement; and (5) generation of force as demonstrated by excursion within the available range of motion. Selective voluntary motor control is graded at each joint as 'Normal' (2 points), 'Impaired' (1 point), or 'Unable' (0 points).</description>
