  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural killer (NK) cells can kill a broad array of tumor cells in a non-major
      histocompatibility complex(MHC)-restricted manner. Adoptive transfer of NK may prolong the
      survival of patients with cancer. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of NK
      cell-based immunotherapy for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) after first-line chemotherapy.
      Half of the participants will receive autologous adoptive transfer of NK cells after the
      response from first-line chemotherapy, while the other half will be followed up in routine
      clinal practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very sensitive to the standard-of-care first-line
      chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, but it will ultimately progress or relapse and develop
      early resistance to conventional treatments. No effective maintenance therapy except for wath
      and wait after first-line therapy at present.

      NK cells constitute the major component of the innate immune system and kill tumor cells in a
      non-MHC-restricted manner. In our previous pilot study and other reports, adoptive transfer
      of autologous NK cells expanded ex vivo was very well tolerant and effective.

      There is no prospective trial on the maintenance therapy of SCLC after first-line
      chemotherapy based on autologous NK cells. The purpose of this phase II clinical research is
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous NK cells as the maintenance therapy after
      the first-line treatment, comparing with conventional observation group.

    <description>Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to first observation of progression or date of death (from any cause). Progression will be evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1. Patients who do not progress or not die will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment, i.e. on the last date that we really know that the patient is considered as &quot;progression-free&quot;.</description>

    <description>Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are collected by apheresis on D0, then induced into NK cells and infused into the patients 14 days later (D14) as the initial transfusion. There are 3 consecutive transfusion days (D14-D16). The second course of PBMCs collection started D14 before infusion. A total of 6 courses will be completed unless progression or unacceptable adverse events.</description>
