      A Phase IIa Open-Label Trial to Investigate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics,
      Biological, and Clinical Activity of AGEN1884 in Combination with Pembrolizumab in Subjects
      with Chemotherapy Naïve, PD-L1 high, metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa, open-label study, of AGEN1884 in combination with pembrolizumab in
      subjects with stage IV NSCLC whose tumors have high PD-L1 expression and no EGFR or ALK
      genomic tumor aberrations.

      The study consists in two phases:

        -  Safety Run-in Phase

        -  Efficacy Phase

      Subjects will be enrolled in a &quot;3+3&quot; Safety Run-in followed by enrollment completing the
      efficacy cohort. Two different dose levels of AGEN1884 may be tested in combination with the
      approved pembrolizumab treatment for this indication (until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, or up to a maximum of 24 months). Each subject will stay on the dose level assigned
      at trial entry.
