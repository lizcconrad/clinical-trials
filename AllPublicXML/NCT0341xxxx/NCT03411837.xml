      The investigators will monitor for the incidence of adverse-events in a prospective,
      longitudinal, non-interventional and observational real-world sub-study of adults patients
      with moderate-to-severe AD who are receiving dupilumab as standard-of-care therapy.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective, longitudinal, non-interventional and
      observational sub-study of patients receiving dupilumab as normal standard-of-care treatment
      to assess the efficacy (Specific Aim #1) and safety (Specific Aim #2) of dupilumab for the
      treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, as well as the prevention and/or mitigation of comorbid
      health conditions (Specific Aim #3). This study will address the hypotheses that dupilumab
      will lead to improved long-term control and decreased severity of AD, and that long-term
      monitoring will shed light on the incidence of adverse drug events.
