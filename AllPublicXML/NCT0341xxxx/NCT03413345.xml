      It is a trial aimed to evaluate the ejection fraction in the preoperative phase and during
      follow-up in two groups of subjects undergoing major orthopedic surgery: the first consisting
      of subjects without history of cardiac disease, and the second from subjects with a history
      of cardiopulmonary disease
