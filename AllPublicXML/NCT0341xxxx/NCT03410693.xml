  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of rogaratinib (BAY 1163877) compared to chemotherapy in patients with FGFRpositive
      locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who have received Prior
      platinum-containing chemotherapy.

      The primary objective of the entire study is to compare rogaratinib (BAY1163877) with
      chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) in terms of prolonging the Overall
      survival (OS) of patients with FGFR positive urothelial carcinoma.

      At randomization, patients will have locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and
      have received at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. Only patients with
      FGFR1 or 3 positive tumors can be randomized into the study. Archival tumor tissue is
      adequate for testing of FGFR1 and 3 mRNA expressions, which will be determined centrally
      using an RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) test. Approximately 42 % of UC patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic UC are identified as FGFR-positive by the RNA-ISH cut-off
      applied.
