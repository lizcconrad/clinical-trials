  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of titrated drugs is at the base of a successful antalgic treatment in order to
      provide both an adequate relief and a satisfactory tolerability profile. These molecules,
      though, have a varying degree of efficacy in different subjects due to medical and genetic
      reasons. The latter are mainly represented by cytochrome (CYP) P450, in particular CYP2D6's
      polymorphisms are responsible for the diversified metabolism of analgesics used in chronic
      pain treatments.

      Four main types of enzymatic metabolism make up the population, each one defined by a
      different CYP2D6 allele: extensive metabolizers, ultra-rapid metabolizers, intermediate
      metabolizers and poor metabolizers.

      Moreover, regarding polytherapies, the analgesics' metabolism could be influenced by
      coadministration of other drugs, thus determining an inhibition or induction of the metabolic
      enzymes - known as phenocopying - and potentially also a change in the metabolic phenotype
      itself. The final outcome is the inconstancy of effectiveness and of the risk of developing
      side effects.

      The primary objective of this study is to define a genetic pattern for the gene CYP2D6 by
      assessing the incidence of poor or ultrarapid metabolizers in a population of chronic pain
      patients. This will also allow to observe phenocopying in the same population.

      Hence 100 patients diagnosed with chronic pain will be enrolled. The genetic pattern of the
      gene CYP2D6 of such patients will be examined by taking mouth samples. At the same time
      parametric tests for paired data to survey the correlations between phenotypical patterns and
      pharmacological therapies will be conducted.
