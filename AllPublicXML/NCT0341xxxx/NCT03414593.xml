  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the preemptive effect of ultrasound guided
      popliteal scistic nerve block on postoperative acute pain in patients with bilateral hallux
      valgus.

      After induction of general anesthesia, the leg to be operated first is decided randomly.
      After the operation of one leg is completed, PSNB is performed on both legs with 0.2%
      Ropivacaine and surgery is started on the remaining legs.

      When the surgery is over, check to see which foot pain begins first, how strong the pain is,
      and whether there are any side effects.

The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. It is for adults and children 10 years old or older.
0: No pain, 1-3: mild pain, 4-6: Moderate pain, 7-10: severe pain, 10: worst pain imaginable.</description>
