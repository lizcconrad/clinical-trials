    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of preemptive effect of rectus
      sheath block (RSB) and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) on postoperative visceral pain in
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LLC).

      After induction of general anesthesia, group of patient is decided randomly. In Group pre,
      RSB and ICNB are performed with 0.2% Ropivacaine 40ml before the operation. In Group post,
      RSB and ICNB are performed with 0.2% Ropivacaine 40ml after the operation.

      Measure the NRS and compare the rescue analgesic dose used at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, and 24
      hours after arrival at the recovery room.

    <description>The difference in analgesics usage between the two groups after the operation is checked at fixed intervals (at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 24 hours after operation) to compare.</description>

    <measure>compare the Numeric rating scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 24 hours after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. It is for adults and children 10 years old or older.
0: No pain, 1-3: mild pain, 4-6: Moderate pain, 7-10: severe pain, 10: worst pain imaginable.
After surgery, the NRS differences between the two groups were compared at a constant interval (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 9, 18, 24 hours postoperatively).</description>
