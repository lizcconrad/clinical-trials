  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test if applying calcium silicate cements (Biodentine) to restore cervical
      carious lesions might adversely affect the gingival health in comparison with conventionally
      used tooth colored material (GIC)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare two different dental materials on dental lesions near the gum line. .
      The study will determine if one material is more effective in gingival health, after the
      placement of the two different dental materials.The oral hygiene and the gingival health of
      the restored teeth will be evaluated clinically at 1, 3 and 6-month intervals.

    <measure>Changes in Gingival index around Cervical Carious Lesions Restored with Calcium Silicate Based Cement (Biodentine™) Compared with Glass-Ionomer Cement;</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gingival health will be measured using the Loe -Silness gingival scoring Index (1963) which scores gingivitis on a numerical scale according to the following criteria:
0 = Absence of inflammation.
1 = Mild inflammation, slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on probing.
2 = Moderate inflammation, moderate glazing, redness, bleeding on probing.
3- Severe inflammation, marked redness and hypertrophy, ulceration, tendency to spontaneous
Gingival index will be evaluated at four sites (mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual) on each tooth</description>

    <measure>Changes in Plaque accumulation around Cervical Carious Lesions Restored with Calcium</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>detect plaque level around restorations Plaque index (PI) (Silness and Löe, 1964). Plaque levels was measured using the Plaque Index Silness and Loe in 1964
Score Criteria
0 No plaque
A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. But only by Using disclosing solution or by using probe.
Moderate accumulation of deposits within the gingival pocket, on the gingival margin and/ or adjacent tooth surface, which can be seen with the naked eye.
Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin. Plaque index will be evaluated at four sites (mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual) on each tooth</description>

    <measure>Changes in Pocket Depth around Cervical Carious Lesions Restored with Calcium</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Probing depths (PD) will be measured at six sites (mesial, distal, and middle sites of the buccal and lingual sides) on each tooth using a Williams periodontal probe. PD will be measured from gingival margin to the base of the pocket.</description>
