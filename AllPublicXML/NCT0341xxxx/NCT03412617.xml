  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many provinces in Indonesia have some well known traditional foods that are widely consumed,
      but it remains unknown whether traditional ethnic dietary patterns can confirm healthy diets.
      High quality diet is associated with reduced risk of metabolic diseases and modulated gut
      microbiota. Moreover, the relationship between dietary quality and microbiota, a potential
      mediator of metabolic disease, has not been studied.

      This study was conducted in specific villages and hamlets that were randomly selected by
      multi-stage random cluster sampling in 2 provinces. The investigators randomly selected 36
      villages (18 villages in each provinces) by using probability proportional to size cluster
      sampling to admit the total 360 women who met the criteria and consented. While
      Bifidobacterium, Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE) and lipid profile were examined in a
      subgroup of 120 participants from each province (n=240).

      Field enumerators were trained to standardize 24 hours food recall, food frequency
      questionnaire for 1 month back, and for stool sampling technique procedure.

      Anthropometric measurement was performed by performing weight and height measurement. Fasting
      blood sampling and fecal Bifidobacterium examination were done in collaboration with
      professional laboratories. Hemoglobin was assessed by using hemocue. Lipid profile was
      quantified using calorimetric method, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was quantified using
      enzymatic colorimetric method glucose oxidase - phenol aminophenazone, HbA1c was using high
      performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) hexokinase, malondialdehyde level was quantified
      using will's spectrophotometry, blood advance glycation end products was done by using enzyme
      linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), carboxymethyl lysine plasma was done by ultra performance
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectometry (UPLC-MS/MS), and plasma tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha was done by ELISA. Fecal sample were collected in 2 pots, each contain 5-10 gram
      of stool, and store in cooler box (2-9 degree celcius) until sample was transported to
      laboratory as soon as possible to store in -80 degree celcius freezer.

    <measure>Dietary or nutritional intake</measure>
    <time_frame>September - November 2016</time_frame>
    <description>Usual dietary intake was done by using semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire for 1 month, and actual intake was done by nonconsecutive repeated 24-hour food recall (weekday and weekend). The investigators was analyse the dietary intake by Nutrisurvey 2007 software. Nutritional intake was reported as total daily intake (energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients). Energy intake is showed in kkal/day. Macronutrients include carbohydrate, protein, fat, and fiber intake are showed in gram/day. Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals are showed in gram/milligram/microgram per day. The value of nutrient intake are very diverse from 0 to high intake.</description>
