    <textblock>
      Laboratory monitoring of patients included serial measurement of complete blood cell count,
      liver function tests, coagulation profile, and renal function tests.

      ICU management during conduction of the research study included the following:

      Control of convulsions using magensium sulphate. Control of blood pressure Diastolic blood
      pressure above 110 mmHg, nifedipine was administered.A plasma volume expansion with saline
      was used in all women to maintain sufficient intravascular volume. Delivery was performed
      immediately after hemodynamic stabilization and clinical control of general condition .

      Laboratory monitoring of patients included serial measurement of complete blood cell count,
      liver function tests, coagulation profile, and renal function tests.

      ICU management included the following:

      Control of convulsions by Loading dose of magensium sulphate (4-6g I.V), given over 20
      minutes in 100 ml of dextrose then Maintenance dose (4-6g) magensium sulphate in 500 cc
      dextrose given over 8 hours using continuous IV drip.Control of blood pressure if Diastolic
      blood pressure above 110 mmHg, nifedipine was administered. Delivery was performed
      immediately after hemodynamic stabilization and clinical control of general condition
      .Termination of gestation decision was based on the the presence of maternal complications,
      fetal distress.After delivery the patient is retrurned to ICU under clinical and careful
      observation of the following:Heart rate, blood pressure,every 15 min,Temperature and
      respiratory rate ,evey 4 hours. Duration of admission in the ICU was assessed
