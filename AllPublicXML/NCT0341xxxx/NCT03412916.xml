  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to adapt, pilot and examine the credibility, acceptability, and
      feasibility of an evidence-based mind-body program, the Relaxation Response Resiliency
      Program for Chronic Pain (p3RP), and the p3RP-Digital Monitoring Device (p3RP-DMD), which is
      the p3RP integrated with a commercial DMD, the FitBit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has three phases. In phase I, the investigators are adapting the 3RP as a
      multidisciplinary team, and then conducting two focus groups. In phase two, the investigators
      are piloting the p3RP and p3RP-DMD. In phase three, the investigators are conducting a small
      randomized-controlled trial of the p3RP versus p3RP-DMD.

    <description>The p3RP uses a multimodal approach to introduce and reinforce new skills, including didactics, in-session activities, discussions, and weekly practice assignments (homework). The p3RP sessions reflect a purposeful integration of the three treatment approaches (relaxation methods, stress appraisal &amp; coping, and growth enhancement). The format is an 8-week program with weekly meetings and a focus on relaxation response strategies, cognitive behavioral training, positive psychology and mind-body interactions.</description>

    <description>The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program for Pain (p3RP) is a comprehensive, multimodal treatment that was designed to increase quality of life, resiliency and ability to cope with medical symptoms and stress. This program is rooted in the elicitation of the relaxation response, a non-judgmental state of focused attention and increased awareness.</description>
