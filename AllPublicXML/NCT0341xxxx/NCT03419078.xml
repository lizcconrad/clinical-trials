      Retrospective case-note review to determine if nutrition via the enteral compared to the

      This is a retrospective case-note review of adults undergoing haematopoietic cell
      transplantation to treat a haematological malignancy who have been admitted to Hammersmith
      Hospital from 2000 to 2014. All patients receiving an allogeneic haematopoietic cell
      transplant from a matched sibling or identically matched unrelated donor will be included. We
      will record the route and assess the broad adequacy of nutritional intakes to determine if
      nutrition via the enteral compared to the parenteral route results in better outcomes after
      haematopoietic cell transplantation. Our outcomes are graft versus host disease incidence and
      severity, transplant related (early) mortality and overall survival.
