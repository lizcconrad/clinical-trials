  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no routine screening for cardiac disease for pregnant women in areas of
      high prevalence. This study will aim to determine the point prevalence of cardiac disease in
      women presenting for antenatal care at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. More specifically,
      it will aim to use focused echocardiography as a screening tool to determine the prevalence
      of cardiac disease among pregnant women attending MTRH antenatal clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) in pregnancy can be associated with severe maternal and
      neonatal morbidity and mortality. Early identification of these women and referral to
      specialized, multi-disciplinary care is essential. Overall, studies on RHD prevalence are
      lacking in sub-Saharan countries and a significant gap in the literature exists for the
      prospective assessment of disease in the context of pregnancy. At Moi Teaching and Referral
      Hospital, there are an estimated 3-4 cases per month of women presenting with acute
      exacerbations of either known or newly diagnosed cardiac disease. These women are often the
      most challenging clinically and emotionally for the reproductive health team to manage, and
      contribute to a significant number of the 2-3 maternal deaths per month at MTRH. There is
      currently no routine screening for cardiac disease in the MTRH antenatal clinics. This study
      will aim to determine the point prevalence of cardiac disease in women presenting for
      antenatal care at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital. More specifically, it will aim to: 1.
      Use focused echocardiography as a screening tool to evaluate cardiac structure and function;
      2. Use focused echocardiography as a screening tool to determine the prevalence of cardiac
      disease among pregnant women attending MTRH antenatal clinic.; 3. Determine the proportion of
      pregnant women with cardiac disease who endorse clinical symptoms as a potential means to
      develop a screening tool; 4. Promote a case-finding culture for cardiac disease in pregnancy

        All pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital.
        This clinic serves approximately 750 women per month. These women draw from urban,
        peri-urban and rural areas. As this is a public hospital, income and education levels are
        low.
