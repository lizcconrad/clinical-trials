  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of PF-06687234 and
      [124I]IB-PF-06687234 (simultaneously given) in subjects with moderate to severe Ulcerative
      Colitis. The study used PET-CT scan imaging to assess the distribution of PF-06687234 and
      [124I]IB-PF-06687234 over 24 and 72 hours in colon (inflamed and non-inflamed), plasma,
      colon, liver, spleen, kidney and small intestine.
