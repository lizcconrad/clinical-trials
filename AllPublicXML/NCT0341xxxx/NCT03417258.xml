      INTRODUCTION: The data obtained by experimental studies about the influence of phytoestrogens
      on colorectal cancer (CRC) have been very promising. On the other hand, clinical trials have
      produced conflicting results. The literature suggests that some subclasses of phytoestrogens
      may have protective effects against CRC and colon adenomas, but most of these results come
      from population studies based on the dietary intake of phytoestrogens. On these premises, it
      is possible to hypothesize that the variability of the data reported in the literature may be
      due to the fact that the real absorption of phytoestrogens (by assessing their concentration
      in the serum or urine) and/or the ability of the single individual of producing equol was not
      evaluated.

      PURPOSE: In the present study, the association between the phytoestrogens intake and the
      prevalence of colon adenomas was evaluated not only on the basis of the simply dietary intake
      but also on the measurement their intestinal absorption. Moreover, a specific evaluation of
      equol production by the intestinal flora was performed. Finally, intestinal bacteria involved
      in equol production were evaluated.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with sporadic colon adenomas were enrolled in group I (case)
      and patients without sporadic colorectal adenomas matched for sex, age and BMI were enrolled
      in group II (control). All participants underwent the following evaluations: BMI, dietary
      history (for quantitative and qualitative analysis of dietary habits), quantitative analysis
      of phytoestrogens (by dietary questionnaires), medications (chronic assumption of aspirin at
      low doses), characteristics of the polyps (for a calculation the cancer risk), analysis of
      urinary excretion of phytoestrogens [by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)] and
      intestinal flora [by mass spectrometry with Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization
      Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) technology].
