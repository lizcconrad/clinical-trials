  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bowel dysfunction is a major complication following open surgery for invasive
      cancer of the bladder that causes significant discomfort, complications and prolongs the
      length of stay in the hospital. Amenable factors that are responsible for postoperative bowel
      dysfunction include intravenous morphine given for pain relief and epidural infusion
      requiring excess intravenous fluids administration after surgery. The British Association of
      Urological Surgeons (BAUS) have published the Enhanced Recovery protocol (ERP) to reduce
      length of hospital stay following open surgery for cancer of the urinary bladder. The ERP is
      a care package that is provided to the patient from the day of the surgery till hospital
      discharge. At Leicester, we have modified the ERP and this has become the standard of care
      for our patients undergoing this surgery. The modified ERP care package includes a novel
      combination of two established pain relief techniques (erector spinae plane analgesia and
      intrathecal opioids) that will avoid the use of epidural analgesia, excess intravenous fluids
      administration and intravenous morphine in the postoperative period. The modified ERP has
      been well accepted by the patients and the clinical team looking after these patients. We
      would like to perform a formal evaluation of the modified ERP care package in the management
      of adult patients undergoing open bladder surgery through an observational pilot study.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of postoperative bowel dysfunction and the
      median length of hospital stay in adult patients undergoing(open radical cystectomy Methods:
      Prospective, observational pilot study that will be conducted at Leicester General Hospital
      over 24 months. Adult patients scheduled to undergo open radical cystectomy will be included
      in the study. Patients who will have laparoscopic surgery will be excluded. After providing
      written consent, the participants will receive an enhanced recovery protocol (ERP) care
      package that will commence from the day of their surgery till they are discharged from the
      hospital. Participants will be asked to report time of opening their bowel, pain scores on
      movement, presence of nausea and vomiting, bowel dysfunction, length of hospital stay and any
      complication from day of surgery till 30 days after surgery. Participation in the study will
      end at 30 days after surgery.
