    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to study the safety and efficacy of anthocyanins in improving key
      dementia-related mechanisms and cognitive functioning in older people at risk for dementia.
      Secondary analyses will include a variety of biological measures, including biochemistry,
      imaging and cardiovascular measures.

      Design, Method, Material. Design: This is a randomized, 6-month, placebo-controlled Phase 2
      study of anthocyanins (Medox) in people with increased risk for dementia, to explore the
      effects of anthocyanins on cognitive performance and a range of biological markers including
      blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, antioxidants, lipid profile, urine,
      faeces, and cardiovascular functions.

      Method: Patients will be randomized (by means of a computerized program) to identically
      appearing capsules with Medox or placebo, 1:1 (produced by MedPalett). Patients will undergo
      monthly cognitive testing online. Brain MRI, structural and functional, will be performed
      before study start and at week 24. Blood samples for analyses will be drawn at study start,
      after 12 weeks and at study end (week 24). Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
      analyses, and faeces analyses, in addition to cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI), and
      photopletysmography (PPG) measurements will be done at study start (baseline) and at study
      end (week 24).

      The cognitive assessment battery consists of the CogTrack, an online cognitive test battery
      with proven utility, reliability, sensitivity and validity and sensitivity to change. The
      battery consists of ten subtests, which, based on factor analysis, are combined into the
      following domains: attention, memory and cognitive speed. The 15 word lists of the verbal
      memory test have been translated into Norwegian. The primary outcome measure will be the
      Quality of Episodic Memory combination of 2 accuracy scores from each of immediate and
      delayed word recall, word and picture recognition (4 tasks in total), which has been shown to
      be sensitive to cognitive changes . The battery will be administered online monthly at home,
      or with assistance from a research associate at SESAM/local research site if Internet is not
      available at home. Collection and registration will be performed securely online.

      Patients will be tested at the same time of day on all occasions, usually in the morning.
      Testing procedures will be standardized (i.e. temperature, room, research associate, coffee
      intake).
