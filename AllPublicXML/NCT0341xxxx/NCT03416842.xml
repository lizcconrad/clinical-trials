  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitious motor therapy has been shown to yield the greatest improvement in motor function
      in those who suffer hemiplegia because of a neurological impairment. However, motor therapy
      remains largely clinically based due to the absence of quantitative home-based therapy
      technology or equipment. With the current lack of accountability, patient adherence to home
      exercise physical therapy programs is estimated to be as low as 35%. In response, some
      companies have extended the applications of their motion capture devices to be used for
      home-based physical therapy. However, the technologies often have not passed their initial
      stages of development. In contrast, a company named 4D Motion is actively working alongside
      the Restorative Neurology Clinic at Burke Medical Research Institute to develop a motion
      capture system tailored to the motor rehabilitation of hemiplegic stroke patients. This
      device is driven by a user's active range of motion and does not impart electrical or
      mechanical stimulation to the user. The device does not force the user beyond their active
      range of motion and does not apply resistance to motion that limits the user's capability.
      The 4D Motion capture system is only used to record what the patient is doing and to promote
      adherence to their prescribed physical therapy plan.
