  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was the comparison of the perioperative time courses of matrix metalloproteinase-9
      (MMP-9) and its inhibitor (TIMP-1) during elective carotid artery stenting (CAS). The
      investigators used a matched, historical carotid endarteriectomy group as controls. Blood
      samples at four time points: T1: preoperative; T2: 60 minutes after stent insertion; T3:
      first postoperative morning; and T4: third postoperative morning. Plasma was isolated from
      heparin anticoagulated blood samples by low speed centrifugation at 4 °C, and stored at -80
      °C until analyzed in a single batch at the end of the study. Plasma concentrations of MMP-9
      and TIMP-1 were expressed as ng/ml.

Group samples were collected at the following four time points: T1, at the time of the insertion of the arterial line; T2, 60 min after cross-clamp release; T3, the first postoperative morning; and T4, the third postoperative morning. A matched subgroup of patients from the previously obtained data served as a historical control.</description>
