  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has become important risk factors for threatening human life and health. Studies
      have shown that chronic hyperglycemia lead to microvascular brain injury. The more common
      types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive dysfunction is a precursor to
      Alzheimer's disease. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a cognitive impairment between normal
      aging and dementia, mainly manifested as memory impairment, especially episode memory
      defects, but also named obstacles, but the overall cognitive function is normal, daily life
      ability is normal. Studies have shown that middle-aged diabetic patients' cognitive ability
      will decline by about 19% in 20 years compared to people without diabetes.

      Sulfur amino acid is the indispensable amino acid in mammals, and its metabolites include
      Taurine, Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Taurine was first isolated more
      than 150 years ago from ox (Taurus) bile. Although the taurine can be synthesized in vivo by
      cysteine in the presence of cysteine dioxygenase, it is mainly acquired from dietary sources,
      such as eggs, meat, and seafood. H2S is a biologically relevant mediator and plays potential
      roles in several physiological processes and disease states in the body. H2S is synthesized
      from 2 sulfur-containing amino acids, l-cysteine andl-methionine, by the 3
      enzymes,cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE), cystathionine-β-synthetase(CBS), and3-mercaptopyruvate
      sulfurtransferase (3-MST). Previous studies have demonstrated that Taurine and H2S may play
      important roles in the development of themicroangiopathy and lower extremity arterial
      occlusive.
