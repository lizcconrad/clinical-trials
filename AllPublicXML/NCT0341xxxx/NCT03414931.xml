  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex and multi-factorial disorder. Most of the
      current antidepressants are based upon the monoamine hypothesis which cannot fully explain
      the etiology of depression. Many elderly patients have significant side effects after
      treatment with antidepressants which hamper the motivation for treatment and medication
      adherence. NMDA hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. MDD in
      the elderly is often associated with cognitive deficits which are not necessarily recovered
      by current antidepressants. The NMDA receptor regulates synaptic plasticity, memory, and
      cognition. In our previous studies, cognitive improvement has been observed with treatment of
      NMDA enhancers. Therefore, this study will examine the efficacy and safety as well as
      cognitive function improvement of NMDAE in the treatment of MDD in the elderly by comparing
      with sertraline (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI]) and placebo.

      The investigator will enroll elderly patients with MDD for an 8-week treatment. All patients
      will be randomly assigned into three groups: NMDAE, sertraline, or placebo. The investigator
      will biweekly measure clinical performances. Cognitive functions will be assessed at baseline
      and at endpoint of treatment by a battery of tests. The investigator hypothesize that NMDAE
      can safely yield better efficacy than placebo and sertraline for elderly patients with MDD.
