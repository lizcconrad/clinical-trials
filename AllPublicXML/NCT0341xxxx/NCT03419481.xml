    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm Phase II trial of pembrolizumab in patients with hepatitis B
      virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma with parallel study on baseline and serial change in
      the immune environment.

      Subjects should have a confirmed diagnosis of HCC (in accordance with the AASLD guideline)
      and confirmed chronic infection with hepatitis B virus as defined by positivity for HBsAg.
      Antiviral therapy for HBV must be given for at least 12 weeks and HBV viral load must be less
      than 100 IU/mL prior to first dose of study drug. They must have disease not amenable to a
      curative treatment approach or loco-ablation. Subject must be fit and agreeable with baseline
      and post-treatment biopsy of tumor. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion per
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
      Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1 and adequate organ functions. 30 subjects will be
      enrolled to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks(Q3W). Pre-treatment and
      on-treatment biopsy after 2 cycles of Pembrolizumab will be preformed. Treatment will be
      stopped when progression of disease or intolerable toxicity occurs. The primary objectives of
      this trial are to study the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with HBV-related
      HCC and to study the serial change in RNA expression of immune-related gene panel in
      post-treatment biopsy tissue.

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to study the serial change in cytokine profile
      between pre-treatment and post-treatment samples, to study the PD-L1 immunohistochemical
      (IHC) expression in tumor sample at baseline and post-treatment tissue samples and to study
      the presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in the baseline and post-treatment tumor
      samples.

      The exploratory objective of this trial is to evaluate the possibility of using baseline and
      the serial change in RNA expression of immune-related gene panel or PD-L1/2 IHC to predict
      treatment response.

             IU/mL prior to first dose of study drug. Those on active HBV therapy with viral loads
             under 100 IU/mL should stay on the same therapy throughout trial treatment. Those
             subjects who are anti-HBc (+), and negative for HBsAg, and negative for anti-HBs, and
             have an HBV viral load under 100 IU/mL do not require HBV anti-viral prophylaxis, but
             need close monitoring.

         20. Baseline HBV DNA level &gt; 100 IU/ml

         21. Patients with concomitant HCV infection (as evidenced by Anti-HCV positivity)
