  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In general, several studies show that adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among men who
      have sex with men (MSM) is low. Yet, high adherence to ART is essential—not only to improve
      the quality of life and survival rates among MSM living with HIV, but also to reduce HIV
      transmission among their partners. Our project aims to address this unmet need through a
      community-based habit-formation intervention, which incorporates elements of gamification.
      This intervention will provide MSM living with HIV who have been recently diagnosed and
      linked to care several tools to develop the habit of taking their medication and overcome
      disruptive adherence events (DAE) that would otherwise lead to treatment abandonment or lower
      adherence.

      Between 2015 and 2017, the investigators conducted a study funded by CONACYT —the Mexican
      Council for Research—in two Mexican cities to involve MSM living with HIV in the design of an
      intervention to improve ART adherence. Results from this study show that at the beginning of
      ART, MSM living with HIV can benefit greatly from a habit-formation community-based
      intervention that includes support mechanisms to tackle the multiple barriers they face.

      Using these findings, the investigators created FUERTES, an intervention with two main
      components: 1) the provision of a simple tool that MSM can access to learn how to develop an
      habit of taking their ART drugs, and 2) the support of a trained peer with background in
      psychology to help teach them how to overcome the myriad of barriers they may face in
      achieving medication adherence.

      This is a multicentre, parallel, randomized, controlled trial. The project's aim is to
      pilot-test the intervention and document its implementation. Specifically, the investigators
      will assess the effect of the intervention on ART adherence among MSM living with HIV at four
      and ten months. Secondary outcomes include viral load and CD4 cell counts. They will also
      assess the scalability of the intervention by measuring the costs of the intervention. The
      duration of the project is two years starting December 2017. The researchers hypothesize that
      the FUERTES intervention will improve ART adherence among MSM living with HIV starting ART by
      at least 15%, measured by the medication possession ratio.

      FUERTES is an intervention with two main components: 1) the provision of a simple tool that
      MSM can access to learn how to develop an habit of taking their ART drugs, and 2) the support
      of a trained peer with background in psychology to help teach them how to overcome the myriad
      of barriers they may face in achieving medication adherence.

      The first component includes providing each participant in the intervention arm with a
      habit-formation kit, which will include: 1) an information and habit-formation tool that can
      be accessed through a web platform, a mobile app and a booklet 2) a pocket pill-case; 3) a
      weekly pill organizer; 4) a water bottle containing a hidden pill case; 5) a fidget cube; and
      6) a notebook and pen. Patients will also have access to a phone number to solve questions
      regarding HIV and ART with a medical doctor.

      The second component includes providing social support to patients with high level of
      barriers that might influence the adherence to ART, through two mechanisms. Firstly,
      participants will receive professional psychologists will act as habit-formation coaches and
      will provide emotional support, sex education and referral to relevant health services.
      Secondly, they will receive one-on-one habit-formation support from MSM living with HIV who
      have been taking ART for several years, with the objective of reducing self-stigma and
      providing experience and reassurance that living a full and healthy life with HIV is
      possible.

    <description>ART adherence will be assessed by different well-validated methods. In this study, ART adherence will be measured using medication possession ratio which measures participants' medication adherence using pharmacy refill information. We will also use a questionnaire based on the &quot;AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) adherence follow up questionnaire&quot;, adapted after the pilot phase. We will administer this questionnaire through self-interview survey in a phablet. We will also use a 30 day recall question.
While higher values indicate better levels of adherence, patients with adherence levels of 90% and above are regarded as ART-adherent while those with values less than 90% are not adherent to ART medications.</description>

After completing baseline a questionnaire, patients with a score of 2 for barriers that might affect their ART adherence will be assigned a coach. The coach will have 7 one-on-one sessions with the patient in a period of 4 months in order to catalyze ART adherence. MSM living with HIV who have been taking ART for &gt;3 years will provide a one-time one-on-one peer support session</description>
