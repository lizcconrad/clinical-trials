    <textblock>
      Internal medicine resident physicians were provided an ipod with the EN application to assist
      them in choosing EN formulas for patients during their ICU rotation. The primary outcome was
      improved initiation of EN within 24 hours of admission. Secondary outcomes include, time to
      initiate EN, goal calories reached, infections rates, length of stay, mortality, and
      concordance with clinical guidelines.

      Background: Resident physicians are frequently uncomfortable ordering enteral nutrition (EN)
      and are unaware of the variety of formulas and supplements available for different disease
      processes. Many depend on a clinical dietitian to assist with recommending EN formulas and
      patient energy requirements which may not be readily available upon patient admission. This
      creates a barrier to early initiation of EN and non-compliance with Society of Critical Care
      Medicine and American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition clinical guidelines.
      Objective: Internal medicine resident physicians were provided an ipod with the EN
      application to assist them in choosing EN formulas for patients during their ICU rotation.
      The primary outcome was improved initiation of EN within 24 hours of admission. Secondary
      outcomes include, time to initiate EN, goal calories reached. Design: This study is a
      retrospective chart review to evaluate the impact of a smart phone/device application (EN
      application) to assist resident physicians when ordering EN. The study is a single center
      trial conducted at an academic teaching facility. All patient data was obtained by a
      retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at The
      University of Oklahoma Medical Center.
