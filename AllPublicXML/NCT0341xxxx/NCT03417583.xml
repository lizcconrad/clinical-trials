      Phase A: Recruit 50 patients with HD, and their caregivers, to complete a neuropsychiatric
      and quality of life battery of scales at baseline. Have these 50 patients complete a formal
      psychiatric assessment with a psychiatrist within 2 weeks of this clinical battery, and the
      results of these 2 types of assessments will be compared to establish the level of agreement
      between clinical rating scales and formal psychiatric assessment.

      Phase B: Continue to follow Phase A cohort longitudinally and administer neuropsychiatric and
      quality of life battery at 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months form baseline. Recruit an
      additional 50 patients, administer the same neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at
      baseline, implement medication and counseling intervention according to a standard of care
      protocol, and follow up with the same neuropsychiatric and quality of life battery at 6, 12,
      and 18 months.

      As presented to patient participant:

      In Phase A of this study, participants will be asked to answer questions about their
      psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a member of study staff and a
      caregiver (see scales below). They will also undergo a psychiatric evaluation with a
      psychiatrist at Vanderbilt who works with HD patients. This psychiatric evaluation will take
      approximately 60 minutes and will occur up to 2 weeks before or after the first regular study
      visit. This involves a clinical interview during which a psychiatrist, who is an expert in
      psychiatric symptoms of HD, will ask about their experience with many different symptoms that
      can be experienced in HD. These two evaluations will occur in random order, and they will
      occur within 2 weeks of each other. Participants will continue to see their neurology
      provider for routine follow-up, and they will repeat surveys at 6 months, 12 months, and 18
      months.

      In Phase B of this study, participants will answer a series of questions assessing
      psychiatric symptoms and quality of life in the presence of a member of study staff and a
      caregiver. In addition, psychiatric symptoms will be treated according to a systematic
      protocol developed by HD experts that guides treatment decisions based on current clinical
      standard of care. Participants will return for follow-up at 6 months, 12 months, and 18
      months and repeat the aforementioned surveys at that time.

      Health-Related Quality of Life and Psychiatric Symptom Scales (This will take approximately
      60-90 minutes):

      Participants will be asked to answer questions about psychiatric symptoms and quality of life
      in the presence of a member of study staff and a caregiver.

        -  Two HD Quality of Life (HDQLIFE) scales, Concern with Death and Dying and Meaning and
           Purpose, will ask participants a total of 9 questions related to your thoughts about
           death and meaning in your life.

        -  The Neuro-QoL scales include 5 subscales created specifically to measure quality of life
           in patients with neurological disease. These scales include 41 total questions which ask
           participants to report participation in social activities, anxiety, depression, sense of
           well-being, and satisfaction within the previous week.

        -  The PROMIS Anger scale includes 8 questions that ask participants to rate symptoms of
           anger in the previous week.

        -  The PROMIS Sleep-Related Impairment short form includes 8 questions that ask about sleep
           quality and how participants feel during the day after sleeping.

        -  The Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ-9) includes 9 questions about symptoms of
           depression.

        -  The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) asks participants to rate the severity of 14
           anxiety symptoms.

        -  The Problem Behaviors Assessment short form (PBA-s) asks participants and their
           caregivers about the frequency and severity of 11 different psychiatric symptoms that
           can be experienced in HD.

        -  The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale includes up to 6 items yes or no questions to
           assess presence and severity of suicidal thoughts.

        -  The HD Anosognosia Rating Scale includes 8 questions that ask participants to assess how
           they perform daily tasks.

        -  Sleep Questionnaire includes 5 questions about night and daytime sleep habits.

      Medical History and Examination (This will take approximately 30-60 minutes):

        -  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) is short test to measure memory and thinking
           skills.

        -  The United Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) tool is used by HD clinicians to
           measure the presence and severity of your motor symptoms like chorea and walking
           difficulty.

        -  The UHDRS Total Functional Capacity (TFC) scale is used by HD clinicians to rate
           participant ability to carry out daily tasks such as household chores or managing
           finances.

        -  Investigators will also gather background information such as: date of birth, address,
           insurance status, and income. Participants will also be asked about health and medical
           history such as: date of diagnosis and current medications.

        -  The Modified Morisky Scale includes 6 yes or no questions about how participants take
           medications.

      As presented to caregiver participant:

      Caregiver participants will be asked to accompany the HD patient to a total of 4 clinic
      visits where study staff will administer a series of surveys. Surveys requiring caregiver
      participation are as follows:

        -  The Factor analysis of the frontal systems behavior scale (FrSBe) family-version is a
           46-item scale that asks caregivers to rate characteristics of frontal lobe dysfunction
           in the HD patient currently and prior to disease onset.

        -  The Traumatic Brain Injury- Care Quality of Life (TBI-CareQOL) Caregiver Strain short
           form includes 6 items which ask caregivers to rate their feelings of stress and strain
           related to being a caregiver.

        -  The Problem Behaviors Assessment short form (PBA-s) asks patients and caregivers about
           the frequency and severity of 11 different psychiatric symptoms that can be experienced
           in HD.

      Caregivers may also offer input on the patient's medical history and other symptom surveys as
      they would in a normal clinic visit.
