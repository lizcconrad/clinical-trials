    <measure>Odor</measure>
    <time_frame>The odor score will be recorded at weekly visits over four weeks for each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>The odor score will be recorded using a scale of 1-4 with a score of 1 being pleasant odor to 4 being an unpleasant odor.</description>

    <measure>Pain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The pain score will be recorded at weekly visits over four weeks for each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>The pain score will be recorded with a visual analog scale from 0-10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool score</measure>
    <time_frame>The BWAT score will be recorded at weekly visits over fours weeks for each subject.</time_frame>
    <description>The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment tool score will be used to assess the wound's status throughout the study. The Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment tool measures wound status. The wound size score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound depth score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound edge score ranges from 0 to 5. The wound undermining score ranges from 0 to 5. The necrotic tissue type score ranges from 1 to 5. The necrotic tissue amount ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate type score ranges from 1 to 5. The exudate amount score ranges from 1 to 5. The skin color surrounding wound score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue edema score ranges from 1 to 5. The peripheral tissue induration score score ranges from 1 to 5. The granulation tissue score ranges from 1 to 5. The epithelialization score ranges from 1 to 5. The total score from these sub-scores added together is used as the total BWAT score. For all sub-score values, a value of 0 or 1 is a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The investigational product being examined contains 100% Manuka honey and is ideal for difficult to dress wounds. The dressing provides a moist wound environment to help promote autolytic debridement. The dressing is ideal for partial or full thickness wounds with moderate-to-heavy drainage.</description>

          -  Must have necrotic tissue at least 25% of wound area

          -  The wound type matches one of the indicated wounds listed on the product labeling:

          -  Leg ulcers

          -  Pressure ulcers

             waveform, consistent with adequate blood flow, within 3 months prior to study
             enrollment. If monophasic on exam, the non-invasive tests must display Ankle Brachial
             Index over 0.8 and no worse than mild disease on segmental pressures.

          -  Subject is likely to be compliant with instructions for case, such as following
             institutional standard of care directions, offloading, and keeping the wound area
             protected from environmental contaminants

             opinion of an Investigator, affect the outcome of the study

          -  In the opinion of an Investigator, the subject is otherwise not suitable for study
             participation, such as the subject is likely to be non-compliant with study
             requirements
