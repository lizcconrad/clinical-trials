      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Deep Oscillation (DO) self-treatment
      on recovery after fatiguing soccer training. We investigate deep oscillation (DO) self
      treatment as a measure to promote regeneration, hypothesizing that DO leads to an accelerated
      recovery within the first 48h after fatiguing training with positive effect on the maximum
      strength, rated perceived exertion, creatinkinase (CK) values and DOMS compared to no
      treatment after an .

      Recovery time between in association football (soccer) often is not long enough to completely
      restore. Insufficient recovery can result in a reduced performance and suboptimal development
      in the training process and a higher risk for injuries. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of Deep Oscillation (DO) self-treatment on recovery after fatiguing
      soccer training. Deep Oscillation is a unique method which is characterized by an alternating
      electrostatic which results in a deep resonance vibration of patients tissue.

      Methods: In a randomized crossover study design including 10 soccer players of the 5th german
      devision the following parameters will be evaluated directly before and 48h after an
      fatiguing soccer specific exercise: Maximum isokinetic strength of the leg and hip extensors
      and flexors (Con-Trex® Leg Press, Physiomed, Germany), rating of perceived exertion (RPE)
      during isokinetic testing (Borg scale 6-20) and creatine kinase (CK) serum levels. Delayed
      Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS; visual analogue scale 1-10) will be recorded 24 and 48h
      post-exercise. At random half of the group will perform a DO self-treatment twice daily (4
      applications) for 15 minutes each, whereas the other half gets no intervention. 4 weeks later
      in a cross-over design the same procedure will be conducted again.

    <intervention_model_description>A randomized, cross-over, repeated measures design is used to evaluate the effects of DO on recovery. At random in study phase I the half of the group performs a DO self-treatment twice daily (4 applications) for 15 minutes each, whereas the other half gets no intervention. After a washing out period in study phase II a crossover will be performed. The same protocol is performed again, whereas the other half of the participants carries out the DO intervention .</intervention_model_description>

    <description>DO self treatment with the device &quot;mobile&quot; (Physiomed, Laipersdorf, Germany; U.S. patent 7,343,203 B2). The device produces an alternating electrostatic field, which results in a low-frequency vibration penetrating the tissue. The Field is pulsed at a frequency of 90 Hz. For self-treatment, each volunteer is given an apparatus to take home. An applicator with a diameter of 9 cm is used. The treatment will be carried out in the morning and evening for 15 minutes each in supine position on a sofa. In accordance with the technique of classical manual lymphatic drainage, stroking and circular movements in the upper and lower leg and the inguinal area take place in a fixed order.</description>
