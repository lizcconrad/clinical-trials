  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a major and irreversible cause of blindness among
      the elderly. The sub-retinal space, located between the retinal pigmentary epithelium (RPE)
      and the external segments of the retinal photoreceptors, plays a crucial role in this
      pathology. A recent epidemiologic study in the US, has shown that Parkinson patients treated
      with L-DOPA, developed only later an ARMD when compared to the untreated patients.

      The L-Dopa is an endogenous ligand of the GPR43 receptor (G protein-coupled receptors),
      located on the RPE's cell's apical pole.

      This receptor, via several intracellular mechanisms, regulates the cell's exosomal and
      endosomal pathways: it would appear that the L-DOPA, by stimulating this receptor, decreases
      significantly the RPE's exosome release.

      The contents of the exosomes is still uncertain, however in addition to their signalization
      role, it seems they transport pro-inflammatory components, possibly helping the cellular
      recruitment due to the mononuclear phagocytic systems, particularly toxic for the
      photoreceptors.

      The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of ARMD in a sample of Parkinson's
      Patients followed at Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild and to compared it to
      the prevalence of ARMD of the general population.

      Furthermore the study aims to explore a possible causal link between L-DOPA treatment and
      ARMD.

    <description>Comparison of the percentage of patients with ARMD in both groups (Parkinson's Patients treated or not treated with L-DOPA) : Diagnosis of ARMD by the ophthalmologist is based on 3 exams (Color retinography, Optical coherence tomography and Fundus autofluorescence imaging). In case of any discrepancy between the results of the 3 exams, the final diagnosis of ARMD is based on the Optical coherence tomography.</description>
