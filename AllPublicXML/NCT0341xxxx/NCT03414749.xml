  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to explore the effect of upper and lower extremity chiropractic
      adjustments (manipulation) as well as surface condition (hard surface vs rocker board) on
      multisegmental postural control as represented by postural sway. Using a rocker (tilt) board,
      the participant cannot stand still, but has to adjust posture continuously to maintain
      balance. Body sways are considered to be self-induced because the design of the rocker board
      creates a natural instability without any external perturbation. This task provides a
      self-driven sensorimotor condition in addition to amplifying the sway dynamics. Because the
      rocker board has only one degree of freedom of motion, anteroposterior and lateral sways were
      considered separately on the device. We had the following hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: Lower
      extremity adjustments will lead to reduced postural sway magnitude compared to upper
      extremity adjustments. Hypothesis 2: Lower extremity adjustments will reduce sway variability
      of the rocker board, trunk and head compared to upper extremity adjustments. Hypothesis 3:
      Lower extremity adjustments will facilitate the organization of sway behavior as assessed by
      the chaotic structure of sway.

    <description>Each participant was fitted with two Shimmer3 sensors (Shimmer Sensing, Dublin, Ireland) on their head (occiput) and low back (over S2 tubercle) (see Figure 2) with a third Shimmer3 sensor placed on the surface (ground or rocker board). Participants were asked to perform a series of four postural tasks with two surface conditions (floor or rocker board) and two variations of each (eyes open or closed, and AP or ML rocker board direction). The conditions were randomized (using REDCap) such that either both floor or both rocker board conditions were performed first, with the remainder performed second. The order of variation within the surface type was held consistent for all occasions; eyes open then eyes closed on the floor, and AP then ML rotation direction on the rocker board.</description>
