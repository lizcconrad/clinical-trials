    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effects of powered exoskeleton (EKSO)
      on cardiovascular performance as measured by resting blood pressure and heart rate, peak
      oxygen consumption during walking, energy expenditure, whole and regional body composition
      assessments. The effects of exoskeleton training on walking kinematics including stand-up
      time, walking time, distance covered and speed of walking will also be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Powered exoskeletons using robotic suits have recently been introduced for the rehabilitation
      of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). Exoskeletons offer a unique opportunity for persons
      with SCI to experience standing and walking at a low metabolic cost. Evidence suggested that
      exoskeleton assisted walking can decrease spasticity and improve bowel movement. Training may
      also improve the level of physical activity as well as psychological parameters that are
      likely to interfere with rehabilitation outcomes. Previous studies reported that a frequency
      of 2-3 times per week or more for 1-2 hours may be beneficial in the rehabilitation of
      persons with SCI. Using exoskeletal-assisted walking to improve the level of physical
      activity may be appealing to persons with SCI.

      Exoskeleton training for 12 weeks may enhance energy expenditure, parameters of physical
      activity and result only on modest effects on both cardiovascular and body composition
      parameters. In other words, persons with tetraplegia may have greater cardiovascular and body
      composition adaptations compared to persons with paraplegia. Twenty subjects will participate
      in a powered exoskeleton (EKSO) for one or twice a week for 12 weeks. The program will
      involve walking with the robotic suits for 1 hour for persons with complete (n=10) and
      persons with incomplete (n=10) SCI.
