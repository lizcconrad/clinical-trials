    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study is to estimate the overall survival of patients with
      cervical cancer after the administration of monoclonal antibody (mAb) Nimotuzumab (hR3) in
      combination with chemotherapy of first intention. Patients will be randomized in two parallel
      treatment groups. The first group will receive a dose of 200 mg of monoclonal antibody
      anti-hR3 (weekly during 18 weeks), combined with a chemotherapy (6 cycles, every 21 days of
      Cisplatin 70mg/m2, Vinorelbine 60 mg/m2 (Per Os) at D1 and D8 and then 80mg / m2. The second
      group will receive a placebo in combination with the same chemotherapy regimen as the first
      group.

      At the end of the first intention chemotherapy treatment, a dose of maintenance of
      Nimotuzumab will be administered at the dose of 200mg every 14 days until progression. A
      second chemotherapy in the second intention is proposed, this one is based on Carboplatin (
      CBP) in an AUC (area under curve) of 6, and Paclitaxel (Txl) in 175 mg / m2 / BSA (body
      surface area ) in drip of 3 hours, every 3 weeks, concomitant with the administration of hR3,
      every 14 days, until a limit of toxicity or an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group)
      status superior to 3, appears.
