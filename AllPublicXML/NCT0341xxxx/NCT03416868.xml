  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Note that this is the second half of a study under the same IRB and NIH grant. This second
      study will enroll patients with nodules and those with muscle tension dysphonia. These two
      groups will receive ambulatory voice biofeedback throughout 6 weeks of voice therapy. The
      targeted objective voice measure during biofeedback will be individually tailored with the
      goal of increased percentage compliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This second study will use a single subject design to determine if adding ambulatory voice
      biofeedback to conventional voice therapy can result in faster carryover (compliance) of new
      vocal behaviors established during voice therapy to daily life. Here, ambulatory voice
      biofeedback will be based on glottal aerodynamic measures that have subject-specific
      sensitivity to vocal hyperfunction. Hypothesis: The first ambulatory voice biofeedback week
      will result in higher compliance percentages when compared to baseline and the week prior to
      the initiation of biofeedback (when there was voice therapy alone). Days/weeks post-AVB will
      be significantly different than baseline (successful carryover).

    <description>For the first two weeks of voice therapy, patients will receive ambulatory voice monitoring (no biofeedback) during their voice therapy sessions and throughout the week. In the following 3 weeks of voice therapy (weeks 3 through 5), patients in this arm will be provided ambulatory voice biofeedback. Week 6 involves monitoring without feedback in all subjects to evaluate &quot;washout&quot; and any effect of feedback dose. Monitoring per week: 20 minutes of phonation time after the therapy session (Day 1), 40 minutes of phonation time for each of the next consecutive two days (Days 2 and 3), and 40 minutes of phonation time for the day before the patient's subsequent voice therapy session (Day 4). During biofeedback weeks, feedback will be enabled only on Days 1 and 2.</description>

    <description>Patients will be provided cues regarding their vocal behavior in daily life. Depending on the result of Study 1 in this IRB protocol/NIH grant, The cues will either be: 100% feedback = a vibrotactile cue on a smartwatch every time the patient voices incorrectly... 25% feedback = a vibrotactile cue on a smartwatch every 4th time the patient voices incorrectly... Summary feedback = the patient's overall compliance (percentage of voiced time within desired limits) will be presented via a smartwatch every 2 minutes of voicing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with vocal fold nodules or muscle tension dysphonia undergoing voice therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If a patient's baseline ambulatory monitoring data is not at least 1 standard
             deviation away from a normative database in any measure, he/she will be excluded.
             Non-English speakers are excluded because prompts on the smartphone app are only
             available in English.
