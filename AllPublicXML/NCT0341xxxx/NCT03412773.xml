  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, global study designed to compare the
      efficacy and safety of BGB-A317 versus sorafenib as a first-line systemic treatment in
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. This study also includes a substudy
      investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy in HCC in Japanese
      patients. In Japan, preliminary safety and tolerability will be evaluated (Safety Run-In
      Substudy) before Japanese patients are recruited in this Phase 3 study.
