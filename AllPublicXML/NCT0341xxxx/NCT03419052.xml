  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how foods high in polyphenols and brain training
      exercises affect older adults' cognitive performance
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with low education who give informed consent will complete a baseline cognitive
      assessment and then be randomized to one of four arms: 1) MIND foods and cognitive training,
      2) MIND foods and control training, 3) control foods and cognitive training, or 4) control
      foods and control training.

      All interventions are conducted through applications running on a tablet computer device that
      we will provide to all participants for the study duration. Cognitive training is delivered
      through the online BrainHQ program from Posit Science, Inc. The foods will be shown on the
      tablet device in an online shopping format. Selected foods will be prepared and delivered by
      the study team.

      Active intervention will last for 12 weeks. After the 12-weeks, free food deliveries will
      cease but participants who were allocated to cognitive training will continue to have access
      to BrainHQ. Those in the MIND food arms will be encouraged to maintain MIND food consumption.

    <description>All interventions are conducted through applications running on a tablet computer device that we will provide to all participants for the study duration.
Speed of processing training is provided by the Internet-based BrainHQ program from Posit Science, Inc. BrainHQ contains five different speed training modules (Hawk Eye, Visual Sweeps, Fine Tuning, Eye for Detail, Sound Sweeps) tap time-order judgment, visual discrimination, spatial-match, forward-span, instruction-following, and memory.(93) The Posit program systematically reduces stimulus presentation time to maintain an 85% accuracy rate and launches each new session based on the stopping point of the preceding session. Participants receive performance ratings relative to their prior trial upon completion of each &quot;exercise.&quot; Participants will be incentivized to train 15 minutes (minimum), 5 days per week for 12 weeks.</description>
