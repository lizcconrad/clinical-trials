      The purpose of the project is to set up a national, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter
      cohort study with associated satellites, a tumor registry platform, to document uniform data
      on characteristics, molecular diagnostics, treatment and course of disease, to collect
      patient-reported outcomes and to establish a decentralized biobank for patients with advanced
      breast cancer in Germany.

      OPAL is a national, observational, prospective, longitudinal, multicenter cohort study (tumor
      registry platform) with the purpose to record information on the antineoplastic treatment of
      advanced breast cancer in Germany. The registry will follow patients for up to five years. It
      will identify common therapeutic sequences and changes in the treatment of the disease. At
      inclusion, data in patient characteristics, comorbidities, tumor characteristics and previous
      treatments are collected. During the course of observation data on all systemic treatments,
      radiotherapies, surgeries, and outcome are documented.

      Health-realted quality of life in patients with advanced breast cancer will be evaluated for
      up to five years.
