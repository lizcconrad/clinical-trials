  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out if the drugs MEK162 and erlotinib (Tarceva)
      given in combination are safe and have beneficial effects in patients who have NSCLC.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved MEK162 for use to treat NSCLC.
      Erlotinib is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

    <description>To evaluate the safety of MEK162 plus erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC by evaluating toxicities of therapy and establish a recommended phase IB dosing of MEK162 and erlotinib. Safety population: consists of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the duration of time from the time of randomization to time of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

    <description>For the Phase I portion, patients will start MEK162 by mouth (p.o.) on cycle 1, day 1 and erlotinib on cycle 1, day 2. The MEK162 will be dosed once daily (QD) or twice (b.i.d.), and erlotinib will be dosed daily (QD) on a 28-day cycle.
Phase I will be followed by an expansion Phase Ib.</description>
