      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Patients with biochemical recurrence (Phoenix criteria: PSA nadir + 2 ng/ml) after
           radiation therapy for prostate cancer addressed for prostate biopsy OR

        -  Patients referred to our institution for biopsy-proven local recurrence after radiation
           therapy for prostate cancer but needing a re-assessment with biopsy (insufficient number
           of biopsy and/or imprecise location of positive biopsy and/or questionable diagnostic of
           recurrence)

      Study Design:

        -  Included patients will undergo an endorectal US examination with a Histoscanning™
           acquisition and a multiparametric (T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted and dynamic
           contrast-enhanced) MRI.

        -  Two independent operators will separately define suspicious focal lesion on
           Histoscanning™ images and on MR images.

        -  Random biopsies (at least 2 cores) will be performed in sextants negative at
           Histoscanning™ and at MRI ; In sextants positive at Histoscanning™ and/or at MRI,
           targeted biopsies will be performed in the suspicious part of the sextant (at least two
           cores per suspicious lesion).

        -  Histoscanning™ and MRI results will be compared to biopsy results.

      A total of 30 patients will be included
