    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride works before surgery in treating
      patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving
      erlotinib hydrochloride before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of
      normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the rate of mediastinal nodal clearance and complete pathological response
      after neoadjuvant erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) mutated stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival in patient population of EGFR mutated stage III
      NSCLC patients who are treated with neoadjuvant erlotinib therapy.

      II. To determine the overall survival. III. To estimate the overall response rate from
      neoadjuvant erlotinib. IV. To estimate the surgical resection rate. V. To evaluate the safety
      of neoadjuvant erlotinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine several molecular and cellular biomarkers in the tumors, the skin and the
      serum that are predictive of the efficacy of neoadjuvant erlotinib.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 2 months and then
      undergo thoracotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      1 year, and then every 6 months for 5 years.
