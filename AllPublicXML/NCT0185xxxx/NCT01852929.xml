    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether obstructive sleep apnea affects sleep
      dependent memory and learning. Subjects with apnea will be given a test of perceptual skill
      learning (the Visual Discrimination Task (VDT)) that has previously been shown to depend on
      sleep. Subjects will be tested on this task before and after sleep. The difference in
      performance after sleep compared to before sleep provides a measure of sleep dependent
      learning. Participants will be tested on one night when they have less apnea because they are
      using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as prescribed by their physician, which is
      well known to reduce apnea; and on another night when they are in their native state and have
      a greater degree of apnea. Memory performance will be compared between the two nights to
      determine how apnea affects sleep dependent memory.

    <measure>VDT learning Change Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline after 6-9 hours sleep</time_frame>
    <description>Learning on the visual discrimination task (VDT) is measured by comparing performance on the perceptual task at a baseline session prior to sleep to that in a second session after sleep. Subjects are standardly tested in the hour prior to their typical bedtime, and re-tested after spontaneously awakening after a night of sleep. Sleep is known to consolidate learning on this task, such that more robust learning occurs after an interval of sleep compared to when the patient is awake over the same interval (Stickgold et al, J Cog Neurosci,2000; Stickgold et al., Nat Neurosci, 2000). Our aim is to determine if sleep dependent learning is disrupted by apnea, and preserved when apnea is eliminated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>During minimum 6 hour sleep recording</time_frame>
    <description>The AHI is a measure of the average number of respiratory events recorded per hour of sleep based on a record which includes a minimum of 6-hours of recorded sleep. Standard clinical categories for the severity of apnea are as follows: Mild = 5-10/ hour; Moderate = 10-15/ hour; Severe = &gt;15/ hour. We will measure the Apnea Hypopnea Index on the night when participants are using their standard recommended PAP therapy and on the night when they are not using that therapy in order to be able to determine how the degree of apnea (AHI) correlates with the primary outcome measure.</description>
