      after they have a baby through questionaires administered prepartum and questionaires and
      structured interviews postpartum. The study will ask subjects questions about HIV, drug use,

      This study is evaluating information pre and postpartum to assess what are barriers to
      patients coming into care for HIV after they have a baby. We will try to evaluate recurrent
      themes in questionaires and interviews to try and identify the barriers to care.
