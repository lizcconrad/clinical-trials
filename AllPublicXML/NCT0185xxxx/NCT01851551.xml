  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 1/2 study performed at two clinical centers in the US and UK. It was a
      single arm, open label study evaluating VSLI plus rituximab in adults with aggressive
      relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate, defined as the proportion of
      patients with a response of CR + PR.

      Duration of response, time to progression, and overall survival were analyzed. Descriptive
      statistics were used for demographics, disease characteristics, treatment exposures,
      efficacy, and safety variables.

    <time_frame>Assessed prior to each cycle for up to 12 cycles (24 weeks). For patients achieving a complete or partial response, follow-up assessments were to be made 2, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment was discontinued (up to ~48 wks).</time_frame>

    <measure>Assessment of the number of events and number and percentage of patients with treatment-emergent AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were assessed up to 30 days post last dose. Dosing may last up to 24 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The number of events and number and percentage of patients with treatment-emergent AEs that occurred from the time of first study treatment up to 30 days following the last study treatment were summarized by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, NCI CTC grade, and relationship to study drug.
Safety variables included adverse events, neurologic assessments, chemistry and hematology laboratory tests, physical examinations, and vital signs.
Neurologic symptom scores were summarized for baseline and worst score on study. The number and percentage of patients with neurologic symptom abnormalities were tabulated and presented by severity and cycle for each symptom.
Neurologic sign scores were summarized for baseline and worst score on study. The number and percentage of patients with neurologic sign abnormalities were tabulated and presented by severity and cycle for each sign.
Shifts from baseline to worst value were tabulated by cycle based on NCI CTC grades</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically-confirmed diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), as defined
             by the Revised European American Lymphoma/WHO classification. This included: diffuse
             large B-cell, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma with sclerosis,intravascular
             large B-cell lymphoma, immunoblastic B-cell lymphoma, T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma or
             anaplastic large B-cell lymphoma. In the US protocol only, patients who had
             transformation from an indolent lymphoma and those who had mantle cell lymphoma were
             eligible.

               -  Confirmation of CD20 expression on lymphoma cells.

               -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) ≤2.

               -  One or more prior chemotherapy regimens. Patients who had received prior
                  rituximab therapy as part of an induction chemotherapy regimen or who had a
                  previous response to rituximab as a single agent were eligible.

               -  Measurable disease in at least 1 site, which had not been previously irradiated.

        Measurable disease was defined as at least 1 bidimensionally measurable lesion with clearly
        defined margins that were ≥1.5 cm in the largest dimension determined by physical
        examination or computed tomography (CT) scan.

          -  Total bilirubin and serum creatinine ≤2 times the ULN.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥0.5 × 109/L, and platelets ≥50 × 109/L.

          -  18 years of age or older.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who were willing to use an acceptable method of
             contraception throughout the course of the study.

        Signed and dated informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known transformation from an indolent lymphoma (UK protocol only).

          -  Eligible for conventional or high-dose chemotherapy with curative intent.

          -  Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg/day of
             prednisone or equivalent) within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Any previous malignancies with less than a 5-year complete remission interval, except
             for curatively resected basal cell carcinoma or curatively resected in situ carcinoma
             of the uterine cervix.

          -  History of or active CNS-lymphoma, AIDS-related lymphoma, or any uncontrolled severe
             medical illness or infection.

          -  History of neurologic disorders unrelated to chemotherapy (including familial
             neurologic diseases and acquired demyelinating disorders).

          -  Grade 3 or 4 sensory or motor neuropathy at screening related to prior chemotherapy.

          -  Major surgery (excluding that for diagnosis) within 4 weeks of enrollment.
