  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether the investigational drug ganaxolone
      can help smokers quit smoking. Ganaxolone is a drug that has been investigated (in other
      research studies) for the treatment of seizures and migraines. This drug is considered
      investigational in the US.

      The purpose of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate whether expired air carbon monoxide
      (CO) will be reduced and smoking cessation success rates enhanced for smokers who receive the
      neurosteroid analog ganaxolone. The trial will be seeking preliminary indications of efficacy
      and tolerability in the smoking population and allow us to estimate effect sizes for future
      controlled trials.
