      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two new family-based oral health
      promotion programs with the routine program in use earlier in Vantaa public dental service.
      The children born in 2008 were followed from their first visit to public dental service at
      the age of 6-12 months to their dental examination at the age of 2-2½ years. The outcome
      measures are the colonization of mutans streptococci in dental plaque, dental caries, and the
      oral health habits of two-year-olds.

      The investigators hypothesized that the training of the dental professionals involved in
      children's examinations could improve the quality of the counseling, raise the level of
      commitment, and give them a new kind of perspective on early childhood oral health
      counseling. Health promotion programs with clinical guidance aimed also at the parents
      themselves might commit the families to maintain their children's good oral health.

      All programs (two new and the control program) consisted of the basic elements of oral health
      counseling for the children. The counseling included regular oral hygiene, i.e. tooth
      brushing with fluoride-containing toothpaste twice a day, advice of a healthy diet with
      proper timing and composition of meals avoiding sugary snacks, and to use xylitol products on
      regular basis. Additionally, in the program of oral hygiene and fluoride, the parents were
      given counseling on how to brush their own teeth with fluoride-containing toothpaste and
      clean between them. In the program of diet and xylitol parent was asked to fill in one-day
      diary of his or her own diet in the waiting room, and the dental professional pointed out the
      frequency of meals and snacks, as well as suggested the use of xylitol 5 grams per day.

      The children, accompanied by their parents, were clinically examined in various health
      clinics of the Vantaa public dental service. At the regular two-year visit, the dental
      hygienists and in-service trained dental nurses tested the children for mutans streptococci
      in plaque. The transtheoretical model and the motivational interviewing were introduced to
      the dental hygienists and in-service trained dental nurses to use in preventive counseling.

      The results of this study will be published in three articles.

    <description>At the age of two years, the children, accompanied by their parents, were clinically examined in the Vantaa PDS. The dental hygienists and in-service trained dental nurses that were working in each clinic performed the examinations by a mirror using the WHO criteria of the electronic patient database. The dental professionals were not blinded to the group of the child. The information from the clinical examinations, including the number of decayed teeth or teeth with distinct visual changes in enamel, was recorded on the database. No missed or filled teeth were found.</description>
