  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to understand the molecular biology underlying the improvement of surgical
      scars treated by ablative fractional photothermolysis (FP). Previous human studies at MGH
      have shown that FP significantly improves the appearance and functionality of surgical and
      burn scars. At the Wellman Center, we have conducted a randomized, controlled study on linear
      surgical scars demonstrating the efficacy of FP to decrease the volume of hypertrophic scars,
      and to improve the appearance and texture of scars. However, the underlying mechanism of this
      therapeutic effect is unknown. It is clear that FP induces wound healing and remodeling of
      the normal skin surrounding microthermal zones (MTZs). Furthermore, other researchers have
      employed animal models using transgenic zebrafish and the mouse eye, and found that laser
      treatments induce changes in gene expression in specific cells. We propose to determine
      whether the effect of FP on scar improvement occurs via changes in patterns of local gene
      expression within the skin, specifically dermal fibroblasts. By characterizing these changes,
      we may be able to identify molecular mechanisms that both explain and contribute to the
      beneficial effects of FP in the surgical and traumatic scar. The molecular insights into the
      therapeutic effects of fractional laser photothermolysis may provide a basis for future
      therapeutic strategies to improve scar remodeling.

      A prospective, open-label study in 10 healthy adults, ages 18-50, with abdominal scars will
      be pursued at the Clinical Research Unit at Wellman Center for Photomedicine (MGH). A
      side-by-side comparison of untreated vs. one topical treatment of ablative fractional
      photothermolysis in qualifying subjects will be made. Ten subjects will receive treatment on
      randomly-assigned portions of their scars, in addition to non-treated control sites. The
      primary measures of efficacy are (a) blinded evaluation of scar improvement from standard
      digital photographs taken before and after the treatments, (b) changes in scar volume
      (measured by 3D Image system) and/or scar width, and (c) a quantitative characterization of
      gene expression measured by mRNA expression levels from treated and untreated scars and
      control sites. The primary measures of side effects are inflammatory and pigmentary outcomes
      assessed by blind evaluation of digital photographs taken before and after the treatments.
      Another study endpoint includes histopathological examination and comparison of treated and
      untreated scars.

      An FDA-approved 10600 nm Fractional laser source will be used for laser exposures performed 2
      months prior to 2 skin biopsies (each 24 mm x 4 mm) of treated and untreated scar sites. A
      control site, with no treatment will also be left for clinical, histological and molecular
      examination.

    <description>Gene array analysis will be performed with the Affymetrix Expression ConsoleTM software, which contains commonly used probe set summarization algorithms, including the MAS5 Statistical algorithm, Probe Logarithmic Intensity Error Estimation (PLIER), and the Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA).
Additional statistical analysis will be performed using the SPSS statistical package (version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All two-tailed values of P &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</description>

    <description>In this survey, subjects are given a list of the treatment side effects before treatment (Visit 1, 2) and are asked to rate each question on a scale of 1 to 5. After treatment, they are given this specific survey (but specific to the treatment site) at each subsequent visit as a repeated measure of side effects. Because subjects will be blinded to the treatment assignment (though sites may become obvious), they will be asked the question based on the treatment site name. Treatment site assignments will be kept with study investigators.</description>
