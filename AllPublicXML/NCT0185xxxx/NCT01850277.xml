  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to determine whether patients on cardiac
      resynchronization therapy with concomitant long-standing persistent or permanent atrial
      fibrillation would benefit from a strategy to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (rhythm
      control strategy) in comparison to a rate control strategy in terms of higher biventricular
      paced beats percentage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to a lack of sufficient data the present guidelines on treatment of patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices are of low scientific
      evidence. The efficacy of CRT in AF patients is limited by the percentage of the effective
      biventricular paced beats (BiVp%), which should exceed 95%-98% - a goal which is seldom
      obtained by means of pharmacological rate control strategy. The only treatment strategy which
      effect is scientifically established is an atrioventricular junction ablation (AVJA) but the
      use of this method is limited.

      On the other hand, about 10% of patients with persistent forms of AF experience a spontaneous
      sinus rhythm (SR) resumption after CRT implantation. Moreover, SR resumption and it's
      maintenance by means of single external electrical cardioversion in AF patients has been
      proven feasible. A strategy of rhythm control in AF patients on CRT could provide high BiVp%
      and improve the efficacy of CRT in this group of patients.

      To show superiority of the rhythm control strategy over the rate control strategy a sample
      size of 60 patients was calculated based on following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I
      error of 0.05, a power of 80%, efficacy (mean BiVp%) of rate control strategy 90%, efficacy
      (mean BiVp%)of rhythm control strategy 98% and 8% drop-out rate to fulfill the criteria of
      intention-to-treat analysis. Due to presumed lack of statistical power the secondary end
      points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory.

    <description>In this group a strategy to restore and maintain SR, including amiodarone and an external electrical cardioversion (EEC), is implemented. A procedure of AF ablation is possible but not obligatory.
At baseline, patients assigned to the group undergo a standard 12-lead ECG, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT), a cardiopulmonary exercise test(CPX), an echocardiography(ECHO), a standard device control; a serum thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) level is assessed and patients fill the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Control visits are performed every 3 months including a 12-lead ECG measurement and a device control. On the visits in the 3rd and 12th month an ECHO, a CPX, a 6MWT are performed and a MLHFQ is filled; control TSH levels are assessed every 6 months.</description>

At baseline, each patient assigned to the rate control group undergoes a standard 12-lead ECG, a 6MWT, a CPX, an ECHO, a standard device control and a serum TSH level assessed. Moreover, the patient fills the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionaire (MLHFQ). The control visits are performed for one year, every 3 months including a standard 12-lead ECG measurement and standard control of the device. On the visits in the 3rd and 12th month additionally an ECHO, a CPX, a 6MWT are performed and a MLHFQ is filled. The control TSH levels are assessed every 6 months.</description>

    <description>The pharmacological treatment in the rhythm control strategy consist of amiodarone given orally including the loading dose up to 600mg daily - for the first 4 weeks. Then, a maintenance dose of 200mg/daily is prescribed. The use of other anti-arrhythmic agents is possible unless they are contraindicated. The introduction of amiodarone must not be performed unless the patient is treated effectively with oral anticoagulants for 3 weeks at least. Discontinuation of amiodarone results neither in withdrawal from the study nor in change of the treatment arm.</description>

    <description>The first EEC is performed after the loading dose of amiodarone has been administered. A maximal number of shocks during one cardioversion is 3. The amount of the energy delivered during shocks is left at discretion of a physician performing the EEC. The EEC must be performed in accordance with the present guidelines on EEC and post-procedural care and the state of art.
If atrial fibrillation reoccur, the patient should undergo a next EEC as soon as possible but preserving the safety time margins (i.e. effective anticoagulation period). The maximal no. of EEC procedures is 3. If sinus rhythm resumption or its maintenance is impossible or AF reoccur after the 3rd EEC, a strategy of rhythm control is discontinued and a rate control strategy is implemented.</description>
