    <textblock>
      The results on the efficacy of the formulations based on alginic acid are controversial.
      Corvaglia et al demonstrated a significant reduction in reflux episodes in preterm infants by
      evaluation with pH-impedance analysis. This study concludes that the use of alginic acid
      reduces the acidity of the gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and has a non-systemic effect and a
      lesser presence of side effects compared to the use of H2-receptor antagonist(H2RA) and
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

      Primary outcomes This prospective, randomized, controlled trial aims to determine, in a
      population of infants within one year of life, suffering from gastroesophageal reflux (GER)
      the effectiveness of magnesium alginate. The clinical improvement of the patient will be
      evaluated based on the negativity of the symptom score (4.3.1), assessed using a validated
      questionnaire on symptoms of GER (I-GERQ Annex A).

      Secondary outcomes To compare the efficacy of Magnesium Alginate on GER in infants compared
      with those of thickened feeding and reassurance, basing on questionnaire results.
