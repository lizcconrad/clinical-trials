    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of stent Inspiron ™
      sirolimus-eluting and coating the abluminal biodegradable stent Biomatrix Flex ™ lesions in
      native coronary arteries.

    <textblock>
      This is a study of non-inferiority, multicentre, prospective, randomized into two treatment
      arms: I) Inspiron ™ stent eluting sirolimus or II) ™ Biomatrix stent eluting biolimus. Are a
      total of 165 randomized patients.

      Patients will be followed for 60 months after the procedure. All new patients will be
      undergoing angiography for evaluation at 9 months. A subgroup of 60 patients will be
      evaluated with volumetric intravascular ultrasound at 9 months. Also, a subgroup of 21
      patients will be evaluated with optical coherence tomography at the end of the index
      procedure and 9 months. It is anticipated that the total study duration is 72 months: 12
      months to complete the admission of patients and 60 months of follow-up.

    <description>For an accurate assessment of the stent conditions 9 months after implantation, a follow-up catheterization will be performed at the 9 months visit in order to measure the diameter of the artery at the stented site.
A subgroup of 60 patients will be evaluated with volumetric intravascular ultrasound at 9 months. Also, a subgroup of 21 patients will be evaluated with optical coherence tomography at the end of the index procedure and 9 months.</description>
