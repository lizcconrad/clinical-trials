  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this exploratory 8-week pilot study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of buspirone for the treatment of anxiety in youth (ages 6-17 years) with autism
      spectrum disorders. The study results will be used to generate hypothesis for a larger
      randomized controlled clinical trials with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical
      power.

    <description>Children with autism spectrum disorders will receive buspirone treatment for eight weeks. Buspirone will be titrated to the maximum daily dose during the first four weeks of the trial (dose titration phase). Week 4 onwards, subjects will be maintained on maximum achieved dose until the end of the trial (dose maintenance pahe). During the titration phase, total dose will be increased by 10mg at each visit and by 5mg on the 4th day after each visit.</description>
