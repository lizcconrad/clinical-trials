      Evaluate the effect of chest manual compression technique (CCT) in the variables of
      oxygenation, hemodynamic and respiratory work in infants with respiratory diseases that are
      associated with atelectasis.

    <description>The CCT was held only once. Prior to the start of data collection the patients were placed in supine position, with the slope of the headboard of the bed in 30 degrees for collection of signs of respiratory distress (runs), RR(respiratory rate)(timer for 1 minute); HR (heart rate) and SpO2(oxygen saturation) through pulse oximetry in infants without atelectasis.</description>

    <description>The CCT was held with the placement of one of the hands were not engaged in. The following has been applied a symmetric oblique direction, pressure from top to bottom on the half thorax rib cage so that it went according to the complacency of the ribcage. This pressure was applied in the expiratory phase and held for 10 seconds, totaling 6 repetitions of the maneuver during 60 seconds. The other hand held on the contralateral iliac crest to stabilize the patient. The technique was held during 5 consecutive minutes with range of a respiratory incursion every 60 seconds. Immediately after and 10 minutes after the end of the application of the technique, the data was measured again.</description>
