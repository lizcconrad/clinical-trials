    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of treatment with 600 mg of BID BI
      207127 in combination with 120 mg QD Faldaprevir and RBV compared to a Telaprevir-based
      regimen along with PegIFN and RBV in chronically infected HCV GT1 treatment naïve patients,
      including patients with compensated cirrhosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Chronic HCV, diagnosed by HCV RNA = 1,000 IU/mL at screening in addition to at least
             one of the following:

               1. positive anti-HCV antibodies or detected HCV RNA at least 6 months prior to
                  screening, OR

               2. liver biopsy indicating chronic HCV infection, OR

               3. history of elevated ALT levels at least 6 months prior to screening.

          2. HCV infection of sub-GT1b confirmed by genotypic testing at screening.

          3. Treatment naïve defined as:

               1. no prior treatment with any interferon, pegylated interferon, and /or ribavirin
                  and

               2. no prior treatment with at least one dose of any other licensed or
                  investigational antiviral agent for acute or chronic hepatitis C infection.

          4. Availability of a liver biopsy within three years or fibroscan within 6 months prior
             to randomisation.

             Note: patients who do not have a liver biopsy (nor fibroscan) due to contraindication
             of the procedure should not be excluded for this reason. The decision on the inclusion
             of these patients should be discussed with the CML. Patients with a liver biopsy
             performed 3 or more years (or fibroscan performed 6 months or more) prior to
             randomisation, demonstrating cirrhosis do not need to repeat a liver biopsy or
             fibroscan.

          5. Age 18 - 70 years (inclusive).

          6. Female patients

               1. with documented hysterectomy, or

               2. who have had both ovaries removed, or

               3. with documented tubal ligation, or

               4. who are post-menopausal with last menstrual period at least 12 months prior to
                  screening, or

               5. of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and
                  on Day 1 (Visit 2), who agree to use two non-hormonal methods of birth control
                  from the date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin. They
                  must not breast-feed at any time from the date of screening until 7 months after
                  the last dose of ribavirin.

             Accepted methods of contraception for females in this trial are diaphragm with
             spermicide substances, intrauterine devices, cervical caps and condoms.

             Note: Systemic hormonal contraceptives may not be as effective in women taking BI
             207127/FDV combination therapy and are not accepted methods of contraception in the
             study.

             OR:

             Male patients

               1. who are documented to be sterile, or

               2. who consistently and correctly use a condom while their female partners (if of
                  child-bearing potential) agree to use one of the appropriate medically accepted
                  methods of birth control from the date of screening until 7 months after the last
                  dose of ribavirin, and

               3. without pregnant female partners. It is in the responsibility of the male patient
                  to ensure that his partner (or partners) is not pregnant prior to enrolment into
                  the study or becomes pregnant during the treatment and follow-up phase. Female
                  partners of childbearing potential must perform monthly pregnancy tests from the
                  date of screening until 7 months after the last dose of ribavirin (tests will be
                  provided by the Sponsor).
