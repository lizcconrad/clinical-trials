      The purpose of this research study is to establish a way to help the development of targeted
      treatments in autism spectrum disorders. This may also help in early diagnosis of autism and
      may possibly predict severity. The study will compare subject's ERK (extracellular
      signal-related kinase) signaling to age- and gender-matched neurotypical controls and
      Intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched developmental disabilities.

           Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V (DSM-V)

        -  Age 3-25 years

        -  Stable dosing of psychotropic drugs for greater than or equal to 5 half-lives

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Diagnosis of schizophrenia, another psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or alcohol or
           other substance abuse based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V criteria

        -  Use of lithium, riluzole or other known modulators of ERK activation

      Age-Matched Neurotypical Control Subjects:

        -  Age matched to the age of an Autistic Disorder Subject

        -  History of normal development

      IQ-Matched Control Subjects:

        -  Those subjects who are included in the study based on having an IQ and age that matches
           the IQ and age of an Autistic Disorder Subject who has an IQ less than 70

        -  All IQ-Matched Control Subjects will then also have an IQ less than 70

      For the ERK activation assay, about 5 mL of whole blood is layered onto 3 mL Histopaque in a
      15 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuged. The lymphocyte-containing cell layer is removed and
      transferred for washing. After a second wash, cells are resuspended and rested. They are then
      stimulated by addition of phorbol myristate acetate and sample aliquots are removed at short
      intervals, fixed and permeabilized. Fixed, permeabilized cells are stained by addition of
      Alexafluor488-labeled monoclonal antibody to phospho-ERK in the dark for 30 min. Washed,
      resuspended cells are analyzed in a Coulter flow cytometer.

        The subjects with autism will be recruited through the clinic population at Cincinnati
        Children's Hospital Medical Center. Recruitment of subjects will be conducted by notifying
        via, IRB approved electronic and paper ads, individuals with autistic disorder, their
        families, treating clinicians and agencies throughout the referral base of CCHMC and those
        within our existing clinical services, residential facilities, schools and group homes for
        the developmentally disabled.

        Inclusion Criteria (ASD subjects):

          -  Diagnosis of autistic disorder as confirmed by a clinical interview, utilizing the
             DSM-V

          -  Age 3-25 years

          -  Stable dosing of psychotropic drugs for 5 half-lives or greater

        Exclusion Criteria (ASD subjects):

          -  Diagnosis of schizophrenia, another psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, or alcohol
             or other substance abuse based on DSM-V criteria

          -  Use of lithium, riluzole or other known modulators of ERK activation

        IQ-Matched Control Subjects: Those subjects who are included in the study based on having
        an IQ and age that matches the IQ and age of an Autistic Disorder Subject who has an IQ
        less than 70. All IQ-Matched Control Subjects will then also have an IQ less than 70.
        IQ-Matched Control Subjects participate in a Screen/Baseline visit only.

        Age-Matched Neurotypical Control Subjects: Those subjects who are included in the study
        based on having an age matched to the age of an Autistic Disorder Subject and a history of
        normal development. Age-Matched Neurotypical Subjects participate in a Screen/Baseline
        visit only.

        Shipped Biomarker Control Group Subjects: For these shipping control samples, blood samples
        will also be drawn from adult parent/guardians of participating subjects.
