  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-7622
      compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) for
      the symptomatic treatment of participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The
      trial consists of two stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. In Stage 1, participants will be
      randomized to receive either placebo or MK-7622 45 mg once daily. In Stage 2, participants
      will be randomized to receive either placebo or MK-7622 (dose: 5, 15 or 45 mg once daily).
      Participants will be enrolled in only one stage; the duration of each stage is approximately
      26 weeks. Interim analyses will be performed in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 to determine whether
      the trial should continue. The primary study hypotheses are the following: Stage 1 - MK-7622
      45 mg once daily is superior to placebo with respect to improving cognition in participants
      with mild to moderate AD as assessed by mean change from baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's
      Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) at Week 12; Stage 2 - At least one
      of the top two doses of MK-7622 (15 mg once daily, 45 mg once daily) is superior to placebo
      with respect to improving cognition in participants with mild to moderate AD as assessed by
      mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11 at Week 12.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the double-blind treatment dose is not tolerated during the first 2 weeks, the participant
      will be discontinued. After the first 2 weeks, if the dose is not tolerated, the regimen may
      be modified according to a defined algorithm. Specifically, the participant will begin
      administration of a reduced dose for up to 2 weeks, followed by a re-challenge at the
      original dose only if tolerability issues diminish or resolve at the reduced dose.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) Score at Week 12 (Stage 1, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline at week 12 was assessed for ADAS-Cog11 score. ADAS-Cog11 measures cognition by assessing 11 metrics impaired in Alzheimer's Disease (AD): speech; speech comprehension; word finding; word recall; object/finger naming; orientation; obeying commands; ideational praxis; constructional praxis; word recognition; and remembering instruction. For each metric, scores range from 0 (no impairment) to (depending on the metric) either 5 (8 metrics), 8, 10, or 12 (1 metric each); higher scores indicate more severe impairment. Individual scores sum to a total ADAS-Cog11 score, ranging from 0-70. Higher total scores indicate greater cognitive impairment and AD severity. Further, increases in AD severity over time would be reflected by increases in ADAS-Cog11 score.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants experiencing an adverse event (AE) was assessed. An AE is any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence, symptom, or disease witnessed in a participant, regardless of whether or not a causal relationship with the study treatment can be demonstrated. Further, any worsening of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study treatment is also considered an AE.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) at Week 24 (Combining Stage 1 and 2, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline at week 24 was assessed for ADCS-ADL score. The ADCS-ADL score measures the performance of activities of daily living, calculated from a 24-question survey. For each of the 24 questions, scores range from 0 (no independence) to (depending on the question) either 2 (1 question), 3 (17 questions), 4 (5 questions), or 5 (1 question), with higher scores indicating greater independence in activity performance. Scores from individual questions are summed into a total ADCS-ADL score, with potential total scores ranging from 0 to 78. Lower scores indicate less independence in activity performance and, as a result, greater AD severity. Further, increases in AD severity over time would be reflected by decreases in ADCS-ADL score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Composite Cognition Score-3 Domain (CCS-3D) at Week 12 (Stage 1, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>CCS-3D is composed of individual cognitive tests, grouped into 3 domains: 1) episodic memory; 2) executive function; and 3) attention/processing speed. For each cognitive test, a z-score (Z) is calculated at each time point [Z = (observed value - study population mean at baseline) / study population standard deviation at baseline]. These individual Zs are first combined into domain-specific Zs, and then into a composite Z, (i.e. CCS-3D). Theoretically, 99.9% of CCS-3D will be ± 3; more positive CCS-3D indicate greater cognitive impairment relative to the total study population at baseline. Further, negative changes in CCS-3D over time indicate improved cognition relative to the total study population at baseline.</description>

          <description>ADAS-Cog11 measures cognition by assessing 11 metrics impaired in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): speech; speech comprehension; word finding; word recall; object/finger naming; orientation; obeying commands; ideational praxis; constructional praxis; word recognition; and remembering instruction. For each metric, scores range from 0 (no impairment) to (depending on the metric) either 5 (8 metrics), 8, 10, or 12 (1 metric each); higher scores indicate more severe impairment. Individual scores sum to a total ADAS-Cog11 score (range: 0-70). Higher total scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.</description>

          <description>The ADCS-ADL score measures the performance of activities of daily living, calculated from a 24-question survey. For each of the 24 questions, scores range from 0 (no independence) to (depending on the question) either 2 (1 question), 3 (17 questions), 4 (5 questions), or 5 (1 question), with higher scores indicating greater independence in activity performance. Scores from individual questions are summed into a total ADCS-ADL score, with potential total scores ranging from 0 to 78. Lower scores indicate less independence in activity performance and, as a result, greater AD severity.</description>

          <title>Composite Cognition Score-3 Domain (CCS-3D)</title>
          <description>CCS-3D is composed of individual cognitive tests, grouped into 3 domains: 1) episodic memory; 2) executive function; and 3) attention/processing speed. For each cognitive test, a z-score (Z) is calculated at each time point [Z = (observed value - study population mean at baseline) / study population standard deviation at baseline]. These individual Zs are first combined into domain-specific Zs, and then into a composite Z, (i.e. CCS-3D). Theoretically, 99.9% of CCS-3D will be ± 3; more positive CCS-3D indicate greater cognitive impairment relative to the total study population at baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) Score at Week 12 (Stage 1, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo)</title>
        <description>Mean change from baseline at week 12 was assessed for ADAS-Cog11 score. ADAS-Cog11 measures cognition by assessing 11 metrics impaired in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): speech; speech comprehension; word finding; word recall; object/finger naming; orientation; obeying commands; ideational praxis; constructional praxis; word recognition; and remembering instruction. For each metric, scores range from 0 (no impairment) to (depending on the metric) either 5 (8 metrics), 8, 10, or 12 (1 metric each); higher scores indicate more severe impairment. Individual scores sum to a total ADAS-Cog11 score, ranging from 0-70. Higher total scores indicate greater cognitive impairment and AD severity. Further, increases in AD severity over time would be reflected by increases in ADAS-Cog11 score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL) at Week 24 (Combining Stage 1 and 2, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo)</title>
        <description>Mean change from baseline at week 24 was assessed for ADCS-ADL score. The ADCS-ADL score measures the performance of activities of daily living, calculated from a 24-question survey. For each of the 24 questions, scores range from 0 (no independence) to (depending on the question) either 2 (1 question), 3 (17 questions), 4 (5 questions), or 5 (1 question), with higher scores indicating greater independence in activity performance. Scores from individual questions are summed into a total ADCS-ADL score, with potential total scores ranging from 0 to 78. Lower scores indicate less independence in activity performance and, as a result, greater AD severity. Further, increases in AD severity over time would be reflected by decreases in ADCS-ADL score.</description>

        <population>Per protocol, analysis population was to include all randomized participants (pooled across Stages 1 and 2) receiving ≥1 dose of placebo or MK-7622 – 45 mg, having either a baseline or 24-week ADCS-ADL assessment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Composite Cognition Score-3 Domain (CCS-3D) at Week 12 (Stage 1, MK-7622 45 mg Versus Placebo)</title>
        <description>CCS-3D is composed of individual cognitive tests, grouped into 3 domains: 1) episodic memory; 2) executive function; and 3) attention/processing speed. For each cognitive test, a z-score (Z) is calculated at each time point [Z = (observed value - study population mean at baseline) / study population standard deviation at baseline]. These individual Zs are first combined into domain-specific Zs, and then into a composite Z, (i.e. CCS-3D). Theoretically, 99.9% of CCS-3D will be ± 3; more positive CCS-3D indicate greater cognitive impairment relative to the total study population at baseline. Further, negative changes in CCS-3D over time indicate improved cognition relative to the total study population at baseline.</description>
