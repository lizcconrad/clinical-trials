  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cause of cardioembolism and a leading cause of
      ischemic stroke. The diagnosis of AF after cerebral ischemia is difficult to establish even
      during the treatment at specialised stroke units, as paroxysmal episodes may terminate
      spontaneously before arrival at the hospital and do not always show early recurrence.
      However, the diagnosis of AF is of particular clinical relevance since adaequate
      anticoagulation is one of the most effective secondary preventive treatments in stroke. The
      detection rate of AF after stroke increases progressively by extending the duration and
      intensity of cardiac monitoring. For this purpose innovative medical devices and implantable
      event recorders have been suggested. However, high socioeconomic expenses, malcompliance and
      the invasiveness of some of these approaches currently limit their use to a minority of
      affected patients, while the growing number of stroke survivors is lacking access to free and
      simple screening tools.

      For primary prevention, the measurement of the peripheral pulse (MPP) is currently the only
      guideline-recommended screening method among individuals aged 65 years or older. In contrast,
      MPP has never been applied in the setting of secondary stroke prevention, probably because
      several factors were expected to interfere with this simple technique, including sensomotor
      and neuropsychiologic handicaps of stroke patients 18. This study investigates feasibility
      and validity of MPP in this cohort (pilot phase) and compares daily MPP for 6 months with
      repeated holter-ECG in patients after ischemic stroke.

      This prospective, single-center, observational trial will enroll n=300 patients with acute
      cerebral ischemia without detection of AF after standard stroke unit diagnostic procedures.
      During the acute in-hospital phase at the stroke unit, patients and, if available, relatives
      are introduced to and trained for peripheral pulse self measurements. Experiences on this
      educational process, including feasibility and diagnostic accuracy have already been gained
      during a pilot phase of the study (n=256 patients). Pulse rate and subjective perception of
      absolute pulse arrhythmia are assessed by the patient and/or relatives at least three times
      daily or during palpitations, with results being documented in a patient diary. After
      hospital discharge, the patient continues with daily measurements (min. 3 times per day) for
      6 months. In parallel the patient will transmit ECGs using a handheld mobile ECG-device as a
      control to the study center. This ECG will be reviewed for episodes of atrial fibrillation.
      If the patient recognizes new pulse arrhythmias or an excess of pulse rate beyond an upper or
      lower limit of &gt;120/min or &lt;45/min, resp., the patient is requested to transmit an additional
      ECG to the study center. In this case, a 12-lead ECG and further diagnostic tests (e.g.
      cardiac marker or echocardiography) is initiated. As an internal control group the same
      patients will receive standard 72h holter ECG at 3 and 6 months which will be evaluated for
      episodes of atrial fibrillation by an investigator blinded for clinical data as well as
      results from the pulse measurements. Detection rates (pulse measurements, holter ECGs) as
      well as time of first diagnosis of atrial fibrillation using the different diagnostic
      approaches will be important endpoints of the study.

    <description>Patients after ischemic stroke without a history of atrial fibrillation will perform measurements of peripheral pulse three times daily and in case of symptomatic arrhythmic episodes. Results will be entered into a diary which will be send to the center every month. In parallel to the measurements, patients will transmit ECGs via a mobile ECG recorder to the study center.
At 3 and 6 months after inclusion patients will be evaluated using 72h holter ECG. During the whole study period AEs as well as SAEs and changes in medications are recorded.</description>
