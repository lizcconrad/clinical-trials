      The purpose of this study is to determine, through continuous monitoring with a cardiac
      monitoring device placed under the skin, the incidence of atrial fibrillation or flutter
      (AF). The cardiac monitor will be placed in patients without symptoms but at risk for AF. It
      is hoped that this information may assist health care professionals in treatment decisions
      related to the early identification of patients at high risk for AF.

      Background: Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (AF) are common cardiac arrhythmias that
      confer a substantial stroke burden largely because the vast majority of AF is asymptomatic
      and identified after a stroke has occurred. Until recently, only intermittent cardiac
      monitors were available, with most AF episodes remaining undetected due to poor sensitivity.
      Health care providers estimate the risk of stroke in AF patients using a patient's
      comorbidity profile to determine who should be treated with oral anticoagulant therapy for
      stroke prevention. The incidence of AF in patients with high stroke risk comorbidities is not
      known. The Medtronic Reveal insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) is a continuous monitoring
      device with excellent AF detection.

      Purpose and Study Objectives: The purpose of the PREDATE AF study is to determine the
      incidence of AF in asymptomatic patients at high risk for having AF in order to determine
      which patient characteristics are most predictive of the development of AF. The primary
      objective is to determine the AF incidence rate; secondary objectives include identifying the
      most important predictors of AF onset and identifying how physicians respond once AF has been
      discovered.

      Study Design: The trial is a prospective, single arm, open-label, single center clinical
      study which will enroll up to 360 patients at high risk of having AF based upon their
      comorbidity profile, who will then receive an ICM. Enrolled subjects will be followed for a
      minimum of 18 months to monitor for the detection of AF. Monthly ICM data transmissions will
      be the mechanism of AF detection, and this information will be utilized to determine the AF
      incidence rate

        The PREDATE AF trial is a prospective, single arm, open-label, single center clinical study
        to evaluate the incidence of AF in patients that are suspected to be at high risk of having
        AF, as defined by a modified CHA2DS2-VASc score.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient meets the approved FDA indication to receive the ICM

          -  Patient is suspected, based on demographics, to be at high risk of having AF, as
             determined by the clinical investigator

          -  Patient has a CHA2DS2-VASc score â‰¥ 2 [Note: stroke/TIA criterion as part of the
             CHA2DS2-VASc score for this trial is limited to either an ischemic stroke or TIA,
             which occurred more than one year prior to enrollment.]
