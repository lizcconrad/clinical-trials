    <textblock>
      Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic disease in children. Complementary and Alternative
      Medicine research on asthma showed a potential effect on pediatric patients.

      Studies looking at the effect of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment seems to reveal positive
      results.

      The aim of study is to further explore the role of OMT on asthma in a pediatric population.
