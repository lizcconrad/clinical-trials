  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children are distressed at anesthesia induction and this distress can result in maladaptive
      recovery outcomes. Having parents be present at anesthesia induction (PPIA) has been
      suggested as a potential intervention to decrease children's distress, and this intervention
      is widely favored by parents. However, to date, PPIA has not been found to be effective in
      reducing children's anxiety. The lack of efficacy may be attributable to the fact that
      parents have generally not been prepared for PPIA. The one study that prepared parents (as
      part of a larger preoperative preparation program) found that PPIA with preparation was
      superior to PPIA as previously studied (without preparation). Unfortunately, this program is
      resource intensive and therefore is not clinically feasible. This study will compare PPIA
      with a clinically feasible preparation program to PPIA with standard care (minimal
      preparation). Should our intervention show evidence of efficacy, the investigators will have
      designed a program that is easily translatable to everyday clinical practice. This will, in
      turn, reduce children's anxiety, improve postoperative outcomes and increase parental
      satisfaction.

    <time_frame>post-treatment (following intervention); average=15 minutes after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS; Kain et al., 1997). This researcher completed measure is made up of 5 categories (e.g., activity, vocalizations) each rated on ordinal behaviorally anchored scales. Total scores on the measure range from 23 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher child anxiety at induction. The tool has shown good convergent validity with another measure of child anxiety (r = 0.79), and excellent inter-rater reliability (kappa range 0.63-0.90). A cutoff score of 30 has been shown to have the best balance of sensitivity (0.85) and specificity (0.92).
NOTE: Most of the measure is administered post-treatment, but part of it begins pre-treatment at baseline.</description>

    <description>The parental presence decision tool will be delivered as an App shown to families using an iPAD and a set of headphones. This App will include information on what to expect in the operating room as well as the role of the parents. The App incorporates the basic principles of other effective perioperative preparation interventions (e.g., providing both sensory and procedural information) and is tailored to the local context. In addition to preparatory information, the App will also inform parents of the role of parent anxiety on children's outcomes in the operating room.</description>

    <description>In standard preparation condition, treating nurses and anesthesiologists will provide information to parents as they standardly do when parents are present at induction; this includes information on logistical issues and safety in the operating room (e.g., where to stand, how to put on gown) and risks of anesthesia induction. Additionally, parents in the standard preparation condition will view a summary of this standard information as text on an iPAD.</description>
