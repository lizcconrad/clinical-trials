    <textblock>
      Kennedy et al, in a study of pediatric Emergency Department (ED) use by newborns less than 14
      days of age, revealed that half of all visits in this population were non-acute problems.
      Other pediatric ED utilization studies have shown similar findings in that 32% to 72% of all
      visits were for non-urgent problems.

      Many studies have found that primiparity and young maternal age are associated with non-acute
      ED presentations. A recent factor that has been investigated is the effect of early neonatal
      discharge. Some other factors are nonwhite mothers and mothers on Medicaid. Zandieh et al,
      found additional predisposing determinants for non-urgent ED visits, such as single
      parenthood, Hispanic ethnicity, and having perceptions that their child's overall physical
      health was poor.

      Paradis et al found that parents receiving a video intervention rated higher confidence with
      specific infant care skills and reported feeling better prepared to care for their baby,
      compared to parents receiving only handouts. However, there isn't any reported study that
      evaluates the benefits of receiving both, a video intervention along with handouts.

      Aim: to demonstrate whether conducting anticipatory guidance related to non-urgent problems
      will reduce non-urgent ED visits, compared to care as usual (CAU) anticipatory guidance
      (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Shaken Baby Syndrome videos; and unstructured talk about
      jaundice, vaccinations, appointments, care of umbilical stump, normal urination and bowel
      movement, fever).

      Inclusion Criteria: Mother of a newborn in the Well Baby Nursery (WBN) of Bronx-Lebanon
      Hospital Center during the 4-month recruitment period of the study.

      Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Mothers selected for video-based anticipatory guidance that have a hearing/vision
           impairment.

        2. Mothers selected for handout-based anticipatory guidance who speak a language other than
           Spanish or English.

      Primary outcome measure: reduction in non-urgent ED visits in mothers who received the
      intervention (video-based and handout-based anticipatory guidance regarding non-urgent
      problems), compared to the control group (received CAU anticipatory guidance)

      Secondary outcome measure: improvement in parental knowledge, attitude and behaviors related
      to non-urgent problems as a result of receiving anticipatory guidance (video and handouts)
      regarding non-urgent problems;
