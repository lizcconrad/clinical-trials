    <description>The primary objective of this study is to investigate efficacy (clinical proof of concept) of AbGn-168H in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis following intravenous administration of multiple doses compared to placebo. In this trial, the high dose and low dose of AbGn-168 and placebo is administered weekly.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 to 75 (inclusive), males or females

          2. Body weight &lt; 140 kg

          3. Patients with stable moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis, no significant changes
             within the past 6 months, involving ≥ 10% body surface area, with disease severity
             PASI ≥ 10 at screening visit and visit 2, with at least 1 lesion for target lesion
             assessment.

          4. Psoriasis disease duration of at least 6 months prior to screening

          5. Patients must be candidates for systemic psoriasis treatment or phototherapy

          6. Patient must give informed consent and sign an approved consent form prior to any
             study procedures

          7. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to
             enrollment and agree to use a highly effective method of birth control during the
             study. A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a
             low failure rate (less than 1% per year).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with primary guttatae, erythrodermic, or pustular psoriasis and patients with
             drug-induced psoriasis

          2. Evidence of current or previous clinically significant disease, medical condition
             other than psoriasis, or finding of the medical examination (including vital signs and
             ECG), that in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the
             patient or the quality of the data. This criterion provides an opportunity for the
             investigator to exclude patients based on clinical judgment, even if other eligibility
             criteria are satisfied. (Psoriatic arthritis is not considered an exclusion)

          3. HIV infection or a known HIV-related Malignancy.

          4. Chronic or acute hepatitis B and C, or carrier status. Patient with anti-HBc Ab and
             undetectable anti-HBs Ab should also be excluded.

          5. Tuberculosis, or a positive Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) for tuberculosis. Subjects
             previously received BCG vaccination can participate in the study after showing
             negative responses in Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA).

          6. History of malignancy in the past 5 years or suspicion of active malignant disease
             except treated cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma and carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix uteri.

          7. History of allergy/hypersensitivity to a systemically administered biologic agent or
             its excipients

          8. Use of biologic agents or investigational drug within 12 weeks prior to treatment,
             systemic anti-psoriatic medications or phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to treatment,
             or topical anti-psoriasis medications (except emollients) within 2 weeks prior to
             treatment

          9. Intake of restricted medications (c.f. Section 4.2.2) or other drugs considered likely
             to interfere with the safe conduct of the study

         10. History of alcohol abuse

         11. History of drug abuse or positive drug screen at screening visit. Subjects with
             legitimate medically supervised uses of the drugs which are not excluded for other
             reasons (section 4.2.2 of the protocol) can be enrolled.

         12. Any blood donation or significant blood loss within 4 weeks prior to Visit 2

         13. Excessive (e.g. competitive) physical activities (within 1 week prior to
             administration or during the trial)

         14. Patients with any of the following laboratory values at screening and are considered
             clinically significant by the investigators:

               -  Haemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, absolute lymphocyte or
                  neutrophil count, or platelet count &lt; LLN (below the lower limit of the reference
                  normal range)

               -  ALT, AST and/or total bilirubin &gt; 2.5xULN

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5x ULN
