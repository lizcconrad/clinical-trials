  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that the adverse effects of second-generation
      antipsychotics exposure and the beneficial effects of long-chain omega-3 (LCn-3) fatty acids
      are mediated by opposing effects on the enzyme implicated in the metabolic syndrome and
      obesity.

      This will be a two-phase study design:

      Phase I: to prospectively investigate the relationship between baseline LCn-3 fatty acid
      status and treatment-emergent adverse cardiometabolic events and weight gain in response to
      acute (6-week) open-label quetiapine in first-episode adolescent manic patients (ages 12-17
      years). SGA-na√Øve acutely manic patients will be treated with open-label quetiapine for
      6-weeks. Patients will be started on 100 mg BID of quetiapine, and the dose adjusted based on
      tolerability and response. The quetiapine target dose is 400-600 mg, with subjects in the
      range of 200-500 mg.

      Phase II: Patients from Phase I will be randomized to double-blind adjunctive treatment with
      LCn-3 fatty acids or placebo for an additional 24 weeks to investigate protective effects on
      the progression and resolution of adverse cardiometabolic events and weight gain during
      quetiapine maintenance therapy. They will have 6 visits over a 24-week period.

          -  Not requiring concomitant use of antidepressant or mood-stabilizer medications (see
             Section C.4.c. Concomitant Medications).

             effects). Similarly, concomitant use of medications with anticoagulant effects (e.g.
             aspirin) will be prohibited
