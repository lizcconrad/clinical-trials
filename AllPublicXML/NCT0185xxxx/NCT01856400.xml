  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a certain gene called sarcoplasmic reticulum gene (SERCA2a), which is found in heart
      muscle. This gene is also found in blood vessels and skin tissue. When active this gene
      builds a crucial protein inside the heart muscle called SERCA2a protein. This is responsible
      for regulating calcium levels inside your heart muscle. When this gene is not activated,
      studies have shown that it can lead to abnormal electrical currents in the heart that can
      lead to death. The investigators are conducting this study to prove that SERCA2a gene is
      inactive in patients with kidney disease. Scientists found that patient at risk for abnormal
      electrical currents in the heart can be tested by what they called &quot;microvolt Twave
      alternans.&quot; This is a very delicate machine much more sensitive than a regular
      electrocardiogram that you do at the cardiology office.

      This study will test the hypothesis that patients with uremic cardiomyopathy have reduced
      levels of SERCA2a protein compared to those with normal kidney function. We propose that such
      a correlation will provide convincing evidence that these patients,have a defective
      redistribution in intracellular calcium handling as an explanation for their increase risk in
      sudden cardiac death an fatal arrhythmias. To achieve our specific aims: 1) we will screen
      patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) going for certain vascular procedures. 2) obtain
      an echocardiogram on these patients including only those with isolated diastolic dysfunction
      or LVH. 3) Patients who has diastolic dysfunction or LVH will be assessed for underlying
      microvolt (TWA) 4) vessel and skin tissue on these patients will be collected for SERCA2a
      quantification.
