  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is being conducted to assess the safety and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of PDA-002 [human placenta-derived cells] administered into the lower
      leg muscles of subjects with peripheral arterial disease and diabetic foot ulcers. It will
      look to see if PDA-002 helps reduce some of the symptoms of PAD and/or improves ulcer
      healing. This study will also help to find the best dose of PDA-002 to use in future studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine a safe dose of PDA-002 [human placenta-derived cells]
      for further study. This is a dose-escalation study where each of four dose levels will enroll
      three to six subjects. Doses will be range from 3 million up to 100 million cells. If one
      dose is considered safe after all treated subjects have been evaluated and reviewed, then the
      next group of subjects will be enrolled to receive the next higher dose. This will continue
      until either the highest dose is reached, until at least 2 subjects at a dose level have ≥
      Grade 2 allergic reaction that is suspected to be related to PDA-002 or 2 or more subjects at
      a dose level experience an unexpected, treatment-related serious adverse event or dose
      limiting toxicity within 14 days following the initial dose of PDA-002. This is an open-label
      study where all subjects will be taking the study drug and all study personnel will know the
      dose each subject receives.
