  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of neurofeedback
      training (NFB) on objective measurements of attention in young adults with ADHD. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate neurofeedback effects on self-report measures of
      attention, ADHD symptoms, and to identify electroencephalogram (EEG) markers of ADHD and
      neurofeedback efficacy. The study is a double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to
      test the efficacy and safety of EEG neurofeedback in individuals 18-40 years of age with
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Attention will be evaluated at baseline,
      after 12 and 24 training sessions (an average of 4 and 8 weeks, respectively), and 4 weeks
      after the last neurofeedback session. The primary outcome will be change from baseline on the
      Attention Performance Index (API) variable of the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) a
      standardized, well-normed, computerized test of attention, after 12 neurofeedback or sham
      training sessions (and average of 4 weeks). Secondary outcomes will be change from baseline
      on other TOVA variables after 12 and 24 sessions (an average of 4 and 8 weeks, respectively),
      at 4 weeks post-training follow-up, and changes from baseline at each time point on the Adult
      Self Report Scale (ASRS) and Mindful Awareness and Attention Scale (MAAS). EEG data collected
      during TOVA attention testing at baseline will be used to model EEG differences between ADHD
      and non-ADHD participants. Additional EEG data collected during the TOVA at midpoint (average
      of 4 weeks), after 24 NFB sessions (average of 8 weeks), and 4 weeks post-NFB will be used to
      develop statistical models to use as indicators of neurofeedback efficacy
