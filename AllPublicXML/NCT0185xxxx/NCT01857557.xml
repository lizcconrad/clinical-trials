  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial assesses the impact of a supervised aerobic exercise program by a kinesiologist in
      patients with migraine. Patients can be assigned to one of two groups 1)The exercise group or
      2)non-exercise group. This is a important area to study because there is currently limited
      information regarding exercise and its impact on migraine frequency and severity. In many
      cases, migraine patients are disabled by their headaches and sometimes will not have a
      significant response to medications. As a result, it is important to study other
      non-pharmacological interventions. In this study, the investigators hope to show the benefits
      of exercise by a reduction in number of headache days per month as well as by improvement in
      quality of life, disability,depression,anxiety,and aerobic fitness.This study will not
      interfere with the usual treatment patients receive at our headache clinic and patients can
      remain on medications deemed necessary.
