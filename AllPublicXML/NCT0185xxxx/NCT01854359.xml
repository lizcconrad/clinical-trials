      Background:

      - The Idebenone in Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS) trial tested
      a new drug for multiple sclerosis. In the IPPoMS trial, participants took either idebenone or
      placebo. Researchers want to give idebenone to all participants for 1 year. It is still not
      certain whether idebenone can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, but this study may
      help answer that question.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide idebenone to all participants on the IPPoMS trial.

        -  To collect data on the safety and effectiveness of idebenone for primary progressive
           multiple sclerosis.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have completed 3 years in the IPPoMS trial.

      Design:

        -  The first study visit for this trial will happen on the same day as the last visit for
           the IPPoMS trial.

        -  Participants will provide a blood samples and will have a lumbar puncture. They will
           also receive a new supply of idebenone to take three times a day with food. They will
           keep a diary to report on any side effects.

        -  After this first treatment visit, participants will have two follow-up visits to the NIH
           6 months apart. These visits may be scheduled over multiple days. Participants will
           provide blood and urine samples. They will also have imaging studies of the brain and
           spine.

        -  Participants will have phone calls with the study researchers to provide updates on
           their condition and any side effects.

      OBJECTIVE:

      A Phase I/II clinical trial is being conducted to investigate the safety, therapeutic
      efficacy and mechanism of action of idebenone in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis
      (PP-MS) patients (IPPoMS (Protocol Number 09-N-0197). Patients who have completed the 2-year
      treatment period of IPPoMS, may enter into this open-label extension study (IPPoMS-E) if they
      are found to be eligible by the Investigator and desire treatment with idebenone despite
      remaining blinded as to their allocation to active treatment versus placebo during the IPPoMS
      trial. The aim of this open-label extension study is gather additional data on safety,
      efficacy and effects of idebenone on CSF biomarkers in these patients over a period of 1
      year. This study will provide open-label idebenone for patients with PP-MS, previously
      randomized to idebenone or to placebo in the blinded phase of IPPoMS.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Patients who were previously enrolled in the IPPoMS (Protocol Number 09-N-0197) will be
      invited to participate in the trial. The same idebenone dose used in the randomized clinical
      trial (2250 mg/day) will be used in this study.

      DESIGN:

      This is a single group, open-label safety and efficacy extension trial with a one year
      treatment period. Patient-specific biomarkers of disease progression, CSF biomarkers of
      oxidative stress, longitudinal neuroimaging including quantitative measures of CNS tissue
      destruction and clinical data will be collected as in the randomized study.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The measurement and collection of data will be performed as in the randomized trial.
      Quantitative neuroimaging measures of central nervous system (CNS: i.e. brain and spinal
      cord) tissue destruction and clinical and functional measures of neurological disability will
      be collected every 6-12 months. Additionally, biomarkers focusing on analysis of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress will be collected every 12 months. The primary
      outcome measure defined in the IPPoMS trial will be also utilized in IPPoMS-E. For patients
      originally randomized to placebo, patient-specific slopes of disease progression during 2
      years of placebo therapy (as measured by primary and secondary outcomes) will be compared to
      patient-specific slopes of disease progression during 1 year of open label idebenone therapy.
      Combination of IPPoMS and IPPoMS-E trials will significantly expand paired no therapy vs.
      idebenone therapy CSF samples for biomarker studies. It will also provide (for the subgroup
      of subjects who were originally randomized to idebenone) longitudinal CSF samples on
      idebenone therapy (collected 2 years apart). This will allow calculations of intra-individual
      changes in CSF biomarkers on and off idebenone therapy, which may provide important insight
      into the mechanism of action of idebenone in PP-MS.
