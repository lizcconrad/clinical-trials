      Obesity is an insulin resistance-associated metabolic disorder which is a hallmark of and
      risk factor for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, often linked to cardiovascular
      disease, certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.The phenotyping of subcutaneous adipose
      tissue (SAT) hematopoetic cells from obese subjects by flow cytometry, microscopy and gene
      expression will enable us to identify inflammation in this tissue and may help us to
      understand the causes and consequences of obesity in order to determine how these cells might
      be implicated in the initiation and/or progression of the aforementioned diseases.

      Obesity is an insulin resistance-associated metabolic disorder which is a hallmark of and
      risk factor for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. It is also often linked to
      cardiovascular disease, certain cancers (e.g., colorectal, esophageal, endometrial, and
      ovarian), and inflammatory diseases (e.g., psoriasis, osteoarthritis,inflammatory bowel
      disease).The phenotyping of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) hematopoetic cells from obese
      subjects by flow cytometry, microscopy and gene expression will enable us to identify
      inflammation in this tissue and may help us to understand the causes and consequences of
      obesity in order to determine how these cells might be implicated in the initiation and/or
      progression of the aforementioned diseases.

        Obesity and psoriasis are characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells (leukocytes)
        in SAT and skin, respectively. We expect that SAT in obese psoriasis subjects will have
        infiltrating inflammatory leukocytes because of obesity, and that these infiltrating
        leukocytes might be different and/or increased in numbers by the pathology of psoriasis
