      Community Health Workers working within primary health care in Brazil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an intervention study conducted with 176 people attended by two Primary Health Units
      in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The intervention group received home visits of Community
      Health Workers trained on counseling on physical activity promotion. These workers received a
      course of 12 hours aimed to improve their knowledge and attitude about physical activity
      promotion. Evaluations will be done at the study baseline and 6 months after the beginning.
      The primary outcome is the population leisure-time and transport-related physical activity
      level.
