    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter feasibility study. Up to 85 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The
      goal of the study is to demonstrate that the Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) System is safe to be
      used in an even larger study outside of hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that have met eligibility criteria will undergo treatment with the hybrid closed
      loop system under various experimental conditions.There is no statistically powered study
      hypothesis testing.

      The investigational centers will be encouraged to include subjects of different ethnicities
      including Hispanic, Native American, and African-American.

      The study is anticipated to last no more than 12 months from investigational center
      initiation to finalization of all data entry and monitoring procedures. Subjects are expected
      to participate for approximately 1- 2 months.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 2-75 years of age at time of screening

          2. A clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes as determined by either medical record or
             source documentation from qualified individual to make medical diagnosis

             Exclusion Criteria that are Based on Demands of In-Clinic Study Procedures :

          3. Pump therapy for greater than 6 months with use of real time CGM for any period of
             time (ie. one day) 3 months prior to screening

          4. Adequate venous access as assessed by investigator or appropriate staff

          5. Subject should have an established insulin carbohydrate and insulin sensitivity ratio.

          6. Subject reports at the time of screening that their average fasting glucose is 60
             mg/dL - 200 mg/dL

          7. Subject reports at the time of screening that their average total daily insulin dose
             is 15 units - 110 units. (Insulin pump memory for this information may be used)
