  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exercise time is an important factor among the medical guides for weight loss; however,
      there is still little knowledge about exercise duration paths in middle-aged and older women.
      The present study aimed to determine the effects of the interval training on weight loss and
      lipid profile, and to compare its efficiency with the continuous training.

      Participants included sedentary women (age 45-75 years) with overweight or obesity (n= 115).
      They were randomly divided into two groups including continuous exercise, and interval
      exercise. The weight assessment parameters including change in weight and body composition,
      blood sample tests were performed pre- and three month post-intervention.
