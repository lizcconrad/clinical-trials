    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe, South America, and the United States of America
      (USA).

      The aim of the trial is to investigate efficacy and safety of FIAsp in a basal-bolus regimen
      versus basal insulin therapy, both in combination with metformin in adult subjects with type
      2 diabetes.

    <time_frame>After 18 weeks of randomised treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For this endpoint the &quot;end of trial&quot; data containing last available measurements are presented. PPG measurements were recorded by the subjects at 2 hours after each meal (breakfast, lunch and main evening meal) as part of three 7-point profiles (SMPG) prior to the visits. Individual mean meal PPG (post-breakfast, post-lunch, post-main evening meal) was derived from the three measurements.</description>

    <time_frame>After 18 weeks of randomised treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For this endpoint the &quot;end of trial&quot; data containing last available measurements are presented. Prandial PG increment for each meal (breakfast, lunch, main evening meal) was derived from the 7-point profiles (SMPG) as the difference between the PPG value 2 hours after each meal and the PG value before each meal. Individual mean meal PPG (post-breakfast, post-lunch, post-main evening meal) was derived from the three measurements.</description>

    <measure>Number of Treatment Emergent Hypoglycaemic Episodes</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-18</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma glucose (PG) was measured and recorded when a hypoglycaemic episode was suspected. All PG values ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or &gt;3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) when they occurred in conjunction with hypoglycaemic symptoms were recorded by the subject. Numbers of treatment emergent hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded during 18 weeks of treatment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0-18</time_frame>
    <description>All adverse events (AEs) described here refer to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE). A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment, week 18.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted at 51 sites in 6 countries as follows: Argentina: 4 sites; India: 8 sites; Mexico: 3 sites; Romania: 5 sites; Slovenia: 4 sites; United States: 27 sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 555 subjects were screened, of which 232 subjects were screening failures and 323 subjects were enrolled and entered the run-in (pre-assignment) period. Of those, 87 subjects were run-in failures. Hence, 236 subjects were randomized to the 18 weeks of treatment period.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Faster Aspart + Basal</title>
          <description>During the 18-week treatment period, subjects received subcutaneous (s.c., under the skin) injection of faster aspart (bolus insulin) along with s.c. basal insulin (insulin detemir or insulin glargine or NPH insulin) and metformin. Treatment recommendations were developed for the different trial products specifying the recommended dose adjustments at different plasma glucose (PG) levels. Trial products were titrated according to the insulin dosing recommendations provided during the study. No maximum dose of insulin was specified as doses were titrated individually. Faster aspart was administered 0-2 minutes before each main meal (i.e., breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The basal insulin injection was to be given once daily (OD), in the evening, at approximately the same time each day.</description>

            <description>During the 18-week treatment period, subjects received subcutaneous (s.c., under the skin) injection of faster aspart (bolus insulin) along with s.c. basal insulin (insulin detemir or insulin glargine or NPH insulin) and metformin. Treatment recommendations were developed for the different trial products specifying the recommended dose adjustments at different PG levels. Trial products were titrated according to the insulin dosing recommendations provided during the study. No maximum dose of insulin was specified as doses were titrated individually. Faster aspart was administered 0-2 minutes before each main meal (i.e., breakfast, lunch and main evening meal). The basal insulin injection was to be given OD, in the evening, at approximately the same time each day.</description>

Treatment recommendations were developed for the different trial products specifying the recommended dose adjustments at different PG levels. Trial products were titrated according to the insulin dosing recommendations provided during the study. No maximum dose of insulin was specified as doses were titrated individually. Faster aspart was administered 0-2 minutes before each main meal (i.e., breakfast, lunch and main evening meal).
