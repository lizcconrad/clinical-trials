  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness
      and the cost effectiveness of an on-line eLearning program (entitled Employment and
      Arthritis: Making it Work) designed to help people with inflammatory arthritis stay employed.
      The program also includes assessments with 1) an occupational therapist, and 2) a vocational
      rehabilitation counsellor at the end of the program to help participants identify and obtain
      necessary changes at work. People from three provinces will be recruited from collaborators'
      patient and program recipient lists. The study group will receive the program intervention
      and the control group will receive &quot;usual care&quot; and printed educational material. All
      participants will be followed for five years. The effectiveness of the program at improving
      at work productivity and reducing work cessation will be evaluated compared to a control
      group receiving printed material on employment and arthritis.

    <description>A ten week on-line eLearning program designed to help people with inflammatory arthritis stay employed. The program consists of 1) 5 interactive web-based eLearning modules that participants will complete individually in between the weekly group sessions, 2) 5 weekly group sessions conducted as virtual real-time web-based group meetings led by a trained facilitator, 3) asynchronous communications such as a message board to facilitate additional interactions among participants, 4) consultations with an occupational therapist (in-person)for an ergonomic assessment, and a vocational rehabilitation counsellor (on-line consultation using web technology) for job retention vocational counselling.</description>
