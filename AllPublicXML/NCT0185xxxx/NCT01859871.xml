  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase understanding about living kidney donation (LKD)
      among Hispanic/Latino patients and public by increasing knowledge and positive attitudes
      about LKD. Improving Hispanics' understanding about LKD will ensure that Hispanic patients
      and public are fully informed of the treatment options for End Stage Kidney Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shortage of kidneys for transplantation, and ethnic disparities in living kidney donation
      rates are major public health problems. Hispanics need more kidney transplants, yet receive
      fewer living donor kidney transplants than they need. Factors known to contribute to
      Hispanics' low rates of living donation kidney transplantation include cultural beliefs, lack
      of knowledge, and negative attitudes about living kidney donation. Web-based interventions
      are promising as Hispanics are using the Internet at increasingly greater rates. However, few
      websites about transplantation are tailored to potential Hispanic kidney transplant
      candidates or the Hispanic community. This study aims to develop, test, and evaluate the
      effectiveness of a bilingual web-based educational resource targeted to Hispanic patients and
      the public, which can serve as a low-cost, convenient, and culturally competent tool to
      enhance knowledge about living kidney donation. Improving Hispanics' understanding about
      living kidney donation will promote their autonomy and self-determination by helping to
      ensure that Hispanic patients and public are fully informed of the treatment options for
      end-stage kidney disease.

    <description>Study participants will take the self-administered pre-test and receive the standard of care. After taking the pre-test, control arm participants will be done with study participation for that day and will attend the transplant center's education sessions. All participants will receive a letter and follow-up call at about two weeks later to schedule the final survey. They will take a final survey via telephone about 3 weeks later. The final survey includes the same topics as the pre-test. They will receive a thank you letter and gift card by mail after completing the final survey.</description>

    <description>Study participants will take the self-administered pre-test in the intervention arm and will be introduced to the website to inform the public of various topics concerning end-stage kidney disease and kidney transplantation. Few websites about transplantation are tailored to potential Hispanic kidney transplant candidates or the Hispanic community. This website is designed to fill the void and be an effective bilingual web-based educational resource targeted to Hispanic patients and public which can serve as a culturally competent tool to enhance knowledge and attitudes about living kidney donation.</description>
