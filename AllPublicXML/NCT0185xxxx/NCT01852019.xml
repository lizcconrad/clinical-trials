  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that patients treated with cangrelor can be directly switched to oral
      prasugrel and that patients treated with prasugrel can be switched to cangrelor without a
      significant decrease in the extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation.

    <measure>Extent of Preservation of Inhibitory Effect After Transition From Cangrelor to Prasugrel Compared With Effect Observed With Prasugrel Alone (Reference Timepoint)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 measures taken at timepoints after cangrelor infusion end to end of Day 1 measures.</time_frame>
    <description>A reference point for the effect of prasugrel alone was chosen for comparison and designated the final draw on study Day 1 (3.5 or 4.0 hours after cangrelor had been discontinued) as the reference for the effect of prasugrel. The extent of aggregation in the presence or absence of the study drugs was examined for each of the endpoints using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and expressed as % aggregation in response to 20 micromolar (μM) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 300 seconds (final/terminal aggregation response).</description>

    <time_frame>Day 8 - at 1.0 and 2.0 hours after initiation of cangrelor infusion</time_frame>
    <description>A reference point for the inhibitory effect of cangrelor alone was chosen for comparison and designated the first draw during the cangrelor infusion (1.0 or 1.5 hours) or within 5 minutes post cangrelor infusion on Day 1. The extent of aggregation was observed during the cangrelor infusion on Day 8, either 24 or 48 hours after discontinuation of prasugrel using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and expressed as % aggregation in response to 20 μM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 300 seconds (final/terminal aggregation response).</description>

    <description>Bleeding was assessed by history, physical exam, and complete blood count (CBC) that was performed on study Days 1 and 8. Reports of bleeding were to be evaluated by performance of a CBC. Bleeding was to be reported as recommended and quantified in accordance with the GUSTO criteria [The GUSTO Investigators, 1993].</description>

        <description>A reference point for the effect of prasugrel alone was chosen for comparison and designated the final draw on study Day 1 (3.5 or 4.0 hours after cangrelor had been discontinued) as the reference for the effect of prasugrel. The extent of aggregation in the presence or absence of the study drugs was examined for each of the endpoints using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) and expressed as % aggregation in response to 20 micromolar (μM) adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 300 seconds (final/terminal aggregation response).</description>
