    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to investigate the feasibility of administering exenatide by
      continuous subcutaneous infusion to healthy subjects. Study will consist of two parts i.e.
      Part A and B. In Part A 2 healthy subjects will receive exenatide infusion over 24 hours
      followed by a follow-up visit 10 to 14 days after discharge from clinic. In Part B
      approximately 6 healthy subjects will receive subcutaneous infusions of exenatide for maximum
      of 7 days followed by a follow-up visit 10 to 14 days after discharge from clinic.

          -  Male/females aged between 18 and 60 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             12-lead ECG. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s) which
             is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside the
             reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator agrees and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures and objectives.

          -  Body Mass Index within the range 18 to 35 kilograms/meter squared (kg/m^2) inclusive.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or

             is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to
             continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow
             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.

          -  Child-bearing potential females must agree to use one of the contraception methods.
             This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study medication
             until follow up visit.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Based on QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) of single electrocardiogram (ECG):

          -  Subjects with a personal or family history of thyroid carcinoma or Type 2 Familial
             Endocrine Neoplasia.

          -  History of uncorrected thyroid dysfunction or an abnormal thyroid functions as
             assessed by thyroid stimulating hormones.

          -  Subjects with a history of severe gastrointestinal disease, or abnormal renal
             function.

          -  Subjects with previous exposure to a Glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetic.

          -  History of chronic or acute pancreatitis. Note: Subjects with a lipase value above
             1.5X ULN at screening are excluded.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy.

        Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessments

          -  A positive test for human immuno virus antibody.

        Other Criteria

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.
