    <textblock>
      The role of perioperative chemotherapy in potentially operable advanced gastric cancer (AGC)
      with regional lymph node metastasis is still in the area of controversy. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of folinic acid (FA), infusional
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX6) in potentially resectable AGC with
      regional lymph node (LN) metastasis.
