      This study will investigate how soon a patient's typing proficiency returns to their
      pre-operative levels following carpal tunnel release surgery. In order to determine this,
      patients will undergo typing tests at different time points that will record their typing
      accuracy and speed. The results will then be compared to determine on average how soon a
      person returns to their pre-operative baseline results.

    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist.
      It causes such symptoms as numbness, tingling, weakness, muscle damage, and pain. If
      non-operative treatments do not work generally patients go on to carpal tunnel release
      surgery in which the transverse carpal ligament is released. After surgery patients usually
      return to work with no restrictions within six weeks. Patients often ask how soon they are
      able to return to typing after surgery, and what their typing ability will be like after
      surgery. Currently there are no studies that evaluate how long it takes for patient's typing
      skills to return to that of the pre-operative skill level. We would like to answer that
      question by comparing typing results from different time points including a baseline prior to
      surgery. We additionally seek to identify which patient characteristics are predictive of a
      faster return of typing proficiency.

      An additional innovative aspect of this project is the use of a web-based typing test that
      will be used in the assessment of patient typing proficiency. We will additionally use a
      web-based model for the collection of our survey data.

    <description>Each patient will complete a preoperative typing test (at their home) prior to undergoing carpal tunnel release surgery. The patient will then take the same typing test at the following time points postoperatively: 8-10days, 2wks, 3wks, 4wks, 5wks, 6wks, 8wks, 12wks. The change in speed and accuracy will be assessed by comparing the preoperative (baseline) typing test results to the postoperative typing test results.</description>
