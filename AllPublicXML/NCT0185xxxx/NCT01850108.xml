  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (alloBMT) is a curative therapy for a variety of
      hematologic disorders, including sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Even when it is clear
      that alloBMT can give to these patients an improvement in their disease, myeloablative
      transplants have important toxicities and mortalities associated. The lack of suitable donors
      continues to be a limit to access to transplantation. Substantial progress has been made
      recently in the development of pre-treatment regimens that facilitate the sustained
      engraftment of donor marrow with reduced toxicity. Most of these regimens incorporate highly
      immunosuppressive drugs, which allow the reduction or elimination of myeloablative agents or
      total body irradiation without endangering the sustained engraftment of HLA-identical
      allogeneic stem cells. Preliminary results of non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation suggest that the procedure can be performed in patients who are ineligible
      for myeloablative alloBMT, and that sustained remissions of several hematologic malignancies
      can be obtained.

        CRITERIA FOR DONOR ELIGIBILITY:

          -  Weight ≥ 20kg and age ≥ 18 years or per institutional guidelines

          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FAHCT) and will be screened per the
             American Association of Blood Banks (AABB). (AABB guidelines and the recipients will
             be informed of any deviations.)

          -  HLA-haploidentical first-degree relatives of the patient. Participants must be HLA
             typed at high resolution using DNA based typing at HLA-A, -B, -C and DRB1 and have
             available: An HLA haploidentical first degree relative donor (parents, siblings or
             half siblings, or children) with 2, 3, or 4 (out of 8) HLA-mismatches who is willing
             and able to donate bone marrow. A unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus
             host or host versus graft direction is considered a mismatch. The donor and recipient
             must be HLA identical for at least one antigen (using high resolution DNA based
             typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment
             of this criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient
             share one HLA haplotype, and typing of additional family members is not required.

        When more than one donor is available, the donor with the lowest number of HLA allele
        mismatches will be chosen, unless there is HLA cross-match incompatibility or a medical
        reason to select otherwise, in which case donor selection is the responsibility of the PI,
        in consultation with the immunogenetics laboratory. In cases where there is more than one
        donor with the least degree of mismatch, donors will be selected based on the most
        favorable combination of:

          -  HLA compatibility in cross-match testing and

          -  ABO compatibility

          -  Donor age &lt;40 years

          -  Avoid female donors for male recipients and

          -  Avoid CMV mismatched donor-recipient transplants:

        HLA cross-matching (in order of priority):

          -  Mutually compatible (no cross-matching antibodies)

          -  Recipient non-cross-reactive with donor, donor cross-reactive with recipient

          -  Mutually cross-reactive

        ABO compatibility (in order of priority):

          -  Compatible

          -  Major incompatibility

          -  Minor incompatibility

          -  Major and minor incompatibility

          -  Donors will be selected to minimize HLA mismatch in the Host-versus-graft direction.

          -  Donors fulfilling the following criteria are ineligible for registration onto this
             study:

          -  All donors will be screened by hemoglobin electrophoresis; donors with a clinically
             significant hemoglobinopathy are ineligible. Sickle trait is acceptable.
