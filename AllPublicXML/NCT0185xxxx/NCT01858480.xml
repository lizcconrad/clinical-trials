      To evaluate the safety and to determine the efficacy of D-ribose for the treatment of
      congestive heart failure (CHF) in subjects who have been stabilized following hospitalization
      with acute decompensation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study of
      D-ribose administered via peripheral intravenous line for 24 hours to stabilized hospitalized
      patients following standard of care treatment for acute decompensation of CHF, followed by
      oral dosing of D-ribose three times a daily through the remainder of the inpatient hospital
      stay and outpatient period of 3 months. Subjects will complete Pretreatment Screening
      procedures only after the Investigator has established that they have met the pre-specified
      criteria for stabilization of heart failure, and be randomized to treatment no more than 7
      days after admission to the hospital.
