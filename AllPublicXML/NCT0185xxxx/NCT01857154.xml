  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether consuming calcium carbonate that has been
      micronized is more effective than the traditional form of calcium carbonate in maintaining or
      increasing bone mineral density in people who are currently taking bisphosphonates or other
      bone-health medications.

      Addressing the need for a form of supplemental calcium that could facilitate increases in BMD
      without the adverse effects often reported with limestone-based forms of calcium, a patented
      technology was developed to increase calcium absorbability using both Zet Mill/Ball Mill
      bottom-up pulverizing technology and 4D top-down ebonite charging technology to create a
      novel form of calcium referred to as micronized calcium carbonate (MCC). In comparison to
      other technologies that use water and high heat, which results in a loss of core nutrients
      and decreased product efficacy, the calcium produced by this unique pulverizing technology is
      micron-sized (0.03um - 10um) and therefore believed to be more effective. While its tiny size
      was thought to increase its absorption, the belief was that the intense activation of zinc
      via the patented ebonite charging process that could maximize the bioavailability of this
      calcium.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Bone Mineral Density as a measurement by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 183 days</time_frame>
    <description>Bone density scanning, also called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or bone densitometry, is an enhanced form of x-ray technology that is used to measure bone mineral density. Imaging with x-rays involves exposing a part of the body to a small dose of ionizing radiation to produce pictures of the inside of the body.
Benefits
DXA bone densitometry is a simple, quick and noninvasive procedure.
No anesthesia is required.
The amount of radiation used is extremely smallâ€”less than one-tenth the dose of a standard chest x-ray, and less than a day's exposure to natural radiation.
DXA bone density testing is the most accurate method available for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and is also considered an accurate estimate</description>

    <measure>Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 183 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the amount of force (pressure) that blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels as it passes through them. Systolic blood pressure is a measure of blood pressure while the heart is beating. Diastolic pressure is a measure of blood pressure while the heart is relaxed, between heartbeats. Measurements will be taken after lying down for at least 5 minutes. Changes will be reported between baseline and day 183 of study.</description>
