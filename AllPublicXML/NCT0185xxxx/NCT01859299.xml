      Background:

      - Uveitis is a general term describing a group of inflammatory diseases of the eye. The
      causes of uveitis are not fully understood. Researchers want to look at bacteria in the body
      that might be related to the inflammation. They will study the natural bacteria present in
      the gut and intestines of people with and without uveitis to understand their potential role
      in these diseases.

      Objectives:

      - To study the intestinal bacteria in people with and without uveitis or ocular inflammatory
      disease.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have uveitis or ocular inflammatory disease.

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age without uveitis or ocular inflammatory disease to
           serve as healthy controls.

      Design:

        -  Participants may have more than one study visit (approximately 2-4) to assess possible
           changes in microbiome composition associated with treatment or disease activity.

        -  At each visit, participants will have a full eye examination, including vision and eye
           pressure tests. They will provide blood samples for testing. Participants will also be
           provided a stool collection kit to take home. The samples may be sent or brought back to
           the clinic.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Objective: What precipitates ocular inflammatory episodes remains unknown, but a possible
      potentiating factor is the microbiome. The microbiome has become increasingly studied with
      the advent of new techniques, but these have not been applied to uveitis. We wish to evaluate
      microbiome composition in patients with the ocular inflammatory diseases uveitis who may be
      on standard therapy or receiving orally-administered tolerizing antigen therapy.

      Study Population: A total of 200 participants may be enrolled in this study. Of those
      participants, the goal is to enroll 50 healthy controls and 150 with various types of
      uveitis.

      Design: This is an observational, prospective, single-center study. Participants will receive
      a complete ocular examination with clinical testing as determined clinically and will provide
      stool and blood samples using a standardized method. Participants may have multiple visits
      and may provide multiple samples in order to evaluate changes in microbiota composition with
      disease status or treatment.

      Outcome Measures: Alterations in bacterial diversity, microbiota composition and changes in
      relative abundance of various taxa or species will be analyzed between healthy volunteers and
      participants and between various types of uveitis. In addition, comparisons will be made
      between these findings and the immunome and metabolome.
