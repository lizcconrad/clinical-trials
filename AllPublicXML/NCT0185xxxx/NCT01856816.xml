  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine how different meal patterns influence the
      absorption of beneficial plant pigments (carotenoids) from vegetables. The hypothesis is that
      carotenoid absorption will be lower when daily vegetables are consumed in one meal compared
      two smaller meals throughout the day.
