          -  12 years of age or older

          -  Signed informed consent form, which meets all criteria of current FDA regulations. For
             patients under the age of majority in the state the study is being conducted (18 years
             in most states) the parent or legal guardian should sign the consent form and the
             child will be required to sign a patient &quot;assent&quot; form that will be written in such a
             way as to be understandable to a child.

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential, have a negative urine pregnancy test and is
             prepared to abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable method of contraception
             during the study (e.g., condom with spermicide, IUD, oral, injected, transdermal or
             implanted hormonal contraceptives). In order for hormonal birth control to be
             considered a reliable method the patient must have been on their regimen for at least
             28 days.

          -  Documented positive allergic skin test, performed within the previous 12 months, to
             one or more of the allergens in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A minimum of two consecutive years of previous history of seasonal allergic rhinitis
             to the pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A score of at least 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) and a
             minimum score of at least 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; and a minimum score of at least 2
             for one of the remaining 3 symptoms (see Appendix A) representing the 12 hours prior
             to the screening visit.

          -  An average composite score of at least 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score
             (rTNSS) and a minimum score of at least 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; and a minimum score
             of at least 2 for one of the remaining 3 symptoms (see Appendix A) representing the
             last 3 days of the 7-day placebo run-in period before the randomization visit and the
             morning of the first day of the randomization visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under 12 years of age.

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating or likely to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Negative or lack of documented skin allergen test (performed within the previous 12
             months) to at least one of the allergens in season at the time the study is being
             conducted. The results of all positive skin allergen test results should be reported.

          -  Patients who suffer from chronic signs and symptoms of Perennial Allergic Rhinitis
             (PAR) should be excluded from the study unless the Investigator assesses that the
             patient's current signs and symptoms are a clear exacerbation of Seasonal Allergic
             Rhinitis (SAR) rather than chronic PAR.

          -  Patients who suffer only from perennial allergic rhinitis or seasonal allergic
             rhinitis to a different allergen than that in season at the time the study is
             conducted.

          -  Previous history of less than 2 years of seasonal allergic rhinitis to the
             pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A total score of less than 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) or a
             score less than 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; or a score less than 2 for all 3 of the
             remaining symptoms (see Appendix A). Any patient who meets the minimum rTNSS
             requirements at the start of the placebo lead-in period but no longer meets the
             requirements prior to the randomized active treatment period of the study cannot
             continue in the active treatment period.

          -  History of asthma over the previous two years that required chronic therapy.
             Occasional acute or mild exercise induced asthma will be allowable on the condition
             that the treatment of the attacks is restricted to beta-agonists only.

          -  Patients with nasal conditions, including infectious rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa
             or atrophic rhinitis.

          -  Clinically significant nasal deformity (e.g. significantly deformed septum, nasal
             polyps or ulcers) or any recent nasal surgery or trauma that has not completely
             healed.

          -  Sinus infection within the previous 30 days or history of re-occurring sinus
             infections.

          -  Patient has started immunotherapy (including topical or desensitization therapy) or
             changed their dose of immunotherapy within 30 days of the first placebo lead-in dose
             or is likely to have to start immunotherapy, or change their current dose during the
             study.

          -  Treatment for oral Candidiasis within 30 days of starting the study or a current oral
             Candidiasis infection.

          -  Upper respiratory tract infection within the previous 30 days.

          -  Patients with a history of tuberculosis.

          -  Patients with the presence of glaucoma, cataracts, ocular herpes simplex,
             conjunctivitis or other eye infection not related to the diagnosis of SAR within 14
             days of enrollment.

          -  The patient has had recent exposure (30 days) or was at risk of being exposed to
             chicken pox or measles.

          -  Patients with any untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral infections within the
             previous 30 days.

          -  Use of any ophthalmic steroids within 14 days or nasal, inhaled or systemic steroids
             within 30 days of the study start. Super or high potency topical steroids should not
             be used during the study. The use of low potency topical corticosteroids (e.g. OTC 1%
             hydrocortisone) will be allowed. The use of hormonal contraceptives or hormone
             replacement therapy is allowed, on condition the patient has been on a stable dosing
             regimen for at least 28 days prior to the start of the study and remains on the same
             dosing regimen during the study.

          -  Use of intranasal or systemic second-generation anti-histamines (e.g. fexofenadine,
             loratadine, desloratadine, cetirizine) within 10 days of enrollment.

          -  Use of intranasal cromolyn within 14 days of enrollment.

          -  Use of intranasal or systemic first-generation anti-histamines, leukotriene receptor

          -  Significant history or current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system
             disorder, organ disorder or other medical condition that in the Investigator's opinion
             would place the study patient at undue risk by participating or could jeopardize the
             integrity of the study evaluations.

          -  Receipt of any drug as part of a research study within 30 days prior to the first
             placebo lead-in dose.
