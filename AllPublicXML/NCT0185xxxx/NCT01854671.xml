  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the difference in proportion of postpartum women
      using contraception after a Community Health Worker (CHW) family planning educational
      intervention compared to women who receive standard care in the West Bank district of
      Ramallah and Al-Bireh.

      Primary hypothesis: Postpartum contraceptive use will increase in women who receive a
      dedicated family planning counseling intervention delivered by CHWs during antenatal care
      compared to women receiving usual care.

    <description>The family planning counseling sessions led by community health workers will present advantages of birth spacing, available methods of postpartum contraception, contraindications (if any) for the method, when each method can be safely started postpartum, where each method can be obtained, and importance of 6 week postpartum clinic follow-up. There will also be a take-home contraceptive method brochure given at conclusion of information session -primarily pictorial and in Arabic, to facilitate discussion at home with husbands and family members.</description>
