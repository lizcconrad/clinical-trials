  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is appropriate clinician-patient communication that provides
      explanations of the reasons for psychoactive drug prescriptions based on the generation of FD
      symptoms and the drugs' effects might improve compliance with psychoactive agent regimens
      among FD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressive agents have been proved to be effective in the treatment of functional
      dyspepsia (FD) patients. However, one of the factors that limit therapeutic benefit is the
      poor compliance with prescribed drugs. The possible reasons for lack of compliance include
      the patient's health beliefs (e.g., that people who took such agents is possibly considered
      insane in China), lack of knowledge about antidepressants (that they are addictive or can be
      stopped on recovery), and aversion to side effects. The investigators propose to examine
      whether different clinician-patient communication methods could affect adherence to
      antidepressant drugs in functional dyspepsia patients.

    <measure>Compliance of Flupentixol-Melitracen</measure>
    <time_frame>weeks 1, 2, 4, 8</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were asked to keep a diary to record their medication intake. At each visit (weeks 1, 2, 4, 8), the patient bring back the drug bottle and the diary, then the physician recorded the number of pills remaining in the bottle. Pills remained more than 20% at any visit or seven days of consecutive abstinence were adopted as the criterion for identifying therapy noncompliance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dyspepsia Symptom Questionnaire at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of patients' dyspeptic symptoms were assessed using the Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) at week 0 and 8. The LDQ contains eight items about epigastric pain, retro-sternal pain, regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, belching, early satiety and dysphagia with six grades for each item and a sum of the eight symptom scores make the LDQ score.LDQ scores of 0 - 4 were classified as very mild dyspepsia, 4 - 8 as mild dyspepsia, 9 -15 as moderate dyspepsia, and &gt; 15 as severe or very severe dyspepsia. The change of LDQ scores was calculated by LDQ scores of 8 weeks minus baseline, with lower values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Psychiatric Symptom on Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>week 0 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>Each patient was surveyed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess the psychiatric symptom at week 0 and 8.The HADS consists of 14 items, seven of which assess anxiety, and seven assess depression. The anxiety and depression subscales were calculated independently. The patients were asked to answer each item on a four-point (0 - 3) scale. Scores of 0 to 7 on either subscale can be regarded as within the normal range, scores of 8 to 10 are suggestive of the presence of the respective state, and scores of 11 or higher indicate the probable presence of the respective mood disorder. The change of HADS scores was calculated by HADS anxiety and depression scores of 8 weeks minus baseline, with lower values indicate better outcome.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Dyspepsia Symptom Questionnaire at Week 8</title>
        <description>The severity of patients’ dyspeptic symptoms were assessed using the Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (LDQ) at week 0 and 8. The LDQ contains eight items about epigastric pain, retro-sternal pain, regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, belching, early satiety and dysphagia with six grades for each item and a sum of the eight symptom scores make the LDQ score.LDQ scores of 0 - 4 were classified as very mild dyspepsia, 4 - 8 as mild dyspepsia, 9 -15 as moderate dyspepsia, and &gt; 15 as severe or very severe dyspepsia. The change of LDQ scores was calculated by LDQ scores of 8 weeks minus baseline, with lower values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Each patient was surveyed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to assess the psychiatric symptom at week 0 and 8.The HADS consists of 14 items, seven of which assess anxiety, and seven assess depression. The anxiety and depression subscales were calculated independently. The patients were asked to answer each item on a four-point (0 - 3) scale. Scores of 0 to 7 on either subscale can be regarded as within the normal range, scores of 8 to 10 are suggestive of the presence of the respective state, and scores of 11 or higher indicate the probable presence of the respective mood disorder. The change of HADS scores was calculated by HADS anxiety and depression scores of 8 weeks minus baseline, with lower values indicate better outcome.</description>
