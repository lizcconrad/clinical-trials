  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a group of lifelong and relapsing inflammatory
      conditions that usually affect the colon and the small intestine. Between 30 to 45% of
      patients with IBD do not take their treatment as prescribed by their health care team
      (Jackson, Clatworthy et al. 2010). The Perceptions and Practicalities Approach (PAPA)
      provides a theoretical framework to develop adherence interventions that are patient-centred
      (Horne, 2001). Unintentional non-adherence occurs when the patient wants to take the
      medication but there are barriers beyond their control, such as not understanding the
      instructions (practical barriers). Intentional non-adherence is the result of the beliefs
      affecting the patient's motivation to continue with treatment (perceptual barriers).

      Aims

        1. To develop an internet-based intervention to address perceptual and practical barriers
           to adherence to medicine for IBD.

        2. To determine whether the intervention is effective based on change in both types of
           barriers.

      Plan of Investigation The inclusion criteria are: age 18 or over; diagnosis of IBD; currently
      prescribed azathioprine, mesalazine, and/or adalimumab.

      240 participants identified via Crohn's and Colitis UK and through two NHS IBD clinics will
      take part in the study. An online pilot Randomised Controlled Trial will allocate the
      participants either to a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based online intervention or
      Treatment as Usual group. On first visiting the website, participants will be screened for
      eligibility and asked for consent before answering the questionnaires. The website will
      assign intervention modules to be completed based on an individual's profile.

      Outcomes: Beliefs about Medicines scores will be measured at baseline, 1 month and 3 month
      follow-ups.

      Potential Impact A CBT based online intervention tailored to personal needs and concerns may
      benefit a large number of patients with low costs for the national healthcare services. A
      website can be accessed at a time and place convenient to the patient.

    <measure>Change in Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The BMQ (Horne and Weinman, 1999) has been validated for use with people with chronic conditions. It comprises a scale that measures beliefs about medication prescribed specifically for IBD and a general scale that evaluates beliefs that medicines are harmful, addictive, poisons.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The MARS scale (Horne and Hankins 1997) is extensively used as a measure of adherent behaviours in a variant of illness populations. The MARS attempts to diminish the social pressure on patients to under-report non-adherence by phrasing adherence questions in a non-threatening manner and assuring them that responses are anonymous and confidential.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS scale (Zigmond and Snaith 1983) is a reliable and valid instrument for detecting states of depression and anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The brief IPQ (Broadbent, Petrie et al. 2006) has demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability and validity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale (SIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SIMS scale (Horne, Hankins et al. 2001) is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing how well the needs for medicines information in patient are being covered.</description>

    <measure>Change in Marlow-Crowne Social Desirability Scale-Form C (M-C Form C) (Reynolds 1982)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Marlow-Crowne Social Desirability Scale-Form C (Reynolds 1982) is a measure of social desirability as a response tendency and it has been proved reliable and consistent (Nordholm 1974; Crino, Rubenfeld et al. 1985; Barger 2002).</description>

    <measure>Change in Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month follow-up, 3 month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The SIBDQ is a valid and reliable tool able to detect meaningful clinical changes in the health related quality of life of individuals with both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis. It measures physical, social, and emotional status (the scores go from 10 to 70, poor to good quality of life).</description>

    <description>The general approach to the intervention is the following:
Assess and profile individual perceptual and practical barriers to medication for IBD using validated questionnaires.
Give feedback to individuals on their questionnaire responses.
Provide individualised advice to address doubts, misconceptions and concerns for currently prescribed medications.
Provide advice on overcoming practical barriers.
Send motivational messages (and reminders if applicable) by email or text based on the unique profile of each participant.
Provide information about how to raise concerns with medical practitioners and how to get the most from a medical consultation.</description>
