  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the hormone, oxytocin, impacts social
      behavior in terms of cooperation with others, attention processing, and reward processing,
      among patients with social anxiety disorder. Based on available research, the investigators
      predict that in patients with social anxiety disorder, oxytocin will improve social
      cooperation during an online ball-tossing game called Cyberball, reduce attention toward
      socially threatening cues during a dot-probe task, and lead to greater willingness to work
      for monetary rewards for others rather than themselves during an effort expenditure task.

    <measure>Social Cooperation</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first day oxytocin or placebo was administered)</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure involved difference scores in the number of balls tossed to Player 1 between two conditions of the task. Across both conditions, the participant (always assigned as &quot;Player 2&quot;) played with 3 other on-line players in real time. In Condition 1, Player 1 was programmed to toss on average 70% of his balls to the participant. In Condition 2, Player 1's behavior switched such that he was programmed to toss on average only 10% of his balls to the participant. The data reported below is the number of balls tossed to Player 1 in Condition 2 minus balls tossed under Condition 1.</description>

    <measure>Disengagement From Social Threat Cues</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first day oxytocin or placebo was administered)</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure involved difference scores in response latencies on disengagement trials for disgust versus neutral cues. Difference scores were calculated as response latencies during disengagement trials for disgust cues minus response latencies during disengagement trials for neutral cues. Negative change scores represent an improvement in disengagement.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Trust Scores on a 1-7 Likert Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (first day oxytocin or placebo was administered)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their perceived level of trust (on a 1-7 Likert scale) toward Player 1 during online ball-tossing task. Higher ratings on this scale reflect greater perceived trust toward Player 1.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 (first day oxytocin or placebo was administered)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will rate their level of perceived empathy (on a 1-7 Likert scale) with Player 1 during online ball-tossing task. Higher scores on this scale reflect greater perceived empathy toward Player 1.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males &gt; 18 years of age with a primary (or co-principal) psychiatric diagnosis of
             social anxiety disorder (SAD), as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV

             patients with comorbidity will permit accrual of a more clinically relevant patient
             population;

             signing the informed consent form.

             disorder, mental disorder due to a medical condition or substance, substance abuse or
             dependence, as diagnosed by DSM-IV criteria;

          -  Concurrent use of other psychotropic medications is excluded, except for
             antidepressants that have been taken at a stable dose for at least 2 weeks;

      <pre_assignment_details>Although 60 participants were enrolled in the study, 6 participants were found to be ineligible due to meeting criteria for substance dependence (n=2), a primary diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (n=1), and not meeting criteria for social anxiety disorder (n=3). Therefore, only 54 participants were assigned to groups.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Social Cooperation</title>
        <description>The outcome measure involved difference scores in the number of balls tossed to Player 1 between two conditions of the task. Across both conditions, the participant (always assigned as &quot;Player 2&quot;) played with 3 other on-line players in real time. In Condition 1, Player 1 was programmed to toss on average 70% of his balls to the participant. In Condition 2, Player 1's behavior switched such that he was programmed to toss on average only 10% of his balls to the participant. The data reported below is the number of balls tossed to Player 1 in Condition 2 minus balls tossed under Condition 1.</description>
