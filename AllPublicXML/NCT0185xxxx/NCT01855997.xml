  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 4 study is designed for the collection of blood biomarker samples from
      participants who have completed CHB treatment with at least 24 weeks of a pegylated
      interferon alfa-2a (Peg-IFN alfa-2a) containing regimen and at least 24 weeks post-treatment
      follow-up. Participants may be enrolled from historical studies supported or sponsored by
      Roche, ongoing studies supported or sponsored by Roche, or from general medical practice. The
      follow-up of individuals who choose to participate in this study will be in accordance with
      the ongoing studies or with the general medical practice of the physician. Data from whole
      blood deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples collected in the GV28555 study or available from
      previously collected Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) samples will be used for combined
      analysis with data from other applicable studies. Procedures will include blood sample
      collection (not applicable for participants who previously have consented and donated RCR DNA
      samples) and medical record capture.

    <measure>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion or Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Positive East Asian (CN) Population: Additive Model</measure>
    <time_frame>Single blood sample ≥24 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of the antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of the antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

    <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response. Only a single SNP (rs12992677) was included in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion or Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Positive East Asian (CN) Population: Additive Model</title>
        <description>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of the antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe). HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of the antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

        <title>SNPs Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion or HBsAg Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Positive CN Population: Dominant Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

        <title>SNPs Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion Plus Undetectable HBV DNA or HBsAg Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Positive Population: Additive Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. HBeAg seroconversion and undetectable HBV DNA were a combined criterion in treatment response. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

          <title>SNPs Associated With Undetectable HBV DNA or HBsAg Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Negative Non-CN Population: Dominant Model</title>
          <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response. Only a single SNP (rs17037122) was included in the analysis.</description>

        <title>SNPs Associated With Undetectable HBV DNA or HBsAg Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in HBeAg-Negative Population: Dominant Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

        <title>SNPs Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion, HBsAg Clearance, or Undetectable HBV DNA ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in CN Population: Additive Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

        <title>SNPs Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion Plus Undetectable HBV DNA, HBsAg Clearance, or Undetectable HBV DNA ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in CN Population: Additive Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. HBeAg seroconversion and undetectable HBV DNA were a combined criterion in treatment response. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively.

        <title>SNPs Associated With HBeAg Seroconversion Plus Undetectable HBV DNA, HBsAg Clearance, or Undetectable HBV DNA ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment: Additive Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. HBeAg seroconversion and undetectable HBV DNA were a combined criterion in treatment response. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to additive models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response.</description>

        <title>SNPs Associated With HBsAg Clearance ≥24 Weeks Post-Treatment in Non-CN Population: Dominant Model</title>
        <description>GWAS approach was used to evaluate the association of SNPs with treatment response. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. Associations with treatment response were analyzed using logistic regression and adjusted for covariates. Markers were coded according to dominant models of inheritance. Markers surpassing p-value thresholds of p&lt;10^-5 and p&lt;5x10^-8 were considered suggestive and genome-wide significant, respectively. Larger beta coefficients correspond to greater likelihood of treatment response. Only a single SNP (rs12992677) was included in the analysis.</description>

          <description>Single blood samples were used to analyze HBV serology and genotype data at least 24 weeks post-treatment. HBeAg seroconversion was defined as the loss of HBeAg and detection of anti-HBe. Undetectable HBV DNA was defined as an HBV DNA level below the LLD of 2000 IU/mL. HBsAg clearance was defined as the loss of HBsAg, with or without detection of anti-HBs. HBeAg seroconversion and undetectable HBV DNA were a combined endpoint in this outcome measure.</description>
