  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study is designed to
      determine whether injection of autologous fibroblasts can increase the mobility (decrease the
      restriction) of burn scars. The study will assess the effects of azficel-T (autologous
      fibroblasts) in subjects who have a unilateral burn scar that is no deeper than the fascia
      (i.e., underlying structures including ligament, tendon, muscle, and bone must not contribute
      to the restriction) and that is either:

        1. An axillary scar causing 20-60% restriction of shoulder adduction

        2. An anterior elbow scar causing 20-60% restriction of elbow extension

        3. A dorsal or palmar lesion of a single finger causing 20-60% restriction of flexion or
           extension

      Subjects will each receive 2 injections of azficel-T or placebo administered 14 days (± 7
      days) apart (depending on cell availability) and will be followed for efficacy (including
      range of motion measurements, scar pain and ability to perform activities) to Visit 7 and for
      safety to Visit 9 at 1 year.

    <description>ROM will be measured in the affected joint using standard ROM measuring techniques. One (1) passive ROM measurement will be taken by the same person at each study visit. ROM will be measured using a goniometer. The percent restriction is calculated by dividing the goniometric angle measured on the affected joint by that measured on the unaffected contralateral joint (multiplied by 100).</description>
