  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 part study for patients with solid tumours. The purpose of Part A is to measure
      the amount of olaparib or its breakdown products in the bloodstream for up to 72 hours after
      eating 3 different breakfasts (high calorie, regular and none). In Part B Patients can take
      olaparib capsules daily and study assessments will be recorded for 6 months (minimum).
      Treatment can continue for as long as the patient is benefitting. Throughout the study
      patients will be monitored for any side effects.
