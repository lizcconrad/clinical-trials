    <textblock>
      The Enlighten study is an 8-week trial investigating the response to use of a smartphone diet
      and activity application. Participants are enrolled as part of a worksite intervention, and
      will receive the LoseIt! weight loss smartphone application, which requires participants to
      self-monitor dietary intake and physical activity, a component shown to effectively produce
      weight loss. The application will be programmed to deliver dietary intake recommendations
      during the first three weeks of the intervention. At the 3 week time point, self-monitoring
      adherence via the smartphone application will be assessed and those who are not responding
      will receive 4 weekly telephone coaching sessions. Those individuals who respond at the end
      of 3 weeks will be encouraged to continue self-monitoring on the application. All
      participants will also receive regular text messages throughout the trial. The importance of
      the proposed research lies in the objective to reconfigure weight loss treatment so as to
      achieve the intended outcome more efficiently and in a manner that allows greater reach.

    <description>All participants will complete 8 weeks of recording of dietary intake, weight, and physical activity on a smartphone application. Time-stamped data from the smartphone will upload automatically to the application server, where it will be visible to the lifestyle coach. The participant's real-time diet, activity and weight data relative to their goals will be visually depicted on the participant's smartphone. The coach will monitor participant adherence and send supportive text messages. Response to the application will be assessed 3 weeks after enrollment into the study; measured by number of food items recorded between weeks 1-3 of the intervention; an indicator of use and adherence. Based on adherence, some participants may receive 4 telephone coaching sessions between weeks 5 and 8. Telephone coaching sessions will include feedback on self-monitoring and goal attainment, problem solving, and motivational interviewing.</description>
