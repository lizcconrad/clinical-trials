      Background:

      - GI-6207 is an experimental cancer vaccine made with baker's yeast. The yeast has been
      modified to help the immune system target a protein called CEA. CEA is found on the surface
      of some kinds of tumor cells, including thyroid cancer cells. Researchers want to see if
      GI-6207 can encourage the body's immune system to attack and kill tumor cells that contain
      the CEA protein. They will test to see whether this vaccine is a safe and effective treatment
      for medullary thyroid cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of the GI-6207 vaccine for advanced medullary thyroid
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have medullary thyroid cancer that has not
      responded to earlier treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide blood and tumor samples and have an imaging study of the neck and chest. They
           will also have a skin test to make sure that they are not allergic to the yeast in the
           vaccine.

        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will start to take GI-6207
           immediately for 1 year. The second group will have 6 months of monitoring and tests with
           no vaccine, and then will take GI-6207 for 1 year.

        -  GI-6207 will be given every other week for the first seven visits (about 3 months), and
           then monthly for the remaining year of treatment. It will be given as injections beneath
           the arm and in the upper thigh. These locations will help the vaccine enter the lymph
           nodes and reach the immune system more quickly.

        -  Participants will be monitored with frequent blood and urine tests and imaging studies.

        -  Participants will have regular follow-up visits after their year of study vaccines.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  CEA is overexpressed in multiple malignancies, including medullary thyroid cancer where
           CEA is universally expressed on tumor cells.

        -  There is no standard treatment for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic,
           metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. The only effective FDA-approved therapy
           (vandetanib) comes with significant toxicity, so it is not used until patients have
           symptomatic or rapidly progressing disease.

        -  Preclinical studies have shown that GI-6207 can induce a strong immune response to CEA
           as well as therapeutic anti-tumor responses.

        -  A previous Phase I GI-6207 study has demonstrated safety and enhanced immune response in
           some patients.

        -  Preliminary data suggests that tumor growth rates can be calculated in medullary thyroid
           cancer patients within 3 months

        -  Retrospective data from prostate cancer studies suggest that vaccines can alter tumor
           growth rates within 3-4 months

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary:

      -To determine the effect of GI-6207 on calcitonin growth rate kinetics after 6 months of
      therapy in patients with medullary thyroid cancer

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Patients will have evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease
           that is evaluable on bone or CT scan.

        -  Patients with minimal or no disease related-symptoms (minimal symptoms will include
           those that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require
           regularly schedule narcotics.)

        -  ECOG 0-1

        -  No previous chemotherapy

        -  No previous vandetanib

        -  Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious
           inter-current medical illness; no cardiac disease; no prior splenectomy. (History of
           previous thyroid autoimmune disease will be allowed as these patients will have had
           total thyroidectomy.)

        -  No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis

        -  No pericardial-based masses greater than 1 cm or thoracic lesions larger than 2 cm

      Design:

        -  Randomized, phase 2 study to determine the effect of GI-6207 on calcitonin growth rate
           after 6 months of GI-6207

        -  Patients will be randomized to either initial GI-6207 therapy or 6 months of
           surveillance followed by GI-6207 therapy.

        -  GI-6207 will be administered subcutaneously at 4 sites at dose of 10 yeast units per
           site, biweekly for 7 visits (day 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85), then monthly up to 1 year
           of treatment. (For patients randomized to surveillance and then GI-6207, they will get a
           full year of GI-6207 after a 6 month surveillance period.)

        -  Once patients have completed one year of therapy with GI-6207, patients without
           radiographic progression will have the option to receive vaccine every 3 months for an
           additional 12 months. Patients who remain on vaccine will continue to be scanned every 3
           months.

        -  Immune monitoring via apheresis will be done prior to enrollment and at 6 months for all
           appropriate and consenting patients. Patients who are evaluable for immunologic response
           by the ELISPOT Assay (HLA 02, 03 and 24) will have apheresis at start of GI-6207 therapy
           and then every 3 months while on GI-6207 treatment when feasible.

    <description>GI-6207 is a heat-killed, recombinant yeast-based vaccine engineered to express the full length human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), with a modified gene coding sequence to code for a single amino acid substitution (asparagine to aspartic acid) at the native protein amino acid position 610, which is designed to enhance immunogenicity. A plasmid vector containing the modified human CEA gene is used to transfect the parental yeast strain (S. cerevisiae W303 - a haploid strain with known mutations from wild-type yeast) to produce the final recombinant vaccine product.</description>

      <textblock>
        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants must meet the following criteria for participation:

          -  Diagnosis: Patients must have histologically confirmed medullary thyroid cancer by the
             Laboratory of Pathology or a pathology report and history consistent with medullary
             thyroid cancer. It is not uncommon for a secondary, minor pathologic focus of another
             form of thyroid cancer to be coincidentally found in 15-20% of patients with medullary
             thyroid cancer. In such cases, eligibility is based on the discretion of the
             investigator.

          -  Patients must have evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease
             that is evaluable on bone, CT scan or MRI. (Patients who are surgical candidates and

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL

          -  Biochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy)

               -  Baseline renal function:

                  --- Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR
                  creatinine clearance on a 24-h urine collection of greater than or equal to 60
                  mL/min.

               -  Hepatic function:

                    -  Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, in patients with Gilbert's
                       syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0 mg/dL

                    -  AST and ALT&lt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal

          -  No other active malignancies within the past 3 years (with the exception of
             nonmelanoma skin cancers, prostate cancer patients with stable biochemical
             recurrence/not on systemic therapy or carcinoma in situ of the bladder).

          -  Willing to travel to the NIH for follow-up visits

          -  Able to understand and sign informed consent.

          -  Must agree to use effective birth control (such as a condom) or abstinence during and
             for a period of 6 months after the last vaccination therapy.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with any of the following will not be eligible for participation in this study:

          -  Patients should have no evidence of immune dysfunction as listed below.

               -  1 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity due to the potential for
                  decreased immune response to the vaccine.

               -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a recent history of autoimmune
                  disease requiring therapy, including, but not limited to, inflammatory bowel
                  disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or active diverticulitis. This
                  requirement is due to the potential risks of exacerbating autoimmunity. However,
                  patients with vitiligo may be enrolled. (Patients with history of autoimmune
                  thyroid conditions will be allowed as these patients will be on replacement
                  medications.)

               -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic
                  steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, eye drops or inhaled) steroid use.
                  Limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of
                  reactive airway disease or to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or
                  anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women, due to the unknown effects of GI-6207 on the fetus
             or infant.

          -  Serious inter-current medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the
             patient to carry out the treatment program.

          -  Untreated brain metastases (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6
             months) due to the poor prognosis of these patients and difficulty ascertaining the
             cause of neurologic toxicities.

          -  Patients with pericardial masses &gt;1 cm or thoracic lesions larger than 2 cm will be
             excluded.

          -  Concurrent chemotherapy.

          -  Chronic hepatitis infection, including B and C, because potential immune impairment
             caused by these disorders may diminish the effectiveness of this immunologic therapy.

          -  Participation in another interventional clinical trial at the time of enrollment.

          -  Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the
             patient's tolerance of study treatment.

          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.

          -  Patients with second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment; patients treated
             surgically with a curative intent, such as non-melanoma skin cancers, localized kidney
             cancer or carcinoma in situ of the bladder, are not excluded. Patients with MEN2 and a
             history of pheochromocytoma will also not be excluded. In addition patients with
             prostate cancer who do not require systemic therapy will not be excluded. (A
             secondary, minor pathologic focus of another form of thyroid cancer may be
             coincidentally found in 15-20% of patients with medullary thyroid cancer. In such
             cases, eligibility is based on the discretion of the investigator.
