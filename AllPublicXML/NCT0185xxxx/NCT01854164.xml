  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the effects of daily supplementation of hydrolyzed
      ginseng extract(HGE) on glycemic status in subjects with impaired fasting glucose(IFG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a 8 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Twenty subjects
      were randomly divided into HGE or a placebo group. Fasting and postprandial glucose profiles
      during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were assessed before and after the intervention.
