  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Dyspnea&quot; refers to the awareness of breathing discomfort that is typically experienced
      during exercise in health and disease. In various participant populations, dyspnea is a
      predictor of disability and death; and contributes to exercise intolerance and an adverse
      health-related quality-of-life. It follows that alleviating dyspnea and improving exercise
      tolerance are among the principal goals of disease management. Nevertheless, the effective
      management of dyspnea and activity-limitation remains an elusive goal for many healthcare
      providers and current strategies aimed at reversing the underlying chronic disease are only
      partially successful in this regard. Thus, research aimed at identifying dyspnea-specific
      medications to complement existing therapies for the management of exertional symptoms is
      timely and clinically relevant. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that
      single-dose inhalation of fentanyl citrate (a mu-opioid receptor antagonist) will improve the
      perception of dyspnea during strenuous exercise in healthy, young men in the presence of an
      external thoracic restriction. To this end, the investigators plan compare the effects of
      inhaled 0.9% saline placebo and inhaled fentanyl citrate (250 mcg) on detailed assessments of
      neural respiratory drive (diaphragm EMG), ventilation, breathing pattern, dynamic operating
      lung volumes, contractile respiratory muscle function, cardio-metabolic function and dyspnea
      (sensory intensity and affective responses) during symptom-limited, high-intensity,
      constant-work-rate cycle exercise testing with and without external thoracic restriction in
      healthy, men aged 20-40 years.
