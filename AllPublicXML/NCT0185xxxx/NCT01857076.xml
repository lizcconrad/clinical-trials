    <textblock>
      There will be a randomized clinical trial, non-blind, 3-arm treatment (medical, surgical,
      gastric bypass and ileal transposition surgery with and sleeve), which will be conducted in a
      single center - S.B.S. Hospital Sirio Libanês, including 75 research subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus and obesity class I. In order to compare the effect of weight loss on
      glycemic control among medical and surgical groups, and after 2 years of follow up, the
      results of efficacy, safety and maintenance will be compared between the three groups.
