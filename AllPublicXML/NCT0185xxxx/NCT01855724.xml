      The purpose of this study is to determine whether gemcitabine and pazopanib are effective in
      the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tree cancer
      (cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder carcinoma).

      This is an open label, uncontrolled, multicenter, phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of Gemcitabine/Pazopanib combination as 1st line treatment in patients with
      unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic biliary tree adenocarcinoma. A total of 46
      patients will be included in the study. The patients will receive open label Gemcitabine 1000
      mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 and Pazopanib 800 mg per os on days 1 to 21 every 21
      days. Treatment with gemcitabine/pazopanib combination will continue until disease
      progression, appearance of significant toxicity, completion of 8 cycles or informed consent
      withdrawal. Upon completion of 8 treatment cycles with the combination, and in the absence of
      disease progression, administration of pazopanib monotherapy as maintenance treatment will be
      continued until disease progression, appearance of significant toxicity or informed consent
      withdrawal.

      Imaging assessments will be performed every 8 weeks
