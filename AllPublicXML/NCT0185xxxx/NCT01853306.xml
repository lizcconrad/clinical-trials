                  for 90 days following completion if therapy.

          7. Subject must be capable of understanding and complying with parameters as outlined in
             the protocol and able to sign informed consent, approved by an Institutional Review

          5. Subject who has received strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A, 1A1, 2D6, or 2C19
             within 3 days or five half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of

             cancer in situ that the Principal Investigator considers to be cured. Questions
             regarding the inclusion of individual subject should be directed to the Medical
             Monitor.

         12. History of gastric surgery, vagotomy, bowel resection or any surgical procedure that
             might interfere with gastrointestinal motility, pH or absorption.

         13. Receipt of any investigational product within 28 days prior to study drug
             administration or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.
