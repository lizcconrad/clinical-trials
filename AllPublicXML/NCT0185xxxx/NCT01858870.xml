    <textblock>
      Lacosamide is an antiepileptic drug approved for using like adjuvant treatment in adults
      epileptic crisis.

      Previous studies has granted to the adjuvant therapy a significant efficacy. This is an
      observational study, multicenter and retrospective, in patients with epilepsy. The aim of
      study is the evaluation of the adjuvant treatment with Lacosamide administered over 12
      months.

      The investigators will collect information from 860 patients in 13 spanish centers.

      The secondary aim is assess the tolerability of treatment during 3,6 and 12 month.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the treatment we will performed a analysis in three different times (3, 6 and 12
      month)for obtain a vision of tolerability and efficacy for Lacosamide in usual clinical
      practice. We intended describe the differences when we add Lacosamide to an antiepileptic
      drug, sodium channel blocker or no-sodium channel blocker in usual clinical practice.

      Clinical data obtained through post-hoc analysis for registered pivotal studies made in
      highly refractory epileptic patients show that adjuvant treatment with Lacosamide has an
      extra efficacy compared with placebo. It is self-depended to the treatment with or without
      sodium channel blockers.

      This study will allow us to obtain information about real existing most population where do
      not exist as high refractoriness as the pivotal studies.

      The population of study is:

      Patients with epilepsy, with plus that 18 years old patients, with initial partial crisis
      treated with Lacosamide according to usual clinical practice in Spain.

      Lacosamide must has been used for epilepsy treatment at least during 12 month.

      The data record is collection in 5 months.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Adults (+18).

        2. Patients with epilepsy partial crisis diagnostic that had been treated with Lacosamide
           according to usual clinical practice.

        3. The patient had at least one partial crisis during the year before to the initiation of
           treatment with Lacosamide.

        4. The patient or their legal agent is reliable and is be able to adhere to the protocol
           according to the investigation criteria.

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patient is in an other study of medical protocol or medical implant.

        2. Patients with other kind of epilepsy.

        3. patients with chronic alcoholism or abuse drug recording in the last year.

        4. patients who don't be in possession of their faculties in the moment to sign Informed
           Consent.

        The study is designed to collect data from patients with epilepsy, aged 18 years with
        partial onset seizures (Partial Crisis) treated with Lacosamide as routine clinical
        practice in Spain. Lacosamide must have been used for the treatment of Partial Crisis for
        at least 12 months. We intend to collect data from approximately 860 patients in 13 Spanish
        centers.
