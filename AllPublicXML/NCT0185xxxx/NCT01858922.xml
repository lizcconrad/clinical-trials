  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects have a type of cancer called Hodgkin Disease (HD), a cancer of the lymph system. The
      lymph system is made up of tissue throughout the body that makes and stores
      infection-fighting cells. HD is one of the most treatable childhood cancers. The standard
      treatment for HD involves chemotherapy (treatment with anti-cancer drugs) and radiation
      therapy (the use of high-dose x-rays to get rid of cancer cells). Although they are cured
      from their cancer, some patients experience negative side effects from treatment later in
      life. These kinds of side effects are often referred to as late effects. This can include
      problems with growth, problems with some organ functions, and sometimes second cancers. These
      types of effects can be associated with either chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The
      investigators are therefore designing studies to minimize or prevent these late effects. It
      is thought that if some patients can be successfully treated without radiation, those
      patients might experience fewer late side effects.

      Some patients, however, do not respond as well to the first stages of treatment (slow early
      responders). Slow early responders are considered to be at higher risk for relapse. This
      study also looks at whether these kinds of patients will benefit from additional
      chemotherapy.

      The purpose of this study is to look at how the immune system recovers and at how certain
      T-cells in the blood behave after receiving chemotherapy with or without radiation. The
      investigators also want to identify if bio-markers (special proteins in blood and in cancer)
      relate to the response of HD to study treatment.

    <textblock>
      At first the subject will have 2 cycles of cancer drugs (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vincristine,
      Etoposide, Prednisone, Cyclophosphamide). The doctors call this combination of cancer drugs
      ABVE-PC for short. A cycle equals 21 days. The cancer drugs will be given intravenously (IV).

      Those patients evaluated as having an early response to treatment will be put in the group of
      Rapid Early Responders (RERs). The RER group includes those patients whose disease has been
      reduced by 60% or more. The next step for patients with RERs is 2 more cycles of ABVE-PC
      chemotherapy followed by another evaluation of their response. Those determined to have a
      complete response (at least an 80% disease reduction) will receive no further therapy. Those
      patients determined to have less than a complete response will receive radiation therapy
      within 6 weeks after the last cycle or when blood counts are recovered. Radiation therapy
      will be given to the involved areas and by the standard of care of this hospital (Texas
      Children's Hospital). After radiation the subject will be off treatment.

      Patients with disease reduction less than 60% are put in the group of Slow Early Responders
      (SERs). The next step for patients with SER is 2 cycles of DECA (Dexamethasone, Etoposide,
      Cytarabine, and Cisplatin). On Days 1 and 2, the subject will be given dexamethasone IV
      first; afterwards, then they will receive the Etoposide and Cytarabine mixture. Cisplatin
      will be given by IV only on Day 1.

      BIOLOGY TESTS The doctors are investigating molecules in tumors and blood that may help them
      better understand the biology of Hodgkin's Disease. These studies may also help them
      understand differences in patients' responses to therapy.

      TISSUE FOR BIOMARKER STUDIES The doctors want to study the material that shows the make-up of
      the cancer (the genes of the cancer tissue) and the special &quot;markers&quot; of the tissue. Tissue
      from the subject's cancer biopsies will be used for these studies. They will collect these
      samples when the subject has a biopsy for clinical reasons.

      IMMUNE FUNCTION AND BIOMARKER BLOOD TESTS The doctors also want to collect blood samples to
      study the subject's immune system and to look at biomarkers in the blood.

If subsequent PET/CT scan indicates a complete response (CR), therapy will stop and regular follow-up will begin. If the subsequent PET/CT for RER patients indicates a partial response, those patients will undergo IFRT.</description>

Those patients determined to have a slow early response (SER) determined by PET/CT scan after two cycles of ABVE-PC will receive 2 courses of DECA.
