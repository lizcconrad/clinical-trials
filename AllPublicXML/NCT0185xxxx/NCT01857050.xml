  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many drug interactions with Warfarin are well documented in the literature, including
      interactions with a variety of antibiotics. However,in mamy cases it is difficult to predict
      when the interaction remains theoretical and when it becomes clinically significant and will
      be reflected in the individual patient. This study's aim is to identify and characterize
      related conditions (including comorbidities, laboratory test results and other parameters
      related to the patient)that might be predictors for drug interactions turning from
      theoretical to clinically significant.
