  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-time-in-man study is mainly designed to assess the safety and tolerability of
      AADvac1 in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

      AADvac1 is a vaccine directed against pathologically modified Alzheimer tau protein that is
      the main constituent of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and is intended to be a
      disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease, i.e. to halt its progress.

      As this study is a Phase I study focused on tolerability and safety, efficacy will be
      assessed in an exploratory manner.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AADvac1 is a candidate therapeutic vaccine for Alzheimer's disease that targets misfolded tau
      protein, a common denominator of neurofibrillary pathology. Based on preclinical results, the
      intervention is expected to reduce the number of neurofibrillary tangles, remove
      hyperphosphorylated tau protein and reduce the amount of oligomerized and insoluble
      pathological tau in the brain, to halt the spread of neurofibrillary pathology through the
      brain, and thus prevent associated cognitive decline.

      The vaccine's antigenic determinant is a synthetic peptide derived from a tau protein
      sequence, which is coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and uses aluminum hydroxide
      (Alhydrogel) as an adjuvant.

      At present AADvac1 is intended as an active immunotherapy for patients with diagnosed
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Patients will receive 3 - 6 immunization doses; the raised titers
      of therapeutic antibodies and possible benefits of the treatment can extend beyond the
      duration of the study.

      Because of the central role of pathological misfolded tau protein in the etiology of AD, the
      vaccine is expected to be more effective than active or passive immunotherapies aiming to
      eliminate the amyloid β plaques that have been clinically investigated so far.
