    <textblock>
      The study objective is to compare the CBCT images generated by the CS 9300 to those generated
      by conventional CT. It proposes a direct comparison of diagnostic image quality between the
      CS 9300 and conventional CT using double image examinations.

    <time_frame>Patients will be followed until each has had their standard of care CT and the investigational CBCT an expected average of 3 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>This study will try to prove that CBCT images are not diagnostically worse than conventional CT for overall image quality and visibility of pathologic attributes, including conspicuity, for all disease types and defects of the sinus region and temporal bone.
After all Data is collected from the three sites, a Reader Study will be conducted to access diagnostic image quality.</description>

    <time_frame>Patients will be followed until each has had their standard of care CT and the investigational CBCT an expected average of 3 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>CBCT images captures at a minimum of 65% reduction in dose compared to conventional CT. This study will try to prove that dose levels to thyroid, breast and gonad are less using CBCT than conventional CT.
After the 5 patients who are randomly selected to wear dosimeters are imaged. A statistical analysis will be performed on the data.</description>
