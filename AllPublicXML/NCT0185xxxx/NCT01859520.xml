  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sperms are prepared by sperm washing techniques before used in assisted reproductive
      technologies. Most commonly used sperm preparation methods are the swim up and the density
      gradient. Recent studies shows that the DNA integrity status of the spermatozoa is related to
      the success in assisted reproduction techniques. Sperm preparation methods may theoretically
      cause damage to sperm DNA. Therefore it is important to select the optimum method of sperm
      preparation causing least sperm DNA damage. Aim of our study is to investigate and compare
      the effect two different sperm preparation techniques on DNA fragmentation.

    <description>The change in the rate of DNA fragmented spermatozoa will be assessed before and immediately after the sperm preparation is completed, because DNA fragmentation of spermatozoa may be increased in time.</description>
