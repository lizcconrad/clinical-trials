  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood, with nearly 50% of
      patients presenting with widespread metastatic disease. The current treatment for this group
      of high-risk patients includes intensive multi-agent chemotherapy (induction) followed by
      myeloablative therapy with stem-cell rescue (consolidation) and then treatment of minimal
      residual disease (MRD) with isotretinoin. Recently a new standard of care was established by
      enhancing the treatment of MRD with the addition of a monoclonal antibody (ch14.18) which
      targets a tumor-associated antigen, the disialoganglioside GD2, which is uniformly expressed
      by neuroblasts. Despite improvement in 2-year event-free survival (EFS) of 20%, more than
      one-third of children with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR defined in) still cannot be cured by
      this approach. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are needed for this subset of
      patients. This study will be a pilot Phase II study of a unique anti-disialoganglioside
      (anti-GD2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) called hu14.18K322A, given with induction chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To study the efficacy [response: complete remission + partial remission (CR+PR)] to two
           initial courses of cyclophosphamide and topotecan combined with hu14.18K322A (4
           doses/course followed by GM-CSF) in previously untreated children with high-risk
           neuroblastoma.

        -  To estimate the event-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed high-risk
           neuroblastoma treated with the addition of hu14.18K322A to treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To study the feasibility of delivering hu14.18K322A to 6 cycles induction chemotherapy
           and describe the antitumor activity (CR+PR) of this 6 course induction therapy.

        -  To estimate local control and pattern of failure associated with focal intensity
           modulated or proton beam radiation therapy dose delivery in high-risk abdominal
           neuroblastoma.

        -  To describe the tolerability of four doses of hu14.18K322A with allogeneic natural
           killer (NK) cells from an acceptable parent, in the immediate post-transplant period
           [day +2 - +5 after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion] in consenting
           participants.

        -  To describe the tolerability of hu14.18K322A with interleukin-2 and GM-CSF as treatment
           for minimal residual disease (MRD).

      The phases of the study are:

        1. Screening phase: Tests and evaluations will be done before treatment starts.

        2. Induction phase: Includes chemotherapy plus hu14.18K322A mAb. Participants will also
           have surgery during this part of the study to remove as much tumor as possible.

        3. Consolidation/Intensification phase: Includes high doses of chemotherapy and blood stem
           cell transplantation with additional, experimental &quot;minimal residual disease&quot; (MRD)
           treatment. Participants will also get radiation treatment to all sites of the tumor(s)
           after recovery from the stem cell transplant.5. Maintenance/MRD treatment phase: With
           immune therapy in addition to the standard treatment with the drug isotretinoin.

        4. Maintenance/MRD treatment phase: With immune therapy in addition to the standard
           treatment with the drug isotretinoin.

The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products).
