  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long acting injectable
      microspheres of risperidone in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with
      symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and
      hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self), schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders
      (disorders in which there is a loss of ego boundaries or a gross impairment in reality
      testing with delusions or prominent hallucinations).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), longitudinal
      (participants are followed over time with continuous or repeated monitoring of risk factors
      or health-outcomes), non-randomized (a clinical trial in which the participants are not
      assigned by chance to different treatment groups), single-center study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of long acting microspheres of risperidone in adult participants with
      schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorders. The duration of this study will
      be 12 months and duration of treatment will be 6 months. The study will include 4 visits:
      Baseline, and 3 follow-up visits including Week 4, 12 and 26. All eligible participants will
      be treated with risperidone 25 milligram (mg) intramuscular injection (injection of a
      substance into a muscle) for every two weeks up to 6 months. Participants with persistent
      symptoms and/or requiring higher doses of antipsychotics (agents that control agitated
      psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a
      quieting effect) will be initiated with higher doses of risperidone. Doses will be adjusted
      according to the response of the treatment. Efficacy and safety of the participants will be
      primarily evaluated by Positive and Negative Syndromes Scale (PANSS) and Extrapyramidal
      Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), respectively. Participants' quality of life and safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210, higher scores indicate worsening. Change at Week 26 score is calculated as Baseline score minus Week 26 score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) - Disease Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;, higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-36 (SF-36) - Quality of Life Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a standardized survey evaluating 8 aspects of functional health and well being: vitality, physical function, social function, physical role, emotional role, bodily pain, general health, mental health. Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 0-100 (100=highest level of functioning).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The GAF is a 100-point tool to measure overall psychological, social and occupational functioning of adults. The higher score range (91 to 100) refers to a superior functioning in a wide range of activities, and absence of symptoms. The lower score range (1 to 10) refers to persistent danger of severely hurting self or others; or persistent inability to maintain minimum personal hygiene; or serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction With Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' were assessed for their satisfaction with the current antipsychotic treatment on a 5-point scale/questionnaire: very good, good, reasonable, moderate or poor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>An ESRS scale is used to assess the extrapyramidal symptoms attributable to antipsychotics. It consists of 8 items to assess individual symptoms and each item is assessed from 0 (none, absent) to 4 (severe). The total score is the sum of the 8 item scores, for a total range of 0 (normal) to 32 severe). The items for the assessment of individual symptoms are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia.</description>

        <title>Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) Score</title>
        <description>An ESRS scale is used to assess the extrapyramidal symptoms attributable to antipsychotics. It consists of 8 items to assess individual symptoms and each item is assessed from 0 (none, absent) to 4 (severe). The total score is the sum of the 8 item scores, for a total range of 0 (normal) to 32 severe). The items for the assessment of individual symptoms are classified into 4 categories of parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia.</description>

        <population>Safety set (SS) population (N=79) included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Here, 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>
