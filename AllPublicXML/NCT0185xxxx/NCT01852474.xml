  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the clinical and neurophysiological effects of
      a non-invasive brain stimulation technique - transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-
      on cortical plasticity and motor learning in children with cerebral palsy. Investigators will
      use different assessment techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and
      kinematics (sensors) to measure changes through the trial.

    <description>Investigators will measure changes in kinematic (sensor) assessments from baseline to follow-up. The sensor will collect Inertial Measurements Units (IMU) and complex motion sensing, as measured by accelerometer/gyroscope/magnetometer of freedom motion capture.</description>

    <measure>Changes in TMS measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will measure change in TMS measurements from baseline to follow-up. TMS measures will consist of: motor threshold, motor evoked potentials (MEP's), transcallosal inhibition, and examinations of intracortical inhibition and facilitation.</description>
