      This study is being conducted to evaluate the effects of Atrasentan on Renal Outcomes in
      Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes and Nephropathy.

      The study objective is to evaluate the effect of atrasentan compared with placebo on time to
      doubling of serum creatinine or the onset of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in subjects with
      type 2 diabetes and nephropathy who are treated with the maximum tolerated labeled daily dose
      (MTLDD) of a Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitor. In addition, the study will assess the
      effects of atrasentan compared with placebo on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, urine
      albumin excretion, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as well as on the
      impact on quality of life in subjects with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has type 2 diabetes (including patients with latent autoimmune diabetes or
             insulin-treated patients without a history of diabetic ketoacidosis who also have a
             negative anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase test AND an elevated post-prandial serum
             C-peptide level) and has been treated with at least one anti-hyperglycemic medication
             and ACEi/or ARB (RAS inhibitor) for at least 4 weeks prior to the Screening S2 visit.

          -  For entry into the Run-In Period the subject must satisfy the following criteria based
             on the Screening laboratory values:

               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 25 to 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 [until the
                  eGFR cap on subjects (approximately 300) with a baseline of &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
                  is reached] and a urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) greater than or equal to
                  300 and less than 5,000 mg/g (greater than or equal to 34 mg/mmol and less than
                  565 mg/mmol);

             edema, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) felt to be compatible with heart
             failure, that was not explained by other causes, and for which there was a change in
