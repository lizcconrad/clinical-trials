  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      800,000 people in the United Kingdom (UK)have dementia, of which 250,000 are living in care
      homes. These individuals have complex mental health problems, disabilities and social needs,
      which if unmet will continue to adversely affect each individual, as well as the main goal of
      enabling people to &quot;live well with dementia&quot;, as presented in the National Dementia Strategy
      (NDS) (Department of Health, 2009).

      This optimized intervention WHELD is based on a factorial study and qualitative evaluation
      designed to facilitate the design of this current study and will combine this with the most
      effective elements of existing approaches to develop a comprehensive but practical
      intervention to improve quality of life in persons with dementia living in care homes. The
      intervention will combine training on person centred care, promoting person centred
      activities and interactions and provide care home staff and general practitioners with
      updated knowledge regarding the optimal use of psychotropic medications for persons with
      dementia in care homes.

      The overarching goal of this trial is to determine whether this optimised WHELD intervention
      is more effective in improving the quality of life and mental health, than the usual care
      provided people with dementia living in nursing homes. The cost effectiveness of the
      intervention will be assessed as well, with the aim to provide a cost effective, simple and
      practical intervention, improving quality of life and mental health of people with dementia
      in care homes; which can be rolled out nationally to all UK care homes as an National Health
      Service (NHS) intervention. The trial will be a randomised controlled 2-arm cluster single
      blind trial that will take place for 9 months across 80 care homes in UK.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this current study is to determine whether the optimised WHELD
      intervention, will significantly improve quality of life for people with dementia in
      comparison to the usual care provided in care homes.

      Key secondary objectives will be to determine the specific impact of the optimised WHELD
      intervention on a range of outcomes including mental health and unmet needs, physical health
      and use of psychotropic drugs, staff attitudes and the quality of the interaction of care
      staff with people with dementia, person centred environment in care home settings and overall
      provide a cost-effective, simple and practical intervention.

      We hypothesise that the intervention will significantly improve several key outcomes.
      Specifically we hypothesise that, compared to treatment as usual the optimised WHELD
      intervention will:

      â€¢ Improve quality of life for people with dementia living in nursing homes

      The secondary hypotheses are that the optimized WHELD intervention will:

        -  Reduce agitation, other behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms

        -  Reduce the use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs use

        -  Reduce unmet needs

        -  Reduce mortality

        -  Improve mood and depression

        -  Improve the quality of interactions between staff and residents

        -  Provide person centred environment in care home settings

        -  Provide a cost-effective intervention

      The study design is a cluster randomised controlled, 2 arms trial to be run in 80 care homes,
      including 960 - 1280 participants.

      Each cluster in the optimised WHELD intervention arm will receive the optimised WHELD
      intervention for 9 months.

      Evaluations will be undertaken to understand the breadth of benefits conferred by the
      intervention to be assessed when used in comparison with the progress of the participants
      residing in the care homes allocated to the TAU trial arm. Baseline and follow up data will
      be collected on all consented residents who meet the inclusion criteria at each participating
      care home.

    <measure>Quality of Life (DEMQOL-proxy)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in quality of life from baseline assessment point to the 9 month intervention period in both intervention and control group</time_frame>
    <description>DEMQOL-Proxy (main outcome measure) is a 31 item interviewer-administered questionnaire answered by a caregiver with the score range of 31 to 124. The The measure is also validated as a method for calculating Quality Adjusted life Year (QALY) for health economic analysis.
DEMQOL (secondary outcome measure) assesses the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for people with dementia. The measure consists of two questionnaires. DEMQOL, conducted with person with dementia is a 28 item interviewer-administered questionnaire with the score range of 28 to 112.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life in late - stage dementia (QUALID)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in quality of life in late stage dementia measure from baseline to the 9 months of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The QUALID is a reliable valid scale, administered to caregivers, for rating quality of life in people with late-stage dementia. The scale measures 11 observable behaviours indicating activity and emotional states. Ratings are made for observations made over the preceding 7 days. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale with QUALID scores ranging from 12 to 45 points with lower scores reflecting a higher quality of life (QOL).</description>

    <measure>Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed prior to randomization and after 9 months of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CMAI is a caregivers' rating questionnaire to specify agitated behaviour (Cohen-Mansfield et al, 1989). The CMAI consists of 29 items related to agitated behaviour, each of which is rated on a 7-point scale of frequency, from 1 = never to 7 = several times an hour. The rating is based on a face-to-face interview with a caregiver.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neuropsychiatric Inventory nursing home version (NPI-NH)</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed prior to randomization and after 9 months of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI is a validated structured interview assessment with the informant (care staff), that assesses behavioural disturbances in patients with dementia [25]. This 12-item version consists of 10 behavioural and two neurovegetative areas. It provides both a total score as well as scores for a number of sub-scales (e.g., delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, disinhibition, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, irritability/lability, aberrant motor activity, sleep, and appetite/eating disorders). The frequency, severity and caregiver distress for each domain are measured. The total possible maximum score is 144. A higher score reflects increased frequency and severity of the disturbances. This specific version is developed for use in nursing homes (NPI-NH), with adapted questions in the standardized interview and the caregiver distress assessment is adapted to occupational disruptiveness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD)</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed prior to randomization and after 9 months of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The CSDD is an assessment of signs and symptoms of major depression in patients with dementia. The CSDD uses a comprehensive interviewing approach that derives information via semi-structured interviews with the participant and the care staff. Many of the items during the patient interview can be filled after direct observation of the patient. The final ratings of the CSDD items represent the rater's clinical impression rather than the responses of the informant or the patient. Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0-2 (0=absent, 1=mild or intermittent, 2=severe). The item scores are added. Scores above 10 indicate a probable major depression. Scores above 18 indicate a definite major depression. Scores below 6 as a rule are associated with absence of significant depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Sheffield Care Environment Assessment Matrix (SCEAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed prior to randomization and after 9 months of the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>SCEAM is a comprehensive observational assessment of the care environment, which covers items such as privacy, choice and degree of control experienced by residents. Assessors require no particular training and can carry out the assessment mostly by walking through the home and directly observing the building and the way it is used in practice. The majority of items relate to the residents, but there is also a section relating specifically to staff and the provision made for them.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>The outcome measure will be assessed prior to randomization and after 9 months of the intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The CSRI is used to estimate the cost of service packages for each participant in the study. Information is collected on the current living arrangements, use of hospital, community-based and day services over a defined retrospective of 3 months in this study. The data collected through the CSRI can be used to calculate service costs and total costs of care.</description>
