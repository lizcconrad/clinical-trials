  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescence is a critical period for the development of depressive disorders. As adolescence
      also is a critical period for brain maturation, it may be hypothesized that maturation
      changes in emotional circuits could underlie vulnerability for depression.

      The aims of the study are (1) to identify the changes in brain morphometry, white matter
      microstructure, and functioning, in networks associated with depression features in
      adolescents, and (2) to assess the effects of treated pathology on brain structure by
      comparing the neuroimaging measures obtained in adolescents at inclusion with those at
      follow-up.

      Adolescence is a key development period for neurobiological processes underlying emotional
      and cognitive functions in adulthood. The pathophysiology of mood disorders has recently been
      associated with maturation changes in brain networks, but little is known on the early brain
      structure changes associated with depression appearing during this major brain maturation
      period.

      The hypothesis of altered structural integrity of limbic prefrontal pathways emerges from the
      literature on depression, but it is unknown whether it is also detectable in adolescents with
      depression. Thus, we aim to investigate WM and GM structure and anatomy, and functional
      correlates of behavioral responses in depressed adolescents.

      40 adolescents with a Major Depressive Episode will be investigated using structural T1
      magnetic-resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), at inclusion and after
      one-year follow-up. Additionally, they will be investigated with fMRI.

      Covariation patterns between neuroimaging and behavioural/clinical variables will be
      assessed.
