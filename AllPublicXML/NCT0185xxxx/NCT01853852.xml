  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GR181413A/AT1001 (migalastat hydrochloride) is a low molecular weight iminosugar, an analog
      of the terminal galactose group that is cleaved from the substrate GL-3. This compound was
      researched and developed as a drug for treatment of Fabry disease. This study, MGM115806,
      will be the first administration of GR181413A/AT1001 to Japanese subjects to investigate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses in healthy Japanese adult
      subjects. Approximately 12 subjects will receive three treatments of 50, 150 and 450 mg
      GR181413A/AT1001 under fasted conditions plus placebo in a dose ascending crossover design.
      Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety assessments will be performed
      following each dose. The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of GR181413A/AT1001 after
      single oral doses of GR181413A/AT1001 at the dose levels of 50, 150 and 450 mg under fasted
      conditions will be assessed.
