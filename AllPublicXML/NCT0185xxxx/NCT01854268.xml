  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a defensive behavior that involves three stages. A large inspiratory phase, a
      compression phase where the vocal folds close and subglottal pressure is developed, and an
      expiratory phase. Cough serves to protect the upper and lower airways from material such as
      liquids, solids, or saliva, that have been aspirated. There are two types of cough: voluntary
      and reflex cough. Voluntary cough involves a cough to command. Reflex cough is a cough that
      is generated secondary to a stimulus in or near the airway. There has been some research
      regarding the differences between voluntary and reflex cough. However, no research has
      described the differences in airflow or movement pattern (kinematics) between the two types
      of cough. This study seeks to determine the respiratory kinematics and airflow differences
      between voluntary and reflex cough in healthy participants.

      As a participant, completion of this study will require the following:

      Investigators will first place cotton elastic bands around your chest and abdomen so that
      measures of chest wall and abdominal movements can be measured. Then, tests of your breathing
      made from pulmonary function testing will be completed.

      Investigators will then have you complete a maximum inspiration followed by a maximum
      expiration three times.

      Investigators will ask you to produce a voluntary cough three times into a facemask which is
      attached to a computer.

      Then the investigators will provide you with nebulized water (FOG) through the facemask for
      up to a minute three times. You will have a minute break in between each presentation.

      Finally, the investigators will provide you with a nebulized dose of Capsaicin, which is
      derived from hot peppers, through the same facemask used in all of the above tasks. You will
      receive three doses of capsaicin and be provided with water at any time during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adults between the ages of 18-80 years.

          -  Ability to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No history of smoking within the last 5 years as this reduces the sensitivity to
             capsaicin

          -  No history of neurological disease (i.e. Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain
             injury, etc.)

          -  No known allergy to capsaicin

          -  No history of respiratory disease (i.e. asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             or respiratory infection within the last 5 weeks.)

Pulmonary function testing: Investigators placed cotton elastic bands around the chest and abdomen so that measures of chest wall and abdominal movements could be measured. Forced vital capacity and rest breathing was completed.
Nebulized water (Fog): The investigators provided nebulized water (FOG) through the facemask for up to a minute three times. A minute break was allotted between each presentation.</description>

Healthy adults who receive capsaicin: Participants will be seated in a comfortable chair and fitted with cotton elastic bands designed to measure changes in chest wall and abdominal movement during cough. The participant will hold a facemask attached to a pneumotachograph, nebulized, and dosimeter. The participant will receive 3 nebulized doses of 200 microMolar capsaicin through the facemask. The participants will have a minute in between each presentation and water will be available at all times.</description>
