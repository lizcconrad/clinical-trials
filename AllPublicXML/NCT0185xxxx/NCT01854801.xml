  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate efficacy of a 14 months follow-up and individual
      medical care of electro-sensitive patients: by measurement of health status, sensitivity to
      electromagnetic fields exposures, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      110 patients suffering from Idiopathic Environmental Intolerance attributed to
      electromagnetic fields (IEI-EMF) are expected in this trial.

      Type of trial: Interventional multicenter study, non-randomized, with measurement before and
      after intervention. Each patient is his own control.

      Primary outcome: Efficacy of an individual medical care on electro sensitive (IEI CEM)
      patients evaluated from the improvement of health status, sensitivity to electromagnetic
      fields (EMF) exposure, and quality of life.

      Scheme:

      Visit 1(T0): Patients undergo a specialized medical examination: a standardized medical
      record is filled in. Physicians evaluate the psychological impact of IEI-EMF and a
      psychotherapeutic care is proposed if necessary. Patients fill in 2 self-questionaries:
      quality of life (SF-36) and EMF exposure sensitivity.

      After the visit 1, a symptoms self-administrated questionary n°1 is completed during 7 days.

      1 month after inclusions (T1), radiofrequencies (RF) are recorded by a dosimeter worn by
      patients for 7 days; patient fill-in the symptoms self-administrated questionary n° 2 during
      the same time.

      Visit 2: 6 months after inclusion, analysis of symptoms and RF exposure is restituted at
      patient. An adapted care is proposed.

      12 months after inclusion (T12), patients complete the symptoms self-administrated
      questionary n°3.

      Visit 3: 14 months after inclusion (T14), patients have medical examination and complete the
      quality of life and EMF exposure sensitivity self-questionaries. Standardized medical record
      is filled in by physicians. Patient and physician discuss the global and comparative analysis
      of individual results.

      Inclusion duration: 24 month; Follow-up: 14 months; Study duration: 38 months.

    <description>At month 12 months the severity of symptoms is evaluated by a self-questionary filled in during 7 days. The level of severity of each symptom occurring during a week, will be self-evaluated by the patient on the base of a 0 to 5 scale. Following the intervention we expect a reduction in the severity of symptoms described.</description>
