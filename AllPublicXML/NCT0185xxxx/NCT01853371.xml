      This research proposal is submitted to fulfill the requirement of the PHD degree of Community
      Medicine Saudi Board at the Joint Program of Family and Community Medicine in Jeddah, Saudi
      Arabia.

      Background: Cupping is an ancient treatment remedy that has been used for many centuries in
      many parts of the world. In the Middle East, Wet cupping &quot;Hijama&quot; is still a popular
      treatment because of its religious background. Despite of that, it still has little
      scientific evidence that proves its efficacy. Many hijama healers claim that they have
      observed dramatic improvement in Blood pressure control of hypertension patients. Not many
      studies support that. This study should help to prove or disprove this hypothesis.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the efficacy of wet cupping on blood pressure among high blood pressure
           patients.

        -  To assess the incidence of wet cupping side effects in the intervention group.

      Methods: The study design is a randomised controlled trial. There will be an intervention
      group of high blood pressure patients who will perform hijama in addition to their usual
      management, and a control group of high blood pressure patients who will receive their usual
      anti-hypertension management only. There will be 4 weeks follow up period. After that, data
      entry, analysis and interpretation will take place.

      Hypothesis: Wet cupping has an effect on blood pressure in adult hypertension patients

    <description>Wet cupping is the process of using a vacuum at different points on the body in order to gather the blood in that area. Then apply few superficial incisions (small, light scratches using a razor) on those areas, followed by repeating the vacuum on the same areas in order to remove 'harmful' blood which lies just beneath the surface of the skin. In this study, the wet cupping procedure was not done on certain days of the lunar month.</description>

            <description>Wet cupping: Will be administered through 3 sessions, with 4 weeks interval between each session and the other.
Conventional treatment: Is the usual anti-HTN treatment taken by the patients at the King Abdulaziz university hospital outpatient department.
Wet cupping: Wet cupping is the process of using a vacuum at different points on the body in order to gather the blood in that area. Then apply few superficial incisions (small, light scratches using a razor) on those areas, followed by repeating the vacuum on the same areas in order to remove 'harmful' blood which lies just beneath the surface of the skin. In this study, the wet cupping procedure was not done on certain days of the lunar month.
Conventional treatment: According to Saudi Hypertension management guidelines, hypertension patients may require life style modification alone , especially for newly diagnosed cases, or my require life style modification and drug treatment.</description>
