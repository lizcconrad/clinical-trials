    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 6, 11 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The AIMS Scale was an extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) rating scale. The AIMS is a 12 item scale. The first 10 items e.g. facial and oral movements (items 1-4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), trunk movements (item 7), investigators global assessment of dyskinesia (items 8 to 10). The first 10 items are rated from 0 to 4 (0=best, 4=worst). Items 11 and 12, related to dental status, have dichotomous responses, 0=no and 1=yes. The AIMS Total Score is the sum of the ratings for the first seven items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 28, with a higher score indicating worse outcome. Last Visit is the last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 6, 11 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The BARS consisted of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by the study physician, subjective feelings of restlessness by the participant, participant distress due to akathisia, and global evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items were rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of 0 = absence of symptoms and a score of 3 = severe condition. The global clinical evaluation were made on a 6-point scale, (0=absent, 1=questionable, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe). To complete this scale, participants were observed while they were seated and then stood for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena were to be elicited by direct questioning. The BARS total score (when combined) ranged from 0 to 18, with higher values indicating a severe condition.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Reported at Least One Occurrence of Suicidality, Suicidal Behavior and Suicidal Ideation on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. Suicidality was defined as reporting at least one occurrence of any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as reporting any type of suicidal behaviors (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and preparatory acts or behavior). The suicidal ideation intensity total score is the sum of intensity scores of 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation). The score of each intensity item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (worst) which leads to the range of the total score from 0 to 25, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. A missing score of any item resulted in a missing total score. If no suicidal ideation was reported, a score of 0 was given to the intensity scale. Last Visit is last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 6, 11 and Last Visit</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive scale items, 7 negative scale items, and 16 general psychopathology scale items from the PANSS panel. The PANSS total score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome). Last Visit is the last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>

    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS positive subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 positive scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 positive symptom constructs are delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. The PANSS Positive Subscale ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms). Last Visit is the last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>

                  7 days prior to participation in this trial.

               4. Participation in other research trials involving ionizing radiation within 1 year
                  of the PET scans that would cause the subject to exceed the yearly dose limits
                  for normal subjects.

               5. Subjects with history of IV drug use which would prevent venous access for PET
                  tracer injection.

               6. Severe motor problems that prevent the subject from lying still for PET and MRI.

               7. Subjects who complain of chronic pain (eg, as the result of rheumatoid
                  arthritis).

          <description>Mean (±SD) Serotonin 5-HT1A Receptor Occupancy Using the Radiotracer [11C]CUMI101 in high dose only. In cohorts 1, 2 and 3, the binding of brexpiprazole to the 5-HT1A receptors was assessed by comparing the binding potential from the Baseline scan (prior to treatment) to that of Day 10 (after treatment). The 5-HT1A receptors following administration of a 4-mg dose of brexpiprazole was assessed and the occupancy estimates were averaged across brain regions 4 hours post-last dose on Day 10.</description>

        <description>The AIMS Scale was an extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) rating scale. The AIMS is a 12 item scale. The first 10 items e.g. facial and oral movements (items 1-4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), trunk movements (item 7), investigators global assessment of dyskinesia (items 8 to 10). The first 10 items are rated from 0 to 4 (0=best, 4=worst). Items 11 and 12, related to dental status, have dichotomous responses, 0=no and 1=yes. The AIMS Total Score is the sum of the ratings for the first seven items. The possible total scores are from 0 to 28, with a higher score indicating worse outcome. Last Visit is the last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>

        <description>The BARS consisted of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia by the study physician, subjective feelings of restlessness by the participant, participant distress due to akathisia, and global evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items were rated on a 4-point scale, with a score of 0 = absence of symptoms and a score of 3 = severe condition. The global clinical evaluation were made on a 6-point scale, (0=absent, 1=questionable, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=marked, 5=severe). To complete this scale, participants were observed while they were seated and then stood for a minimum of 2 minutes in each position. Symptoms observed in other situations (e.g., while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity on the ward) may also be rated. Subjective phenomena were to be elicited by direct questioning. The BARS total score (when combined) ranged from 0 to 18, with higher values indicating a severe condition.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Reported at Least One Occurrence of Suicidality, Suicidal Behavior and Suicidal Ideation on the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</title>
        <description>The C-SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. Suicidality was defined as reporting at least one occurrence of any suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior was defined as reporting any type of suicidal behaviors (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and preparatory acts or behavior). The suicidal ideation intensity total score is the sum of intensity scores of 5 items (frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons for ideation). The score of each intensity item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (worst) which leads to the range of the total score from 0 to 25, with a higher score indicating a worse outcome. A missing score of any item resulted in a missing total score. If no suicidal ideation was reported, a score of 0 was given to the intensity scale. Last Visit is last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline in PANSS Negative Subscale Score</title>
          <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 (absence of symptoms) and a score of 7 (extremely severe symptoms). The PANSS negative subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 negative scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 negative symptom constructs: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, stereotyped thinking. The PANSS Negative Subscale ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms). Last Visit is the last scheduled post-baseline evaluation including early termination evaluation.</description>
