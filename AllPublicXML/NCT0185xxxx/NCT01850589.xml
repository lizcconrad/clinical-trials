      The aim of this study is to prove that the use of Bupropion with counseling works better than
      counseling alone for patients to quit smoking. The belief is that overall, there is a small
      percentage of patients who quit smoking all together.

      The objective of the current investigation is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intensive
      verses conservative smoking cessation program in patients with peripheral arterial disease in
      an outpatient setting.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients with confirmed peripheral arterial disease (PAD), defined as at least one
             of the following criteria, during the initial Vascular Surgery Office exam and review
             of the patient's medical record:

               1. Ankle-brachial index of &lt;.90 in at least 1 lower extremity.

               2. Toe-brachial index of &lt;.60

               3. Objective evidence of arterial occlusive disease in 1 lower extremity by duplex
                  ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomographic
                  angiography

               4. prior leg arterial revascularization or amputation due to PAD

          2. Patients have to smoke with a minimum of 10 cigarettes per day for a minimum of 5
             years.

          3. Patients must be able to give informed written consent and be at least 18 years of
             age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women: Smoking Cessation Program medication Chantix (varenicline), Zyban
             (bupropion) has been shown to cause decreased fertility and decrease fetal weight in
             animal study offspring.

          2. Patients less than 18 years of age: Safe and effective use in children has not been
             established with Chantix (varenicline) and Zyban (bupropion). These medications are
             not approved for use in individuals less than 18 years of old.

          3. Patients with a history of a seizure disorder. Zyban (bupropion) is contraindicated in
             patients with preexisting seizure disorder.

          4. Patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Patients with these
             eating disorders have been shown to have an increased incidence of seizures and Zyban
             (bupropion) is contraindicated in patients with a history or anorexia nervosa and
             bulimia nervosa.

          5. The use bupropion concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including
             drugs with MAOI-like activity is contraindicated. Studies with animals indicate that
             bupropion-induced adverse reaction and toxicity appear to be enhanced by these
             medications.

          6. Patients with renal insufficiency;defined as having a Creatinine Clearance (CrCl)
             &lt;=50mL/min. Chantix is substantially excreted by the kidneys and the risk of toxic
             reactions are greater in patients with impaired renal function. Creatinine Clearance
             =[(140-age(yr)]*weight(kg)]/[72*serumCr(mg/dL)].

          7. Patients with hepatic insufficiency; defined as having elevated liver function tests
             (serum aminotransferases) greater than 1.5 baseline. Zyban is metabolized in the
             liver. Half-lives of bupropion and/or its major metabolites are prolonged in patients
             with liver disease.

          8. Patients with vascular pathology other than PAD (Carotid atherosclerosis, abdominal
             aortic aneurysms, venous insufficiency).

          9. Subjects with a history of psychiatric illness requiring current treatment with
             psychoactive medications, a history of dependence on alcohol or non nicotine substance
             in the past year or current use of tobacco products other than cigarettes.
