      To evaluate the efficacy and performance in an all-comers contemporary population of the
      ABSORB bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) strategy versus the XIENCE family (XIENCE PRIME
      or XIENCE Xpedition) everolimus eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of coronary
      lesions.

    <textblock>
      The AIDA trial is a prospective, randomized (1:1), active control, single blinded,
      four-center, all-comers, non-inferiority trial. A total of 1845 patients were enrolled. The
      study population includes both simple and complex lesions, as well as stable and acute
      coronary syndrome patients. The follow-up will continue for 5 years including clinical
      endpoint characteristics.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is an acceptable candidate for treatment with a drug-eluting stent in
             accordance with the applicable guidelines on percutaneous coronary interventions and
             the Instructions for Use of the ABSORB BVS strategy and XIENCE family.

          -  Subject is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment
             alternatives of receiving the ABSORB BVS strategy and he/she or his/her legally
             authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any Clinical
             Investigation related procedure, as approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is younger than 18 years of age

          -  Subject has a true bifurcation lesion where a priori two scaffold/stent strategy is
             planned.

          -  Unsuccessful predilation of one or more of the planned lesion to be treated.

          -  Planned treatment of in-stent restenosis of a previously placed metallic stent.

          -  Subject has one or more lesion planned to be treated with a scaffold/stent diameter
             size smaller than 2.5 mm or greater than 4.0 mm.

          -  Subject has one or more lesion planned to be treated with a stent/scaffold length
             greater than 70 mm and/or overlapping of four or more scaffolds/stents.

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and

             prasugrel and ticagrelor, inclusive), everolimus, poly (L-lactide), poly (DL-lactide),
             cobalt, chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          -  Subjects pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to
             2 years following index procedure. (Female subjects of child-bearing potential must

             contraception must be used during participation in this trial)

          -  Subjects with a limited life expectancy less than one year.

          -  Subjects with factors that impede clinical follow-up (e.g. no fixed abode).

          -  Subject is already participating in another clinical investigation that has not yet
             reached its primary endpoint.

          -  Subject is belonging to a vulnerable population (per investigator's judgment, e.g.,
