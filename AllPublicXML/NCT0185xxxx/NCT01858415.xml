  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TriPollar is intended for non invasive treatment of facial wrinkles and rhytides. This
      study was designed in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the TriPollar.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TriPollar technology is based on three or more electrodes designed to deliver RF current
      focused into the skin, thus generating heat in the dermal layer. Selective and focused
      electro-heating of the skin is intended to stimulate collagen remodeling in the dermal layer
      resulting in non invasive wrinkle treatment.
