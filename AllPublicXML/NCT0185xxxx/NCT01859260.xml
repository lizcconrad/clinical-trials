    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and undertreated condition in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (CKD). Both physiologic and empiric data suggest that renal hypoxia due to OSA
      is associated with worsening kidney function. Hospitalized patients are often exposed to
      multiple nephrotoxins such as antibiotics, contrast agents, and diuretics, which place them
      at risk for acute worsening of kidney function. This study aims to determine whether
      immediate diagnosis and treatment of OSA in CKD patients will decrease the incidence of acute
      kidney injury during hospitalization. The investigators will evaluate the extent to which
      this effect can be attributed to a decrease in nocturnal hypoxia and improved blood pressure
      control. Secondary endpoints include hospital length of stay, and a composite outcome
      comprised of hemodialysis initiation, major cardiovascular events, and mortality.
