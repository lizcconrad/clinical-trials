      This study will help determine whether the occurrence of adverse events can be decreased by
      moving to a bi-weekly, opposed to a weekly, dosing schedule of gemcitabine plus nab-Pacitaxel
      for the treatment of unresectable/metastatic pancreatic cancer.

          2. Previous use of any chemotherapy or radiation therapy for metastatic disease.

          3. Patient has known brain metastases, unless previously treated and well-controlled for
             at least 3 months (defined as clinically stable, no edema, no steroids and stable in 2
             scans at least 4 weeks apart).

          8. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery within 4 weeks of study entry.

          9. Patient requires a legal authorized representative for consenting.
