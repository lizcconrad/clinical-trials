  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test a potential new kind of anti-cancer treatment, called
      PRAME immunotherapy in resected patients with lung cancer.

      As of 18 July 2014, the recruitment was stopped prematurely and the study was unblinded. Only
      patients on active treatment will have the option to continue in the study. Patients
      randomised to the Placebo group were withdrawn.

      There will no longer be an active follow-up of patients after discontinuation or completion
      of the treatment. The study will end 30 days after the last dose will be administered.

      As a result, primary and secondary objectives will not be assessed as planned. All clinical
      and safety data collected in the study will be analysed descriptively. For each biological
      sample already collected in the scope of this study and not tested yet, testing will not be
      performed by default, except if a scientific rationale remains relevant despite the premature
      termination of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the treatment period, safety monitoring will continue as initially foreseen. Reporting
      of post-study adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) will continue as per protocol. In
      the best interest of the patient, no more biological samples for protocol research purposes
      (i.e. serum sampling for humoral immunity, whole blood sampling for pharmacogenetics) will be
      taken.
