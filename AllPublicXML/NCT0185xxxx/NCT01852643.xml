    <textblock>
      Most of the studies performed to compare the present techniques of rhinoplasty have been
      based on the clinical examination and change of postoperative complaints that cannot be very
      precise in evaluating the advantages of one technique over another. Therefore, in this study
      the investigators are going to compare the efficacy of spreader graft and lateral crural
      overlay techniques by an objective method, rhinomanometry.

    <description>Rhinomanometry is performed by a technician in two stages: before surgery and three months after surgery. It is performed in line with the standards suggested by the &quot;Committee Report on Standardization of Rhinomanometry&quot;. After surgery, patients are monitored for one month and rhinomanometry is performed under the same initial conditions after three months. In both stages of rhinomanometry, nasal resistance means are evaluated by Pascal per milliliter per second (Pa/mL/s) and the right and left and total nasal flow indices are evaluated by milliliter per second (mL/s).</description>
