  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an out-patient based prospective, multi-centre, observational post-marketing
      surveillance study amongst internists and cardiologists. In this study, patients with
      essential hypertension and at least one additional risk factor will be included. Patients may
      take any antihypertensive treatment which is approved for cardiovascular protection including
      Micardis 80 mg / Micardis Plus. Patients will be followed over one year in four visits from
      baseline to endpoint with an additional visit before and after the month of Ramadan.

    <measure>Achievement of the JNC 7 Treatment Goals (BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients enrolled in the study who achieve the JNC 7 (the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) treatment goals (blood pressure (BP) &lt;140/90 mmHg) in a primary-care setting at week 52. This variable was derived from the mean sitting blood pressure assessed by the investigators at week 52. To achieve JNC 7 treatment goals, the subject had to satisfy both blood pressure criteria - systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients Achieving JNC 7 Treatment Goals at the End of the 1 Year Treatment Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients enrolled in the study who achieve the JNC 7 (the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure) treatment goals (blood pressure (BP) &lt;140/90 mmHg) in a primary-care setting at the end of the 1 year treatment duration. This variable was derived from the mean sitting blood pressure assessed by the investigators at the end of the 1 year treatment duration. To achieve JNC 7 treatment goals, the subject had to satisfy both blood pressure criteria - systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. At this timepoint, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and/or kidney disease was also taken into account. Subjects with either of the mentioned conditions had to have systolic blood pressure lower than 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg to satisfy JNC 7 treatment goals.</description>

This variable was derived from the mean sitting blood pressure assessed by the investigators at the end of the 1 year treatment duration. To achieve JNC 7 treatment goals, the subject had to satisfy both blood pressure criteria - systolic blood pressure below 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. At this timepoint, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and/or kidney disease was also taken into account. Subjects with either of the mentioned conditions had to have systolic blood pressure lower than 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 80 mm Hg to satisfy JNC 7 treatment goals.</description>
