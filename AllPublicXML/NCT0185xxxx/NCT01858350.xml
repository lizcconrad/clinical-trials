  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a prospective open unblinded clinical four-arm evaluation of
      Complementary and Alternate Medicine (CAM) interventions on children 1-12 years of age who
      were undergoing imaging by Medical Resonance Imaging(MRI) and receiving parenteral sedation.
      Children were assigned to active music therapy, passive music therapy, distraction therapy,
      and no intervention; measures included doses and numbers of sedation medications, time of
      sedation, and salivary levels of the stress hormone cortisol and pro-inflammatory cytokines,
      before and immediately after the intervention was completed. The Time Frame for the outcome
      measures are at the start of the intervention and immediately following the procedure
      (generally about 150 minutes). No further follow up was conducted.

    <time_frame>The Time Frame for the outcome measures are at the start of the intervention and immediately following the procedure (average about 150 minutes). No further follow up was conducted.</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention is performed prior to sedation. Following sedation, the patient undergoes MRI. After the MRI is completed, the amount of sedation given to the patient is recorded. No other follow up is required.</description>

    <time_frame>Saliva samples were collected before the intervention and then after the MRI was performed (average about 150 minutes).</time_frame>
    <description>The aim of this measure was to determine if the interventions changed the levels of salivary cortisol and inflammatory cytokines</description>
