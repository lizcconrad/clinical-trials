  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - TRC102 is a new cancer treatment drug that may help improve the results of chemotherapy. It
      blocks tumor cells' attempts to repair damaged DNA, which may allow chemotherapy to kill the
      cells more easily. Researchers want to see how well it works with temozolomide, a
      chemotherapy drug that is designed to damage tumor cell DNA. These drugs will be given to
      people who have advanced solid tumors or lymphomas that have not responded to earlier
      treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of TRC102 and temozolomide for advanced solid tumors
      and lymphomas.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced solid tumors or lymphomas that have
      not responded to earlier treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Tumor samples may also be collected. The size and location of
           the tumors will be determined with imaging studies.

        -  Participants will take TRC102 and temozolomide for 28-day cycles of treatment. They will
           take temozolomide and TRC 102 by mouth once a day on days 1-5. Participants will keep a
           diary to record doses and any side effects.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Tumor samples
           will also be collected.

        -  Participants will continue their treatment as long as the cancer does not grow and there
           are no severe side effects.

      Background:

      -Base excision repair (BER) of DNA repair pathway has been implicated in resistance to

      both alkylating and antimetabolite chemotherapy.

      -TRC102 (methoxyamine HCl) acts through a novel mechanism to inhibit BER and has

      demonstrated the ability to potentiate the activity of the alkylating agent temozolomide

      (TMZ), in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that TRC102 can be safely co-administered

      with TMZ and would potentiate DNA damage caused by TMZ, resulting in antitumor

      responses.

        -  Based on responses measured during the Phase I portion of the trial, we will further

      explore the efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic colon carcinoma,
      nonsmall

      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and granulosa cell ovarian cancer

      Primary Objective:

      -To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral TRC102

      in combination with oral TMZ in patients with refractory solid tumors

      -Evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of oral TRC102 when administered in

      combination with TMZ.

      -To explore the response rate of this combination in patients with colon cancer, NSCLC,

      and granulosa cell ovarian cancer

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Determine the effects of the study treatment on the level of histone gammaH2AX in
           circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor and correlate the gammaH2AX response in tumor
           and CTCs

        -  Determine the effects of the study treatment on the levels of cleaved caspase 3,
           epithelialmesenchymal transition, and APE in tumor and CTCs

        -  To explore resistance mechanisms to the study drug combination

        -  Determine and characterize the effects of study treatment on erythrocytes

        -  Characterize the clinical presentation of hemolysis observed in earlier study subjects
           and

      explore the possible mechanisms

      -To explore the progression free survival rate of this combination in patients with colon

      cancer, NSCLC, and granulosa cell ovarian cancer

      Eligibility:

      -Phase I: histologically confirmed solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy

      known to prolong survival or for which no standard treatment options exist

      -Phase II: histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon post at least two lines of

      therapy, NSCLC post at least two lines of therapy, or granulosa cell ovarian cancer post at

      least one line of therapy

        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  Healthy adult volunteers greater than or equal to 18 years of age will be consented to
           donate research blood

      Study Design: Phase I

        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial; traditional 3+3 design.

        -  Oral TRC102 and oral TMZ will be administered daily, days 1-5 in 28-day cycles

        -  Once the MTD is established, up to 15 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to

      further evaluate that dose for PK and PD endpoints for evidence of DNA damage and

      apoptosis.

      -During the escalation phase, tumor biopsies will be optional. During the expansion phase,

      (once MTD is reached), mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued in the 15

      additional patients enrolled to further evaluate PD endpoints.

      Phase II

      -This is a 3-arm Simon 2-stage design trial evaluating independently the response rate of

      patients with colon, NSCLC, and granulosa cell ovarian cancer.

        -  Patients with a body surface area (BSA) of greater than or equal to 1.6 m(2) will
           receive 125 mg of TRC 102 and 150 mg/m2 of TMZ PO qday x 5 every 28 days (DL6). Patients
           with a BSA of &lt;1.6 m(2) will receive 100 mg of TRC 102 and 150 mg/m2 of TMZ PO qday x 5
           every 28 days (DL5).. Each cycle will be 28 days.

        -  The accrual ceiling for the Phase II portion is 75 patients.

        -  Mandatory paired tumor biopsies will be pursued to further evaluate PD endpoints.

             this clinical trial. Patients with treated brain metastases, whose brain metastatic
             disease has remained stable for greater than or equal to 4 weeks without requiring
             steroid and anti-seizure medications are eligible to participate.

          -  Phase II only: No other prior malignancies are allowed except for the following:

               -  Adequately managed stage 0 (carcinoma in situ), I, or II basal cell or squamous
                  cell carcinoma from which the patient is currently in complete remission.

               -  Any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for three years.

               -  Adequately managed stage I or II well differentiated thyroid or prostate cancer
                  is also eligible, wherein the patient is not required to be in complete
                  remission.

          -  Phase II only: patients with colorectal cancer with known MSI-high disease who have
