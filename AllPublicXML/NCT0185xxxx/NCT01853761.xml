      The purpose of this study was to analyze microcurrent short and long term effects used with
      aerobic exercise on abdominal fat.

      Nutritional patterns have been changed during XXI century with sugar and fat's high
      proportions that allied to sedentarism increased body fat. There is already a well establish
      relationship between total body fat excess, cardiometabolic diseases and increased mortality,
      knowing that abdominal fat (android pattern), different from body index, presents an
      additional influence to health risks. Women with their abdominal adipocytes (visceral fat)
      show an increased lipolitic activity that releases free fat acids to the systemic and portal
      circulation leading to a metabolic syndrome, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases
      Aerobic exercise is a way to decrease fat as it stimulates lipolysis through an increase in
      catecholamine's level resulting from a sympathetic system nervous activity raise. The most
      used exercise for lipid elimination is the prolonged aerobic moderate exercise with a minimum
      of 30 mn.

      Nevertheless aerobic exercise practice reduce globally lipidic sources and not locally .
      Electrolipolysis using microcurrent has been used in clinical practice as a technique to
      reduce abdominal fat. This technique can be applied transcutaneously or percutaneously
      seeming that the former is not so effective as skin can be an obstacle to the current effect
      on visceral and subcutaneous fat .

      Abdominal fat excess is associated with cardiometabolic diseases and can be prevented using
      microcurrent and aerobic exercise to stimulate lipolysis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>subcutaneous abdominal fat and viceral abdominal fat</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks after the intervencion</time_frame>
    <description>Ultrasound was performed at the end of expiration to measure subcutaneous abdominal fat between xiphoid apophysis and navel, below navel, and above left and right anterior superior iliac spine. Between xiphoid apophysis and navel was also measured visceral abdominal fat</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>bioimpedance values</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks after the intervencion</time_frame>
    <description>The height was measured with the volunteers on respiratory apnea. To minimize the influence of electrolyte balance changes in bioimpedance assessment, was given some rules to volunteers. It was calculated BMI using the body weight divided by height squared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The volunteers were on fasting (12 hours) and was collected a blood sample on finger to measure cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose levels. The results were recorded through the classes</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>perimeters measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks after intervencion</time_frame>
    <description>The perimeters measurements were done, at the end of expiration, at waist level (below last rib), at navel level, at the point immediately above the iliac crests and at trochanters level. The waist-hip ratio was calculated using the waist level perimeter divided by trochanters level perimeter</description>

    <measure>Suprailiac, vertical and horizontal abdominal skinfolds</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks after intervencion</time_frame>
