      The aim of the the study is to investigate whether Remote Ischaemic Conditioning (RIC) can
      improve clinical outcomes (cardiac death and hospitalisation for heart failure) at one year
      in patients presenting with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction and undergoing primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention. This will be done in a multinational investigator-driven,
      multi-centre, randomised, controlled, single-blind, parallel assignment, prospective clinical
      efficacy trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in Denmark and Europe, accounting
      for 1.92 million deaths in Europe per year: over one in five men (21%) and one in five women
      (22%) die from CHD.

      Patients presenting with a ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)have despite advanced
      treatment with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) a significant mortality and
      morbidity at one year with 17.4% of patients dying from a cardiovascular cause or being
      hospitalised from heart failure.

      Remote Ischaemic Conditioning (RIC) applied at the time of myocardial reperfusion can reduce
      myocardial infarct size, confirming the existence of myocardial reperfusion injury. In this
      respect, RIC has been shown to limit myocardial infarct size and preserve cardiac function in
      STEMI patients undergoing pPCI.

      RIC is performed in the ambulance during transport to the PCI unit by cycles of inflations of
      a blood pressure cuff to induce four 5-minute cycles of limb ischaemia and reperfusion. The
      method is virtually cost-free non-pharmacological and non-invasive therapeutic strategy.

      Hypothesis:

      RIC followed by pPCI improves clinical outcomes in STEMI patients when compared to STEMI
      controls undergoing standard pPCI evaluated one year post PCI.

      Trial Design and aim:

      Multinational investigator-driven, multi-centre, randomized, controlled, single-blind
      (Outcomes Assessor), parallel assignment, prospective clinical efficacy trial. A total of
      2600 patients are to be included over a 36 months period.

      Overall primary objective To determine whether RIC improves clinical outcomes (Cardiac
      mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure) at one year in 2600 STEMI patients
      undergoing pPCI.

      Secondary objectives:

      To determine, in the pre-specified subgroups, whether age, gender, diabetes, and duration of
      chest pain to PCI influence the response to RIC.

      To determine whether RIC preserves left ventricular function measured by echocardiography
      after three months post pPCI.

      Study progress The patient will be informed and treated according to the national and
      international guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and protected under the Act concerning
      the processing of personal data and health law.

      The admitting ambulance doctor or doctor at the receiving hospital will orally inform the
      patient and hand out the approved short written information. After information is given in
      the acute phase the patient does not have much time for reflection before signing the
      informed consent form.

      Therefore a full written information and additional oral information will be given to the
      patient after the acute phase by a study nurse or the doctor performing the pPCI. As well
      during the first and second stage of information it will be emphasised that the patient has
      the right to withdraw his/her informed consent at any time.

      After informed consent is obtained the patient will be randomised via a secure web-site to
      either pPCI with or without RIC by the the doctor on duty at the receiving hospitals.
      Computer-generated blocked randomisation lists, stratified by centre, will be prepared in
      advance of the study.

      pPCI incl. the use of stents and antithrombotic regimens will be performed according to
      standard procedures at the treating hospital.

      Blood samples (acute, 6-8, 24 and 48-72 hours after pPCI will be drawn during the acute phase
      at the treating hospital or at the local hospital.

      Three days after pPCI an echocardiography (ECCO) will be performed at the hospital. Further
      three months after pPCI an ECCO will be performed at the hospital.

      Information regarding re-hospitalisation or death will be drawn from electronic patient
      chart.

      Benefit of the study Potential benefits: Participating patients will be offered an extra
      clinical out patient control, incl. an echocardiography three months after pPCI.

      Disadvantage: In relation to the inflation of the blood pressure cuff temporary moderate
      pains in the treated arm might occur. Otherwise, the RIC has previously been proven to be
      without side effects.

      An extra blood sampling of app. 15 ml will be drawn 48-72 hours after pPCI. A small but
      insignificant risk of local infection in relation to this is a risk.
