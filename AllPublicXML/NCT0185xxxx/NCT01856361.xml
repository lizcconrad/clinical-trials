  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of ramipril in stimulating and
      promoting sperm production in men with low sperm count. Ramipril is an Angiotensin Converting
      Enzyme Inhibitor (ACEI) currently used to treat high blood pressure. However, previous
      studies have shown that this class of medications can improve sperm parameters. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ramipril compared to placebo (Substance That is
      not known to have treatment effect), in improving sperm density in infertile men with
      documented low sperm count. This study will help us identify subjects that might benefit from
      treatment with this medication, and the effect it will have on sperm count, shape, and
      motility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately half of all infertility problems are caused by male factors. These men account
      for 17% of patients at the primary health care level that seek help for infertility.
      Oligospermia (Low sperm count) of unknown cause occurs in up to 60% of men with unexplained
      infertility. Certain group of patients with oligospermia can father children, but those with
      infertility have long posed a major therapeutic challenge. A variety of empirical
      non-specific treatments have been used, in attempt to improve their semen characteristics and
      fertility. In the past, androgens were suggested as a treatment; however, exogenous
      testosterone was found to exert negative feedback on the pituitary-gonadal axis and thereby
      suppresses Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH) secretion then
      adversely affects sperm production. Other treatment modalities like clomiphene citrate,
      tamoxifen, recombinant FSH, zinc, selenium, and L-carnitine have been tried with minimal
      success. In the present study we are proposing the use of an angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor (ACEI) for the treatment of oligospermia. A recently published pilot study showed
      that the use of lisinopril improved sperm quantity and quality in oligospermic men. ACEI are
      inexpensive, safe, widely available, and, if effective in improving sperm production and
      quality, could avert couples from undergoing invasive procedures.
