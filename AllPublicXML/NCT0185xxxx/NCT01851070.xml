    <textblock>
      Study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose escalating study. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of a single
      intravenous infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) compared to placebo at
      12 weeks post-infusion in the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who
      have received methotrexate +/- other DMARDs for at least 6 months prior to screening and who
      have had an incomplete response to at least one TNF-alpha inhibitor.

    <description>To evaluate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of a single intravenous (IV) infusion of allogeneic mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs) compared to placebo at 12 weeks post-infusion in the treatment of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have received methotrexate +/- other oral DMARDs for at least 4 months and who have had an incomplete response to at least one course of a TNFα inhibitor.
Overall safety will be based on the overall assessment of AE/SAEs, Vital Signs, Physical Examination, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs and Chest x-ray.</description>

Safety will be assessed according to the following:
Adverse events/serious adverse events (&quot;primary endpoint&quot;)
Vital signs
Physical examination
Clinical laboratory tests
Electrocardiogram
Chest x-ray (CXR)
Efficacy will be assessed according to the following:
ACR20/50/70
DAS28 (mean changes from baseline as measured by using hsCRP and ESR)
Mean changes from baseline in all components of the ACR core response criteria
Remissions (as defined in the 2011 Joint Statement of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
Joint erosion of hands and wrists assessed via x-ray
