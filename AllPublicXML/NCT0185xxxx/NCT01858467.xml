  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LMA Supreme (SLMA) is a single-use supraglottic device that provides a good seal for
      positive pressure ventilation and good first attempt insertion rate of 98% in low-risk
      patients undergoing Caesarean section. It has a double aperture design that facilitates the
      introduction of an orogastric tube to aspirate gastric contents. The current practice is to
      use endotracheal intubation with rapid sequence induction in general anaesthesia for
      Caesarean section.

      The primary study hypothesis is the first attempt insertion success rate of SLMA and
      endotracheal intubation are equivalent with a difference of less than 3%.

      We propose a randomised controlled trial to study the first attempt insertion success rate of
      supreme LMA versus endotracheal intubation in general anaesthesia for elective Caesarean
      section.
