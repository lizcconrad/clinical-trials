    <textblock>

      mental health service resources, teachers' knowledge about child mental health, and teachers'
      classroom behavioral management and parent involvement skills.

    <textblock>
      Participating schools are randomly assigned to a 6-month long school-based intervention or to
      a wait-list control group. The intervention focuses on improving teacher's classroom
      behavioral management practices, parent engagement, and child mental health knowledge.

      Teachers are assessed at the beginning and the end of the study, and again after 6 months of
      intervention. Teachers' parent engagement, mental health knowledge, and behavioral practices
      in the classroom are assessed through observations and teacher ratings.
