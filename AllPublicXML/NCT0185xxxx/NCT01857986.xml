    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of the AnapnoGaurd 100 system relative to
      standard of care (SOC) Control, in the course of mechanical ventilation and intubation. The
      main effectiveness aspect of this trial is the AnapnoGaurd 100's ability to reduce leaks
      between the endotracheal tube and the trachea walls as a result of the cuff pressure
      management. Since the primary outcome can't be measured by any method other than the
      investigational device, the study groups will be treated as follows:

        -  The Treatment group in this study will be treated with the fully functional AnapnoGaurd
           100 device (per its intended use),

        -  The Control group will be treated with the AnapnoGuard device, where the cuff control
           will be disabled (off) and the cuff management will be done according to SOC.

      Effectiveness will be measured by the duration and level of carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage
      around the endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff, from the lungs to the subglottic space and safety
      will be measured by adverse events (AEs).

    <measure>CO2 Leakage Above the ETT Cuff, Measured Over Time.</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will be followed for the duration of endotracheal intubation, an expected average of 4 days</time_frame>
    <description>Trial outcome measure represents patients' exposure to CO2 leakage standardized per hour. Specifically, each patients' area under the curve (AUC) of CO2 leakage (mmHg) is computed over the whole trial by multiplying leakage duration (X-axis; continuous time) by CO2 level (Y-axis; mmHg), divided by the patient's number of hours in the trial. Outcome measure is thus [CO2 mmHg*hour]/hour.
CO2 leakage is the concentration of CO2 above the cuff as measured by the AG100 system every few minutes (in clinical mode). Time points which created the curve were every two adjacent time intervals having a valid CO2 reading.</description>

        <description>Trial outcome measure represents patients’ exposure to CO2 leakage standardized per hour. Specifically, each patients’ area under the curve (AUC) of CO2 leakage (mmHg) is computed over the whole trial by multiplying leakage duration (X-axis; continuous time) by CO2 level (Y-axis; mmHg), divided by the patient’s number of hours in the trial. Outcome measure is thus [CO2 mmHg*hour]/hour.
CO2 leakage is the concentration of CO2 above the cuff as measured by the AG100 system every few minutes (in clinical mode). Time points which created the curve were every two adjacent time intervals having a valid CO2 reading.</description>
