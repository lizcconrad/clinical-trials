  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment for tongue cancer. However, surgery-induced
      immunosuppression has been implicated in the development of post-operative septic
      complications and neoplasm metastasis. General anesthesia is considered to not only suppress
      surgical stress, but also affect the immune function directlyï¼Œsuch as altering the number and
      activity of immune cells. It is reported that some anesthetics increase susceptibility to
      tumor metastasis, apparently by suppressing natural killer cell activity. Different
      anesthetic techniques and anesthetics used in anesthesia have shown different effects on
      immunity. Many of the studies were animal trials or performed in vitro; in addition, most are
      focused on a single drug. To date, there is little published prospective clinical research
      designed specifically to investigate the effects of different general anesthetic technique on
      immune function in patients with oral malignant tumors. The aim of this study is going to
      characterize the immune response of patients undergoing surgery for tongue cancer under 3
      types of general anesthesia.
