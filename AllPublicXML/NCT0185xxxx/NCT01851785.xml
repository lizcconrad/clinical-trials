  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled design will be utilized to examine and compare the effectiveness of
      the proposed educational intervention, which includes an educational decision aid with
      attention control on select key patient-centered and process of care outcomes. The study
      sample will consist of approximately 300 African-American patients with osteoarthritis (OA)
      of the knee. Patients will be recruited from Pennsylvania Presbyterian Medical Center and the
      Philadelphia VA Medical Center and will be randomized to one of the two study arms.

      The immediate goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a
      high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered educational intervention on African American
      patient preferences, expectations, and the likelihood of receiving a recommendation for knee
      joint replacement surgery when clinically indicated. The long-term goal of this research is
      to implement effective strategies to improve minority patients' access to joint replacement
      and ultimately eliminate racial disparities in the utilization of this effective treatment
      for knee OA.

      Study Aim: To examine the effect of the decision aid (DA) intervention on the likelihood of
      receiving a recommendation for knee joint replacement when clinically indicated. Hypothesis:
      The DA intervention will lead to higher rate of treatment recommendation within 6 months.

      Secondary Aim: To examine the effect of the DA intervention on the rate of knee replacement
      receipt within 12 months. Hypothesis: Patients randomized to receive the intervention will
      undergo knee replacement within 12 months at a higher rate than those in the attention
      control group.

      The study involves a baseline questionnaire, educational intervention, and follow-up
      questionnaire by phone 12 months after the intervention takes place. All eligible, consented
      patients will complete the baseline questionnaire, conducted by an ACTION research staff
      member. The baseline questionnaire (attached at end of protocol) will include the following
      instruments that have been field-tested by our team in previous and ongoing studies: 1.)
      Willingness to Consider Joint Replacement Question 2.)Knowledge Regarding Knee OA and Joint
      Replacement (developed by The Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making) 3.) Hospital
      for Special Surgery Knee Expectations Survey 4.)Socioeconomic Survey 5.) Access to Health
      Care, Charleson Comorbidity Index 6.) Quality of Life SF-12v2. This survey can be done over
      the phone or in person. It should take approximately 30-40 minutes. At the completion of the
      baseline questionnaire, patients will be randomized into either study Decision Aid (DA)
      (hereafter referred to as DA intervention) arm or the attention control arm. Patient
      appointments for the DA intervention or attention control activity will be scheduled to occur
      2 weeks prior to the patients appointment with an orthopedic specialist (up to the date of
      the appointment). The DA intervention (referred to as an information session in patient
      material) will be completed by an ACTION research study interventionist (the interventionist
      will not administer the baseline assessment). In the intervention arm, patients will be shown
      a decision aid video entitled, Treatment Choices for Knee Osteoarthritis. The patients are
      then given a brief education intervention called AskMe3, which is a brief communication
      skill-building intervention developed by the Partnership for Clear Health Communication.
      AskMe3 instructs patients 3 questions to ask their doctor: a) what is my main problem b) what
      do I need to do c) why is it important for me to do this? The completion time for the
      educational intervention will be approximately 1 hour. The attention control arm will be
      conducted by the ACTION research staff. Patients will be given written educational material
      adapted from the NIH/NIAMS publication Osteoarthritis to review at his/her leisure. (A copy
      of the information contained in the informational pamphlet is attached at end of protocol).
      The completion time for the attention control arm is approximately 10 minutes. Follow-up
      procedures will occur at the following time points: 1.) approximately 6 months after the
      participants intervention, an ACTION team staff member will review their medical chart to see
      if the participant had knee joint replacement surgery 2.)12-months post intervention
      participants will be contacted to find out if they had knee joint replacement surgery and a
      medical chart assessment will occur at this time as well. All follow-up procedures will be
      administered by an ACTION research team member that was not involved in the educational
      intervention. Participants in both the DA intervention and the attention control will
      complete a 12-month follow-up (completed approximately 12 months post intervention)survey
      over the phone. The survey will be comprised of the following: Willingness to consider joint
      replacement, Hospital for Special Surgery Knee Expectations Survey, Knowledge Regarding Knee
      OA and Joint Replacement, and a survey regarding surgery for joint replacement. At the time
      of the 12-month follow-up, the patient's medical record will be accessed to check for a joint
      replacement procedure.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the attention control arm will receive an educational program (an NIH-developed booklet) that summarizes how to live with knee OA but does not specifically mention joint replacement. This booklet provides information about OA, examples of exercises one could do to improve pain and reduce stiffness, types of non-drug pain relief such as massage, and information about various medications. The interventionist will give the participant the booklet and describe what can be found inside. They are also encouraged to ask their doctor any questions they may have about the information in the booklet or questions they may have about their OA. The purpose of this educational program is to provide a tangible clinical incentive to the control group for participating in this additional component of the study.</description>
