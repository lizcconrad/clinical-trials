    <textblock>
      Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The pathogenesis fo PGF was poorly
      understood. Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest was effective for some patients with
      PGF in our preliminary study. This present study aimed to explore the efficacy of peripheral
      cell harvest for poor graft function.

      Poor graft function (PGF) is a common complication after allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation, which was associated with high mortality. The pathogenesis fo PGF was poorly
      understood. Infusion of donor peripheral cell harvest was effective for some patients with
      PGF in our preliminary study.The peripheral cell harvest was aphaeresis on the fourth or
      fifth day after mobilization with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor.
      Hematogical response was assessed at 30 days after infusion. Good response was defined as
      neutrophil &gt; 1.0×109/l without G-CSF support for at least 3 consecutive days, and persistent
      platelet &gt;20×109/l without transfusion for at least 7 days. Otherwise, poor response was
      defined.
