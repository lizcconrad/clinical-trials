      The aim of the study was to compare the new approach and the retromandibular approach, so
      that the therapeutic effect and the advantages of the new approach would be clear.

      Sixty patients (72 sides) with medial or low condylar fractures were treated with surgical
      intervention. Thirty-six patients (42 sides) were treated with minor parotid anterior
      approach, and the other 24 patients (30 sides) were treated with retromandibular approach.
      The data about the operations and complications were recorded. The follow-up periods were
      3-12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1)clinical and imaging diagnosis of medial or low condylar fractures

          -  (2)bone fragments that were obviously dislocated, that affected patients appearance
             and function, requiring surgical intervention

          -  (3)no previous surgical treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1)medial or low condylar fractures without obvious displacement

          -  (2)patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful surgery

          -  (3)the surgical site had traumatic scar, so the approach could be carried out on the
             original incision
