  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) is a treatable and a common disease of the
      elderly. The overall objective of this work is to describe cardio- and cerebrovascular risk
      factors and vascular disease in shunted INPH-patients compared to an age- and sex matched
      elderly population, as well as the impact of vascular risk factors and vascular co-morbidity
      on clinical symptoms and outcome of surgery in INPH-patients. The hypothesis is that
      INPH-patients have a higher level of vascular risk factors and subclinical organ damage than
      a normal elderly population, and that the higher the level of existing vascular risk factors,
      the more severe the symptoms of the hydrocephalic disease.

    <description>Enrollment of participants 2010-2012. First, all participants complete a questionnaire, second they go to their local health care center or nearby hospital for measurements and blood samples. The visit at the health care center/hospital is within a couple of months. Participants are not followed further (cross-sectional study). Analyses performed 2013-2014.
