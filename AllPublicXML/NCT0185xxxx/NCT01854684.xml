      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of photodynamic therapy during
      surgery in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that can be removed by surgery.
      Photodynamic therapy uses a drug, such as temoporfin, that becomes active when it is exposed
      to a certain kind of light. When the drug is active, cancer cells are killed. This may be a
      better way to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that intraoperative adjuvant regional photodynamic therapy with low-dose
      temoporfin is safe.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Initial assessment of efficacy (i.e., 2-year disease free survival). II. To investigate
      the relationship between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) levels,
      measured light dose and the clinical outcome.

      III. Correlate the serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites (25-hydroxyvitarnin D3 and
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) with the presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis at the time of
      surgical resection.

      IV. To measure temoporfin uptake in malignant and normal tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of photodynamic therapy with temoporfin.

      Patients receive temoporfin intravenously (IV) over no less than 6 minutes and then undergo
      standard surgical resection with intraoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
