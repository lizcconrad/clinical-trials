      To estimate the I-year progression-free survival probability in patients up to 70 years of
      age with previously untreated diffuse large B-celllymphoma (DLBCL), or with intermediate
      (Burkitt-like) lymphoma, whose tumor cells show MYC rearrangement, and who are treated with
      alternating cycles of Rituximab-HCV AD and Rituximab-Methotrexate-Cytarabine, in concert with
      optimal supportive treatment including Pegfilgrastim, prophylactic antimicrobials, and close
      clinical follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or intermediate (&quot;Burkitt-like&quot;) lymphoma, newly
             diagnosed from an excisional biopsy or from a large core biopsy with sufficient
             diagnostic material to perform genetic testing for MYC-R.

          2. Positivity for MYC-R by Fluorescent in-situ Hybridization (FISH) or by classical
             cytogenetics.

          3. No prior lymphoma treatment, with one exception: One cycle of R-CHOP regimen is
             permitted (consisting of one single dose each of Rituximab, of cyclophosphamide, of
             doxorubicine, and of vincristine, as well as up to 5 doses of Prednisone when part of
             chemotherapy).

          4. No prior radiation therapy is permitted

          5. Age ≥ 18 years to 70 years of age

          6. CT imaging of neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to registration.
             Any additional imaging used to assess extent of disease must also have been done
             within 28 days prior to registration

          7. Bidimensionally measurable disease by imaging within 28 days prior to registration

          8. Adequate bone marrow biopsy, and aspiration performed for staging within 28 days
             before registration, and before start of any treatment

          9. Indication for primary treatment with systemic multiagent chemotherapy

         10. Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL and estimated (Cockroft-Gault) creatinine clearance&gt; 50 ml/min
             within 7 days prior to registration

         11. Cardiac ejection fraction of ≥ 50% by MUGA scan or by 2-D echocardiogram , as well as
             EKG without significant abnormality within 28 days prior to registration

         12. Performance status of 0, of 1, or of 2 (ECOG scale)

         13. Patient willing to have, and to maintain, a central venous line throughout the
             treatment phase (either PICC line, or double lumen tunnelled catheter, or double lumen
             subcutaneous venous port system)

         14. Willing and logistically able to be followed as outpatient at least twice weekly,
             during the treatment phase.

         15. Signed informed consent to accept transfusion of blood products as medically indicated

             7 days prior to registration

          5. Patients with bone marrow involvement and either ANC &lt; 1000/uLor Platelets &lt;
             50,000/uL, within 7 days before registration

          6. Patients without bone marrow involvement by lymphoma, and either ANC &lt; 1500/uL or
             Platelets &lt; 100,000/uL within 7 days before registration

          7. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, with sickle cell disease, or with transfusion
             dependence for over 6 months antedating the diagnosis oflymphoma.

          8. Known hypersensitivity to E. coli derived proteins

          9. Patients at risk of reactivation of hepatitis B who are unwilling to be treated with

             use effective contraceptive method from study start to one year after the last dose of
             protocol therapy. Adequate contraception is defined as hormonal birth control,
             intrauterine device, double barrier method, or total abstinence.

         11. Additional or prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell
