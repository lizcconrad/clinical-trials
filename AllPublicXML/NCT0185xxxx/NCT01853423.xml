      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 0.1% formulation of
      rapamune cream in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), ages 3 years and older, who
      have facial angiofibromas that would benefit from treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, prospective single center study. Patients that are seen in our
      regional Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Clinic and have facial angiofibromas that would benefit
      from this cream and who wish to be involved in this study would be enrolled. We anticipate
      enrolling 12-15 patients the first year. Patients will have pictures of their facial
      angiofibromas taken immediately prior to entry into the study. They will then be prescribed
      0.1% rapamune topical formulation to apply twice daily to their skin for the first two weeks
      and then once daily. If level is above 0, will re-check serum lipids, cbc, and repeat levels
      every three-four months and monitor the patient for symptoms. Patients will return at one
      month and three months to obtain serum rapamune levels along with pictures, then they will be
      seen intermittently throughout the first year with photographs of their face taken at the one
      month visit, 3 month visit, six month visit and twelve month visit. We will ask the parents
      about any side effects from the medication during the entire time patients are using the
      topical rapamune. We will monitor the facial lesions as well. We will assess for skin
      sensitivity, pain, erythema, or pruritus. If skin irritation results from the drug, then we
      will stop use of the drug. Parents will sign an informed consent allowing their child's
      picture to be taken and allowing us to summarize the data for publication at the end of this
      study.

      This study will be the first study using a consistent formulation to make a 0.1% rapamune
      cream, and this will be performed under the direction of myself and Dr. Almoazen in the
      University of Tennessee Health Science Center(UTHSC) College of Pharmacy compounding
      laboratory. Only patients who are thought to be reliable for the follow up visits and to use
      the cream appropriately will be enrolled in the study. This study meets the FDA criteria for
      an Investigational New Drug(IND) exemption.

      The adverse events noted in the package insert for rapamune cream are all based on systemic
      administration of the medication, primarily to adults with other diseases. In our clinical
      experience, with topical use there is no absorption and we have not noted any side effects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient or his / her legally authorize representative (LAR) must sign and date the
             approved informed consent prior to study participation or initiation of study
             procedures. If appropriate, the patient will give written or verbal consent. Surrogate
             consent will be obtained utilizing the &quot;legally authorized representative (LAR)&quot;. The

             is familiar with the subject's personal values, who is reasonably available, and who
             is willing to serve. No person who is identified as a protective order or other court
             order that directs that person to avoid contact with the subject shall be eligible to
             serve as the subject's LAR. Identification of LAR should normally be made using the
             following order of descending preference: Conservator, guardian, attorney in fact,
             subject's spouse (unless legally separated), the subject's adult child, the subject's
             parent, the subject's adult sibling, any other adult relative of the subject, or other

             and who is willing to serve.

               1. Patient must have a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.

               2. Female or male patients over the age of 3 years.

               3. Female subjects of child bearing potential must not be pregnant and must undergo

               1. Patient has a history of drug allergy to rapamune.

               2. Patient is pregnant or lactating.

               3. Subject is receiving therapy with Rapamycin.

               4. Subject is receiving any form of immunosuppression or has previously experienced
                  immune dysfunction.

               5. Subject is currently participating in or has participated within the Last 30 days
                  in a clinical trial involving an investigative drug.

               6. Subject has other dermatologic conditions that would preclude or prevent adequate
                  assessment of changes to their facial angiofibromas.

               7. Subject has had laser surgery, cryotherapy, or other dermatologic treatment to
