  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the pain experienced by patients undergoing orthodontic treatment
      with Invisalign ® corrective aligners with that of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment
      with conventional braces. Because the aligners are removable, nearly invisible and don't
      involve metal that can irritate teeth and gums, we are expecting less pain in the Invisalign
      Treatment and less affectation of the quality of life.

      The aims of the study are to determine:

      the presence of pain, the magnitude of pain, the duration of pain, and the location of pain.

      The hypotheses of this study are:

        -  Treatment with Invisalign ® aligners result in less pain than the braces

        -  Treatment with Invisalign ® aligners result in less irritation to the soft tissues with
           braces

        -  Pain should increase each time the aligners are put in the mouse and decrease until
           disappearing on the third day.

        -  The quality of life will be most affected by treatment with braces than with Invisalign
           ®.

        -  Null Hypothesis: There is no difference at all points between the two treatments.
