  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis is a infectious disease that resides in the mucosa surrounding dental
      implants and also affects the supporting bone. Because the number of implants placed in
      everyday clinical practice is continuously increasing, is it reasonable to anticipate an
      increasing prevalence of peri-implantitis. This underlines the necessity for a predictable
      therapy. However, from the literature there is very little reliable evidence suggesting which
      could be the most effective interventions for treating periimplantitis.

      The primary objective of this controlled clinical study is to evaluate the clinical effect of
      decontamination of the implant surface during the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis
      using a 2% chlorhexidine solution or a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution. The secondary objective
      is to assess the microbiological effect of decontamination of the implant surface during the
      surgical treatment of peri-implantitis using a 2% chlorhexidine solution or a 0.12%
      chlorhexidine solution.

      The primary study parameter is the change from baseline in modified bleeding index. Secondary
      study parameters are: change in microbial composition of the biofilm covering the dental
      implant surface; microbiological composition of the peri-implant sulcus; change in probing
      pocket depth;change in suppuration on probing; change in radiographic marginal bone level on
      standardized intraoral radiographs; change in modified plaque index; implant failure, defined
      as implant mobility of previously clinically osseointegrated implants and removal of
      non-mobile implants because of progressive marginal bone loss or infection; complications and
      adverse events. It is hypothesized that decontamination of the implant surface with 2%
      chlorhexidine leads to a greater decrease in modified bleeding index than decontamination
      with a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution.

    <description>Implants with peri-implantitis lesions will be surgically exposed, followed by a mechanical cleansing using curettes and gauzes and cotton pellets soaked in saline and 1 minute of local application of a 2 % chlorhexidine solution. After 1 minute of saline rinsing the gingival flap will be returned slightly apical (in order to reduce pockets) and will be firmly sutured. The surgery is followed by 2 weeks of rinsing with 0.12% chlorhexidine + 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride without alcohol twice daily during 30 seconds.</description>
