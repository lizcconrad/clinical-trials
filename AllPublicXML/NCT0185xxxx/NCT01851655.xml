  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind (subject/evaluator)study. Enrolled patients
      had anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and met criteria for advanced
      rehabilitation. The study included 8 weeks of advanced rehabilitation consisting of low- or
      high-intensity plyometric exercise. The objective of the study was to determine the effect of
      plyometric exercise intensity on knee function and knee cartilage in patients with ACL
      reconstruction.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of the study, investigators will insure patients meet the criteria for advanced
      rehabilitation based on knee motion, pain levels and quadriceps strength.

      Participants will be asked to review the informed consent and consent to the study prior to
      any study procedures. The study will consist of 2 testing sessions and an 8 week intervention
      (2 visits per week) at the UF&amp;Shands Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine Institute. The testing
      sessions will include clinical measures of knee impairments, questionnaires, biomechanical
      analysis and functional performance testing.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Subjective Form Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC subjective form is a measure of self-reported knee function. It includes items related to symptoms and functional activities. Scores range from 0 to 100 points, and higher scores equal higher function. Responses will be recorded on hard-copy and entered into a spreadsheet to calculate the score. The change will be computed as (post-intervention score minus pre-intervention score).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Urinary Concentrations of the C-terminal Crosslinking Telopeptide of Type II Collagen (CTX-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>CTX-II is a biomarker of Type II collagen degradation. Early morning, second-void urine samples will be collected and stored. Concentrations of CTX-II will be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and corrected for creatinine concentration, which will also be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Values will be log-transformed. The change in urinary CTX-II concentration will be computed as (post-intervention value minus pre-intervention value).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Vertical Jump Height.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical jump height will be assessed with the Vertex. The average of three trials will be recorded in cm. The change in vertical jump height will be computed as (post-intervention value minus pre-intervention value).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Ratio of Urinary CTXII to Serum CPII Concentrations.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>CTX-II is a biomarker of Type II articular cartilage degradation. Type II collagen carboxy propeptide (CPII) is a biomarker of Type II collagen synthesis. Early morning urine and blood samples will be collected pre- and post-treatment. Urinary CTX-II will be analyzed as described in Primary Outcomes. Serum CPII will be determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Values of both biomarkers will be log-transformed, and the ratio of CTXII:CPII will be calculated. The change will be computed as (post-intervention CTXII:CPII values minus pre-intervention CTXII:CPII value).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quadriceps Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Knee extensor torque will be measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. The lever arm will move at 60 degrees/second. The peak torque from 5 trials will be obtained and normalized to body weight. The change will be computed as (post-intervention value minus pre-intervention value)</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fear of Movement/Re-injury</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The 11-item version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia will be used to assess kinesiophobia or fear of movement/re-injury. Scores range from 11 to 44 points, and higher scores equal higher fear of movement/re-injury. Responses will be recorded on hard-copy and entered into a spreadsheet to calculate the score. The change will be computed as (post-intervention score minus pre-intervention score).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anterior Knee Laxity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-intervention) to 9 weeks (post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Anterior knee laxity will be assessed with a knee arthrometer and a maximum manual pull. The side-to-side difference will be recorded in mm. The change will be computed as (post-intervention difference minus pre-intervention difference).</description>

        <title>Change in Urinary Concentrations of the C-terminal Crosslinking Telopeptide of Type II Collagen (CTX-II)</title>
        <description>CTX-II is a biomarker of Type II collagen degradation. Early morning, second-void urine samples will be collected and stored. Concentrations of CTX-II will be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and corrected for creatinine concentration, which will also be determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Values will be log-transformed. The change in urinary CTX-II concentration will be computed as (post-intervention value minus pre-intervention value).</description>

          <title>Plyometric Exercise - High Intensity</title>
          <description>The exercises should produce a higher peak vertical ground reaction force than those in the low group based on literature findings (e.g. single leg jumps, jumps from higher heights, higher percent effort).
Plyometric Exercise: Treatment sessions include a combination of running, jumping and agility activities (plyometric exercise). Each rehabilitation session will also include an abbreviated, standardized program of lower extremity strengthening (leg press, machine squats, knee extensions; 3 sets x 10 repetitions each), flexibility (standing gastrocnemius and quadriceps stretch, hamstrings stretch in long-sitting; 2 x 30 seconds each) and proprioception (standing on foam and a tilt board; 3 x 30 seconds each).</description>
