  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to develop a novel pathway to decrease the cost and waiting time
      to manage bariatric surgical patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

      Hypotheses:

      Compared to the current perioperative pathway, the proposed novel pathway incorporating
      overnight oximetry and perioperative sleep apnea precautions is safe and more cost effective
      for evaluating and managing obstructive sleep apnea in the bariatric surgical patients.

      To decrease the cost and waiting time, we proposed a novel perioperative pathway to manage
      obstructive sleep apnea in the bariatric patients. In this pathway, the patient will be
      screened by the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The recruited patients will be randomized into two
      groups:

      The STOP-Bang questionnaire score is ≥4 then you will be assigned to any one of these groups

        -  sleep study group (group 1) or

        -  oximetry group (group 2).

      The potential patients will be screened by the STOP-Bang questionnaire. Those with a score ≥4
      will be randomized into Sleep Study group or Oximetry group. The patients in the Sleep Study
      group will be referred to a sleep medicine specialist who is part of the Bariatric Surgery
      Psychosocial Program. In the Sleep Study group, patients will undergo sleep studies overnight
      in a sleep laboratory. At the same time, they will also wear the oximeter wristwatch to
      measure overnight oximetry. Depending on the sleep study results and medical history, a
      decision will be made regarding therapeutic options. If the patient has severe sleep apnea
      (AHI&gt;30) or moderate sleep apnea (AHI&gt;15 to &lt;30) with significant co-morbidities (e.g.
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes), CPAP treatment will be recommended. For mild sleep apnea
      (AHI&gt;5 to &lt;15) or moderate sleep apnea without significant co-morbidities, CPAP will not be
      required. If patient is not able to tolerate or refuses CPAP, dental device and positional
      therapy will be recommended.

      The patients in the Oximetry group will undergo overnight pulse oximetry. The patients with
      ODI&gt;10 events/hour will be referred to the sleep medicine specialist. Since the patients with
      ODI&gt;10 had a high probability 69%) to have moderate and severe OSA. A split- night PSG will
      be employed to confirm OSA diagnosis and to titrate CPAP with in patients with ODI&gt;10. The
      1st part of the night will be a sleep study and depending on AHI, CPAP titration will be done
      for the 2nd part of the night. Compared to Sleep Study group, only one night instead of two
      nights of sleep studies is needed in patients with ODI&gt;10 events/hour. The patients with ODI
      ≤ 10 events/h will undergo surgery with routine care plus sleep apnea perioperative
      precautions.
