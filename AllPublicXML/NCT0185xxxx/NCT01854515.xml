    <textblock>
      The present study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of nebulizing Budesonide sin
      comparison with intravenous Dexamethasone before extubation in prevention of post-extubation
      complications amongst patients admitted in intensive care unit.

      In this double-blind randomized clinical trial study, 90 patients (age between 18 to 65) who
      are intubated (at least for 48 hours) and now are ready for extubation will be enrolled in
      the study after obtaining a written informed consent from their parents or guardians.

      The investigators divide our patients randomly into two equal groups.

      -In the budesonide group patients underwent a therapy with nebulizing Budesonide at a dose of
      1 mg diluted in 4 cc of sterile water for 20 minutes, one hour preceding extubation. After
      extubation patients received nebulizing budesonide via oxygen mask at the same dose every 12
      hours for 48 h.i In dexamethasone group intravenous dexamethasone was administered to patient
      at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg before extubation. After extubation, the administration of
      intravenous Dexamethasone continued at the same dose every 12 h. for 48 h.

      Another anesthesiologist who is unaware about kind of medication, will evaluate the patients
      for severity of stridor. We will record the vital sings and grade of stridor every 6 hour.
      Respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) were
      recorded for each patient immediately before aerosol administration (time 0) and at 30 and 60
      min; and 2,4,8,12,24,36 and 48 hrs. After extubation then the presence of stridor (heard with
      the aid of stethoscope) was recorded within 48 hr of extubation
