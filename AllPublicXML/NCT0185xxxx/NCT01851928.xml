      The objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of two nutrition
      screening tools to identify inpatients with malnutrition or at risk of malnutrition. The two
      tools are the Royal Marsden Abridged Adult Nutrition Screening Tool (AANST) and the
      Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)[10] The tools will be compared with the currently accepted
      gold standard, Patient Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). Both screening tools
      are in the form of scored questionnaires and are suitable for electronic input.

      The ultimate objective is to select an adult inpatient nutrition screening tool with the
      highest sensitivity for future use in the oncology inpatient setting in order to allow prompt
      commencement of an appropriate nutrition care plan.

        Patients will be approached for consideration and recruitment to the study in a stratified
        manner in order to proportionately represent the diagnostic groups admitted to The Royal
        Marsden NHS Foundation Trust as inpatients. Patients will be approached sequentially from
        the list until the required number of patients are recruited for that particular diagnoses.
        Recruitment for particular diagnostic groups may take place over a number of days until the
        required number of patients is recruited. The same procedure will be repeated, with a newly
        generated list, for all selected diagnostic groups in a random order. This methodology will
        aim to capture patients who have been newly diagnosed, patients with established disease,
        patients newly admitted and those who have been inpatients for anumber of days or weeks.
