      The study hypothesis is that the means by which HCV induces glucose intolerance is through
      impairment of B-cell function and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in predisposed Latinos with
      insulin resistance and that HCV eradication improves these abnormalities. It is also
      hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption impact insulin sensitivity and secretion with
      Latinos with or without HCV infection.

      The study hypothesis is that the means by which HCV induces glucose intolerance is through
      impairment of B-cell function and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in predisposed Latinos with
      insulin resistance and that HCV eradication improves these abnormalities. This study
      addresses changes in the metabolic parameters over time. In addition, it is hypothesized that
      moderate alcohol consumption impacts insulin resistance and secretion and 30 patients with or
      without HCV who drink alcohol moderately will have discontinuation of alcohol use for 6 weeks
      and have metabolic testing before and after alcohol discontinuation.

          -  Known history of diabetes, or fasting plasma glucose concentration &gt;126 mg/dl

          -  Known history of cirrhosis of the liver, as well as individuals with decompensated
             liver disease such as those with ascites, variceal bleeding, and encephalopathy

          -  Known history of pancreatitis

          -  Prior or current treatment for HCV
