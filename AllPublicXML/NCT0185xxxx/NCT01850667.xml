  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgery, such as, by hepatic
      resection or liver transplantation, but less than 20% of HCC patients are suitable for
      surgery. In the remaining patients with inoperable and advanced HCC, trans-arterial
      chemo-embolization (TACE) has been widely used but TACE alone rarely produces complete
      response and commonly develops recurrence. Recently several small studies reported high tumor
      response and local control rate after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) alone or with
      TACE for inoperable HCC. A single institution phase II trial with SBRT for inoperable HCC
      after incomplete TACE at Korea Cancer Center Hospital showed promising results: the overall
      response rate of 73% and 2-year local control rate of 95%. They reported severe
      gastrointestinal toxicity of 11% because there was no normal tissue constraint for
      gastrointestinal tract and dosage to gastrointestinal tract was restricted to the lowest
      levels possible. In addition, they found that the presence of gastroduodenal ulcer before
      SBRT was significantly influenced on severe gastrointestinal toxicity. Based on this study,
      we will conduct a multicenter phase II trial on maintenance of treatment results and
      reduction of severe treatment related toxicity below 5%. To achieve this, we strictly apply
      normal tissue constraints. Secondly, we will do Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) before SBRT
      to evaluate gastroduodenal ulcer. After then, we will apply the normal tissue constraint of
      gastrointestinal tract according to gastroduodenal ulcer.
