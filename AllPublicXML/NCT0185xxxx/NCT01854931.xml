    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of this project is to assess the potential public health impact of
      delivering Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance, a proven fall prevention program, through
      local community dissemination partners (e.g., senior service providers), in the selected
      counties in the state of Oregon.

    <textblock>
      The program, Tai Chi: Moving for Better Balance, developed by ORI scientists (2003; 2004;
      2008, a,b) was implemented in this dissemination project. Class duration was 90 minutes,
      2-times per week over a 12-month period. During the initial 2 weeks, practice involved
      learning and performing 2 forms practiced in one set of 8 repetitions (for each form) and
      increased to a set of 10 repetitions for up to 5 forms between Week 3 and Week 5. Although
      additional forms were learned as the intervention progressed, starting in Week 6, training
      focused on 10-12 repetitions of the combination of forms rather than single forms. Once all 8
      forms were learned ( Week 10), training was maintained at between 10-15 repetitions of the
      8-form routine. Exercise activities were accompanied by music. Each Tai Chi practice session
      included (a) a 10-15 minute warm-up, (b) 60 minutes of Tai Chi practice, and (c) a 10-minute
      cool-down period. Instruction comprised (a) learning new movements and (b) reviewing
      movements learned from previous sessions. In addition, copies of the videotape/DVD and user's
      guidebook were distributed to all participants who were encouraged to use these materials for
      additional home practice.

      All participating individuals were assessed at baseline, 6 months (mid-point), 12 months
      (intervention termination), and 6 months following the intervention (post-intervention
      follow-up) on measures of health, fall history, functional ability, and quality-of-life. Each
      evaluation session lasted about one hour and was conducted by a trained research assessor in
      various centers where these classes were held.

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>implementation, effectiveness, maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months evaluation on program implementation and effectiveness, and a follow-up at month 18 on program maintenance</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of implementation includes fidelity evaluation (compliance rate, completion of required teaching and practice protocol).
Effectiveness will be evaluated using falls calendar, physical performance based measures including Functional Reach, Timed Up&amp;Go, 50 foot walk for speed.
Maintenance will be evaluated by measuring continued participation among participants (individual level) and participating centers' (center level) willingness to continue the program.</description>
