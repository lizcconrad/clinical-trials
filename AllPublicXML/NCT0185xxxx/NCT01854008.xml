    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the implementation of walking urban
      circuits in increasing the level of physical activity and exercise capacity in severe chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients after being enrolled in a pulmonary
      rehabilitation program.

    <measure>walked in meters in the six minute walking test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Unlike walking meters of baseline and one year</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT was standardized following international recommendations. Oxygen saturation and heart rate were recorded throughout the test using a pulsioximeter (Digit ® Finger Oximeter, Smiths Medical PM, USA). Dyspnea was evaluated using the modified Borg scale at the beginning and end of the test</description>
