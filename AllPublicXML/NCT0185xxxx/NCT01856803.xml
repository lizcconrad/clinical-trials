  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Age is a risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after human leukocyte antigen
      (HLA)-matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). The incidence of acute
      GVHD is significantly higher in patients at 40 years of age or more than those at 18 to 39
      years of age after allo-SCT. It was found that Anti-thymocyte globulins can be used for
      prophylaxis of both acute and chronic GVHD after allo-SCT.Prophylaxis of GVHD using ATG in
      patients at 40 years of age or more in matched sibling allo-SCT settings might significantly
      decrease the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and the incidence of late effect after
      transplantation.

      Prophylaxis for GVHD included CSA, MTX and MMF±ATG. In the trial group, CSA was started
      intravenously on day -1, at the dosage of 3 mg/kg, and switched to oral formulation as soon
      as the patient was able to take medication after engraftment. The dosage was adjusted to
      maintain a trough blood level of 200-300ng/ml. MMF was administered orally, 0.25g every 12
      hours, from day -1 before transplantation to day 30 after transplantation. The dosage of MTX
      was 15 mg/m2, administered i.v. on day 1, and 10 mg/m2 on days 3, 6, and 11 after
      transplantation. ATG (Thymoglobulin 2.5mg/kg per day i.v.) on days -2 through -1. In the
      control group, CSA was started intravenously on day -1, at the dosage of 3 mg/kg, and
      switched to oral formulation as soon as the patient was able to take medication after
      engraftment. The dosage was adjusted to maintain a trough blood level of 200-300ng/ml. MMF
      was administered orally, 0.25g every 12 hours, from day -1 before transplantation to day 30
      after transplantation. The dosage of MTX was 15 mg/m2, administered i.v. on day 1, and 10
      mg/m2 on days 3, 6, and 11 after transplantation.
