  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Dyspnea&quot; refers to the awareness of breathing discomfort that is typically experienced
      during exercise in health and disease. In various participant populations, dyspnea is a
      predictor of disability and death; and contributes to exercise intolerance and an adverse
      health-related quality-of-life. It follows that alleviating dyspnea and improving exercise
      tolerance are among the principal goals of disease management. Nevertheless, the effective
      management of dyspnea and activity-limitation remains an elusive goal for many healthcare
      providers and current strategies aimed at reversing the underlying chronic disease are only
      partially successful in this regard. Thus, research aimed at identifying dyspnea-specific
      medications to complement existing therapies for the management of exertional symptoms is
      timely and clinically relevant. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that
      single-dose inhalation of nebulized ondansetron (a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) will
      improve the perception of dyspnea during strenuous exercise in health, young men. To this
      end, the investigators will compare the effects of inhaled 0.9% saline placebo and inhaled
      ondansetron (8 mg) on detailed assessments of neural respiratory drive (diaphragm EMG),
      ventilation, breathing pattern, dynamic operating lung volumes, contractile respiratory
      muscle function, cardio-metabolic function and dyspnea (sensory intensity and affective
      responses) during symptom-limited, high-intensity, constant-work-rate cycle exercise testing
      in healthy, men aged 20-40 years.
