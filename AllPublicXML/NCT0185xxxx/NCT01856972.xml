  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the short term effects of adding manual therapy techniques to static
      stretching in Dorsiflexion (DF) Range of Motion (ROM). The investigators will be studying 2
      forms of manual therapy, a rear-foot thrust joint mobilization (TJM), and Instrument assisted
      soft tissue mobilization (IASTM). By comparing 3 groups: TJM+static stretching versus IASTM +
      static stretching versus static stretching alone the investigators wish to see if there are
      any short term benefits in DF ROM by adding either of these interventions to static
      stretching.

      The manual therapy treatment will occur over 2 sessions and DF ROM measurements will be taken
      4 times over a 2 week period.

      The population that the investigators wish to examine are subjects with healthy feet and
      ankles, but with limited DF ROM.

      The primary objective of this study is to see if subjects with decreased dorsiflexion motion
      will experience greater increases in dorsiflexion motion with the addition of manual therapy
      of static stretching alone.

      Our hypothesis is subjects who receive manual therapy therapy and static stretching will
      experience a significant increase in DF ROM as compared to subjects who receive static
      stretching alone. More specifically subjects who are treated with the IASTM will experience
      greater results than subjects who are treated with the rear-foot thrust mobilization.

    <description>Subjects will perform 3 practice range of motion (ROM) before the first measurement is taken. Subjects will then be measured for Dorsiflexion range of motion with knee in full extension and then with knee flexed 3 times each. With each measurement subjects will be instructed to bend the ankle forward as far as possible without their heel leaving the ground. The average value for these 3 measurements will be calculated and that will be the subjects DF ROM measurement. The change in ROM at each measurement will be the outcome we are measuring</description>

    <description>IASTM treatment: will be performed with the sound assisted soft tissue mobilization tool #5. Patient will be placed in the prone position with the ankle in a relaxed position. The treating therapist will perform 10 scanning strokes in the caudal, cephalic, medial, lateral directions for a total of 40 strokes over the Gastrocnemius/Soleus complex. The therapist can then perform more concentrated strokes in areas noted by the therapist as tight, with a maximum treatment time of 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>A high velocity-low amplitude distractive thrust is directed at the talocrural joint. The procedure is performed with the patient in the supine position. The therapist interlaces hands over the dorsum of the foot with 5th digit placed on talus. The therapist slightly pronates and dorsiflexes the foot. Tension is taken up in a caudal direction until the soft tissue barrier is engaged. A distractive thrust is then applied. This is performed up to 2 times. If the therapist notes a cavitation, the patient is progressed to ROM exercises. If there is no cavitation is noted by the therapist the thrust mobilization is reapplied.</description>
