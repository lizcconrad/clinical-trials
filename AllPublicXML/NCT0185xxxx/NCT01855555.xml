    <textblock>
      Sedation and anesthesia for which to perform diagnostic imaging represents a rapidly growing
      field of practice, especially in children. Propofol is the most common sedative drug
      administered for MRI/CT. However, this drug is associated with adverse events, including
      pulmonary complications, and there has been no report on these complications in Korea. In
      this prospective observation study, the investigators will report the nature and frequency of
      adverse events associated with propofol-based sedation for MRI/CT.

    <description>When a patient is admitted to the Pediatric Sedation Center, a presedation assessment is performed by hospitalists. Then Pediatric sedation is performed by protocol in the sedation unit.
Data on demographics, primary illness, ASA, snoring history, URI symptom, medications used, procedure and recovery times, medication doses, outcomes of anesthesia, airway interventions and adverse events will be reported.</description>
