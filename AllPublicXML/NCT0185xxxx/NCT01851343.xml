      Background:

      - Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are cells that can develop into other tissue types,
      including bone, cartilage, marrow, and blood cells. However, BMSCs are not stem cells there
      is no evidence that after infusion into another person that BMSCs change into any other
      cells. Research suggests that BMSCs can travel to different parts of the body and work with
      immune cells to reduce inflammation and help repair damaged tissues. BMSC infusions have been
      used in tests to treat moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's disease
      (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). These tests have shown some good results, but more research
      is needed to study their safety and effectiveness. Researchers want to see how well BMSC
      infusions work to treat CD and UC. The BMSCs will be collected from volunteer donors.

      Objectives:

      - To look at the safety and effectiveness of BMSC infusions for moderate to severe CD and UC.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years old with moderate or severe inflammatory bowel disease
      (CD or UC) that has not responded to standard treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have two screening visits. The first will be 15 to 30 days before the
           first BMSC infusion. The second will be within 14 days of the first BMSC infusion.

        -  At the first screening visit, participants will have a physical exam and medical
           history. They will provide blood, urine, and stool samples. They will also give
           information about their symptoms and quality of life.

        -  At the second screening visit, participants will have their vital signs (like blood
           pressure and heart rate) measured. They will also provide blood samples, and have a
           colonoscopy with biopsies.

        -  During treatment, participants will have one BMSC infusion per week for 4 weeks. Blood
           and urine samples will be collected at each treatment visit.

        -  One week after the last infusion, participants will have a study visit. The tests from
           the first and second screening visits will be repeated.

        -  There will be six follow-up visits at 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the last study
           visit. Participants will repeat the tests from the first screening visit.

    <textblock>
      Crohn s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the 2 major sub-types of inflammatory bowel
      disease (IBD), are chronic, life-long conditions characterized by relapsing inflammation of
      the gastrointestinal tract. CD has a predilection for the small bowel and the proximal large
      bowel; however, it can affect the gastrointestinal tract discontinuously anywhere. UC mainly
      affects the distal colon but can involve the entire colon as well. In spite of advances in
      IBD therapeutics, a significant number of patients continue to have symptoms while on
      conventional medications. The current protocol proposes to study infusions of allogenic bone
      marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) for the treatment of active IBD.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of BMSC infusions in subjects with IBD
      and to examine the host clinical and immunologic response to BMSCs. BMSCs possess
      multi-lineage differentiation potential in bone marrow, and aid in the repair of damaged
      tissue. They suppress the lymphocyte immune response and target sites of inflammation to
      promote healing through tissue regeneration. Studies are underway examining the utility of
      BMSCs to treat several conditions including neurologic disorders, myocardial infarctions,
      rheumatologic disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders including acute
      graft-versus-host-disease and IBD. Progress in the understanding of the cell populations
      involved in the pathogenesis of IBD and the discovery of the potential immunologic and
      regenerative characteristics of BMSCs have created a new potential direction for IBD therapy.

      This phase I study will enroll subjects with moderate-to-severe IBD who are refractory to or
      intolerant of standard therapy. Under the guidance of the NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell
      Transplantation Center, the Cell Processing Section of the Department of Transfusion Medicine
      at the Clinical Center has developed a procedure for collecting, expanding, and
      cryopreserving clinical grade BMSCs under an FDA Drug Master File. Marrow will be aspirated
      from volunteer donors participating on protocol 10-CC-0053 who have passed the standard
      screening for blood and marrow donors; BMSCs will be expanded in vitro. Since it is not
      necessary to HLA-match BMSC donors with their recipients, a BMSC repository will be used as
      the source of BMSCs for this study.

      In Arm 1, the safety of the BMSC infusion dosage (4 x 106 cells/kg/dose 10%) and schedule
      (once a week for 4 weeks) will be evaluated in 3 non-overlapping IBD subjects. Once safety is
      established in these subjects, subsequent subjects in Arm 2 will be enrolled without overlap
      restriction. Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and response assessments at 28,
      56, 84, and 112 days after the first infusion. Additional safety visits will be performed at
      180, 360 and 720 days after the first infusion. Safety will be monitored by a Data and Safety
      Monitoring Board. Response to study drug will be assessed in all patients by changes in
      symptom scores, endoscopic/histologic findings, quality of life scores, and
      immunologic/laboratory parameters. Fifty subjects will be evaluated over a 5-year period.

        -  SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects who meet ALL of the following criteria will be considered for enrollment into this
        study:

          1. Be 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive, as of the date of enrollment.

          2. Be willing to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy during the study period.
             Subject to the judgment and discretion of the PI, participants who meet ANY of the
             criteria listed immediately below, as well as male participants who are in a
             monogamous relationship with a woman who meets ANY of the criteria below, may not be
             required to take any pregnancy avoidance measures (e.g. barrier methods). Such
             participants will be counseled on risks at the time of consent and at appropriate
             points (e.g. when pregnancy testing occurs) during the study:

               1. Females who have had their uterus, and/or BOTH ovaries removed

               2. Females who have had BOTH fallopian tubes surgically tied or removed

               3. Females who have undergone other permanent birth control procedures, such as
                  endometrial ablation or sterilization (such as Essure or Novasure), and have had
                  any required follow up testing to confirm the effectiveness of the permanent
                  birth control procedure.

               4. Females who are above the age of 50 and have spontaneously had no menses at any
                  point during the past 12 or more consecutive months (i.e. have reached
                  menopause).

               5. Females who, in the conservative and reasonable judgment of the PI (e.g. due to
                  sexual orientation, or serious life choice), from the time of enrollment until

                  12 weeks after the last BMSC infusion, will NOT participate in any potentially
                  reproductive sexual contact (i.e. sexual intercourse with a male partner).

               6. Males who have had a vasectomy and have had the follow-up testing confirming zero
                  sperm count in their semen.

          3. Any subject who does NOT meet the criteria listed in #2 above, will be appropriately
             counseled on reproductive risks and pregnancy avoidance, and will be required to
             adhere to the following measures, as agreed upon by the subject and the PI until at
             least 12 weeks after the last BMSC infusion:

               1. A highly effective hormonal method to prevent pregnancy [e.g. CONSISTENT,
                  CONTINUOUS use of contraceptive pill, patch, ring, implant or injection], and/or
                  IUD or equivalent.

                  IN ADDITION TO

               2. A barrier method to be used at the time of potentially reproductive sexual
                  activity (e.g. [male/female condom, cap, or diaphragm] + spermicide).

               3. Male participants will be appropriately counseled on risks and must agree to
                  consistently use effective contraception with female sexual partners through the
                  Day 112 study visit to avoid a pregnancy that could be affected by the study
                  drug. Appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy and trial related risks in sexual
                  partners, per the PI s judgment, must be agreed to and practiced.

             NOTE: Most of the above interventions to prevent pregnancy must be implemented at a
             particular time in the menstrual cycle, and may not be immediately effective. Trial
             activity that may pose a reproductive risk may NOT occur until the above contraceptive
             measures are fully effective and must continue until at least 12 weeks after the last
             BMSC infusion.

          4. Have a diagnosis of CD or UC that has been endoscopically or radiographically
             confirmed at least 6 months prior to screening.

          5. Have either active CD symptoms as defined by a CDAI score between 220 and 450,
             inclusive, as measured for 7 consecutive days during screening, or active UC as
             defined by a SCCAI score greater than or equal to 6.

          6. The patient must have demonstrated an inadequate response to, loss of response to, or
             intolerance of at least 1 of the following agents as defined below:

             pimecrolimus, tacrolimus, and any other systemic immunosuppressants.

          3. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Serum pregnancy test must be negative at screening for
             female subjects of childbearing potential. Urine pregnancy test must remain negative
             at each of the four infusion visits.

          4. Subject does not agree to pregnancy avoidance measures required to prevent pregnancy
             during participation in the study, or meet criteria that would exempt them from
             contraceptive measures.

          5. Has clinically significant systemic infection (e.g., chronic or acute infection,
             urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection) within one month of
             screening and no opportunistic infection within six months of screening. Has a history
             or presence of recurrent or chronic infection (e.g. viral infections [including

             syphilis).

          6. Has a positive Quantiferon-TB Gold (QFT-G) test, indicating tuberculosis infection, at
             time of screening. A QFT-G will not be done in a subject who has received tuberculosis
             vaccination; these subjects will be eligible to participate if latent tuberculosis can
             be excluded with a chest x-ray (CXR).

          7. Received an agent not approved by the FDA for marketed use in any indication or any

             CDAI diary or at any time during the screening window. This includes medications used
             to treat IBD as an off-label use (at the discretion of the investigator).

          8. Has abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including:

               -  Neutrophil count &lt;1500 cells/mm(3).

                  anticoagulation medications.

               -  If total bilirubin is greater than 1.2 mg/dL, then direct bilirubin can be no
                  more than 70% of the total, up to a direct bilirubin of 2.0 mg/dL.

          9. Has active infection with enteric pathogens as evidenced by positive microbiological
             culture of stool.

         10. Has active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
             testing will be performed on biopsies taken during the time of initial colonoscopy in
             order to exclude CMV.

         11. Has a history of low-grade or high-grade colonic mucosal dysplasia.

         12. Has a history of uveitis or iritis within the previous two months. This is due to the
             concern that BMSCs may home to sites of active inflammation.

         13. Had bowel surgery other than perianal (e.g., fistulotomy, seton placement, abscess
             drainage) within 6 months prior to beginning the CDAI screening diary or drawing
             screening blood samples.

         14. Has surgical changes to gut anatomy that preclude administration of clinical activity
             indicies including but not limited to ileostomy, colostomy, or subtotal colectomy with
             ileorectal anastomosis.

         15. Has known or suspected short bowel syndrome.

         16. Requires parenteral or total parenteral nutrition.

         17. Has a history of cancer, other than non-melanomatous cancer of the skin, within the
             past 5 years.

         18. Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements.

         19. Has any medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in this protocol.

         20. Has only small bowel IBD that is inaccessible by standard colonoscopy to obtain
             research biopsies. For this reason patients with only upper gastrointestinal IBD are
             also excluded.

         21. Refuses to abstain from using COX-2 inhibitors or NSAIDs throughout the 4 week study
             drug infusion period.
