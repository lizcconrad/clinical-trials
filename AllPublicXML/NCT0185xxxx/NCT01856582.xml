  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if infusing additional special donor cells will
      help to improve graft or immune function in previously transplanted children with immune
      deficiencies and bone marrow failures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of infusing purified CD34+ cells
      of donor origin in order to augment graft function in response to declining chimerism after
      initially performing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for children
      with primary immunodeficiency diseases. This protocol will be utilized for patients with
      waning mixed donor chimerism that is inadequate for correction of clinical condition or
      disease for which stem cell transplant was performed, or for augmentation of immune function.
      An infusion of selected CD34+ stem cells will be given without any preparative regimen. As
      the children eligible for this protocol have reduced immune function and pre-existing donor
      chimerism, we hypothesize that stem cells will be able to engraft and the infusion will
      augment graft function. This therapy serves as an alternative to a second stem cell
      transplant that is known to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. CD34+
      stem cells will be collected from the donor used for initial stem cell transplant. Cells will
      be T-cell depleted (TCD) by performing a CD34 selection using the CliniMACS device (Miltenyi
      Biotec) in order to prevent development of new or exacerbation of existing graft versus host
      disease (GVHD), as avoidance of GVHD in nonmalignant diseases is desirable. There is
      sufficient data showing that mixed donor chimerism is adequate for reverting disease
      phenotype in certain primary immunodeficiencies. Observations from Europe and CCHMC show that
      donor chimerism might be boosted by CD34+ stem cell infusion alone without any specific
      preparative regimen. This therapy is likely to be associated with low toxicity due to the
      absence of a preparative regimen and lack of exposure to fresh donor cells capable of
      initiating GVHD, and offers potential significant benefit.

    <description>Graft function will be measured in two ways. Firstly the percentage of donor chimerism, and secondly measured improvement in immune function; improvement in numbers of circulating white blood cells and/or platelets, and/or clearance of opportunistic viral infections.
Improvement in immune function studies compared to baseline levels.
In the case of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, improvement of platelet count to &gt;20,000/L.
Clinical response to infection, if applicable.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible for this protocol, patients must have the following:

          1. Primary immunodeficiency (e.g. SCID, Wiskott-Aldrich and/or other more rare conditions
             and other bone marrow failure syndromes) with prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          2. Waning donor chimerism or immune function that is inadequate to correct their disease
             or clinical condition, for which primary transplant was given, as determined by their
             attending physician.

          3. Available primary donor.

          4. Must not have other organ dysfunction deemed by the attending physician to preclude
             this procedure.

          5. Age &lt; 35 years at time of transplant

          6. One of the following must be true:

               -  Patients must have evidence of persistent or recurrent immunodeficiency or
                  thrombocytopenia.

        -OR-

        • Primary immunodeficiency disease with known potential to progress to malignant condition
        if untreated.

        -OR-

        • Debilitating secondary disease known to be a consequence of inadequate immune response to
        known agent or pathogen, uncontrollable by other available medical therapies (e.g. third
        patient described on page 5).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Absence of an available original donor

          2. Failure to sign consent form, or inability to undergo informed consent process

          3. Pregnant or lactating female

          4. Uncontrolled GVHD
