  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the effect of mometasone furoate is any different
      from Eucerin in decreasing the severity of redness of the skin during irradiation, preventing
      the skin from peeling, or reducing the amount of irritation the patient reports during
      treatment.

    <description>Patient education regarding amount to be applied (amount depending on body habitus) and area of treatment field will be reinforced by the R.N. prior to the first radiation treatment. Part of patient education may involve application of the cream. Patients will be instructed to apply cream to the upper outer quadrant, upper inner quadrant, lower outer quadrant, and lower inner quadrant, as well as irradiated nodal fields. They will be instructed to apply cream in a thin, uniform layer twice a day, in the morning and evening, and not within the immediate 4 hours prior to radiation treatment. Patients will be informed that application immediately following radiation treatment is acceptable for those scheduled to receive morning treatments. Patients will be provided diaries to record the date and time they applied the study cream. Pts should return the completed diaries on their weekly status checks and at the 2 weeks +/- 2 business days following the completion of RT.</description>
