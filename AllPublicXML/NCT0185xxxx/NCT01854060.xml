      The prevalence of IBS in the community has been reported in numerous cross-sectional surveys.
      However, less is known about the incidence of IBS ,mainly due to its slow development and to
      patients under-reporting. Furthermore, only one study has analyzed data concerning potential
      risk factors for the diagnosis of IBS. The investigators will examine the incidence of IBS in
      a large cohort of young adults and will look at the association of socioeconomic,
      anthropometric and occupational factors with IBS incidence.
