  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find a noninvasive test to help physicians diagnose detrusor
      overactivity (DO), to use this urine test to help diagnose bladder problems, determine if
      treatments are working, and determine if patients are good candidates for interventions like
      sacral neuromodulation/Interstim Therapy.
