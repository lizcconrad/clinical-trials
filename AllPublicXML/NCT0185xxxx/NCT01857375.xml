      This research is to determine the use of insulin pens compared to syringe and vial therapy in
      adults newly begun on insulin therapy during their hospital stay. Patients will have no prior
      experience using insulin or other self-administered injectable medicine. The study will
      examine which method of administering insulin reduces dosing errors, causes a lower incidence
      of low blood sugars, increases adherence to therapy and with which method patients are more
      satisfied.
