      The investigators propose to study the single agent activity of Cabazitaxel in a Phase II
      trial of subjects with relapsed or refractory non-small cell lung cancer pretreated with
      docetaxel, given the fact of its significant activity and its acceptable toxicity profile.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non small cell lung cancer represents the second most common type of cancer in both men and
      women in the Western world. The availability of new active regimens in the first line setting
      has prompted several investigators to consider second line therapy for patients with advanced
      NSCLC, since a substantial percentage of patients maintain a good PS upon recurrence. On the
      basis of the results of phase III trials docetaxel, erlotinib, gefitinib, or pemetrexed are
      considered as &quot;standard&quot; choices for second-line therapy.

      However, despite the increased availability of different drugs, NSCLC remains a devastating
      disease with median OS which rarely exceeds 12 months.

      Preclinical data of cabazitaxel have demonstrated antitumor activity in models resistant to
      paclitaxel and docetaxel. In cell lines resistant to cytotoxic agents, cabazitaxel induced
      further tumor regression.

      The recommended phase 2 doses for Cabazitaxle were 20 and 25 mg/m2. Cabazitaxel showed
      antitumor activity in solid tumors including docetaxel-refractory metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer and breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age&gt;18 years old

          -  Cytologically or histologically documented NSCLC

          -  PS 0-2 (WHO scale)

          -  Measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (at least
             one measurable lesion)

          -  Documented disease progression to previous treatment with docetaxel regimen in 1st or
             2nd line setting assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors with at
             least one visceral or soft-tissue metastatic lesion.

          -  Brain metastases are allowed, given that are clinically stable and the patient does
             not present neurologic symptoms.

          -  Previous radiotherapy, either in the adjuvant setting or for the treatment of bone
             metastases, is allowed provided that the measurable lesions are outside the radiation
             fields. Patients who were irradiated to ≥ 40% of bone marrow are not eligible for the
             study.

          -  Patients must have a recent (within 7 days prior to treatment start) biochemical and
             hematogical assessment as defined by adequate bone marrow (absolute neutrophil count
             ≥1.5 x 109 cells/L, platelets ≥100 x 109cells/L and hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL), liver (AST &amp;
             ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN, total bilirubin within normal range) and renal (serum creatinine &lt; 1.5
             x ULN). If creatinine 1.0 - 1.5 x ULN, creatinine clearance will be calculated
             according to CKD-EPI formula and patients with creatinine clearance &lt;60 mL/min should
