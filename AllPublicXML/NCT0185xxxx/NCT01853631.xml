  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects on this study have a type of lymph gland cancer called Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, acute
      lymphocytic leukemia, or chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (these diseases will be referred to as
      &quot;lymphoma&quot; or &quot;leukemia&quot;). The lymphoma or leukemia has come back or has not gone away after
      treatment.

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No one way seems perfect for
      fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease,
      antibodies and T cells, hoping that they will work together. Both antibodies and T cells have
      been used to treat patients with cancer. They have shown promise, but have not been strong
      enough to cure most patients.

      T cells can kill tumor cells but normally there are not enough of them to kill all the tumor
      cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the
      laboratory and then given them back to the person.

      The antibody used in this study is called anti-CD19. It first came from mice that have
      developed immunity to human lymphoma. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a
      substance on the outside of these cells called CD19. CD19 antibodies have been used to treat
      people with lymphoma and leukemia. For this study, anti-CD19 has been changed so that instead
      of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to
      a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor.

      In the laboratory, the investigators found that T cells work better if they also add proteins
      that stimulate T cells, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells last longer
      in the body but not long enough for them to be able to kill the lymphoma cells. The
      investigators believe that if they add an extra stimulating protein, called CD137, the cells
      will have a better chance of killing the lymphoma cells.

      The investigators are going to see if this is true by putting the CD19 chimeric receptor with
      CD28 alone into half of the cells and the CD19 chimeric receptor with CD28 and CD137 into the
      other half of the cells. These CD19 chimeric receptor T cells with CD28 and with or without
      CD137 are investigational products not approved by the FDA.

      The purpose of this study is to find the biggest dose of chimeric T cells that is safe, to
      see how long the T cell with each sort of chimeric receptor lasts, to learn what the side
      effects are and to see whether this therapy might help people with lymphoma or leukemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will give the investigators blood to make CD19 CD28 (with and without CD137)
      chimeric receptor-T cells in the laboratory. These cells will be grown and frozen. To make
      the T cells, investigators will take blood (or blood from a donor) and stimulate it with
      growth factors to make the T cells grow. To get the CD19 antibody and CD28 (with or without
      CD137) to attach to the surface of the T cell, they will insert the antibody gene into the T
      cell. This is done with a virus called a retrovirus that has been made for this study and
      will carry the antibody gene into the T cell. This virus also helps to find the T cells in
      the blood after injecting them; in order to tell them apart investigators have made two
      viruses that are slightly different because one has CD137. These two viruses can be told
      apart by a special laboratory test. Because the patient will receive cells with a new gene in
      them, the patient will be followed for a total of 15 years to see if there are any long term
      side effects of gene transfer. If the patient cannot visit the clinic, he or she will be
      contacted by the research coordinator or physician.

      When subjects enroll on this study, they will be assigned a dose of CD19 chimeric receptor-T
      cells. Several studies suggest that the infused T cells need room to be able to proliferate
      and accomplish their functions and that this may not happen if there are too many other T
      cells in circulation.

      Because of that, if the subject's level of circulating T cells is relatively high, s/he may
      receive one treatment of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and fludarabine if the doctor thinks this
      is appropriate. This drug will decrease the numbers of the subject's own T cells before
      infusion of the CD19 chimeric receptor T cells. If subject is already receiving chemotherapy,
      this may not be needed. The investigators would prefer subjects do not receive other
      chemotherapy until 6 weeks after cell infusion but they can do so if their doctor thinks it
      is medically necessary.

      Patients will be given an injection of cells into the vein through an IV at the assigned
      dose. The injection will take about 20 minutes. The investigators will follow them in the
      clinic after the injection for up to 3 hours.

      If after a 6 week evaluation period after the infusion, the patient seems to be experiencing
      a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms), s/he may be
      able to receive up to five additional doses of the T cells if s/he wishes. The first repeat
      infusion can only take place at least 6 weeks after the first infusion. Any additional
      infusions after that would be at least 4 weeks apart. All additional infusions will be at the
      same dose level received the first time or a lower dose. The treatment will be given by the
      Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital.

DLT will be defined as any of the following that is NOT (1) pre-existing, or (2) due to infection (to which patients with CLL and NHL are predisposed), or (3) due to underlying malignancy, and that may, after consultation with the FDA when indicated, be considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study cellular products: (1) Non-hematologic DLT is any grade 3 or grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, including allergic reactions to T cell infusions; (2) Hematologic DLT is defined as any grade 4 hematologic toxicity. Patients with evidence of bone marrow disease (metastases or diffuse infiltration) are not evaluable for hematologic dose limiting toxicity.</description>
