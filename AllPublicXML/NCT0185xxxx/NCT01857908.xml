  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal androgens are serum biomarkers of interest that may help guide abiraterone acetate
      treatment, particularly at the time of progression. Biomarkers may also help identify
      pathways to resistance of abiraterone acetate treatment. The most practical way of
      approaching this question is to explore surrogate biomarkers of prostate cancer including
      quantification of pharmacodynamic endocrine biomarkers.

      Goals of this study include:

        -  Explore which circulating endocrine markers or endocrine related markers have the best
           potential to predict clinical response to abiraterone acetate in CRPC patients

        -  Explore the utility of microRNA, circulating DNA and exosome analyses in complementing
           the previous objective

    <time_frame>Patients will be followed from Day 1 (date of initiation of Abiraterone treatment) until the date of first documented progression (estimated to be 1 year). PSA will be assessed every 30 days (approximately) until the time of PSA/clinical progression</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed written informed consent. Before any study procedures are performed, subjects
             (or their legally acceptable representatives) will have the details of the study
             described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent document to read.
             If subjects consent to participate in the study, they will indicate that consent by
             signing and dating the informed consent document in the presence of study personnel

          -  Be suitable for receiving treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the
             prostate without neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology

          -  Patients may not receive any other investigational agent or dose escalation of
             abiraterone acetate during study participation

          -  Patient consents to comply to treatment with abiraterone acetate as directed by their
             physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Taking a dose of abiraterone acetate other than 1g daily or lack of compliance to
             daily dosing of abiraterone acetate and prednisone

          -  Patients receiving spironolactone or any other steroidogenic compounds in excess of
             the associated prednisone 5mg bid are excluded due to the potential for androgen
             receptor agonism
