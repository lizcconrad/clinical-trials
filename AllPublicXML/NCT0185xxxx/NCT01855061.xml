    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether it is possible to predict response to
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic cancer who are treated with irinotecan by
      determining the mutational profile of the tumor.

    <description>Patients will be subjected to a their metastatic solid tumor. Radiological response will be evaluated after each 2 cycles: 1. percentage change in radiological volume of the &quot;index lesion&quot; (radiological measurable lesion that underwent biopsy) after the first two cycles of irinotecan; 2. radiological response according to RECIST 1.1 after each 2 cycles. Patients are intended to receive irinotecan until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Patients will be subjected to another biopsy of the index lesion at definitive discontinuation of irinotecan. Patients will also be subjected to blood draws for determining patient's genetic background variation.
Side studies include:
pharmacogenetics
pharmacokinetics of SN-38
carboxylesterase activity in the index lesion
midazolam clearance test (only in Rotterdam patients)</description>
