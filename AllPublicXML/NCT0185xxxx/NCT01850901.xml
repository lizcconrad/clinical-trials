      The aim of this study is to assess whether renal denervation (RD) added to usual care
      compared to usual care alone reduces blood pressure (BP) as determined with ambulatory BP
      monitoring (ABPM) after 6 months in subjects with an average day-time systolic BP of at least
      135 mmHg as determined with use of ABPM, despite use of three or more BP lowering agents or
      with documented intolerance or contraindication for to 2 or more of the 4 major classes of
      antihypertensive drugs (ACEi/ARB, calcium channel blockers, betablockers and diuretics)
      obstructing use of 3 antihypertensives

      Further aims are to assess the effect of renal denervation on the use of BP lowering agents,
      to explore the effect of renal denervation in strata of estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) (eGFR 20-60 mL/min per 1.73m2 and eGFR&gt;60 mL/min per 1.73m2) and according to baseline
      office BP.

      Randomization will be stratified by hospital and eGFR and will be at a 2:1 ratio.
