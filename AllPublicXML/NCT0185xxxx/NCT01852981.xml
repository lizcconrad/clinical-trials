    <textblock>
      To verify changes in physical activity levels, metabolic markers, and physical fitness as
      results of two physical activity interventions within the Brazilian public health system
      (primary health care).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of two strategies - lifestyle counseling focused on physical activity, and
      supervised exercise - adapted to the Brazilian primary health care system and resources will
      be compared between them and with a control group. Subjects are healthy, physically inactive
      adults from a low socioeconomic area of Sao Paulo city. Evaluations will be done at the study
      baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months (6 months follow-up) after the beginning. The
      primary outcome is leisure-time physical activity.

    <description>Strategies consisted of group discussion, some physical activities, phone support, and printed materials. The content and strategies were elaborated by a team formed by a doctor, nutritionists, a psychologist, and physical education professionals and the main aim was to promote the engagement in physical activity, working not only on behavioral change but also on the environment attributes available for physical activity practice. The main strategy was the group discussion, which sessions lasted 120 minutes each and its frequency changed as follow: in the first month they were weekly; in the second occurred twice per month; and in the third month onwards sessions were monthly. All sessions occurred in the Primary Health Unit or inside a community association building.</description>

    <description>Supervised exercise program in groups. Individuals in this program participated in three weekly structured and supervised sessions of aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises, drawn up in accordance to the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations. Load, intensity, and exercise adjustments were made during the program. All sessions lasted 60 minutes each and occurred in a gymnasium nearby the Primary Health Unit.</description>
