      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence, based on
      pharmacodynamic parameters of Propofol 2% (20 mg/mL) MCT Fresenius and Diprivan® 20 mg/mL
      (AstraZeneca), administered by target controlled infusion (TCI).

               -  Total hip or total knee replacement

               -  Requiring opening of the great cavities of the body (cranium, thorax, peritoneum,
                  or pelvis)

               -  With routine risk, even if low, of hemorrhage severe enough to require

             central venous catheter may be used to obtain Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples, though
             only if no port of the catheter is being used for administration of any other product,
             including crystalloid infusion at more than a &quot;keep line open&quot; rate)

          8. History of difficult venous access

          9. Myocardial infarction within 6 months of randomization or a cardiac reperfusion
             procedure within 6 weeks of randomization

         10. Significant respiratory, cardiovascular, liver or renal disease as assessed by
             investigator

         11. Active systemic infection (localized infection related to surgical procedure is
             allowable as long as there is no indication of systemic involvement)

         12. History of psychiatric disorder, including use of sedatives or antidepressants for any
             reason, within 6 months prior to randomization

         13. Alcohol or other substance abuse within 2 years prior to randomization, as well as for
             the duration of the study

         14. Use of medication that could reduce the subject's respiratory and/or cardiac output

         15. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating

         16. Hemoglobin &lt;7.5 g/dL at screening or randomization

         17. Platelets &lt;50,000 x 10³/μL at screening or randomization

         18. ECG findings detected at screening not consistent with the subject's medical history
             or warranting cardiology review

         19. Participation in an interventional clinical study within 6 months of screening
