  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate a NULOJIX® (belatacept) based regimens as a means of
      improving long-term graft function without increasing the risks of immunologic graft injury
      by avoiding both calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and corticosteroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Taking standard anti-rejection medications for a long time can cause serious side effects,
      including kidney damage. Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to
      prevent their immune system (the body's natural defense system against illness) from
      rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who receive a kidney transplant must take these
      anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the kidney
      continues to work.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if NULOJIX® (belatacept), will minimize serious
      long term side effects seen with anti-rejection medications while still protecting the
      transplanted kidney from damage. The researchers also want to learn more about the safety of
      this treatment and the long term health of the transplanted kidney.

    <description>The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI):
A score of ≥ 90 means kidney function is normal.
A score between 60 and 89 indicates mildly reduced kidney function, pointing to kidney disease.
Scores between 30 and 59 indicates moderately reduced kidney function.
Scores between 15 and 29 indicate severely reduced kidney function.
Scores below 15 indicate very severe or endstage kidney failure.
An estimate of the slope, or change over time, in eGFR was produced using standard statistical linear modeling procedures. The estimate was then re-scaled so that it could be interpreted as a change in eGFR per month. Positive numbers indicate increasing kidney function.
Larger numbers indicate greater change in kidney function.</description>

        <title>Mean Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) Calculated for Each Treatment Group Using the CKD-EPI Equation at Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>eGFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation (CKD-EPI):
A score of ≥90 means kidney function is normal.
A score between 60 and 89 indicates mildly reduced kidney function, pointing to kidney disease.
Scores between 30 and 59 indicates moderately reduced kidney function.
Scores between 15 and 29 indicate severely reduced kidney function.
Scores below 15 indicate very severe or end stage kidney failure.</description>

            <description>Induction:
Methylprednisolone (MEDROL) was administered at a dose of 500mg on the day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 60 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 4, and 0 mg on day 5.
Thymoglobulin via intravenous infusion was administered at a target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days.
Maintenance:
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.
The site investigator determined the starting dose. The first tacrolimus (tac) dosing was administered on the day of transplant or day 1 and was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks post-transplant and 5-8 ng/mL thereafter.</description>

Basiliximab (Simulect) was administered in two 20 mg doses, within 2 hours prior to transplantation and on day 3.
The site investigator determined the initial tacrolimus (tac) dose started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during days 1-84, and then decreased by 1/3 at day 84 and by 1/3 at week 16. If trough levels were less than or equal to 3 ng/ml at week 20 then all tac was stopped. Otherwise, the dose was reduced by 1/2 and stopped at week 24.

Scores between 30 and 59 indicates moderately reduced kidney function.
Scores between 15 and 29 indicate severely reduced kidney function.
Scores below 15 indicate very severe or endstage kidney failure.
An estimate of the slope, or change over time, in eGFR was produced using standard statistical linear modeling procedures. The estimate was then re-scaled so that it could be interpreted as a change in eGFR per month. Positive numbers indicate increasing kidney function.
Larger numbers indicate greater change in kidney function.</description>

        <description>Acute cellular rejection occurs when lesions at the site of the graft characteristically are infiltrated with large numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages that cause tissue damage. Acute cellular rejection for this endpoint is defined as a grade equal to or greater than IA by Banff 2007 criteria as determined by local pathology. Severity is graded as IA, IB, IIA, IIB, or III, with IA being the mildest form of cellular rejection and III being the most severe form of cellular rejection. Originally it was 2 endpoints but all participants’ highest grade was also their first grade so only reporting their first grade.</description>

Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during days 1-84, and then decreased by 1/3 at day 84 and by 1/3 at week 16. If trough levels were less than or equal to 3 ng/ml at week 20 then all tac was stopped. Otherwise, the dose was reduced by 1/2 and stopped at week 24.
Maintenance:
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.
Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at 10 mg/kg beginning 24 hours from the time of reperfusion, and at days 5, 14, 28, 56 and 84</description>

        <description>The presence of antibodies reactive to Histocompatibility Antigen (HLA) molecules expressed on the renal allograft have been associated with both acute and chronic injury to the transplanted kidney. The development of de novo anti donor HLA antibodies may mean a person is more likely to reject the graft.

        <title>Count of Participants With Either New Onset Diabetes After Transplant (NODAT) or Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) at Week 52 Post-Transplant -Based on Criteria Specified by the ADA and WHO</title>
        <description>New onset diabetes is the development of diabetes post-kidney transplant. It was identified by the clinical sites caring for each participant and reported directly in the clinical database. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a determination made by referencing glucose measurements obtained from a standard chemistry panel. Any fasting glucose measure that is between 110 and 125 mg/dL is classified as IFG.

Thymoglobulin via intravenous infusion was administered at a target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days.
Maintenance:
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.
The site investigator determined the starting dose. The first tacrolimus (tac) dosing was administered on the day of transplant or day 1 and was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during the first 24 weeks post-transplant and 5-8 ng/mL thereafter.</description>

        <title>Standardized Blood Pressure Measurement at Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>A blood pressure measurement consists of two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels when the heart beats. Diastolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels between beats of the heart.
Systolic measures of &lt;120 and diastolic measures of &lt;80 are considered normal.
Systolic measures of 120-139 and diastolic measures of 80-89 are considered at risk (or pre-hypertension).
Systolic measures of ≥140 and diastolic measures of ≥90 are considered high.</description>

The site investigator determined the initial tacrolimus (tac) dose started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during days 1-84, and then decreased by 1/3 at day 84 and by 1/3 at week 16. If trough levels were less than or equal to 3 ng/ml at week 20 then all tac was stopped. Otherwise, the dose was reduced by 1/2 and stopped at week 24.
Maintenance:
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.
Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at 10 mg/kg beginning 24 hours from the time of reperfusion, and at days 5, 14, 28, 56 and 84</description>

          <title>Standardized Blood Pressure Measurement at Wk 52 Post-Transplant</title>
          <description>A blood pressure measurement consists of two numbers: the systolic and diastolic pressures. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels when the heart beats. Diastolic pressure measures the pressure in blood vessels between beats of the heart.
Systolic measures of &lt;120 and diastolic measures of &lt;80 are considered normal.
Systolic measures of 120-139 and diastolic measures of 80-89 are considered at risk (or pre-hypertension).
Systolic measures of ≥140 and diastolic measures of ≥90 are considered high.</description>

        <title>Fasting Lipid Profile at Wk 28 Post-Transplant</title>
        <description>A fasting lipid profiles measures total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. These measurements are used in assessing one's risk of cardiovascular disease. Target ranges for each of these measures are provided:
Total cholesterol: 75-169 mg/dL if age ≤20; 100-199 mg/dL if age ≥ 21; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease
LDL cholesterol: &lt;70 mg/dL for people with documented cardiovascular disease or metabolic syndrome; &lt;100 mg/dL for people considered high risk for cardiovascular disease; &lt;130 mg/dL for people considered low risk for cardiovascular disease; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease
HDL cholesterol: 40mg/dL and higher; high values indicate reduced risk of cardiovascular disease
Non-HDL cholesterol: 30 mg/dL above the target value for LDL cholesterol; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease and
Triglycerides: &lt;150 mg/dL; high values indicate risk of cardiovascular disease.</description>

          <description>Induction:
Methylprednisolone (MEDROL) was administered at a dose of 500mg on the day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 60 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 4, and 0 mg on day 5.
Thymoglobulin via intravenous infusion was administered at a target dose of 6 mg/kg over 3 to 4 days.
Maintenance:
Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at a dose of 10 mg/kg beginning 24 hours from the time of reperfusion, and then at days 5, 14, 28, 56 and 84.
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.</description>

          <description>Induction:
Methylprednisolone (MEDROL) was administered at 500mg on day of transplant, and tapered to 250 mg on day 1, 125 mg on day 2, 60 mg on day 3, 30 mg on day 4, and 0 mg on day 5.
Basiliximab (Simulect) was administered in two 20 mg doses, within 2 hours prior to transplantation and on day 3.
The site investigator determined the initial tacrolimus (tac) dose started on the day of transplant or day 1. Dosing was adjusted to achieve a target trough of 8-12 ng/ml during days 1-84, and then decreased by 1/3 at day 84 and by 1/3 at week 16. If trough levels were less than or equal to 3 ng/ml at week 20 then all tac was stopped. Otherwise, the dose was reduced by 1/2 and stopped at week 24.
Maintenance:
Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) or equivalent was administered at a target dose of 1000 mg PO or IV BID starting on the day of transplant or day 1.
Belatacept (NULOJIX) was given at 10 mg/kg beginning 24 hours from the time of reperfusion, and at days 5, 14, 28, 56 and 84</description>
