      The study will evaluate [68Ga]ABY-025 for PET imaging of HER2 expression in subjects with
      HER2-positive or HER2-negative breast cancer.

      Open-labeled, exploratory, single center study.

        1. Group 1 (dose-finding) Six subjects with HER2-positive primary tumor status and four
           subjects with HER2-negative status. [68Ga]ABY-025 PET with low dose (100 μg) of ABY-025
           peptide is performed, followed by a repeated PET within three weeks using high dose (500
           μg) ABY-025 peptide (radioactivity maximum 500 MBq). A third [68Ga]ABY-025 PET will be
           performed in the HER2-positive subgroup only, when signs of progressive disease are
           found at routine clinical evaluation or else latest after 12 months regardless of
           disease status, then using the ABY-025 peptide dose previously determined to be
           preferable.

        2. Group 2 Ten subjects with HER2-positive primary tumor status. [68Ga]ABY-025 PET is
           performed using the ABY-025 peptide dose determined to be preferable during the
           dose-finding part of the study, followed by a second [68Ga]ABY-025 PET investigation at
           signs of progressive disease or else latest after 9 months.
