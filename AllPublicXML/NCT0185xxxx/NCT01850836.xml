      To investigate the therapeutic effect of dual hemisphere repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) on post-stroke non fluent aphasia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients with subacute post-stroke non-fluent aphasia were randomly allocated with a
      ratio 2:1 to receive real (n = 20) or sham (n = 10) rTMS of the affected motor cortex. Each
      patient received 1000 rTMS pulses (1 Hertz at 110% of resting motor threshold) over the
      unaffected Broca's area and 1000 pulses (20 Hertz at 100% resting motor threshold) over
      affected left Broca's area for 10 consecutive days. LANGUAGE section of hemispheric stroke
      scale, Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire Hospital Version (SADQ-H) and NIH stroke scale
      were assessed before, post sessions, 1 and 2 months after the last session . Motor threshold
      was assessed before and after the end of last session.
