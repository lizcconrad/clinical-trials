      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and
      safety of an experimental intravenous medication, N-Rephasin® SAL200 in healthy male.
      Participants will include 36 male volunteers. Participants will be grouped according to
      dosage of N-Rephasin® SAL200 including placebo (0 mg/kg). Study procedures include: check of
      vital signs, reporting any experienced side effects, physical examination including
      assessment of the cardiovascular system, and blood sample collection for monitoring of
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and antibody production etc. Participants will be involved
      in study related procedures for up to 50 days after injection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of the safety of N-Rephasin® SAL200 in healthy human volunteers by 12 lead electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory values changes, monitoring of vital signs, and the occurrence of adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 50 days after administration</time_frame>
    <description>12-lead ECGs will be obtained using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures ventricular rate(/min), PR interval(msec), QRS duration(msec), QT/QTc interval(msec) etc.
Vital sign measurement: blood pressure, pulse rate and body temperature measurement.
Clinical laboratory test: hematological values(WBC with differential count, RBC(Red blood cell), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet), coagulation values (PT(INR), aPTT), serum biochemical values(calcium, phosphorus, glucose, BUN(blood urea nitrogen), uric acid, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALT(alanine amino transferase) , γ-GT(gamma-glutamyl transferase), CPK(creatine phosphokinase), LDH(lactate dehydrogenase), creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride), and urinalysis values (specific gravity, pH, albumin, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, blood, nitrite, urobilinogen, WBC, color, turbidity, with microscopy)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic evaluation of N-Rephasin® SAL200 at the administered doses by analysis of concentration of N-Rephasin® SAL200 in serum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to 2</time_frame>
    <description>PK(Pharmacokinetic) sampling is performed by specified timepoints in the protocol(pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24hrs-post dose).
Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Monitoring of serum antibacterial activity (micrograms per millilitre) of N-Rephasin® SAL200 over time at the administered doses by spot overlay method (i.e., antibacterial activity assay) using blood samples.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sampling will be performed by specified time-points in the protocol (1, 1.5, 2hrs-post dose).
Determination of serum antibacterial activity (micrograms per millilitre) of N-Rephasin® SAL200 will be accessed by qualitative comparison of halos formed after spotting blood samples onto the lawn of Staphylococcus aureus with those formed after spotting standards (0 ug/ml, 0.05 ug/ml, 0.1 ug/ml, 0.2 ug/ml, 0.4 ug/ml, 0.6 ug/ml, 0.8 ug/ml and 1 ug/ml), which are prepared by spiking of N-Rephasin® SAL200 into human serum.
Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 50 after administration</time_frame>
    <description>Blood sampling for analysis of production of anti-N-Rephasin® SAL200 antibody is performed at day 50 after administration.
Analysis is performed by specified protocol based on ELISA method.</description>
