      The main objective of the study is to:

      a. Determine if supplementation of tocotrienol compared to placebo has an effect on the
      symptoms of school going children with ADHD.

      The secondary objective is to:

        1. Determine if supplementation of tocotrienol compared to placebo has an effect on the
           dose of current medication used in school going children with ADHD.

        2. Determine the safety of tocotrienol in the study population.

        3. Determine if tocotrienol levels in children with ADHD correlate with their symptom
           scores.
