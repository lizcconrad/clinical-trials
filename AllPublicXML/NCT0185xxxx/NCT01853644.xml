    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well tivozanib works in treating patients with recurrent
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the clinical activity of tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant,
      recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determining the potential survival advantage and characterizing the safety of single agent
      tivozanib in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tivozanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses
      repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
