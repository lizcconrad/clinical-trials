    <textblock>
      Computed Tomographic (CT) urography is the best imaging modality to evaluate obstructing
      lesions of urinary tract such as urinary stone, tumor and inflammatory lesion. The purpose of
      our study is to compare images of CT urography performed by low voltage and low concentrated
      iodine CT contrast with them of conventional CT urography.

      Computed Tomographic (CT) urography is the best imaging modality to evaluate obstructing
      lesions of urinary tract such as urinary stone, tumor and inflammatory lesion. It is needed
      that CT urography should have the high contrast between target lesion described as filling
      defect and adjacent contrast filled urinary tract. For the implementation of high contras,
      conventional CT urography has been performed with higher voltage and higher concentrated CT
      contrast than another CT protocols. The higher voltage results in the more radiation
      exposure. And the intravenous injection of higher concentrated CT contrast results in the
      increase of the prevalence of contrast induced nephrotoxicity.

      The purpose of our study is to compare images of CT urography performed by low voltage and
      low concentrated iodine CT contrast with them of conventional CT urography.
