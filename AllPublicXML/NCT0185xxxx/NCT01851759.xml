      Using placebo as control, The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      methanesulfonic acid cinepazide injection to relieve disabled degree of acute cerebral
      infarction patients, and explore the best safe and effective dose as well as dose method.

    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 288 acute cerebral infarction patients. Patients will be assigned
      randomly to receive either Methanesulfonic acid cinepazide injection or placebo treatment.
      All patient in the study will receive standard of care treatment and clinical, diagnostic,
      laboratory, safety, and follow-up evaluations. Follow-up evaluations, including National
      Institute of Health stroke scale(NIHSS), Barthel index score and modified Rankin scale
      assessments, will be done periodically until 90 days after onset. The degree of disabled
      improved will be a primary measure of drug effectiveness.
