      This research is designed to assess if problem drinking by treatment seeking individuals can
      be treated (reduced) by kudzu extract pharmacotherapy plus medical management therapy.

    <textblock>
      Men and women participants, ages 21-60 yrs old and seeking treatment for their drinking, but
      otherwise physically and mentally healthy, will be recruited. Participants must meet criteria
      for heavy drinking* and either Alcohol Abuse or Alcohol Dependence according to DSM-IV
      criteria. Following a baseline period, participants will be randomized to take either kudzu
      extract or placebo for 10 weeks, and record and report their alcohol consumption. All
      participants will receive weekly medical management sessions with the study physician.

      *Heavy Drinking according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (2007) is
      more than 4 drinks per day and more than 14 drinks per week for men; and for women, more than
      3 drinks per day and more than 7 drinks per week.

    <description>Medical Management is a manualized treatment deriving from a number of empirically tested manualized therapies designed to approximate a primary care approach to alcohol dependence. The treatment, delivered by a medical professional (i.e., nurse or physician), monitors medication side effects, provides strategies to increase medication adherence and supports abstinence through psychoeducation and referral to groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The visits allow for assessments of drinking, overall functioning, medication adherence, and side effects. Also at one of these weekly visits, a blood sample will be taken for liver function tests (GGT, ALT, AST). Samples will be further analyzed for two measures of heavy drinking: carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) and phosphatidylethanol (PEth).</description>
