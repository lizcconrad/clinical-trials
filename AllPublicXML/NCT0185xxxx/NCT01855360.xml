  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of progression of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, as measured by changes in strain echocardiography, in a group of patients taking a combination of doxycycline and TUDCA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: * (FDAAA) outcome measure is assessed every 6 months by serial echocardiography, with final measurement 18 months after enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome measure, namely changes in longitudinal echocardiographic strain, will be compared to previously determined changes derived from a cohort of patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis who were not receiving specific therapy for amyloid deposition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of patients with adverse events to the medications over the period of therapy (18 months)</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of kidney function (BUN and creatinine) and blood counts will be done every 3 months.</description>

    <measure>To evaluate general and health related quality of life (QoL) in SSA and ATTR subjects.</measure>
