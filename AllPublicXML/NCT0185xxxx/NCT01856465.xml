    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes benign hepatic simple steatosis (SS) and
      steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterised by inflammation leading to fibrosis and
      cirrhosis. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, and the prevalence
      is 74-98% in morbidly obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery. Although steatosis
      improves post bariatric surgery, hepatic inflammation and fibrosis do not consistently
      improve. Alterations of the human gut flora (intestinal microbiota; IM) may play a role. One
      mechanism linking IM to obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and NAFLD is through translocation
      of bacterial lipopolisaccharide (LPS=endotoxin) into the blood stream (=endotoxemia), causing
      chronic inflammation. Morbidly obese subjects have different IM compared to lean controls,
      and the IM structure is significantly altered after bariatric surgery, probably due to a
      combination of anatomic changes, diet, and weight loss. For example, the ratio of
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes may be lower in obese subjects compared to lean controls and lower
      numbers of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were reported in some obese subjects before bariatric
      surgery, which increased 3 months post-surgery. This is of interest since, in animal studies,
      low abundance of F. prausnitzii, a butyrate producing bacterium, is associated with increased
      intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, and inflammation. To our knowledge, only two studies
      are available describing IM in patients pre and post bariatric surgery, and no data have been
      published on the relationship between IM and NAFLD in these patients.

      Study Design: A. Cross-sectional study: Sixty patients with morbid obesity undergoing
      bariatric surgery diagnosed with NAFLD on liver biopsy (30 SS, 30 NASH). Main hypothesis: The
      ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes is higher in stool samples from morbidly obese subjects
      with NASH compared to SS. Other differences in IM composition exist. Objective: to compare
      bacterial dynamics using Illumina technology to assess the IM. The relative abundance of the
      dominant fecal microorganisms (including Firmicutes, Archaea, Bacteroides, Bifidobacteria,
      Mollicutes, Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridia clusters, F. prausnitzii, Roseburia, and
      Lactobacilli) will also be assessed by real-time PCR. Sub-hypotheses: In NASH compared to SS,
      there will be: a) lower fecal butyrate concentration; b) higher endotoxin and other
      inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6) in plasma. Potential covariates assessed: small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), measured by glucose hydrogen breath test (GHBT), which can
      contribute to endotoxemia and inflammation; IR, diabetes status, lipid profile, plasma
      vitamin E, liver enzymes, anthropometry, food intake, physical activity and environmental
      factors.

      B. Prospective cohort study: Patients undergoing bariatric surgery with either SS or NASH (up
      to 60 of them recruited from Part A) will be followed prospectively over 12 months to assess
      changes in the IM and liver histology. Goal is to have 60 subjects who complete the study
      with a 2nd liver biopsy. Main Hypothesis: In morbidly obese patients with NAFLD (SS or NASH),
      changes in IM post bariatric surgery will be associated with changes in liver histology.
      Specifically, an increased number of F. prausnitzii in feces with be associated with
      improvement in liver histology while a reduction will be associated with deterioration of
      liver histology. Objective: To correlate changes in liver histology (NAFLD activity score
      [NAS], inflammation, fibrosis, steatosis) between 0 and 12 months with changes in F.
      prausnitzii. Other changes of the fecal IM community structure, fecal short chain fatty acids
      (including butyrate), plasma endotoxin, inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6) and SIBO will also
      be assessed, in addition to diet, activity, weight change, improvement of diabetes and plasma
      vitamin E. Secondary hypotheses: Increased number of F. prausnitzii in feces will be
      associated with increased fecal butyrate, lower serum endotoxin and lower inflammatory
      markers (TNF-α, IL-6) in plasma.

      Significance: In humans with morbid obesity and NAFLD undergoing bariatric surgery, very
      little data are available on IM and its metabolic effect and contribution to NAFLD. These
      studies will add more information regarding the role of IM and its effect on potential
      mechanisms contributing to NAFLD. It will also provide us with pilot data for future
      intervention studies assessing the potential use of pre- or probiotics for NAFLD in morbidly
      obese subjects in the setting of bariatric surgery.

        NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, and the prevalence is 74-98%
        in morbidly obese individuals. The aim of this study is to examine the role of intestinal
        microbiota (IM) in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in morbidly obese patients
        undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. Alterations of the human gut flora (intestinal
        microbiota) will be determined before and after surgery in realtion with the change of
        liver histology.
