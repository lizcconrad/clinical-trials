  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UX003-CL201 is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to assess the safety, efficacy, and dose of
      UX003 in MPS 7 patients via intravenous (IV) administration every other week (QOW) for 36
      weeks with up to an additional 36 weeks from the optional continuation period. Up to 5
      participants, who are between 5 and 30 years of age inclusive, will be enrolled and treated
      with UX003.

      The initial 12-week treatment period will be followed by a 24-week forced dose titration
      period to assess the optimal dose. Participants who complete both the initial treatment and
      forced dose titration periods will continue treatment in a 36- week continuation period.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Deaths, and Study/Treatment Discontinuations</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 242 weeks + 30 days. SAEs were recorded beginning at the time the subject signed the informed consent form through 30 days following the last study visit. Non-serious AEs were recorded from the time of informed consent through the last study visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, whether or not considered drug related. SAE: an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening AE; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Other important medical events may also, in the opinion of the Investigator, be considered SAEs. An AE was considered a TEAE if it occurred on or after the first dose, and was not present prior to the first dose, or it was present at the first dose but increased in severity during the study. Events recorded as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment were categorized as related. AE severity was graded using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03.</description>

    <description>During the initial 14-week treatment period of the study, participants receive 2 mg/kg UX003 every other week (QOW) for 12 weeks. At Week 14, participants continue on UX003 therapy and begin a forced dose titration period for an additional 24 weeks at the dose sequence of 1, 4, and 2 mg/kg UX003 QOW as follows: 1 mg/kg UX003 for 8 weeks beginning on Week 14; then 4 mg/kg UX003 for 8 weeks beginning on Week 22; then 2 mg/kg UX003 for 8 weeks beginning on Week 30. Following the 24 week forced dose titration period, participants who continue on treatment (continuation period) received 2 mg/kg UX003 QOW beginning at Week 38 for up to an additional 36 weeks.
After the first phase of the study, participants who elect to continue drug treatment are transitioned to the long-term extension phase, where they are treated with UX003 at 4 mg/kg beginning at Week 74, for up to an additional 168 weeks.</description>

          -  Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent, or in the case of
             subjects under the age of 18 (or 16 years, depending on the region), provide written
             assent (if required) and written informed consent by a legally authorized

             research-related procedures.

          -  Sexually active subjects must be willing to use an acceptable method of contraception
             while participating in the study.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study. Females considered not
             of childbearing potential include those who have had tubal ligation at least one year
             prior to Screening, or who have had total hysterectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has any degree of
             detectable chimaerism with donor cells.

          -  Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS or its excipients that, in the judgment of the
             Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or
             partner) at any time during the study.

          -  Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) within 30 days
             prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion
             of all scheduled study assessments at any time during the study.

          -  Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opinion of the Investigator, that
             it warrants immediate surgical intervention or other treatment or may not allow safe
             study participation.

          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places
             the subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study,
             or would interfere with study participation or affect safety.

            <description>During the initial 14-week treatment period of the study, participants received 2 mg/kg UX003 QOW for 12 weeks. At Week 14, participants continued on UX003 therapy and began a forced dose titration period for an additional 24 weeks at the dose sequence of 1, 4, and 2 mg/kg UX003 QOW as follows: 1 mg/kg UX003 for 8 weeks beginning on Week 14; then 4 mg/kg UX003 for 8 weeks beginning on Week 22; then 2 mg/kg UX003 for 8 weeks beginning on Week 30. Following the 24 week forced dose titration period, participants who continued on treatment (continuation period) received 2 mg/kg UX003 QOW beginning at Week 38 for up to an additional 36 weeks.
After the first phase of the study, participants who elected to continue drug treatment were transitioned to the long-term extension phase, where they were treated with UX003 at 4 mg/kg beginning at Week 74, for up to an additional 168 weeks.</description>

        <description>Adverse Event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, whether or not considered drug related. SAE: an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any dose results in any of the following outcomes: death; a life-threatening AE; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Other important medical events may also, in the opinion of the Investigator, be considered SAEs. An AE was considered a TEAE if it occurred on or after the first dose, and was not present prior to the first dose, or it was present at the first dose but increased in severity during the study. Events recorded as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment were categorized as related. AE severity was graded using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.03.</description>
        <time_frame>Up to 242 weeks + 30 days. SAEs were recorded beginning at the time the subject signed the informed consent form through 30 days following the last study visit. Non-serious AEs were recorded from the time of informed consent through the last study visit.</time_frame>
