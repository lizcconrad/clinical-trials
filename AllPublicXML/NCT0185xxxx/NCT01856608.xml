      Assessing the utility of the Team SA instrument in measuring the effectiveness of
      communication across disciplines during ICU rounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary rounds are events that occur daily in Intensive care units. During these
      events, practitioners from multiple disciplines meet at a pre-specified time to discuss
      current medical condition and plans of care. At the conclusion of these discussions, all
      practitioners are expected to understand the plan of care well enough to execute defined
      tasks, but also coordinate as circumstances change. In order to coordinate under changing
      circumstances practitioners must have a broader understanding of the current state of the
      patient and how likely certain deteriorations are. This synthetic understanding of patient
      risks across multi-provider groups has been described as anticipatory team situational
      awareness (Team SA). One instrument has been validated in the ICU as feasible and
      informative. This Team SA survey successfully identified that the time spent in &quot;training&quot;
      discussions improved Team SA across physician groups. The investigators' goal is to implement
      this survey across the investigators' medical ICU service to obtain a baseline estimate of
      how effective current communication patterns are for achieving concordant Team SA. If gaps in
      communication are encountered future interventions will be developed

        Daily census rosters of the MICU and 8ICU nursing units will be reviewed for occupancy. At
        8am on survey days occupied beds will be tallied (up to 39 beds). Beds occupied by a
        non-MICU service patient and those with active DNR-CC orders will be excluded. From the
        remaining patients, ten bed numbers will be randomly selected for review. Randomization
        will be stratified by MICU service sub-unit (MICU 40, MICU 90, 8ICU). If fewer than ten
        patients are eligible on an assigned survey day, all patients in the ICU on that day will
        be surveyed.
