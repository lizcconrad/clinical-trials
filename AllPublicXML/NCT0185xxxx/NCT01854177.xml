  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies we demonstrated that endogenous opioids (inhibitory neuropeptides)
      modulate the perception of breathing difficulty in patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) (ERJ 2009;33:771; J COPD 2011;8:160). Recently, we found that
      antagonism of substance P (an excitatory neuropeptide) with aprepitant did not affect the
      perception of breathing difficulty. However, after administration of aprepitant, blood levels
      of both substance P(+ 54 ± 39%) and beta-endorphin (+ 27 ± 17%) increased significantly. As
      these blood levels reflect cellular/tissue activity, we postulated that the concomitant
      release of excitatory (substance P) and inhibitory (beta-endorphin) neuropeptides had
      opposing effects (counterbalanced each other) on the perception of breathing difficulty.

      The objective of the present study is to further examine the possible role of substance P on
      the perception of breathlessness. We propose to administer oral aprepitant and oral placebo
      in a randomized clinical trial in patients with COPD. However, four hours after patients take
      these medications, intravenous naloxone will be administered in order to block the effects of
      endogenous opioids (beta-endorphin) on opioid receptors. Five minutes later, patients will
      breathe thru a tube with fine wire mesh to provoke breathing difficulty, and then provide
      ratings of the intensity and unpleasantness of breathlessness every minute.

      The two competing hypothesis of the study are:

        1. if breathlessness ratings with aprepitant/naloxone = placebo/naloxone, then substance P
           has no effect on perception of breathing difficulty;

        2. if breathlessness ratings with aprepitant/naloxone ≠ placebo/naloxone, then substance P
           has an effect on perception of breathing difficulty.

      This study is a randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing the acute effects of oral
      aprepitant (selective antagonist of substance P receptor) vs. placebo on ratings of
      breathlessness during resistive load breathing in patients with COPD. Four hours after
      randomization, all patients will receive intravenous naloxone (antagonist of opioid
      receptors) to block the effects of endogenous opioids on perception of breathlessness. The
      two competing hypothesis of the study are:

      Breathing difficulty will be induced by the patient breathing thru a tube with fine wire mesh
      for approximately 10 - 20 minutes in the laboratory (J COPD 2011;8:160).

      Approximately 20 patients with COPD will be recruited from the out-patient clinic at the
      Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. The population will consist of female or male adults at
      least 50 years of age, at least 10 pack-year history of smoking, and a diagnosis of COPD
      associated with chronic bronchitis based on standard criteria.
