      inflammation induced by the allergy season and prevent the changes in the microbiome caused
      by the allergy season.

    <measure>Symptoms of sneezing, rhinitis, nasal congestion and nasal itching</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom scores will be recorded by subjects twice daily during the trial. Subjects report four symptoms: sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and nasal itching on a scale from 0 to 3 (0= no symptoms, 1= mild symptoms, 2= moderate symptoms, 3= severe symptoms).</description>
