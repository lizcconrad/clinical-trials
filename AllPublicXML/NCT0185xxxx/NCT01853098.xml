  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is a proof-of-concept study to test whether a novel
      mindfulness based intervention, Positive Affect Training (PAT), can enhance positive affect
      and compassion, and decrease negative affect and feelings of depression. PAT involves a
      combination of practicing mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation in groups.
      The goal of the research is to test the initial feasibility and efficacy in increasing
      positive affect and decreasing negative affect in individuals recruited from the general
      community who experience negative affect. If the training proves to be successful, we will
      test the intervention, in additional studies, on individuals with dysthymic disorder and
      other clinical disorders. PAT is a cost-effective, non-invasive intervention. Therefore if
      effective, it could be an alternative or supplemental intervention option to existing
      psychotherapy for dysthymic disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and mindfulness meditation, in which PAT is rooted, are
      derived from Buddhist practices that have been empirically shown to have applications in
      improving mental health. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, mindfulness based CBT was
      shown to decrease stress, negative affect, and chronic pain in both psychiatric and
      non-psychiatric subjects. Mindfulness-based therapy has since been shown to be effective for
      treating mood and anxiety disorders. Only recently has LKM been examined as an intervention
      for affective symptoms. This meditation practice seems to be particularly suited for reducing
      negative affect while also enhancing positive affect in individuals who show emotional
      dysregulation, such as people with dysthymic disorder. This notion is supported by
      experimental studies suggesting that LKM decreases anxiety and stress, positively influences
      emotional responses to neutral stimuli, and promotes positive emotions such as trust, love,
      hope, and compassion. Dr. Fredrickson, a prominent researcher and social psychologist who is
      the foremost expert in LKM will serve as an outside consultant for the development of the
      protocol. She is not listed as an official collaborator because she will not be in direct
      contact with the participant data that the investigators will collect.

      The intervention the investigators plan to develop, Positive Affect Training (PAT), combines
      mindfulness and LKM, with a strong emphasis on the latter. The investigators will adopt
      strategies that have been described in a previous LKM protocol for trauma victims. The
      investigators contacted Dr. Kearney who shared his manual with us. Given the impressive
      effect LKM seems to have on generating positive, and attenuating negative affect in
      experimental studies, the investigators plan to test PAT as a method of improving positive
      affect. The current study aims to test the initial efficacy of PAT in individuals who report
      experiencing a low mood. The investigators hypothesize significant improvement in subjects'
      self-reported ratings of negative and positive affect as a result of the intervention.

    <description>During the PAT sessions, the participants will be taught the basics of mindfulness and how to concentrate their thoughts and feelings on the present moment in a non-judgmental fashion. As the therapy sessions continue, participants will be introduced to basic loving-kindness meditation (LKM). They will be taught to identify and focus the positive feelings they have when they are around someone or something they care about, and transfer these feelings first to themselves, then to a close friend, to a neutral individual, to people whom they dislike, and finally to all living beings.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Responds positively to the question on the recruitment material (flyer and posting):
             &quot;Have you been feeling depressed or in a low mood for most of the day, more days than
             not, nearly every day for 1 year or longer?&quot;

          -  Must have a negative affect scale score of the PANAS of at least 21.6 (1 SD above the
             mean of normative sample)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with a BDI score of 30 or higher (more than moderate depression) will be
             excluded.

          -  Participants who are at risk of harming themselves will be excluded from participating
             in the study. Suicidality will be assessed after obtaining consent during the
             screening visit. In addition, the Beck Depression Inventory will be examined for
             self-reported suidicality. If a participant is found to have suicidal ideation, the PI
             will be contacted immediately and appropriate follow-up care will be provided by
             referring the participant to the ER.

          -  Participants will be assessed through a phone screen using questions from the Anxiety
             Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS) for disorders that could impose a safety risk for
             the participants or others (e.g., bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc). Subjects who
             endorse &quot;yes&quot; responses to phone screen items will be excluded.

          -  Participants who are receiving any psychiatric or psychological treatment for a mood
             or anxiety disorder at the time of the assessment will be excluded from the study.
             Participants who initiate such treatments while being enrolled in the study will be
             closely monitored. These participants will be allowed to remain in the study, but will
             later be excluded from the data analyses. They are allowed to remain in the study for
             ethical reasons and because the present trial is a proof-of-concept study and not a
             clinical trial.
