      The primary goal of this project is to determine if an innovative behavioral weight loss
      program that incorporates new developments from the field of behavior therapy produces
      superior weight control than standard behavioral treatment. A sample of 200 adults from the
      community are participating in this study.

          -  Successfully complete all steps in the enrollment process

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  You have a medical condition or psychiatric condition that may limit your ability to
             comply with the behavioral recommendations of the program or pose a risk to you during
             weight loss.

          -  You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant in the next three years.

          -  Report recently beginning a course of or changing the dosage of prescription
             medications that can cause significant weight loss or weight gain.

          -  You are participating in or plan to participate in another weight loss program in the
             next three years.

          -  The research team identifies any factors that would render you potentially unable or
             unlikely to follow the protocol, or unable to benefit from it.
