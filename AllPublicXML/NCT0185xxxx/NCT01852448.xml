  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is associated with worse CF-relevant outcomes.

      The mechanisms underlying CFRD development are not fully understood, but recent evidence
      suggests Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) mechanisms may be involved and may involve incretins
      (gut secreted hormones that augment insulin secretion in response to a nutrient load).

      This study will examine the prevalence of Genome wide association study (GWAS)-implicated
      T2DM alleles (including TCF7L2) across the spectrum of glucose abnormalities in CF and will
      use this information to compare incretin and insulin secretion in non-diabetic children and
      adults with high risk and low risk alleles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CFRD is associated with worse nutritional status, greater pulmonary function decline, and
      increased mortality, highlighting its relevance in CF and arises primarily from compromised
      insulin secretion--traditionally considered a by-product of pancreatic exocrine tissue damage
      and fibrosis. Recent developments in the field of diabetes are propelling a re-examination of
      this basic explanation. Genome-wide association studies have associated genetic variants in
      TCF7L2, a transcription factor implicated in enteroendocrine function, with increased
      susceptibility to T2DM and CFRD.

      The Objectives of this study are to perform targeted sequencing of TCF7L2 and other
      GWAS-associated T2DM genes in the pediatric and adult CF populations and then to compare
      insulin secretory capacity, β-cell sensitivity to glucose, and incretin secretion in
      non-diabetic CF subjects with high and low-risk alleles.

      Phase 1 will include 350 subjects (Children age&gt;= 2 years, adolescents, and adults) for
      TCF7L2 genotype and ten other GWAS-implicated T2DM genes. The distribution of TCF7L2 and
      other GWAS-implicated T2 DM genes across the spectrum of glucose abnormalities will be
      described. Phase 1 requires a single blood sample and review of medical records.

      Phase 2 will include a subset of 30 non-diabetic children (age &gt;8) and adults who will have
      insulin and incretin secretion studies performed to look at how the body secretes insulin and
      other hormones in relation to having or not having these &quot;diabetes&quot; genes. These studies
      include Glucose Potentiated Arginine Tests (GPA, which measures β-cell secretory capacity and
      sensitivity to glucose) and Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT, which measures incretin and
      insulin secretion).
