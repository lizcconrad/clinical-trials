      Adherence to antiviral treatment in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is an important factor to
      achieve sustained virological response (SVR). The aim of our study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of a multidisciplinary support program (MSP) in adherence to and efficacy of
      pegylated interferon alfa-2a and ribavirin compared to the conventional approach. We assessed
      447 patients with CHC receiving antiviral treatment distributed into 3 groups: control group
      (recruited 2002-2004, n= 147), MSP-pilot group (recruited 2005-2006, n=131), and
      MSP-validation group (recruited 2007-2009, n=169).

      MSP-validation group (follow-up 2007-2009, n=169).A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed
      using a Markov model.

    <measure>Adherence to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>48 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherent patients were defined as those receiving equal or more than 80% of total dose of pegylated interferon (180 microg/week) and ribavirin (1200 mg/d) during equal o more than 80% of duration treatment (48 weeks).
Non-adherent patients were defined as those receiving less than 80% of total dose of pegylated interferon (180 microg/week) and ribavirin (1200 mg/d) during less than 80% of duration treatment (48 weeks).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of treatment measured by sustained virological response</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 72 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy end point was to evaluate the sustained virological response (SVR) of antiviral treatment.
SVR was defined as undetectable hepatitis C virus viral load (&lt;15 IU/ml) 24 weeks after treatment completion.
Non-SVR was defined as detectable hepatitis C virus viral load (&gt;15 IU/ml) 24 weeks after treatment completion.</description>
