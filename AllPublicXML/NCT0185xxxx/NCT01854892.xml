  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care and accounts
      for over 3.7 million physician visits/year in the U.S. alone. Ninety percent of adults will
      experience low back pain in their lifetime, 50% will experience recurrent LBP, and 10% will
      develop chronic pain and related disability.

      While there is growing evidence for the clinical effectiveness of alternative and
      complementary therapies to treat low back pain, little is known on the physiologic
      consequences and effects of these treatments. Further, additional data is needed to
      understand how these different treatment techniques effect clinical changes in pain and
      disability. The lack of empirical data hinders acceptance by the wider scientific and
      health-care communities, and it also limits the development of rational strategies for using
      alternative and complementary therapies.
