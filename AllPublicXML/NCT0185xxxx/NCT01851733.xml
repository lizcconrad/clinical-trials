  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided laser surgery (MLA)
      and doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
      The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a separation of circulating blood from the tissue of the
      central nervous system, preventing substances in the blood from entering the brain. MLA
      disrupts the BBB around the tumor which may allow cancer-killing substances to be carried
      directly to the tumor and the surrounding area. Using MLA prior to chemotherapy may result in
      a greater concentration of drug in the tumor to kill the cancer cells while limiting side
      effects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate imaging techniques (MRI) and blood tests (biomarkers) to help figure out the best
      time for chemotherapy to be initiated after the blood brain barrier is disrupted, as it is
      immediately following a procedure like MRI-guided laser ablation (MLA-Monteris Neuroblate).
