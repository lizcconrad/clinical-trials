    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study evaluating the performance of
      the Albuterol Spiromax dose counter in patients with a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the functionality, reliability, and accuracy of the
      Albuterol Spiromax inhaler integrated dose counter in a clinical setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening/run-in period where, after meeting study criteria, patients
      enter a run-in period lasting 7 to 14 ±2 days, during which diary and medication compliance,
      as well as inhaler technique, will be assessed. The run-in period will commence the day
      following the completion of all screening procedures and will continue through to and include
      the day prior to the first treatment visit (TV1) such that a minimum of 7 full days of diary
      data will be collected prior to TV1. The purpose of the run-in period is to assess compliance
      with a BID dosing regimen and with the completion of the diary entries over a minimum period
      of 7 days. Patients who demonstrate adequate inhaler technique and who are at least 90%
      compliant with dosing and completion of the diary on the last 7 consecutive days of run-in
      will qualify for enrollment into the open-label study. The study treatment period will
      comprise 6 treatment visits (TV1-TV6) for all enrolled patients except those in the 5-week
      treatment cohort who will have only 5 treatment visits (TV1-TV5). Patients may continue
      taking their current asthma or COPD medications throughout the Treatment Period. The patient
      will return to the clinic on Days 8 (±1), 15 (±1), 22 (±1), and 36 (±1), and then on Day 50
      (-2) after approximately all 200 doses have been delivered, or until early withdrawal. The
      patient will be deemed to have completed the study if at least 90% of the recommended doses
      contained in Albuterol Spiromax with dose-counter were used. A representative sample
      (approximately 15%) of patients will participate in the trial for approximately 5 weeks with
      Day 36 (±1) being the final study visit.

    <measure>Dosing Discrepancies Per 200 Dose Cycles: Dose Cycle Not Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome measures how often the dose cycle was not counted: the participant completes a full dose cycle (opens the mouthpiece cap, inhales the medication, and closes the mouthpiece cap) but the counter display does not advance (i.e., does not count down) within a dosing session. The discrepancy rate was calculated as &quot;number of discrepancies/total number of dose cycles&quot; *200.</description>

    <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome measures when the inhaler counter reading increases, instead of decreases, after the participant has executed the dose cycle (i.e., the ending counter reading is greater than the beginning counter reading within a dosing session). The discrepancy rate was calculated as &quot;number of discrepancies/total number of dose cycles&quot; *200.</description>

    <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome measures when the inhaler counter advances (decreases, e.g., 50 to 48) between dosing sessions but the participant has not knowingly executed the dose cycle (i.e., the counter number at the beginning of the dosing session is less than the counter number at the end of the previous dosing session). The discrepancy rate was calculated as &quot;number of discrepancies/total number of dose cycles&quot; *200.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome measures when the inhaler counter counts upwards (number increases, e.g. 50 to 52) rather than downward between dosing sessions but the participant has not knowingly executed the dose cycle (i.e., the counter number at the beginning of the dosing session is greater than the counter number at the end of the previous dosing session). The discrepancy rate was calculated as &quot;number of discrepancies/total number of dose cycles&quot; *200.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Value of Total Discrepancy Size Per Inhaler</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome is calculated for each inhaler as &quot;beginning counter reading minus end counter reading&quot; minus &quot;patient-recorded number of dose cycles&quot;. The total inhaler discrepancy size is an important measure because it provides the most relevant means of ensuring that the inhaler does not exhaust its supply of albuterol before the counter has recorded the labeled 200 doses.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 50</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) summarized in this table are those that began or worsened after treatment with study drug (treatment-emergent AEs). An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <title>Dosing Discrepancies Per 200 Dose Cycles: Dose Cycle Not Count</title>
        <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome measures how often the dose cycle was not counted: the participant completes a full dose cycle (opens the mouthpiece cap, inhales the medication, and closes the mouthpiece cap) but the counter display does not advance (i.e., does not count down) within a dosing session. The discrepancy rate was calculated as “number of discrepancies/total number of dose cycles” *200.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 50</time_frame>
        <population>Per protocol population includes all data from randomized participants who have not experienced major protocol violations prior to dosing with at least 180 inhaled doses. Participants in the 35-day subgroup are excluded from the PP population, as they will only have taken approximately 140 doses during the study.</population>

          <title>Dosing Discrepancies Per 200 Dose Cycles: Dose Cycle Not Count</title>
          <description>The purpose of the study is to determine if the dose counter on Albuterol Spiromax is counting accurately; accuracy is determined by concordance/agreement between patient-reported Albuterol Spiromax counter readings and patient-reported dose cycles recorded in patient diaries. This outcome measures how often the dose cycle was not counted: the participant completes a full dose cycle (opens the mouthpiece cap, inhales the medication, and closes the mouthpiece cap) but the counter display does not advance (i.e., does not count down) within a dosing session. The discrepancy rate was calculated as “number of discrepancies/total number of dose cycles” *200.</description>
          <population>Per protocol population includes all data from randomized participants who have not experienced major protocol violations prior to dosing with at least 180 inhaled doses. Participants in the 35-day subgroup are excluded from the PP population, as they will only have taken approximately 140 doses during the study.</population>

An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>
