  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this clinical trial is to test if adding pertuzumab (Perjeta), improves the
      anticancer activity of the combination chemotherapy regimen of trastuzumab (Herceptin)
      concomitant with paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide (T-FEC). The
      study will also test the safety of this therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive 6 months of T-FEC chemotherapy concomitant with trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab before surgery. Subsequently, subjects will undergo surgery to remove any cancer
      from the breast and axillary lymph nodes that may have survived the chemotherapy. It is
      expected that the majority of women will have no viable cancer left in the breast or lymph
      nodes by the time all chemotherapy is completed.

    <measure>Pathologic Complete Response</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) when pertuzumab is added to weekly trastuzumab/paclitaxel followed by trastuzumab/5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer. This study will assess pCR rates separately in ER+ and ER- cancers. Pathologic complete response is defined as no evidence of viable invasive tumor cells at the primary tumor site and axillary lymph nodes in the surgical specimen. Residual Disease (RD) is defined as: Any invasive cancer in the breast or axillary lymph nodes in the surgical specimen.</description>

        of invasive tumor cells or, (ii) Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) result of more

          -  Patients who are high risk for developing the following anthracycline, paclitaxel,
             trastuzumab or pertuzumab related toxicities including:

        History of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy, uncontrolled
