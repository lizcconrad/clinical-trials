    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate kidney transplant candidates' comprehension about
      increased risk donor kidneys necessary for informed consent. We have developed a web-based
      tool that educates and assesses candidates' comprehension (Inform Me), as a supplement to
      current informed consent processes. We will then compare the effectiveness of the current
      informed consent processes supplemented by Inform Me, with the current consent processes
      alone for kidney transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The shortage of kidneys for kidney transplantation results in almost 10,000 deaths per year
      in the United States. One strategy to increase the number of available kidneys is to offer
      kidney transplant candidates kidneys that come from donors who have an increased risk of
      transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Increased
      risk kidney donors are defined as those who have engaged in behaviors associated with an
      increased risk of HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, and comprise approximately 9% of all US
      deceased organ donors. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy mandated
      informed consent from recipients who accept increased risk kidneys. The objective of this
      study is to increase study participants' comprehension about increased risk donor kidneys
      necessary for informed consent. To accomplish this objective, we will develop a web-based
      tool that educates and assesses participants' comprehension (Inform Me), as a supplement to
      current informed consent processes. We will then compare the effectiveness of the current
      informed consent processes supplemented by Inform Me, with the current consent processes
      alone. The tool will utilize health information technology to deliver information about the
      definition of, risks, benefits, and alternatives to using increased risk donor kidneys via a
      web-based application. Computer adaptive learning will personalize information presented to
      each candidate according to his/her comprehension levels in interactive chapters to increase
      comprehension. Inform Me will facilitate nurses' primary role as patient educators.

    <description>The purpose of Inform Me is to help kidney transplant candidates understand what kidneys from increased risk donors are and describes the risks and benefits of accepting and refusing a kidney from an increased risk donor. Increased risk donors are donors who engaged in behaviors that increase their chances of having: Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis B Virus , Hepatitis C Virus. Inform Me focuses only on increased risk donor kidneys. Inform Me aims to prepare patients to make a decision with their transplant team to accept or to refuse a kidney from an increased risk donor. Inform Me does not try to convince patients to accept or refuse a kidney from increased risk donors.</description>

          -  Kidney Transplant candidates eligible: 1) completed the first phase of transplant
             evaluation education, and 2) wait-listed patients expected to receive a transplant
             within the next 6 months, returning for re-evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No special classes of study participants, including fetuses, neonates, prisoners,
             institutionalized individuals, or other vulnerable populations will be included in the
             proposed study. Although pregnant women will be eligible for participation in the
             study, they are unlikely to be selected for kidney transplantation.
