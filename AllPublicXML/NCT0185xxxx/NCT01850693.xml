      This study is to evaluate the prevalence, plaque characteristics (plaque types, stenosis
      degree, remodeling) and predictors of coronary atherosclerosis in stroke patients with
      coronary CT angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD) share common risk factors and pathological
      mechanisms. CAD is an important cause of death in patients with stroke.

      Currently, coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is very useful non-invasive tool for detection of
      CAD and plaque analysis.

      Therefore, the investigators aimed to evaluate the prevalence, plaque characteristics (plaque
      types, stenosis degree, remodeling) and predictors of CAD in stroke patients through
      follow-up (more than 5 years) using CCTA.
