    <description>Nebulized budesonide 1 mg b.i.d. thrice a week for four months. Patients will also receive a metered dose inhaler of formoterol/budesonide (6/200) at a dose of 2 puffs b.i.d. and as and when required [max 10 puff/day]</description>

    <description>Amphotericin B deoxycholate (50 mg) will be dissolved in 10 mL sterile water for injection (5 mg/mL). The solution remains stable for at least 7 days at 2째C to 8째C. Ten milligrams of the drug (2 mL) will be nebulized over 10-15 minutes twice in a day for three times a week (Effective dose: 10 mg b.i.d. thrice a week) using a jet nebulizer. Nebulized budesonide will be administered at a dose of 1 mg b.i.d. thrice a week after nebulization with amphotericin B. The total duration of therapy would last 4 months. Patients will also receive a metered dose inhaler of formoterol/budesonide (6/200) at a dose of 2 puffs b.i.d. and as and when required [max 10 puff/day].
The first dose will be administered under direct supervision.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive only nebulized budesonide 1 mg b.i.d. thrice a week for four months. Patients will also receive a metered dose inhaler of formoterol/budesonide (6/200) at a dose of 2 puffs b.i.d. and as and when required [max 10 puff/day]. The first dose will be administered under direct supervision. If the first dose is tolerated, therapy would be continued for the total duration of the study (4 months). The patient will be advised to clean the nebulizer chamber with soap and water after each administration to avoid contamination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: ABPA in remission defined as follows:

          1. Age 12-65 years

          2. Diagnosis of ABPA in the Chest Clinic

          3. Received glucocorticoids for management of ABPA according to the Chest clinic protocol
             (0.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, 0.25 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, 0.125 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks,
             subsequently taper and stop steroids over the next 4 weeks).

             levels after four months of steroid therapy would serve as the baseline
