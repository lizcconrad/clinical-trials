    <textblock>
      The study consists of a Phase1b lead-in portion to determine the MTD of OMP-59R5 in
      combination with EP for 6 cycles followed a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized,
      placebo-controlled portion comparing the efficacy and safety of OMP-59R5 in combination with
      EP for 6 cycles followed by single agent OMP-59R5 relative to EP alone for 6 cycles in
      subjects receiving first-line therapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer.

                  in situ cervical cancer

               2. Adequately treated stage I cancer from which the subject is currently in
                  remission, or

               3. Any other cancer from which the subject has been disease-free for ≥ 3 years
