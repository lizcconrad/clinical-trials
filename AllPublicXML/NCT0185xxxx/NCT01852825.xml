  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect on various biomarkers of treatment with
      MK-8237 in participants with allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. In Part 1 of the study
      healthy participants undergo nasal allergen challenge (NAC) with house dust mite (HDM)
      extract in order to verify the operational performance of NAC and associated sample
      collection methods. Part 2, the main study, is a placebo controlled, double blind study of
      participants with HDM-induced allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis. The primary
      hypotheses are that the changes from baseline in post-allergen challenge HDM-specific
      Immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) and Immunoglobulin E blocking factor (IgE-BF) are greater after
      treatment with MK-8237 than after treatment with placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in D. Farinae HDM-specific IgG4 Antibodies in Serum at 12 Weeks (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with Dermatophagoides (D.) farinae HDM and then with MK-8237 or placebo, and the amount of HDM-specific IgG4 antibodies in serum at baseline and at week 12 were measured. Fold change from baseline was evaluated based on constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) method with log transformed data. The model included time (categorical variable), treatment, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participants as random effect. Least squares geometric means are presented. It is hypothesized that the change from baseline is statistically greater with MK-8237 treatment than with placebo. This hypothesis is supported if the lower bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean fold difference is &gt;1.0.</description>

    <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with D. pteronyssinus HDM, and then with MK-8237 or placebo, and the amount of HDM-specific IgG4 antibodies in serum at baseline and at week 12 were measured. Fold change from baseline was evaluated based on cLDA method with log transformed data. The model included time (categorical variable), treatment, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participants as random effect. Least squares geometric means are presented.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in HDM-specific IgE Blocking Factor (IgE-BF) in Serum at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with D. pteronyssinus and D.farinae HDM and then with either MK-8237 or placebo, and the amount of IgE-BF in serum was measured based on an Ordinary IgE measurement and an assay in the presence of Competitors; with IgE-BF = 1 - (Competitive IgE/Ordinary IgE). This ranges from 0 (no IgE blocked) to 1 (all IgE blocked); and as it is based on a ratio there are no units. Change from baseline (12 weeks minus baseline) was evaluated based on cLDA method, and was analyzed based on the original scale. The model included time (categorical variable), treatment, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participants as random effect. It is hypothesized that the change from baseline is statistically greater with MK-8237 treatment than with placebo. This hypothesis is supported if the lower bound of the 1-tailed 95% CI around the 12 week mean difference in change from baseline in HDM-specific IgE blocking factor response excludes zero.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 6.5 Hours Post-NAC Interleukin-5 (IL-5) Protein Concentration in Nasal Exudates Following 12 Weeks of Treatment (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with D. pteronyssinus and D.farinae HDM and then with either MK-8237 or placebo, and the levels of Il-5 protein 6.5 hours after NAC in serum at baseline and at week 12 were measured. Fold change from baseline and between-treatment comparison was evaluated based on cLDA method with log transformed data. IL-5 protein concentration was measured in nasal exudates collected both pre- and post-nasal challenge. Least squares geometric means are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 6.5 Hours Post-NAC Nasal Epithelial Eosinophil-related Messenger RNA (mRNA) Signature Following 12 Weeks of Treatment (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with D. pteronyssinus and D.farinae HDM and then with either MK-8237 or placebo, and the levels of nasal epithelial eosinophil-related mRNA signature 6.5 hours after NAC in serum at baseline and at week 12 were measured. The mRNA signature is derived from nine gene transcripts which were measured using the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay. Positive control and pre-specified housekeeping gene normalization methods recommended by nSolver were used to normalize the transcripts. The average of the expression level of the nine genes was used to describe the eosinophil mRNA signature. Fold change from baseline and between-treatment comparison was evaluated based on cLDA method with log transformed data. Least squares geometric means are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Time Weighted Average (TWA) Over 1 Hour Pre-NAC Through 1 Hour Post-NAC Visual Analog Score (VAS) for Sneezing, Rhinorrhea, Congestion and Nasal Itch Following 12 Weeks of Treatment (Part 2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) representing the spectrum of symptoms from absent (0) to extremely severe (100) for each of rhinorrhea, nasal blockage, sneezing and nasal itch were summed to obtain an overall score. The range of VAS overall score is 0 - 400, with higher numbers representing worse symptoms. The models for the time-weighted mean (TWA) of the summed scores over 1 hour pre-NAC through hour 1 following NAC were constructed at the original scale.</description>

        <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with Dermatophagoides (D.) farinae HDM and then with MK-8237 or placebo, and the amount of HDM-specific IgG4 antibodies in serum at baseline and at week 12 were measured. Fold change from baseline was evaluated based on constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) method with log transformed data. The model included time (categorical variable), treatment, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participants as random effect. Least squares geometric means are presented. It is hypothesized that the change from baseline is statistically greater with MK-8237 treatment than with placebo. This hypothesis is supported if the lower bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the geometric mean fold difference is &gt;1.0.</description>

        <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with D. pteronyssinus and D.farinae HDM and then with either MK-8237 or placebo, and the amount of IgE-BF in serum was measured based on an Ordinary IgE measurement and an assay in the presence of Competitors; with IgE-BF = 1 - (Competitive IgE/Ordinary IgE). This ranges from 0 (no IgE blocked) to 1 (all IgE blocked); and as it is based on a ratio there are no units. Change from baseline (12 weeks minus baseline) was evaluated based on cLDA method, and was analyzed based on the original scale. The model included time (categorical variable), treatment, and time by treatment interaction as fixed effects and participants as random effect. It is hypothesized that the change from baseline is statistically greater with MK-8237 treatment than with placebo. This hypothesis is supported if the lower bound of the 1-tailed 95% CI around the 12 week mean difference in change from baseline in HDM-specific IgE blocking factor response excludes zero.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 6.5 Hours Post-NAC Nasal Epithelial Eosinophil-related Messenger RNA (mRNA) Signature Following 12 Weeks of Treatment (Part 2)</title>
        <description>Blood was collected from participants treated with D. pteronyssinus and D.farinae HDM and then with either MK-8237 or placebo, and the levels of nasal epithelial eosinophil-related mRNA signature 6.5 hours after NAC in serum at baseline and at week 12 were measured. The mRNA signature is derived from nine gene transcripts which were measured using the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay. Positive control and pre-specified housekeeping gene normalization methods recommended by nSolver were used to normalize the transcripts. The average of the expression level of the nine genes was used to describe the eosinophil mRNA signature. Fold change from baseline and between-treatment comparison was evaluated based on cLDA method with log transformed data. Least squares geometric means are presented.</description>
