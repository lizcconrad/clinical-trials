    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the change in Disability Rating Scale over 4 weeks. The Disability Rating Scale is a commonly used and reliable instrument for monitoring minor changes occurring throughout the course of a patient's recovery (Rappaport et al., 1982).</description>
