      The study purpose is to test the hypothesis that Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
      (CP-CML) patients with stable Complete Molecular Response (CMR) who discontinue Dasatinib
      treatment are able to maintain a sustained remission in the long-term, with undetectable or
      minimally detectable BCR-ABL residual disease.
