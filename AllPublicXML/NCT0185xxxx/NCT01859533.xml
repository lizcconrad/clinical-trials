  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluating the effect of early application of Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via
      Neopuff in cases of transient tachypnea of the newborn(TTN) and its role in decreasing the
      duration and complication of TTN.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether positive end expiratory pressure therapy (PEEP)
      administered early via a T piece based infant resuscitator (Neopuff) would safely reduce the
      incidence of TTN and the need for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission of near term
      and term infants with respiratory distress.
