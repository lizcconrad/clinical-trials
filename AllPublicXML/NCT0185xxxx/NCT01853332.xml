      Research Procedures: If a patient choose to take part in this research study, they will
      undergo these research procedures:

      The patient will participate in a total of two meetings and four phone calls over the course
      of the study (two and a half years). The meetings will be held at the beginning and end of
      the two and a half year period. The first part of each meeting will take place at Beth Israel
      Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) where they will sign this consent form and then be
      interviewed for medical history, given a physical examination, and have blood tests described
      below. The patient will then be transported to Judge Baker Children's Center (JBCC), where
      they will have lunch, complete questionnaires, and participate in taped interviews
      (approximately 4 hours). The phone calls will be approximately every six months and the
      patient will be contacted by the people at JBCC. More detailed information on the study
      procedures is outlined below and on the JBCC consent form for the study.

      Interviews, Questionnaires, and Phone calls: These aspects of the study are covered in the
      Judge Baker Children's Center consent form. Briefly, the patient will be asked to discuss
      relationships with their partner, family, and friends, their career, their current goals in
      life, their health status, etc. These sessions will be recorded so that the patient's answers
      can be coded and analyzed at a later time. All information will be kept strictly
      confidential.

      Medical Examination: The patient will arrive fasting to the medical examination. During the
      medical exam, a physician will ask the patient questions about their physical health and
      family history. The doctor will then conduct a physical examination which includes:

        1. Glucose finger stick for diabetes screening

        2. Vital signs (such as blood pressure) and anthropometrics (such as waist circumference).

        3. Measuring the amount of fat in the patient's body using bioelectrical impedance
           analysis. This test will measure the resistance to the naturally occurring flow of
           electrical currents within the nerves and muscles using a few electrical sensors
           (similar to the EKG) attached to the patient's wrist and ankle for less than a minute.
           This procedure is not painful and uses the same principle as weighing oneself on a scale
           that provides body mass index.

        4. Measuring the patient body's ability to use sugar through an oral glucose tolerance test
           (OGTT). A nurse will place an intravenous (IV) catheter (a small tube) in the patient's
           arm. It will be taped to stay in place for approximately four hours. The patient will
           drink a mixed nutrient drink called Boost. The patient's blood will be drawn through the
           catheter 15 min after the Boost is given and then at 30-minute intervals for 3 hours to
           measure how they metabolize the nutrient drink.

        5. EKG

    <description>Correlations of scales with BMI score. Cumulative adversity occurring before age 18 was assessed using a) the Evaluation of Lifetime Stressors, b) SCID, and c) the Adult Attachment Interview. A cumulative adversity sum score was obtained (range 0-13; higher is more adversity). An overall adversity score was created by multiplying the number of childhood adversities × the overall severity of childhood adversity × the overall chronicity of childhood adversity. Scores for overall adversity ranged from 0 to 156 (higher is more adversity). The Social Adjustment Scale is a semi-structured interview assessing functioning in the preceding 2 months and ranges from 1 (excellent adjustment) to 7 (very poor adjustment). Psychosocial risk factors is an index of 1 to 3 (higher is more risk). Health risk score adds smoking, non-optimal drinking (&gt;7/14 drinks/week for women/men), a score in the bottom tertile of the AHEI, and minimal exercise (&lt;6 hours/week)and tallied (scores0-4 with higher worse).</description>

    <measure>Social Adjustment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2.5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Social Adjustment Scale is a semi-structured interview assessing functioning in the preceding 2 months in domains of work (including employment functioning, homemaking and other household functions, and/or student/educational functioning), friendships/leisure, and relationships with extended family. If applicable, relationships with immediate family members (spouse/partner and/or children) are also assessed. The SAS is closely linked to mental health and can be used as a tool for assessing treatment response to psychotropic medications or therapies. Positive adjustment is the ability to carry out each activity/role effectively, deriving satisfaction/support from that domain, whereas poor adjustment reflects maladaptation, dissatisfaction, disengagement, and/or discord. Scores range from 1 (excellent adjustment) to 7 (very poor adjustment). Coding was completed during an audio-recorded interview; 12% were coded for agreement (91%).</description>

        Approximately 165 former participants and 250 new participants will take part in this study
        at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (and Judge Baker Children's Center). The new sample
        will include 250 African American and Black Caribbean midlife men and women with the goal
        of recruiting 80% as couples. A total of 415 people will take part in this study at all
        study sites. Spouses and long-term significant others (with bonuses to couples for joining)
        will be encourage to also participate in the study. Targeting couples in this way will be

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female participants between 35 and 55 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria: (based on interference with key assessments)

          -  Abnormal hepatic function (liver function tests &gt;2X upper normal);

          -  abnormal renal function (creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dl);

          -  conditions/illnesses such as active infection, significant malabsorption/malnutrition,
             cancer;

          -  active hormonal disease such as overt hypo/hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism,
             hyper-cortisolism, or treatment with steroids or growth hormone.

          -  Known Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) will be screened for by
             a detailed history and systems review.

          -  Baseline laboratory analysis with chemistries, CBC, hormone levels, and EKG will be
             completed.

        Two exceptions will be made to the usual exclusion criteria:

          1. Original subjects with DM or CVD will not be excluded, since that would result in bias
             in that sample and loss of opportunity to examine predictors associated with these
             outcomes.

          2. Community adults diagnosed with these disorders at the screening visit will be
             retained and referred for medical treatment as needed. In both groups, those with DM
             and/or CVD will be followed for psychosocial and relevant biomedical variables,
             excluding assessments interfered with by CVD and DM relevant medications. Those with
             DM and CVD will at times be separately analyzed, together with participants who
             develop these disorders in the years of this new study phase.

        <description>Correlations of scales with BMI score. Cumulative adversity occurring before age 18 was assessed using a) the Evaluation of Lifetime Stressors, b) SCID, and c) the Adult Attachment Interview. A cumulative adversity sum score was obtained (range 0–13; higher is more adversity). An overall adversity score was created by multiplying the number of childhood adversities × the overall severity of childhood adversity × the overall chronicity of childhood adversity. Scores for overall adversity ranged from 0 to 156 (higher is more adversity). The Social Adjustment Scale is a semi-structured interview assessing functioning in the preceding 2 months and ranges from 1 (excellent adjustment) to 7 (very poor adjustment). Psychosocial risk factors is an index of 1 to 3 (higher is more risk). Health risk score adds smoking, non-optimal drinking (&gt;7/14 drinks/week for women/men), a score in the bottom tertile of the AHEI, and minimal exercise (&lt;6 hours/week)and tallied (scores0-4 with higher worse).</description>

        <title>Social Adjustment Scale</title>
        <description>The Social Adjustment Scale is a semi-structured interview assessing functioning in the preceding 2 months in domains of work (including employment functioning, homemaking and other household functions, and/or student/educational functioning), friendships/leisure, and relationships with extended family. If applicable, relationships with immediate family members (spouse/partner and/or children) are also assessed. The SAS is closely linked to mental health and can be used as a tool for assessing treatment response to psychotropic medications or therapies. Positive adjustment is the ability to carry out each activity/role effectively, deriving satisfaction/support from that domain, whereas poor adjustment reflects maladaptation, dissatisfaction, disengagement, and/or discord. Scores range from 1 (excellent adjustment) to 7 (very poor adjustment). Coding was completed during an audio-recorded interview; 12% were coded for agreement (91%).</description>

          <title>Health Risk Factors</title>
          <description>An index score of health behavior risk factors was created. Any amount of smoking, non-optimal drinking (≥ 7 drinks per week for women; ≥ 14 drinks per week for men), a score in the bottom tertile of the AHEI, and minimal exercise (&lt; 6 metabolic hours per week) were considered risk factors, coded as “1”, and then tallied. The range of scores for health risk factors in the current sample was between 0 and 4 health risk factors (where 4 is more risk factors).</description>
