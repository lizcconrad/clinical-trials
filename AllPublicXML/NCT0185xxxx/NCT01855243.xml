  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To compare efficacy and safety of traditional sliding scale insulin (SSI) versus
      modified 70/30 insulin versus modified basal plus supplemental scale /bolus insulin regimens
      for glycemic control in hospitalized diabetic patients with diabetes.

      Methods: In a prospective trial, patients with diabetes will be randomized to receive either
      traditional hospital SSI , or twice daily 70/30 insulin plus supplemental lunchtime insulin
      for BG ≥ 150 mg/dL or once every night glargine plus three times prandial glulisine for BG ≥
      150 mg/dL . 70/30 insulin and glargine will be started respectively at 0.4 and 0.2 U/kg/day
      for BG ≤ 200 mg/dL or 0.5 and 0.3 U/kg/day for BG above 200 mg/dL.

    <measure>differences in glycemic control between treatment groups as measured by mean daily BG concentration during their hospital stay.</measure>
    <time_frame>during hospital stay which is expected to be average 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BG will be measured before each meal (i.e. before breakfast, before lunch and before dinner) or every 8 hours if the patient is not eating using a the same hospital point of care glucose meter. In addition, BG will be measured at any time if a patient experienced symptoms of hypoglycemia or if requested by the treating physician. The results of BG values will be presented as pre-meal glucose and mean daily BG during the hospital stay from the day of admission</description>

    <description>Patients who will be recruited to be treated with glargine/glulisine, will received 50% of TDD as detailed demonstrated in Umpierrez et al., studies . as This includes administration of glargine (Lantus®) once every night plus glulisine (Apidra®) before each meal for BG ≥ 150 mg/dL. Glargine dose will be calculated as 0.2 U/kg/day for admission BG less than 200 mg/dL or 0.3 U/kg/day for BG exceeding 200 mg/dL. Glargine was given using Solostar Flex-Pen® once daily in the evening around 8:00 pm. Glulisine was given using the Solostar Flex-Pen® three times just before the meals for BG &gt; 150 mg/dL according to hospital sliding scale. To avoid hypoglycemia, if for any reason, a subject missed a meal, the dose of glulisine will be held.</description>

    <description>Modified split-mixed insulin protocol adopted by Umpierrez et al., will be applied to patients treated with 70/30 insulin. Insulin dose will be started at 0.4 U/kg/day for admission BG less than 200 mg/dL or 0.5 U/kg/day for BG above 200 mg/dL. Two thirds of total daily dose (TDD)will be given before breakfast and 1/3 of TDD before dinner. Supplemental lunchtime regular insulin dose will given for BG &gt; 150 mg/dL . Patients previously treated with 70/30 insulin before admission initially will receivethe same regimen as at in home.</description>
