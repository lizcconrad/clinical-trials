    <textblock>
      To accomplish our Specific Aims, we propose to conduct a two-session fMRI experiment in up to
      30 patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and up to 30 healthy controls. All subjects will be
      invited to complete the second, identical fMRI session about 3 months following completion of
      the first session. Fibromyalgia subjects will complete their scans before and after a 12-week
      Tai Chi intervention in collaboration with Tufts Medical Center.

    <description>Each Tai Chi session will last 60 minutes and will continue twice a week for 12 weeks. Our instructors, who have extensive experience conducting Tai Chi training programs, will follow the standardized Tai Chi protocol. We will also provide the participants with printed materials on FM and the Tai Chi Mind-Body program, including Tai Chi principles, practicing techniques, and safety precautions for participants with FM.
In the first session, the Tai Chi instructors will explain exercise theory and procedures of Tai Chi. For the remaining sessions, the subjects will practice Tai Chi under the instruction of one of the Tai Chi instructors. Every session will include the following components: (1) warm-up and self-massage and a review of Tai Chi principles; (2) Tai Chi movement; (3) breathing techniques; (4) relaxation. Each component of the program derives from classical Yang style Tai Chi 108 posture.30</description>

        Criteria for fibromyalgia patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers 18-50 years of age.

          -  Fibromyalgia for at least the past 3 months, as determined by the referring physician.

          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language provided
             that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment
             measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific causes of pain (e.g., cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections)

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's
             judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for
             adverse outcome.

          -  Presence of any contraindications to fMRI scanning. For example: cardiac pacemaker,
             metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy.

        Criteria for healthy adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers 18-50 years of age.

             that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the assessment
             measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic and acute pain (ex. Fibromyalgia).

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the investigator's
             judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened potential for
             adverse outcome.
