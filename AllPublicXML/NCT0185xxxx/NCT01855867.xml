  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an anti-HIV medication known as Stribild
      (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF) is safe, tolerable and acceptable when
      taken for 28 days, once a day after a possible, sexual, exposure to the Human Immune
      Deficiency Virus (HIV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stribild is a combination of 1 integrase strand transfer inhibitor, 1 pharmacokinetic
      enhancer, and 2 nucleos(t)ide analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and was approved
      in August 2012, as a complete treatment regimen for HIV-1 infection in adults who are
      antiretroviral treatment-na√Øve. We are proposing to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      acceptability of Stribild given to participants over age 18 after a possible sexual exposure
      to HIV-1. Enrolled participants will have experienced a moderate to high risk exposure, as
      outlined in the study protocol, within the last 72 hours - per 2005 Center for Disease
      Control and Prevention guidelines. Participants will take one Stribild tablet, by mouth, once
      a day for 28 days. Study staff will assess for changes in blood chemistries and clinical
      signs and symptoms from baseline health. Study participation is 90 days and will include HIV
      testing, STI screening, HIV/STI risk reduction counseling, clinical assessments, blood draws
      and surveys designed to gather knowledge and perception of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis
      (PEP) and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Conditional referrals to continued HIV/STI
      risk reduction counseling and testing will be made if risk remains high at study termination.
      In addition, participants will be connected to a medical provider if risk demonstrates a
      potential need for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis.

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability - as measured by number of participants with adverse events, the severity of adverse events and frequency of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 14, 30 and 90</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability will be measured by laboratory testing and clinical review of systems. Blood will be collected, via phlebotomy, at day 0, 30 and 90. Laboratory testing will include: CBC with differential, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, creatinine, BUN and hepatitis B at day 0. HIV testing will be done, by finger stick, at day 0, 30 and 90 - with confirmation testing if rapid testing indicates a reactive result or if acute seroconversion is suspected. HIV antigen testing will be conducted, via venipuncture, at day 90. Clinic staff will query participants on health status at day 0 and changes to their health on day 14, 30 and 90. If indicated, targeted physical exams will be offered. Adverse events, which are deemed related to the study intervention, will be followed until considered resolved or sequelae are considered permanent. Negative social impacts, due to study participation, will also be monitored from day 0 to day 90.</description>

    <measure>Awareness and attitudes around non-occupational post-prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 and Day 90</time_frame>
    <description>To describe awareness and attitudes around nPEP among persons presenting for nPEP after a high-risk sexual contact, at day 14 and day 90. Perceptions will be collected by a computer based survey.</description>

    <description>To describe awareness and attitudes around PrEP among persons presenting for NPEP after a high-risk sexual contact, at Day 14 and Day 90. Perceptions will be collected by a computer based survey.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence compared to other nPEP regimens studied at Fenway Health or from literature review.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>To compare adherence rates, based on self-reported missed doses and pill count with the investigational regimen, with historical adherence rates for NPEP regimens. Adherence will be measured by participant self report and pill count done at the clinic.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Description of nPEP failure (HIV infection during study participation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through 90</time_frame>
    <description>Instances of NPEP failure (i.e., incident HIV infections during the study period) will be identified by HIV testing and stored plasma samples analysis collected at Day 0, 30 and 90. Additionally, HIV testing will be done if the participant presents or reports signs and/or symptoms of HIV seroconversion (i.e. fever, body aches, chills, rash). If available a description of the clinical status and disease state of the source individual will be developed. Additionally, characterization will be made of the infecting virus genotypically from both the infected subject and, if possible, from the source individual.</description>
