      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of non-invasive Reza
      Band UES Assist Device for the treatment of esophagopharyngeal reflux with extra-esophageal
      symptoms (chronic cough, choking, aspiration, chronic post nasal drip, globus, sore throat,
      throat clearing).

      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of non-invasive Reza
      Band UES Assist Device for the treatment of esophagopharyngeal reflux with extra-esophageal
      symptoms (chronic cough, choking, aspiration, chronic post nasal drip, globus, sore throat,
      throat clearing). Reza Band is to be worn when sleeping. The patient will put the Reza Band
      on at bedtime and take it off upon waking.

      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open label, multicenter study designed to assess the
      safety and effectiveness of the Reza Band. At up to 5 investigational sites, up to 100
      subjects will be enrolled.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint is to be evaluated by the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI).
      Success is defined as &gt;25% reduction in the RSI at the last follow-up, as compared to the
      baseline RSI. The RSI is a validated nine-item patient-administered outcome questionnaire
      designed to document symptoms and severity. Patients are asked to rate how nine problems have
      affected them on a scale of 0 (no problem) to 5 (severe problem), with a maximum total score
      of 45.

      All adverse reactions being reported will be evaluated with the frequency and percent of
      subjects of each reaction being summarized by severity and by relationship to the Reza Band.
      Since some subjects may report the same event several times (e.g., redness), the first
      occurrence of the worst reported case of the event will be used for the purpose of analysis.

      The incidence of site reactions, including laryngospasm, choking, pain, cough and hoarseness
      will be summarized. Exact 95% confidence intervals for the incidence rate of site reactions
      will be presented.

    <measure>SF-36 Short Form Health Survey - 4 Week Follow-up Score Compared to Baseline Score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 Weeks minus Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>

    <time_frame>4 Weeks minus Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSQ is a self-report measure (0-4 for each of 30 questions) designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive sleepiness (DOES) on multiple activities of everyday living that includes areas of physical, mental and social functioning. Scores can range from 0 (worst possible outcome) to 120 (best possible outcome). Zero (0) is defined as not doing that specific activity for other reasons.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
