    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the utility of kilovoltage (kV) cone beam CT
      imaging to track the dose delivered in head and neck cancer patients, to assess the benefit
      of cone beam CT to patients set-up for radiation treatment, to determine how shifts based on
      kV cone beam CT compare to the standard approach (orthogonal pair), and to develop remote
      access tools (preferably internet-based) so that the MD can approve these plans in real time.

      The investigators' secondary objectives for this study are to assess the possibility of using
      kV cone beam for treatment replanning as compared to standard the treatment planning, to
      determine the need and feasibility of adaptive radiation therapy, to develop concept of
      establishing cumulative DVH (C-DVH) with daily updates and compare it to planned DVH (P-DVH),
      to identify tolerance margins, to evaluate local control, locoregional control, distant
      metastasis, and overall survival, to assess patient quality of life,and to develop predictors
      of patients which may benefit from ART.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients should have an ECOG (Eastern Clinical Oncology Group) performance status of
             0-2

          -  Patients should meet at least one of the following criteria:

               1. Locally advanced cancer (T3-T4 and/or N2-N3)

               2. Tumors wrapping around critical structures such as the optic nerves, optic
                  chiasm, or brainstem

               3. Significant expected weight loss.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous surgical procedure more significant than a biopsy to the primary tumor or
             regional lymph nodes.

          -  Poor renal function (inability to undergo a CT with IV contrast)

          -  Previous radiation therapy to the head and neck.

          -  Inability to tolerate prolonged immobilization.

          -  Children and women who are pregnant or decline to use contraception.
