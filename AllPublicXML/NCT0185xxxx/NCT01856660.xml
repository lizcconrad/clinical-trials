  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individual food preferences are not considered in designing weight-loss therapies. This
      project will determine if short-term weight-loss is improved by matching participants with
      diets that reflect their genetically-determined food preferences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dislike of the diet is a common complaint in weight loss therapy that contributes to poor
      outcomes. Ironically, individual food preferences are rarely taken into account in designing
      weight-loss interventions. In the proposed research, we will utilize genetically-determined
      differences in food preferences, indexed by PROP bitter taste phenotype to develop a novel
      approach to weight loss therapy. The overall goal of this project is to determine if weight
      loss following a 6 month intervention can be substantially improved by matching participants
      with diets that reflect their genetically-determined food preferences. The study is designed
      as a randomized clinical weight-loss intervention trial in women in which PROP non-tasters
      and super-tasters. will be randomized to either the low-carbohydrate or the low-fat diet
      condition
