  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the investigators want to determine, if a fast identification of germs,
      causing infections of the lower respiratory tract, is possible through the use of Multiplex
      PCR technology - a method that allows on time detection of bacteria in medical specimen by
      identifying DNA sequences that are known to be specific for the respective microbe. Therefore
      aspiration samples from the respiratory tracts of ventilated patients, which are suspected to
      develop such an infection, will be collected and analyzed by using a multiplex PCR
      (polymerase chain reaction) application situated on the intensive care unit. The
      investigators want to determine if Multiplex PCR diagnostic could be a faster alternative to
      conventional microbiological methods. The results of the Multiplex PCR analyses therefore
      will be compared with results of conventional microbiological methods.

      In this clinical observational study it is to be investigated if Multiplex PCR analyses of
      clinical samples from ventilated critically ill patients could be a fast and accurate
      alternative to conventional microbiological diagnostic methods in the identification of human
      pathogenic microbes in the setting of pneumonia. Therefore aspiration samples from intubated
      and ventilated critically ill patients, which are suspected to develop such an infection,
      will be collected and analyzed by using a multiplex PCR application situated on the intensive
      care unit. The samples will be investigated for DNA sequences that are known to be specific
      for pneumonia causing microbes. Analyses will take place in a point of care setting and will
      be carried out by intensive care physicians. According to the standard protocols of our
      intensive care units, conventional microbiological investigations, including MALDI-TOF, will
      be carried out parallel to the Multiplex PCR analyses.
