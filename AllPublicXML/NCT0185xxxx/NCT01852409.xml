  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant ascites often has a profound impact on the quality of life of cancer patients.
      Current treatments,including dietary, medical, and procedural are often temporary and
      unsatisfactory options in patients approaching the end of life. Intraperitoneal bevacizumab
      for the palliation of malignant ascites might be a novel choice for refractory malignant
      ascites.
