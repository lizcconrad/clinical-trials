  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The University of Sao Paulo Department of Otorhinolaryngology developed prototypes for a
      digital new hearing aid with an integrated sound generator. These prototypes assist both
      hearing rehabilitation (about 10% of the population) and tinnitus sufferers (about 17% of the
      population).

      Currently, the Brazilian Public Heath Care does not have any such hearing aids. So, the
      development of devices for the hearing rehabilitation as well as the treatment of tinnitus
      represents an advance in the implementation of Public Policies in Brazil.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of the hearing aid with an integrated sound
      generator and amplification alone for tinnitus control in patients with tinnitus associated
      hearing loss.

      This study, in the form of a blind randomized clinical trial, was approved by CAPPesq under
      protocol number: 0163/10.

      49 adults with tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss were randomly assigned into 2 groups.
      Both groups received counseling about tinnitus. One group received hearing aids with only
      amplification and the other group received hearing aids with an integrated sound generator.
      After the fitting process, both groups were told to use the hearing devices 8 hours per day.
      The outcome measures as the tinnitus handicap inventory and psychoacoustics measurements were
      conducted by a blind audiologist that didn't know each group each patient belonged to.
