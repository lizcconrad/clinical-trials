  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      efficacy of long-term (6-month) treatment with delamanid plus an optimized background regimen
      of other anti-tuberculosis drugs in pediatric patients who completed Trial 242-12-232.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter trial to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of delamanid plus an optimized background
      regimen in pediatric patients with MDR-TB over a 6-month treatment period. This long-term
      trial, an extension of Trial 242-12-232, will be conducted in patients who have completed
      Trial 232.

    <description>The efficacy of delamanid in treating pediatric MDR-TB patients will be evaluated by chest radiography (patients with pulmonary disease), change in body weight/height, and evaluation of TB symptoms. Sputum culture conversion (for culture-positive patients) will be assessed in patients who are able to produce sputum (or provide other biological specimens) for microbiological evaluation.</description>
