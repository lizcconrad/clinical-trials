  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study design: a randomized, crossover trial. Each patient performed three different airway
      clearance techniques (Autogenic drainage, slow expiratory with glottis opened in lateral
      posture [ELTGOL], temporary- positive expiratory pressure [T-PEP] with not similar autonomy
      degree in a randomized order. Each technique were applied in 3 sessions during one week at
      alternate days (Monday /Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday). The time spent in
      each bronchial session was 40 minutes. Seven days were the wash-out time period between the
      different techniques.
