  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the intra and inter-subjects variability of the pressure
      measurement cartography in healthy and well and able volunteers, sitting on a rigid base
      during two hours.

      -  The purpose of this study is to understand the formation of pressure sore, to improve
           the care of paraplegic patients.

        -  This pilot study is going to help to establish a model in healthy volunteers in the
           prevention of pressure sores.

    <description>Orthotest CE is a rigid base mapping system composed by 1024 pressure transducers uniformly distributed in a 35x35 cm surface.
Orthotest CE is a product manufactured by Vista-Medical. The patient sit on the rigid base during 2 hours to record the pressure and all the data needed for the pilot study.
