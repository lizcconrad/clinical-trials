  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of systemic inflammation and endothelial
      dysfunction. In recent years, it has been reported that the individual components of the
      differential white cell count, specifically the neutrophil and lymphocyte counts,may have
      clinical utility in predicting diseases. An elevated NLR has been shown to be a prognostic
      indicator in various malignancies. İn the literature, many studies have been shown that NLR
      have predictive value in determining the prognosis of various diseases (cardiac or noncardiac
      diseases ). However, little is known about the predictive values of NLR in pregnancy
      complications. This study aimed to evaluate the potential predictive value of NLR in
      preeclampsia- eclampsia.

      An elevated NLR has been shown to be a prognostic indicator in various malignancies. İn the
      literatüre have been shown that NLR have predictive value in determining the prognosis of
      various diseases (cardiac or noncardiac diseases.However, little is known about the
      predictive values of NLR and PLR in gestational DM, preeclampsia and the other pregnancy
      complications.

      Retrospective data were collected for patients who was diagnosed with , preeclampsia-
      eclampsia, The NLR was defined as the absolute neutrophil count divided by the absolute
      lymphocyte count.
