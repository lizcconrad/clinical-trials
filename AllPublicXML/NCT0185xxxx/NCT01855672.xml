    <textblock>
      The objective of this proof-of-concept study is to generate initial safety and effectiveness
      data for the neuro-modulation stimulation (NMS) E-Box in patients with chronic migraine in an
      acute setting. The results of this study will determine if further development of this device
      in a larger study is warranted.

         18. Participation in any other clinical study (not to include registries or survey-only
             studies) within 30 days or 5 half lives of an investigational drug, whichever is
