    <textblock>
      Dose Escalation part of the study: To estimate the MTD(s) and/ or RP2D of LEE011 in
      combination with everolimus + exemestane, and LEE011 in combination with exemestane, and to
      characterize the safety and tolerability of the combinations of everolimus + exemestane +
      LEE011 and LEE011 + exemestane in patients with ER+ HER2- advanced breast cancer

      Dose Expansion part of the study: To characterize the safety and tolerability of the triplet
      combination of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane in patients na√Øve or refractory to CDK4/6
      inhibitor based therapy, and the safety and tolerability of the doublet combination of LEE011
      + exemestane in patients refractory to CDK4/6 inhibitor based therapy (except patients
      treated with prior LEE011 are not allowed in Group 3).

      The primary purpose of the phase Ib part of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose(s) (MTD(s)) and/or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane
      in patients with ER+ Her2- advanced breast cancer. This part of the study will also assess
      safety, tolerability, and PK of the LEE011 + exemestane, LEE011 + everolimus + exemestane
      combinations.

      The Dose Expansion part of the study will evaluate the triple combination of LEE011 +
      everolimus + exemestane and the double combination of LEE011 + exemestane for safety and
      tolerability.
