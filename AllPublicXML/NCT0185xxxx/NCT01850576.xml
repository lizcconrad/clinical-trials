  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Public health programs and policies have utilized the &quot;combination prevention&quot; model of
      bringing together tailored, proven interventions in order to reduce the global impact of HIV.
      Project TEACH-Kenya adapts two effective HIV interventions, Project BRIEF (Behavioral
      intervention, Rapid HIV test, Innovative video, Efficient cost and health care savings,
      Facilitated seamless care) and STEP (Skill-based Teenage Education Program for HIV
      prevention) to increase HIV testing and counseling rates, implement proven risk reduction
      programs, and improve rates of linkage to care and ART initiation among adolescents in Kenya.
      The collaboration with St. Francis Community Hospital and input from the Kasarani community
      will increase the breadth, reach, and impact of this HIV prevention intervention in Kenya.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2010, HIV/AIDS accounted for up to 29% of all deaths and 24% of all disabilities in Kenya.
      There is a particular need to concentrate HIV education, testing, and linkage-to-care efforts
      among high-risk adolescents; by age 18, 47% of women and 58% of men have had sexual
      intercourse. Only one in four young Kenyans used condoms the first time they had sex, and
      only half of 15-24 year olds had comprehensive HIV knowledge. The goal of this intervention,
      Project TEACH-Kenya, is to adapt two proven HIV interventions, Project BRIEF and STEP, to an
      urban setting in the Kasarani District of the Nairobi Province, Kenya. According to the US
      President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) Five-Year Strategy, a successful
      prevention program brings together a combination of evaluated, tailored interventions, to
      stem the spread of HIV infection among high-risk populations. This synergistic model,
      referred to as combination prevention, serves as the basis for adapting the current
      intervention encompassing HIV testing and counseling, risk behavior reduction programs, and
      linkage to care and ART initiation to the Kenyan context. Project TEACH-Kenya will develop
      tailored, theory-based educational videos, linkage procedures, and a tailored prevention
      program for adolescents 13-18 years old and pilot and test the intervention at St. Francis
      Community Hospital, a high volume community-based hospital in Kasarani. The majority of
      adolescents that access St. Francis's services are orphan and vulnerable children affected by
      HIV/AIDS (OVC-HIV) who are disproportionately poor and malnourished and are at increased risk
      for acquiring HIV, stressing the need for this intervention. The outcome of this project will
      be a feasible, evidence-based, cost- and time-effective program to improve HIV education and
      increase testing and linkage-to-care rates among adolescents in Kenya.

    <description>Feasibility of implementing project STEP will be measured by acceptance and participation rates. Evaluation outputs include:
Efficiency: Number of eligible participants, number randomized into each age and experimental group,
Acceptance rates (number of people who agree to participate in program; number who complete the whole 10 week program);
Population characteristics: We will describe the demographic and behavioural profiles of those who participated in the program and those who refuse; the level of HIV knowledge, self efficacy and satisfaction with the program.
Satisfaction/acceptability: College student recruitment, receptivity and satisfaction with the project; implementation issues and resource use</description>

    <description>HIV related knowledge will be measured using the HIV KQ-18; stigma will be measured using the AIDS-Related Stigma Scale. Sexual history will also be measured using the traditional Project B.R.I.E.F. survey. The questionnaire will be piloted for receptiveness. We will ask for ratings of satisfaction with the video-based pre-counseling and education/prevention post test using measures used by Calderon.</description>

    <description>STEP is based on social learning theory and provides age-appropriate and culturally acceptable HIV prevention information in a format that encourages information growth and skills enhancement. The program is delivered by 'Instructors,' undergraduate college students aged 18-24, one hour per week for 10 weeks.</description>
