      Study Population

      -People with seizures benefit from regular exercise. Exercise may help decrease the number of
      seizures they have. It also improves overall health and quality of life. However, people with
      seizure disorders often have been prevented from doing sports or other regular physical
      activity. They may also feel that exercise or injury can increase their risk of seizures.
      Researchers want to try an exercise program for people who have seizures to see if they can
      increase motivation to exercise which will improve overall health and may decrease the
      frequency of seizures.

      Objectives:

      - To see how exercise education improves motivation to exercise in people who have a history
      of seizures.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a history of seizures.

      Design:

        -  This study involves three outpatient visits and weekly telephone calls for about 12
           weeks. There will be followup calls at about 6 and 12 months after the outpatient
           visits.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will answer
           questions about their current level of physical activity, mood, quality of life, and
           ideas about exercise.

        -  At the first visit, participants will learn how to keep a physical activity log and
           seizure calendar. They will also use an activity monitor and take their pulse regularly.
           They will complete questionnaires about their mood and thoughts about exercise and
           seizures.

        -  At the second visit, participants will set personal activity goals and learn about
           physical activity and seizures. They will review the physical activity log, seizure log,
           and activity monitor and pulse readings for the previous 4 weeks.

        -  After the second visit, participants will receive weekly telephone calls. Each call will
           last about 5 minutes. These calls will ask about physical activities for the week and
           participants' progress toward meeting their goals. These calls will also review the
           seizure log.

        -  At the third visit (12 weeks), the same tests from the first visit will be repeated.

        -  The followup phone calls will continue to monitor participants' activity levels.

      Objective:

      To see what keeps people with seizures from exercising and see how they can increase their
      belief that they can exercise and that exercise will help them.

      Study Population:

      50 adults with seizures

      Design:

      In this protocol, we will pilot the use of an educational intervention to provide people with
      seizure disorders an opportunity to learn about the benefits of exercise and learn
      specifically what types of exercise to incorporate into their daily lives.

      Outcome Measures:

      To assess the effectiveness of the educational intervention, we will use pre and post
      intervention measures including seizure specific measures of self-efficacy (belief that they
      can exercise) and outcome expectations (belief that exercise will help them) for exercise. To
      assess changes in physical activity, seizure frequency, and mood, we will monitor physical
      activity and seizure calendars, activity monitor recordings, and mood rating scales.
