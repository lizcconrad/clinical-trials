      Aim-1: Evaluate opt-out versus opt-in testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at
      the Cook County jail and the Illinois Department of Corrections Northern Intake facilities.
      Outcomes of interest include a) uptake of each HIV testing strategy, b) comparative
      effectiveness of identifying HIV-positive cases, new cases and undisclosed cases, and c)
      predictors of HIV testing.

      Aim-2: Evaluate two case management strategies - &quot;correctional case management&quot; and
      &quot;transitional case management&quot; - designed to improve linkage and adherence to appropriate
      medical care after release from incarceration. Correctional case management is a longer-term,
      more intense approach while transitional case management seeks to meet the clients' immediate
      needs, link them to Ryan White case management, and then support the Ryan White case manager
      in assisting these clients. Correctional case management will be compared to the standard of
      care for jail detainees, and to transitional case management for persons leaving prison.
      Outcomes of interest include, (a) HIV viral load and CD4 cell counts over time, (b) adherence
      to medication, and (c) visits to medical providers.

      Aim-3: Evaluate the impact of an incentive for HIV-positive detainees released from jail to
      visit an HIV service organization where they can be linked to medical care and case
      management. Outcomes of interest are essentially the same as Aim-2.

      Aim-4: Assess university-based telemedicine as means to improve care of state prison inmates
      living with HIV. Outcomes of interest include medication regimens, HIV viral load and CD4
      cell counts, and associated health conditions.

      Aim-5: Assess the uptake of partner notification and social network HIV counseling and
      testing involving HIV-positive persons released from jail and prison as a means to extend the
      reach of the 'seek, test, treat and retain' (STTR) model into the community.

    <arm_group_label>Jail: HIV testing, corrections case mgt</arm_group_label>
    <description>For all jail detainees regardless of HIV status, we observed the uptake of opt-out and opt-in HIV testing. For HIV-positive jail detainees leaving jail, we observed 1) health outcomes for corrections case management versus other than corrections case management, 2) the impact of an incentive to visit an HIV service organization after release from jail</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Prison: telemed, corrections case mgt</arm_group_label>
    <description>We compared outcomes for for HIV-positive prisoners before and after the implementation of telemedicine to deliver HIV medical care. For HIV-positive prisoners released from prison and returning to Chicago, we observed health outcomes for those enrolled in corrections case management those not enrolled in corrections case management.</description>

    <intervention_name>Corrections case management</intervention_name>
    <description>Corrections case management is a long-term (18-24 months) program that seeks to improve the linkage of HIV-positive persons recently released from jail or prison to community-based HIV care, retain them in care, and reduce recidivism. Compared to the long-standing Ryan White case management program, corrections case management has greater access to housing and a greater emphasis on employment. Clients completing the program are then linked to the Ryan White case management program.</description>
