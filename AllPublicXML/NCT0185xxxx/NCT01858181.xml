  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocaratuzumab is a third-generation, fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting
      the CD20 surface marker on normal and malignant B lymphocytes. It has been optimized for an
      increased binding for CD20 and an enhanced antibody dependent cell medicated cytotoxicity
      (ADCC) effector function.

      A previous phase I/II study of intravenously (IV) administered ocaratuzumab in
      refractory/relapsed follicular lymphoma patients has concluded that ocaratuzumab is safe and
      well-tolerated at doses up to 375mg/ m2 weekly for four weeks.

      In this proposed phase I study, ocaratuzumab will be administered subcutaneously to patients
      with previously treated CD20+ B-cell malignancies. Three dose levels (40 mg weekly x 4 doses,
      80 mg weekly x 4 doses, and 80 mg weekly x 8 doses) will be investigated for safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analyses.
