      The purpose of this study is to look at two different diets (a low carbohydrate diet and a
      low fat diet) for migraine prevention in overweight or obese persons with migraine. The
      overall aim is to test the theory that diet will improve migraine frequency and that such
      improvements will be associated with favorable changes in body weight, inflammation, and
      heart health.

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a risk factor for migraine. Further, in the past decade multiple lines of research
      have substantiated the presence of migraine headaches as a risk factor for CVD (eg. stroke).
      Migraineurs have also been demonstrated to have abnormal insulin responses, higher lipids and
      endothelial dysfunction. Limited data suggests a low fat diet may be of benefit in reducing
      migraine frequency; no studies have examined the efficacy of a low carbohydrate (ie. low
      glycemic) diet for migraine prevention in adults.. None of these studies examined the effects
      and potential mechanisms of such diet programs on CV health, body composition, and the
      inflammatory cascade in migraineurs. This 3 -month study addresses the efficacy and potential
      mechanisms of two different diets, (a low carbohydrate diet and a low fat diet) for migraine
      prevention in a clinical cohort of overweight or obese persons with migraine. The overall aim
      is to test the hypothesis that each behavioral intervention will improve migraine frequency
      and that such improvements will be associated with favorable changes in body composition,
      inflammation, and CV parameters.

      Hypothesis 1.1 The mean monthly migraine frequency will be decreased in those who maintain a
      low-fat diet or low-carbohydrate diet for 3 months as compared to controls.

      Hypothesis 1.2 Participants randomized to the diets will demonstrate favorable changes in
      body composition (eg. decrease in adipose tissue volume on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      and body fat on DEXA), inflammatory markers (eg. decrease in adipocytokine levels), and CV
      parameters (eg. improved cholesterol panel, glucose levels and markers of arterial stiffness)
      as compared to controls.
