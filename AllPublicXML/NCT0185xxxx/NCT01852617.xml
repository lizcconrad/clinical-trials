  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Argentina and Uruguay are among the countries with the highest proportion of pregnant women
      who smoke. The implementation of an effective smoking cessation intervention would have a
      significant impact on the health of mothers and children. The &quot;5 A's&quot; (Ask, Advise, Assess,
      Assist, Arrange) is a strategy consisting of a brief cessation counseling session of 5-15
      minutes delivered by a trained provider, which is considered the standard of care worldwide.
      However, it is under used in Argentina and Uruguay. We will conduct a two-arm, parallel
      cluster randomized controlled trial of an implementation intervention in 20 prenatal clinics
      in Argentina and Uruguay. Our primary hypothesis is that the intervention is feasible in
      prenatal clinics in Argentina and Uruguay and will increase the frequency of women receiving
      tobacco use cessation counseling during pregnancy. Our secondary hypothesis is that the
      intervention will decrease the frequency of women who smoke by the end of their pregnancies.
      Prenatal clinics will be randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group
      after a baseline data collection period. Midwife facilitators in the ten intervention clinics
      will be identified and trained to deliver the &quot;5 A's&quot; to pregnant women and will then
      disseminate and implement the program. The ten clinics in the control group will continue
      with their standard in-service activities. A follow-up data collection will be conducted
      immediately after delivery. The intervention will be tailored by formative research to be
      readily applicable to local prenatal care services at busy maternity hospitals, as well as to
      be acceptable to local pregnant women and health providers. The study will be conducted in 48
      months.
