      The purpose of this study is to determine if Enteral Feeding (EN) in patients with a
      traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen impacts outcomes. Patients who receive EN
      will be compared to those who remain nil-per-os (NPO). Additionally, an internal study
      control will be performed by analyzing concurrent injured patients requiring an open abdomen
      who did not have a bowel injury.

      Specific aims:

      Hypothesis 1: EN in patients with a traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen improves
      fascial closure rate compared to patients who remain NPO.

      Hypothesis 2: EN in patients with a traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen reduces
      infectious complications compared to patients who remain NPO.

      Hypothesis 3: EN in patients with a traumatic bowel injury requiring an open abdomen have a
      lower mortality rate compared to patients who remain NPO.

      Fascial closure is determine by the primary physician and should be recorded in the operative
      record. This record will be accessed to determine if this variable is accomplished.
      Additionally, any dehiscence complication will be recorded (which would impact the long-term
      fascial closure rate). Infectious complications (abscess, pneumonia, etc) will be adjudicated
      by the primary clinician and any record of this in the patient chart will be recorded.
