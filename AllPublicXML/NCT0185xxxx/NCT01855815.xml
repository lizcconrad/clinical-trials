      The purpose of the Hemolung RAS Registry Program is to collect retrospective, de-identified,
      standard of care data following the commercial use of the Hemolung RAS.

      ALung's post-market Hemolung RAS Registry Program provides a continuum for measuring the
      Hemolung RAS effectiveness and safety in a real-world setting beyond the results reported in
      pre-market clinical feasibility studies. The Hemolung RAS Registry Program is part of ALung's
      1) evaluation of clinical evidence throughout the life cycle of the product, 2) longer term
      residual risk assessment of the product, and 3) commitment to maintain quality systems and
      integrate continuous quality improvements in the product.

      On a voluntary basis, participating physicians and institutional staff enter de-identified
      data online in the secure, password protected, regulatory-compliant Hemolung RAS Registry
      Portal in a retrospective manner following a patient's ICU discharge, status at 28 days
      post-Hemolung therapy, or death whichever is earlier. There is no requirement to collect and
      report data outside of standard of care. The program's methodology, data monitoring and
      statistical analysis plan is consistent with this type of initiative in a real-world setting.
