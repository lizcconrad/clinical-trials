  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Darapladib (SB-480848) is a novel, selective, orally active inhibitor of lipoprotein
      associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) currently under clinical development by GlaxoSmithKline
      as a potential anti-atherosclerosis agent for reduction of major adverse cardiovascular (CV)
      events in patient populations with chronic coronary heart disease and after an acute coronary
      syndrome.

      This study will determine the effect of repeated administration of diltiazem on the
      pharmacokinetics of a repeated administration of darapladib. A drug interaction study with a
      moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted to provide guidance to prescribing physicians.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing

             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and ECG.

             alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin laboratory result outside the reference range may be
             included only if both the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree and document
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures.

          -  BMI within the range 19-37 kilogram per square meter (kg/m2) (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             [for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)

             of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female
             subjects must agree to use contraception until the final follow-up visit.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of Child-bearing potential and

             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
