  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agitation/aggression is one of the most common and serious behavioral complications of
      dementia. If the behavior is refractory to standard care (behavior approaches and off label
      use of psychotropic medications), other evidence based treatment options are not currently
      available. Retrospective reviews and preliminary studies have indicated Electroconvulsive
      Therapy (ECT) may be a safe, effective intervention in this patient population. This study
      will measure the impact of open-label ECT on symptoms of agitation, aggression, cognition,
      mood and psychosis for patients referred for ECT who accept this intervention vs. those
      patients referred for ECT but decline this intervention (i.e. standard care controls). It
      will also assess adverse events, activities of daily living and caregiver burden during study
      participation. The hypothesis is that subjects with dementia related aggression/agitation who
      receive ECT will show significantly greater reductions in these behaviors than subjects who
      do not consent for ECT and continue with standard care. Pine Rest is partnering with McLean
      Hospital (Massachusetts) to answer this question. To our knowledge, this is the first
      prospective study to examine whether patients receiving ECT or standard care differ in
      reduction of aggression and agitation symptom severity and changes in cognition pre- and
      post- treatment.
