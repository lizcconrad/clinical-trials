  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy or childbirth is a kind of persistent and strong source of stress for pregnant
      women. Prenatal and intrapartum negative emotions not only damage the mental health of
      pregnant women, but also have a negative impact on the mode of delivery, labor, postpartum
      complications and neonatal outcomes . Due to considerations for the effect on the fetus,
      there is concern of the use of drug treatment for depression during pregnancy. Therefore,
      psychological interventions have an important role. According to the WHO global survey in
      Asia 2007-08, China had the highest overall rate of caesarean section (46.2%), and also had
      the highest rate of caesarean section without indication (11.7%). The embarrassing &quot;first in
      the world&quot; of caesarean section rate was causing widespread concern in China. Recently, the
      Chinese government has launched a project named &quot;promoting the rate of natural childbirth and
      protecting the health of mother and child&quot;, trying to reduce the cesarean section rate
      especially that without medical indication. Therefore, examining if emotional management is
      effective in reducing negative emotions of pregnant women as well as decreasing the rate of
      cesarean section is an important research question. Our study aims to help the pregnant women
      control their anxiety, depressive feelings and other negative emotions by &quot;emotional
      self-management group training&quot; and we examine if this can reduce the incidence of depression
      and improve delivery outcomes.

      This study tried to explore the effectiveness of prenatal emotional management on pregnant
      women' delivery outcomes. All participants filled the Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the baseline
      assessment. Then they were randomly assigned into the emotional management (EM) group and the
      usual care (UC) group. The baseline evaluation began at 31 weeks of pregnancy and the mother
      was followed up to 42 days postpartum. Each subject received the EM package In the EM, and
      the UC was given only routine prenatal care. PHQ-9 and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
      scale（EPDS）were used for assessment.

    <description>All participants were randomly divided into intervention group and control group with 100 in each group. At the baseline assessment, all participants filled the PHQ-9 themselves and instructed by a trained nurse, , the diagnosis of depression was fulfilled by the psychiatrists in our research program. When participants scored over than 10 on the PHQ-9, the diagnostic interview was arranged by a research assistant and was done in one week. At the same time, the results of antenatal physical examination for every participant were collected by our research assistants when a participant was enrolled. After the baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned into two groups: the emotional management (EM) group and the usual care (UC) group.</description>
