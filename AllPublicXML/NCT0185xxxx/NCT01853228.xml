  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and efficacy of decitabine in sequential
      administration with cytarabine in children with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study to evaluate
      safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug) of decitabine
      in sequential administration with cytarabine in children with relapsed or refractory AML. The
      study will determine the maximum tolerated dose of cytarabine that can be given following
      decitabine (Phase 1) and the response rate to this combination (Phase 2). Participants may
      enter a continuation phase of single agent-decitabine infusions for as long as such treatment
      would be considered beneficial. Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety
      and efficacy will be monitored throughout the study.
