  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare toxicities between 2 external beam radiation
      fractionation schemes plus a brachytherapy boost for prostate cancer. Our current standard
      use a 2 Gy per fraction schedule which is compare to the experimental hypofractionated 3 Gy
      per day approach with neo adjuvant hormonal therapy. It will demonstrate the feasibility and
      safety of such a treatment regimen in prostate cancer. It may also set base for a larger
      randomized trial.

    <textblock>
      30 patients with intermediate / extensive low risk (all core biopsies involvements &gt; 50%)
      prostate cancer (not necessitating to treat the nodal regions) will be included in this
      study. Patient stage T1 - T2, Gleason score ≤ 7, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 20 will be
      considered.

      Fiducial gold markers will be introduced in the prostate 1-week before the CT planning. 36
      gray (Gy) in 12 fractions using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) will be
      administered to the prostate (margins of 0,5cm) +/- first centimeter of the seminal vesicles.

      Brachytherapy boost (15 Gy x 1) dosimetric parameters should respect our current standard
      (Prostate V100 &gt; 90% and V150 ≤ 40%, V200 ≤ 15%, Urethra V125 ≤ 1 cc, Rectum V75 ≤ 1cc,
      Bladder V75 ≤ 1cc). Short course (4 months) hormonal therapy (Degarelix) will be administered
      to the patient based upon recommended litterature11, 12.

      Genitourinary (GU), GI and Sexual toxicity will be self reported. QOL questionnaires will be
      given to the patients to be answered. Results will be monitored and compared to our currently
      used standard fractionation regiment.

      Follow-up will be scheduled 6 weeks after the implant and every 4 months for the first year,
      every 6 months for the second year 2 to 5, and on a yearly basis after 5 years. PSA &amp;
      testosterone tests will be done every 3 months for the first 3 years, every 6 months on years
      4 and 5, and yearly thereafter.
