  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in
      children ages 1-14 years old. There are no effective therapies to treat secondary brain
      injury and the post-injury response of CNS apoptosis and neuroinflammation. This study is a
      follow-up trial from a previously performed Phase I trial that demonstrated the safety and
      potential CNS structural preservation effect of intravenous autologous bone marrow
      mononuclear cells (BMMNC) after severe TBI in children. (Cox, 2011) The study is designed as
      a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, blinded Phase 2 safety/biological activity
      study. The investigators hope to determine the effect of intravenous infusion of autologous
      BMMNCs on brain structure and neurocognitive/functional outcomes after severe TBI in
      children.

      Study Design: Multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled, Bayesian adaptive dose
      escalation design.

      Study Intervention: Single dose administered within 48 hours from time of injury. Controls
      will undergo a sham harvest and receive similarly labeled/external appearance and volume of
      0.9% NaCl. BMMNC's will be harvested and undergo processing under cGMP conditions to obtain
      6x10^6 cells/kg or 10x10^6 cells/kg weight. The cellular product/placebo will be infused
      within 48 hours of injury.

      Safety Monitoring &amp; Follow-Up: Subjects will be monitored for infusion related toxicity
      post-infusion through hospital discharge and follow-up return study visits. Laboratory and
      imaging studies will be repeated at the 1, 6, and 12-month follow-up visits. A medical safety
      monitor (MSM) will review blinded SAE reports following post-infusion Day 14 for each subject
      in real time to ensure good clinical practice and to quickly identify safety concerns. The
      MSM will remain blinded to the treatment assignment, unless the NINDS appointed DSMB approves
      unblinding.
