      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate the effects of a modified formulation of
      AquADEKs (AquADEKs-2) on markers of inflammation, antioxidant levels and oxidative stress.

      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a disease that affects the organs in the body such as the lungs. Some
      of the damage to the lungs of CF patients may be caused by something called
      oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and oxidative stress.

      Oxidation in the body is kind of what happens to an apple when it turns brown after being
      cut. And, just as a squeeze of lemon juice stops the oxidation of an apple, antioxidants can
      stop the rusting (or damage) inside our bodies by unstable oxygen molecules called free
      radicals. Free radicals can help fight off bacteria and viruses but too many of them do
      damage instead. Our bodies need antioxidants to keep things in balance so we have the right
      amount of free radicals.

      Many CF patients also have trouble digesting food and absorbing nutrients like vitamins. Many
      of the vitamins we rely on are antioxidants, like vitamins A, D, E, K and beta-carotene. In
      some people with CF, even though they take multivitamins and pancreatic enzymes, they still
      have low amounts of antioxidants. The investigators are looking to see if taking more
      vitamins and antioxidants will help CF patients.

      AquADEKs-2 is an investigational new drug (a drug that has not received approval by the Food
      and Drug Administration [FDA]). This research study is being done with the AquADEKs-2
      compared to a control multivitamin. The study drug, AquADEKs-2 contains standard amounts of
      fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) that are contained in typical CF multivitamin supplements
      plus several antioxidants including beta-carotene, mixed tocopherols (different forms of
      vitamin E), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), mixed carotenoids (lutein, lycopene and zeaxanthin), and
      the minerals zinc and selenium. The control multivitamin contains standard amounts of
      vitamins A, B, D, E, and K without additional antioxidant supplementation.

          <description>Two control multivitamin softgel capsules will be taken orally on a once daily basis with pancreatic enzymes and a glass of milk or fat-containing meal for 4 weeks for the screening run in period.

AquADEKs-2: AquADEKs-2 contains standard amounts of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) that are contained in typical CF multivitamin supplements plus several antioxidants including beta-carotene, mixed tocopherols (different forms of vitamin E), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), mixed carotenoids (lutein, lycopene and zeaxanthin), and the minerals zinc and selenium.
