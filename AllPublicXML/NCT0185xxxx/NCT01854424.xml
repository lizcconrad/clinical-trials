  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrocyte is a monocyte sub-population involved in fibroproliferation/repair processes and
      associated with outcome in different diseases. In previous study, we have demonstrated the
      presence of alveolar fibrocytes during Acute expiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and their
      association with patient outcome. The purpose of this multicentric observational prospective
      study is to describe the percentage of alveolar fibrocytes in ICU patients with ARDS
      (survivors vs. non survivors) and to confirm their association with 28-day mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains common (15% of ventilated
      patients in the ICU), severe (30% of mortality) and have no specific treatment. Impaired
      epithelial repair with fibroproliferation is observed in non resolutive form of ARDS.
      Fibrocytes are cells that both express markers of hematopoietic cells (CD34+, CD45+) and
      fibroblasts (collagen-1). Fibrocytes may be recruited directly from the pool of circulating
      blood monocytes but also derive from monocytes in situ in absence of serum amyloid P (SAP or
      pentraxin-2). In murine models of lung injury, it has been shown that fibrocytes were
      recruited in the lung and contribute to the local fibrogenesis. Our team is the first to have
      demonstrated during ARDS in human the presence of fibrocytes among the alveolar cells
      obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (Quesnel et al, Eur Resp J, 2010). In a second
      single-center work enrolling 122 patients, we have shown that a percentage of alveolar
      fibrocytes &gt; 6% was associated with an increased risk of death (HR = 6.2 [2.8 to 13.6], p
      &lt;0.0001). However, this result remains to be confirmed in a second cohort because it was not
      the main objective of the first study and because of the variable lead time of BAL sampling
      in this cohort of patients with ARDS (Quesnel et al, CCM, 2012). Furthermore, the correlation
      of the percentage of blood fibrocytes (Fsg%) with the percentage of alveolar fibrocytes
      (Fal%) remains unknown and their kinetics remain to be studied during ARDS evolution.

      Hypothesis and Objective: We hypothesize that percentage of alveolar fibrocytes is a
      prognostic marker during ARDS. Our main goal is to confirm in a validation cohort that the %
      of alveolar fibrocytes measured in BAL fluid during the first 48 hours of ARDS evolution is
      associated with 28-day mortality.
