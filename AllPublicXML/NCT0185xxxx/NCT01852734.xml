      The purpose of this prospective non-randomised study is to examine whether two different
      microspheres (Bead-Block and Embosphere) are equally effective in the treatment of the
      uterine fibroid controlled with contrast-enhanced MR examination.

      Quantitative MR imaging, including dominant fibroid T1, T2 and contrast enhancement
      characteristics before intervention and 3 months after interventions will be analysed as a
      potential predictor of volumetric response after embolization.

      Another purpose is to determine long-term follow-up in all patient treated in a period from
      2001-2011 in OUH analysed retrospectively.

      Group 1: 26 patient will be treated with Bead-block microspheres - 700-900 µm microspheres or
      combinations of one vial 2 ml of 500-700 µm microspheres, follow by 700-900 µm microspheres
      until blood flow stop ( &quot; cut the tree&quot; appearance).

      Group 2: 26 patient will be treated with Embosphere; 500-900 µm until &quot;near-stasis&quot; flow stop
      in the uterine artery.

      Clinical and Technical success will be examined, and radiological follow-up 3 and 12 months
      after embolization using MR contrast-enhanced examination in a Bead Block group and only 3
      months control in Embosphere group to assess total fibroid burden infraction degree and
      eventually residual contracts fibroid enhancement.

      Quantitative MRI dominant fibroid characteristic for and 3 months after an intervention to
      examine eventually potential of as a possible predictor of the volumetric response of the
      uterine fibroid.

      Retrospective study compromised all patient treated between January 2001 until January 2011
      with follow up to January 2014, and re-intervention as well as complications rate analysis.
