  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy has become the gold standard for the surgical treatment of benign ovarian cysts
      and is usually performed by stripping the ovarian cyst wall, followed by bleeding control of
      the ovarian wound ground using bipolar coagulation. However, the hemostasis with bipolar
      coagulation could result in the damage of ovarian reserve and decrease the response of the
      ovaries to hormonal stimulation for assisted reproductive technologies. The possible
      mechanism may contribute to thermal destruction of ovarian follicles by excessive use of
      bipolar coagulation for hemostasis purposes.

      To avoid additional ovarian tissue damage by conventional bipolar coagulation being
      potentially important ovarian reproductive function, hemostasis using various topical
      hemostatic agents has introduced to control post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding. Among
      them, FloSeal (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) is a hemostatic matrix
      sealant composed of a gelatin-based matrix and thrombin solution. On coming into contact with
      blood after application at a bleeding site, the gelatin particles swell and tamponade
      bleeding. The bulk of the gelatin matrix-thrombin composite has the effect of slowing blood
      flow and providing exposure to a high thrombin concentration, thus hastening clot formation.
      Therefore, it may more suitable for use in post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding, where
      there is superficially pervasive focus of bleeding.

      Ovarian reserve is defined as the functional potential of the ovary, which reflects the
      number and quality of antral follicles left in the ovary, and is correlated with the response
      to ovarian stimulation using exogenous gonadotropin. Serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) has
      been accepted as the most reliable and easily measurable marker for postoperative assessment
      of ovarian reserve.

      The investigators conducted a multicenter, large-scale, randomized controlled trial to
      investigate whether hemostasis by Floseal was superior to that by bipolar coagulation in
      preserving ovarian reserve by assessing serial AMH levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic
      ovarian cystectomy for benign ovarian cysts.

    <description>In the Floseal group, the sites of bleeding were covered with Floseal under direct vision with a laparoscopic applicator and ovarian cortex was closed on itself and waited for 2 minutes for Floseal to act. Then, subsequently bleeding sites were reexamined with irrigation.</description>
