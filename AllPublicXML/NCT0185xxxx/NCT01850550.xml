  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific objective of this research proposal is to determine the short-term efficacy of a
      primary care-based weight control intervention in which successful volunteer peers deliver a
      group-based program.

      The purpose of the study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a
      successful volunteer peer-led weight control program compared to a control condition to
      determine intervention efficacy at 3 months. Six peer leaders from 2 primary care clinics
      will be recruited and trained to conduct the intervention. Overweight and obese patients
      (n=80) will be recruited (randomized by individual) to determine weight loss at 3 months
      (primary outcome). The program consists of 12 weekly weight loss sessions led by a successful
      volunteer peer leader using an adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program to help
      participants lose weight.

      The intervention will consist of 12 weekly one-hour weight loss sessions led by successful
      volunteer peers. The initial weight loss session will be conducted by the peer leaders with
      oversight by the PI. This session will serve to introduce the program and give an overview of
      program. The remaining sessions, conducted by co-peer leaders, will utilize an adaptation of
      the Diabetes Prevention Program. This adaptation allows for use in a group setting and
      facilitation by a lay individual.

      Control Condition: Participants in the control condition will be given written information at
      the baseline visit from the NIH website &quot;Aim for a Healthy Weight&quot; to provide a basic
      understanding of weight loss and access to basic online resources. We expect that use of the
      website may result in some weight loss. However, similar information-only interventions have
      had a very small effect, which is accounted for in the sample size calculation.
