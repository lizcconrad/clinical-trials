      This study is designed to investigate the relationship between patients' position and
      endotracheal tube intracuff pressure in the pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no data in the literature as to the effect of changes in head position on
      CP. As the cuff is located in the patients' trachea, the shape of the patents' trachea may be
      change depending on the position of the patient's head and therefore, the CP may also change.
      If the intracuff pressure will increase as the patient's head is moved into a flexed or
      extended position, these patients may be at risk for tracheal damage. The investigators will
      prospectively evaluate the relationship between the patient's head position and CP in
      patients undergoing otolaryngological surgery.
