  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, ~1 million elective hip or knee replacement surgeries are performed
      annually. With estimated surgical site infection (SSI) rates as high as 2.5%, this represents
      ~25,000 patients at risk of potentially avoidable morbidity following lower extremity joint
      replacement surgery. Although SSIs only account for 20% of all HAIs, they are a major risk
      factor for prosthetic joint infections (PJIs). Furthermore, UTIs have also been identified as
      an independent risk factor for infections of implanted hardware.

      In general, the majority of PJIs become apparent within 3 months of hardware implantation,
      but deep infections may not be evident for up to one year after surgery. Hardware infections
      result in delayed healing, repeated surgical interventions, and long-term antibiotic therapy.
      PJIs are associated with an average increase in hospital LOS by 14 days, additional
      expenditures of up to $50,000 per infected joint, and a doubling of the mortality rate
      compared to uninfected lower extremity joint replacements.

      Recent work from our group suggests that vitamin D insufficiency may be a risk factor for
      perioperative HAIs. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency is approximately 40% in
      elective joint replacement surgery patients, and perioperative 25(OH)D levels drop 30-40% in
      the setting of surgical stress, remaining 20% below baseline up to 3 months after surgery. To
      date, perioperative vitamin D optimization strategies have not been reported. Therefore, our
      goal is to study the effect of a single (pre-operative) versus a divided (pre-operative and
      on post-operative day 1) dose of cholecalciferol on perioperative vitamin D status in
      patients scheduled for elective hip or knee joint replacement surgery.

    <measure>Change in vitamin D status 5 days following supplementation with cholecalciferol</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed between the initial preoperative evaluation day and an average duration of 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will receive 150,000 IU or 100,000 IU cholecalciferol (vs. placebo) 3-7 days before surgery during their pre-operative assessment. Vitamin D status on the day of pre-operative assessment will be compared to vitamin D status on the day of surgery. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure serum: 1) 25-hydroxyvitamin D; 2) Parathyroid hormone; 3) Vitamin D binding protein; 4) LL-37; 5) Albumin; and 6) Calcium levels.</description>

    <time_frame>Patients will be followed between the day of surgery and an average duration of 1 day after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will receive either pre-operative supplementation with 150,000 IU or pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol plus 50,000 IU cholecalciferol on post-operative day 1 (vs. placebo). Vitamin D status will be compared between the day of surgery and post-operative day 1. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25-hydroxyvitamin D; 2) Parathyroid hormone; 3) Vitamin D binding protein; 4) LL37; 5) Albumin; and 6) Calcium levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-surgical vitamin D status 2 weeks after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed between the day of surgery and an average duration of 14 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will receive either pre-operative supplementation with 150,000 IU or pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol plus 50,000 IU cholecalciferol on post-operative day 1 (vs. placebo). Vitamin D status will be compared between the day of surgery and post-operative day 10-18. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25-hydroxyvitamin D; 2) Parathyroid hormone; 3) Vitamin D binding protein; 4) LL37; 5) Albumin; and 6) Calcium levels.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pre-surgical vitamin D status 3 months after surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>Patients will be followed between the day of surgery and an average of 90 days after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will receive either pre-operative supplementation with 150,000 IU or pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol plus 50,000 IU cholecalciferol on post-operative day 1 (vs. placebo). Vitamin D status will be compared between the day of surgery and post-operative day 80-100. To assess vitamin D status, we will measure: 1) 25-hydroxyvitamin D; 2) Parathyroid hormone; 3) Vitamin D binding protein; 4) LL37; 5) Albumin; and 6) Calcium levels.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive either pre-operative supplementation with 150,000 IU or pre-operative supplementation with 100,000 IU cholecalciferol plus 50,000 IU cholecalciferol on post-operative day 1 (vs. placebo). The incidence of post-operative complications will be assessed between the day of surgery and post-operative day 80-100. To assess the incidence of post-surgical complications, we will measure rates of: 1) pneumonia; 2) urinary tract infection; 3) surgical site infection; 5) sepsis/bacteremia; 6) infected hardware; 7) hospital readmission; and 8) mortality.</description>
