      Primary Endpoint:

      The primary objective is to show that AIS patients, ineligible for or refractory to treatment
      with IV-tPA, with appropriate image selection, treated with mechanical thrombectomy within
      6-12 hours of symptom onset have less stroke related disability and improved good functional
      outcomes as compared to those treated with best MT with respect to endpoint defined as:

      • 90-day global disability assessed via the modified Rankin score (mRS), analyzed using raw
      mRS scores. Statistical details can be found in section 7.2.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  90-day global disability in the 6-12 hr cohort assessed via the overall distribution of
           mRS

        -  Proportion of patients with good functional recovery for the 6-12 hr cohort as defined
           by mRS 0-2 at 90 days

        -  Mortality at 30 and 90 days

        -  Intracranial hemorrhage with neurological deterioration (NIHSS worsening &gt;4) within 24
           hours of randomization

        -  Procedure related serious adverse events (SAE's)

        -  Arterial revascularization measured by TICI 2b or 3 following device use

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration has been shown to be safe
      and effective for treatment of AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset, and newer evidence has
      shown potential benefit out to 4.5 hours. Mechanical thrombectomy for AIS patients has been
      shown in clinical trials to be safe up to 8 hours after symptom onset. The rapid progression
      of thrombectomy devices over the last several years has resulted in faster recanalization
      times while maintaining a high degree of safety. This has resulted in improved patient
      outcomes, similar to prior randomized trial data showing improved outcomes over medical
      therapy or earlier devices. Data from the MERCI trial suggests that patients &gt; 85 as well as
      those with a baseline NIHSS score &gt; 30 are unlikely to benefit from thrombectomy. Patients
      with rapidly improving neurologic deficits likely will have an excellent recovery with
      conventional care, precluding the ability to detect a beneficial treatment effect of
      thrombectomy.

      Pilot data incorporating physiologic imaging has shown that appropriate patients can be
      selected for thrombectomy. This selection methodology has shown the ability to maintain the
      same level of safety and efficacy as those patients treated in the highly selective
      environment of a clinical trial, despite presenting far beyond accepted time based standards.
      Vertebrobasilar occlusion patients are excluded to maintain a homogenous study population,
      particularly since no data currently is available addressing the comparability of imaging
      penumbral patterns in the anterior vs. posterior circulation. This has also been shown to be
      reproducible at multiple centers and with different imaging modalities. However, all
      prospective interventional stroke studies performed to date have been restricted by the
      8-hour time window.

Secondary outcome endpoints will be compared between randomized groups in an ITT fashion; with overall Type I error controlled using hierarchical testing. That is, if statistical significance is observed on the primary effectiveness endpoint, the secondary clinical efficacy endpoints will then be tested in sequential fashion each at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, with testing ceasing once a null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
