      This study will compare the safety, effectiveness, and cost of two different types of
      long-acting insulin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will be comparing two long-acting insulins, insulin glargine
      and NPH insulin. The trial will be evaluating differences in effectiveness, safety and cost
      between the two agents when used in patients on more than 80 units or 1unit/kg long-acting
      insulin. The investigators hypothesis is that patients switched from lantus to NPH will have
      improved blood glucose control.
