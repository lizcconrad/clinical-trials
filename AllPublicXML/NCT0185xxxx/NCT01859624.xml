    <textblock>
      Albuterol is a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating
      breathing problems such as asthma. Studies have shown that albuterol may be beneficial in
      improving muscle function in people with late-onset Pompe disease. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate whether albuterol is safe and effective for improving muscle function in
      people with late-onset Pompe disease, whether or not they are receiving enzyme replacement
      therapy (ERT). For this study, albuterol is considered an investigational drug. The word
      &quot;investigational&quot; means albuterol is not approved by the FDA for individuals with late-onset
      Pompe disease.

    <description>This study includes the off-label administration of oral albuterol (4 mg pill) and tracking the effect of motor function at two additional visits, 6 and 12 weeks following the initiation of the study drug. The initial dose of albuterol will be a 4 mg daily for the first 6 weeks. If the 4 mg is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 8 mg at the 6 week visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Pompe disease by blood acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) assay and GAA gene
             sequencing

          2. Age: 18+ years at enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Continuous invasive ventilation (via tracheostomy or endotracheal tube)

          2. Clinically relevant illness within two weeks of enrollment including fever &gt; 38.2o C,
             vomiting more than once in 24 hours, seizure, or other symptom deemed contraindicative
             to new therapy.

          3. Chronic heart disease (Myocardial infarction, arrythmia, cardiomyopathy)

          4. History of seizure disorder

          5. Hypothyroidism

          6. Pregnancy/Breast Feeding [Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test at each study visit. In addition, at Screening/Baseline women of
             childbearing potential must have been using a medically acceptable contraceptive for
             at least 3 months prior to study enrollment OR the subject a) has a regular menstrual
             cycle, b) Day 1 (onset of menses) for the current cycle is known, and c) the urine
             pregnancy test can be administered within the first two weeks of the current cycle
             (between Days 1 and 14)]. The urine pregnancy test will be administered and
             interpreted by Stephanie Dearmey, Physician Assistant (PA-C), who has completed
             training from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Mrs. Dearmey will use a
             commercially available test kit specified by the point-of-care testing policies. If
             these criteria for urine pregnancy testing are not met at the Screening/Baseline
             visit, then a blood pregnancy test will be done.

          7. Patients on a non-standard schedule for ERT; for example, weekly infusions as opposed
             to infusions every two weeks.

        The use of the following concommitant meds is prohibited during the study:

          -  diuretics (water pill);

          -  digoxin (digitalis, Lanoxin);

          -  beta-blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), and propranolol
             (Inderal);

          -  tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil, Etrafon), doxepin (Sinequan),
             imipramine (Janimine, Tofranil), and nortriptyline (Pamelor);

          -  Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine
             (Nardil), rasagiline (Azilect), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), or tranylcypromine
             (Parnate); or

          -  other bronchodilators such as levalbuterol (Xopenex), bitolterol (Tornalate),
             pirbuterol (Maxair), terbutaline (Brethine, Bricanyl), salmeterol (Serevent),
             isoetherine (Bronkometer), metaproterenol (Alupent, Metaprel), or isoproterenol
             (Isuprel Mistometer).
