      This randomized study will examine the effectiveness of two types of pregnancy tests (a
      semi-quantitative test and a high sensitivity test) to identify continuing pregnancy at home
      at various time points after early medical abortion. The first test a semi-quantitative panel
      test marketed under the brand name dBest (AmeriTek, Seattle WA, USA). This urine-based,
      one-step kit has been used in two previous studies in Vietnam (12, 13). The second test is a
      locally available urine dipstick (Quickstick one-step hCG Pregnancy Test, Phamatech, San
      Diego, CA, USA).

        1. The investigators hypothesize that 99% of the SQPT and 35% of the HSPT will correctly
           identify ongoing pregnancy at day 14.

        2. The investigators hypothesize that 99% of the SQPT and 25% of the HSPT will correctly
           identify ongoing pregnancy at day 7.

        3. The investigators hypothesize that 75% of the SQPT and 10% of the HSPT will correctly
           identify ongoing pregnancy at day 4.
