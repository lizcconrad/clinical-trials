  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of montelukast (MK-0476) in the
      treatment of Japanese pediatric participants with perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR). The
      primary hypothesis of this study is that montelukast oral granules (OG) and chewable tablets
      (CT) provide appropriate exposure to montelukast in Japanese pediatric participants with PAR.

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study drug is also an AE. Participants were monitored for the occurrence of AEs for up to 14 days after last dose of study drug (up to a total of 14 weeks). AEs were reported based on the dose of study drug participants received.</description>

          <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study drug or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of study drug is also an AE. Participants were monitored for the occurrence of AEs for up to 14 days after last dose of study drug (up to a total of 14 weeks). AEs were reported based on the dose of study drug participants received.</description>
