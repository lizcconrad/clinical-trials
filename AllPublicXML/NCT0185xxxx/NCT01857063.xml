  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of montelukast (MK-0476) in the treatment of
      Japanese pediatric participants with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). The primary hypothesis
      of this study is that montelukast is superior to placebo in the treatment of nasal symptoms
      in SAR.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Averaged During 3 Hours of Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 hours of pollen exposure on Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS is the sum of the three nasal symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal discharge and sneezing. Participants completed a questionnaire about their nasal symptoms. Score ranged from 0 to 4 for each of the three nasal symptoms, with a total possible score ranging from 0 to 12 and a higher score indicating more severe nasal symptoms. The baseline TNSS was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline TNSS was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to Japanes cedar (JC) pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes. Analysis was done by study drug as taken.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Experience at Least One Adverse Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Participants were monitored for occurrence adverse events for up to 14 days after last dose of study drug. Analysis was done by study drug as taken.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted TNSS Averaged During 3 Hours of Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 hours of pollen exposure on Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>TNSS was weighted as 2:1:1 for nasal congestion, nasal discharge and sneezing. The Weighted TNSS ranged from 0 to 16, with a higher score indicating more severe weighted total nasal symptoms. The baseline Weighted TNSS was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline TNSS was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to JC pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes. Analysis was done by study drug as taken.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nasal Congestion Score Averaged During 3 Hours of Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 hours of pollen exposure on Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The Nasal Congestion Score was assessed as 0 = No symptoms of nasal congestion to 4 = Completely obstructed all day, with a possible Nasal Congestion Score ranging from 0 to 4 and a higher score indicating more severe nasal congestion. The baseline Nasal Congestion Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline Nasal Congestion Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to JC pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nasal Discharge Score Averaged During 3 Hours of Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 hours of pollen exposure on Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The Nasal Discharge Score was assessed as 0 = 0 times participant blew his/her nose to 4 = 21 or more times participant blew his/her nose, with a possible Nasal Discharge Score ranging from 0 to 4 and a higher score indicating more severe nasal discharge. The baseline Nasal Discharge Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline Nasal Discharge Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to JC pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sneezing Score Averaged During 3 Hours of Exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 3 hours of pollen exposure on Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The Sneezing Score was assessed as 0 = 0 times participant sneezed to 4 = 21 or more times participant sneezed, with a possible Sneezing Score ranging from 0 to 4 and a higher score indicating more severe sneezing. The baseline Sneezing Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline Sneezing Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to JC pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.

        <description>The TNSS is the sum of the three nasal symptom scores for nasal congestion, nasal discharge and sneezing. Participants completed a questionnaire about their nasal symptoms. Score ranged from 0 to 4 for each of the three nasal symptoms, with a total possible score ranging from 0 to 12 and a higher score indicating more severe nasal symptoms. The baseline TNSS was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline TNSS was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to Japanes cedar (JC) pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.

        <description>The Nasal Discharge Score was assessed as 0 = 0 times participant blew his/her nose to 4 = 21 or more times participant blew his/her nose, with a possible Nasal Discharge Score ranging from 0 to 4 and a higher score indicating more severe nasal discharge. The baseline Nasal Discharge Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period prior to entering the chamber room. The post-baseline Nasal Discharge Score was assessed on Day 7 of a treatment period during 3 hours of exposure to JC pollen in the chamber room, as an average of measurements at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Sneezing Score at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 Minutes After Entering Chamber Room</title>
          <description>The Sneezing Score was assessed as 0 = 0 times participant sneezed to 4 = 21 or more times participant sneezed. The possible Sneezing Score ranged from 0 to 4, with a higher score indicating more severe sneezing. The Sneezing Score was assessed on Day 7 prior to entering the chamber room and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 minutes after entering the chamber room. Analysis was done by study drug as taken.</description>
          <population>The FAS population consisted of all randomized participants who took at least one dose of study drug, and had a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment in a treatment period.</population>
