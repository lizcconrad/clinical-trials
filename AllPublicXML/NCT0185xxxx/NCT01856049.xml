  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell-based cardiac regeneration has been the focus of acquired, adult heart disease for many
      years. However, congenital heart disease with severe structural abnormalities may also be
      reasonable targets for cell-based therapies. Interestingly, the pediatric heart is naturally
      growing and may be the most amendable to regenerative strategies. Therefore, identifying
      autologous cells (cells from the patient's own body) would be important to initiate these
      studies.

      This study aims to validate the use of umbilical cord blood as a source of autologous cells
      for the purpose of cardiac repair of congenital heart disease. Cells will be isolated from
      the cord blood to help us determine the feasibility of collection, processing, and storage of
      these samples at the time of birth of infants with prenatal diagnosis of hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome. This study may be useful for the development of pre-clinical and clinical
      studies aimed at the long-term goal of repairing damaged heart muscle.

    <description>Umbilical Cord Blood is drawn from the umbilical cord of newborn babies diagnosed with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, before placental detachment. Cord blood is packaged in a Credo Cube, and sent at a temperate state to the manufacturer immediately after draw. At least 65 mL of cord blood is needed to produce a stem cell product during manufacturing. Once processed, the patient's autologous cord blood stem cells will be frozen for their potential future use in a clinical trial.</description>
