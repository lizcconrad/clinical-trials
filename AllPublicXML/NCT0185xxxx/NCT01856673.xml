    <textblock>
      This study is a community prevention randomized trial with three parallel groups: two
      intervention groups and one control group in Buenaventura and Quibdó.

      The aim of the trial is to evaluate the impact of two community interventions on mental
      health; the intervention groups are designed to decrease depression, anxiety, post-traumatic
      stress disorders symptoms as well as the level of dysfunctionality in Afro-Colombian victims
      of violence.

      Adult people (equal or more than 18 years old) belonging to Afro-Colombian communities in
      both cities will participate in the enter survey. The subjects will be selected based on the
      severity of symptoms, traumatic experiences and a level of dysfunction identified using the
      instruments of this research (i.e. those obtaining an score equal or higher than 49 in
      symptoms (25% of the total of symptoms)).

      The fieldwork and the interventions will be conducted by people belonging to the community;
      they are called Lay Psychosocial Community Workers (LPCW). After six (6) weeks of formal
      training, they will be able to perform two kinds of interventions, Common Elements Treatment
      Approach (CETA) based on a cognitive behavioral intervention and Narrative Community Group
      Therapy (NCGT), for the people affected by violence and displacement that were pre-selected
      according to the baseline instrument.

      The LPCW will be under the constant supervision by psychologists of the project, and under
      weekly supervision by a group of experts from Johns Hopkins University, the Heartland
      Alliance and The Institute for Research and Development in Violence Prevention and Promotion
      of Peaceful Coexistence Social (CISALVA) by means of phone calls or monthly visits to the
      cities. Selected subjects will be randomly allocated to any study branch: CETA, NCGT or the
      waiting control group.

      The study subjects will follow their allocated treatment, or waiting in the control group,
      for 8 to 12 weeks; then they will be re-assessed using the project instrument two weeks after
      the last session of therapy.

      The study outcome is the differences in instrument scores between the follow-up and the
      baseline among the interventions (CETA or NCGT) and control group.

      Control subjects will be assessed by the project psychologist after the follow-up, and they
      will receive treatment when necessary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colombian armed conflict predominantly affects rural communities; armed conflict has caused
      thousands of deaths and the displacement of a vast amount of people from rural areas. A
      considerable amount of the displacement comes from the two most important cities in Pacific
      coast region: Buenaventura in Valle del Cauca province and Quibdó in Chocó province.

      This project will assess treatments, Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) and Narrative
      Community Group Therapy (NCGT), to reduce mental symptoms triggered by violence and will
      develop mechanisms for a sustainable supply of mental health services in the region.

      Adult Afro-Colombian persons who have responded to the study survey but present symptoms of
      severe mental illness like schizophrenic, psychotic, suicidal attempters, those who can
      potentially harm others, or who require specialized treatment will not be included in the
      study.

      They will be referred to a project psychologist who will determine whether they require
      psychiatric treatment, in which case, they will be referred to health institutions through
      social workers who will ensure treatment is given. Finally, anyone who is related to the LPCW
      will be excluded.

      For the CETA arm, new clients will be enrolled as long as a treatment position becomes
      available (i.e., as long as previous clients have completed the treatment) to keep the
      providers (LPCW) running at full capacity. These new clients will be chosen from those
      randomly allocated to receive the CETA treatment; within fifteen (15) days of the completion
      of treatment the participants will be reassessed.

      Similarly, the NCGT arm will form new groups as long as place becomes available (i.e, as long
      as previous group has finished treatment) to keep providers running at full capacity. Group
      members will be chosen from randomly allocated participant to receive NCGT, selecting enough
      people each time to fill up a group before the treatment begins. All group members will be
      reassessed within fifteen (15) days of completing the NCGT.

      The participants allocated in the control group will undergo a waiting period similar to the
      period between the initial and final assessments of those receiving CETA and NCGT. This
      period is estimated to be 3 months, but it could be longer if there are treatment delays. At
      the end of this time, the participants will be reassessed.

      after the control group is reassessed they will be evaluated and receive professional
      attention by psychologists to decide what is the best intervention that we can offer to the
      clients in both cities.

      Missing values will be handle using multiple imputation methods and data will be analyzed
      with an intention to treat basis. Sensitivity analysis will be carried out using non-imputed
      database and including co-variables in the models the inverse probability weight to lost of
      follow-up.

      The anticipated results is a reduction in anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress
      disorder symptoms of 20 points among subjects in intervention groups (CETA or NCGT ) compared
      with those in the control group.

      An adherence of 70% is expected to generate strategies for the promotion and prevention in
      mental health for Afro-Colombian victims of violence and displacement.

          <description>Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) only
Common Elements Treatment Approach: It was developed for treating symptoms related to violent trauma, i.e. symptoms of depression, anxiety and distress, among victimized population by violence and torture in Colombia. The most relevant components for treatment of these 3 problematic issues were identified from literature review and panel of experts. Descriptions and schemes have been developed in order to guarantee facility of use by community counselors who have little background in mental health skills. These counselors, who will be called Mental Health Community Workers (MHCW), will receive training in this technique before beginning of interventions. Application of this technique will be supervised constantly by mental health professionals (psychologist or social worker) from the project team.</description>

Sessions will begin with a series of introductory activities that motivates participants to propose different problems that they would like to solve in the group. A participant proposed a problem and he/she will be asked to talk about it. MHCW and/or psychologist will support individuals if anyone needs help to solve a psychological crisis. At the end of this narration, participants will be asked about who has had a similar situation, and how they solved it. In this way, proposed solutions will be collected by the MHCW.

        <description>TMHS scale of 64 items, ranging from 0 for “never” to 3 for “all the time” being the option three the worst condition, including locally relevant symptoms and sub-scales of depression (n=15 symptoms), anxiety (n=10 symptoms) and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (n=16 symptoms). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) and symptoms of trauma (PTSS) were assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ).
The Dysfunction measure was a gender-specific questionnaire with 12-items for females and 10-items for males. Each item assessed a task ranging from 0 for “no difficulty” to 4 for “cannot do it”, being the option four the worst condition.
For each scale, the mean was calculated in order to used it as the measure for comparisions.

            <description>Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) only
Common Elements Treatment Approach: It was developed for treating symptoms related to violent trauma, i.e. symptoms of depression, anxiety and distress, among victimized population by violence and torture in Colombia. The most relevant components for treatment of these 3 problematic issues were identified from literature review and panel of experts. Descriptions and schemes have been developed in order to guarantee facility of use by community counselors who have little background in mental health skills. These counselors, who will be called Lay Psychosocial Community Workers (LPCW), will receive training in this technique before beginning of interventions. Application of this technique will be supervised constantly by mental health professionals (psychologist or social worker) from the project team.</description>

Narrative Community Therapy Intervention: It consists on teaching skills to people in the community to provide mental health therapy. Therapy will be performed by LPCW under constant supervision of mental health professionals (psychologists or social workers). Sessions will begin with a series of introductory activities that motivates participants to propose different problems that they would like to solve in the group. A participant proposed a problem and he/she will be asked to talk about it. LPCW and/or psychologist will support individuals if anyone needs help to solve a psychological crisis. At the end of this narration, participants will be asked about who has had a similar situation, and how they solved it. In this way, proposed solutions will be collected by the LPCW. Finally, session closes with a motivating activity.</description>

After the exit survey, control group participants will have an appointment with a professional psychologist to determine whether they require a mental health treatment. Those with such necessity will receive treatment in the ACOPLE center by professional psychologists or they will be referred to other health care level according to the type of psychopathology (e.g., psychosis) or its severity. Also, participants in the control group will be monitoring monthly by phone calls and if they have any psychological problem, they will be assessed in the ACOPLE center.</description>
