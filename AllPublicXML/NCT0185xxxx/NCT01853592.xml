      Background:

      - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is type of imaging study that uses magnetic fields and
      radio waves to take pictures of the body. To help the images show up more clearly, a contrast
      agent is injected into a vein. Researchers are interested in finding contrast agents that can
      help show problems with the blood vessels around the heart. They want to test an agent called
      Gadofosveset Trisodium to see how it works in MRI scans.

      Objectives:

      - To test the effectiveness of Gadofosveset Trisodium as a contrast agent in heart MRI scans.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide blood samples before the scanning sessions.

        -  Participants will have an MRI scan after the screening visit. They will have a dose of
           the contrast scan before the study.

        -  Participants will return for one additional MRI scan within 1 to 2 months of each scan.
           Different doses of the contrast agent will be used for each scan.

        -  An additional blood sample will be collected within 1 week of the second MRI scan.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the diagnostic quality of contrast-enhanced
      coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is improved by using a higher versus a lower
      dose of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. We will compare two doses of an intravascular
      contrast agent (Gadofosveset, 0.03 and 0.06 mmol/kg) in this pilot dosing study. Healthy
      participants will be recruited who do not have a clinical indication for MR angiography but
      do have safety clearance for IV gadolinium contrast and MR scanning.

      Subjects will be evaluated in order to determine if the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and
      contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of the coronary arteries is increased for the higher dose
      contrast agent. Parameters will be compared with paired t-testing for significance.
