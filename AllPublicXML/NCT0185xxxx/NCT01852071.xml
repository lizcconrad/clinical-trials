  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this current study, the investigators will determine whether using a lentiviral vector
      (based on HIV-1) will be more effective and safer at gene transfer to hematopoietic stem
      cells compared to previous gene transfer vectors based on murine (mouse) retroviruses for
      ADA-deficient SCID. The level of gene transfer in blood cells and immune function will be
      measured as endpoints.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be open to twenty (20) infants and children diagnosed with ADA-deficient SCID
      who do not have a medically eligible, HLA-identical sibling donor for bone marrow
      transplantation. The EFS-ADA lentiviral vector with the human ADA cDNA will be used to
      transduce autologous CD34+ cells from the bone marrow of these subjects. The subjects will
      receive 4 mg/kg busulfan prior to re-infusion of their gene-modified cells. Safety is the
      primary endpoint. During the follow-up phase, the investigators will determine whether the
      cells can engraft and produce mature cells that contain and express the corrected ADA gene in
      the absence of PEG-ADA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which will be withheld at Day +30
      following transplant. Efficacy studies to evaluate level of immune reconstitution will begin
      in the first year and will continue in the second year. This Phase I/II clinical trial will
      be performed at Mattel Children's Hospital, UCLA and at the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical
      Research Center, NIH.
