  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After surgery for breast cancer, the prevalence of chronic pain is estimated between 20 and
      68%. They begin after surgery and may persist until more than 6 months. They respond poorly
      to opioid analgesics impair the quality of life.

      Among the different postoperative analgesic techniques used, the use of a local anesthetic
      infiltration continues catheter has advantages including improving the quality of analgesia,
      with a significant decrease in average of VAS (scale visual Analogue), a decrease in morphine
      consumption, improving the quality of life of patients.

      Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a continuous local anesthetic infiltration in
      the control of postoperative pain after mastectomy.
