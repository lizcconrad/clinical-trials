    <textblock>
      Phase IV, open-label, randomized, two-arm, multi-center study in patients with metastatic
      melanoma who are treatment naïve or have previously received a single non-immunologic
      therapy.

      Treatment Arm 1: Patients will receive two courses (four cycles) of High Dose Interleukin-2
      (HD IL-2) followed by one course (four doses) of ipilimumab.

      Treatment Arm 2: Patients will receive one course (four doses) of ipilimumab followed by two
      courses (four cycles) of HD IL-2.

      HD IL-2 and ipilimumab dosing regimens will comply with the instructions in the most current
      package inserts, institutional guidelines, and medical expertise of the treating physician.
      However, neither the ipilimumab nor the HD IL-2 should be dose reduced. If necessary, doses
      should be either held or permanently discontinued (per package insert instructions). Protocol
      specific dosing guidance is included in the 12PLK02 Work Instructions.

      Patients will be scheduled for four response assessments. Response assessment timing should
      be targeted to fall within the following time points: between 5-11 weeks, 13-19 weeks, 24-30
      weeks and one year after initiating therapy in either treatment arm. Timing of the response
      assessments may be adjusted to facilitate clinical procedures and treatment decisions.

      Patient treatment tolerability and safety events will be monitored and managed while enrolled
      in the 12PLK02 study. Patients who receive HD IL-2 in the 12PLK02 study will be enrolled in
      the PROCLAIM study (Registry Protocol 10PLK13) for the collection of long-term assessment
      data, including response and disease status and treatment decisions. Patient treatment data
      will be entered in to the PROCLAIM database, for a minimum target of 2 years and potentially
      up to 5 years, after the patient completes the 12PLK02 study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients 18 years or older

          -  Confirmed and measurable metastatic melanoma with at least one measurable lesion for
             evaluation of response

          -  Meets the requirements for HD IL-2 therapy per Institutional guidelines

          -  Meets the requirements for ipilimumab therapy per Institutional guidelines

          -  Treatment naïve or has received only one systemic therapy apart from adjuvant therapy.

          -  At least 4 weeks since last adjuvant therapy or other cancer treatment

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent and participate in study procedures as
             described in the 12PLK02 and 10PLK13 protocols. Patients consented for 12PLK02 will
             also be asked to participate in the 10PLK13 PROCLAIM registry study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with known or suspected infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
             hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) or other infectious hepatitis

          -  Untreated brain metastases. (Brain metastases that have been treated, which no longer
             require corticosteroid therapy and are without progression by MRI at least 6 weeks
             after definitive therapy are acceptable.)

          -  Received prior ipilimumab therapy (Prior Adjuvant Ipilimumab and Adjuvant Interferon
             are permitted with a minimum 4 week washout)

          -  Received prior HD IL-2 therapy.

          -  Received investigational drug within 30 days prior to study dosing. Patients may
