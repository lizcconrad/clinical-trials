  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to identify lifestyle factors associated with PCOS and understand
      how diet and activity levels impact features of PCOS. The secondary aim is to examine
      psychosocial factors (e.g., health beliefs) of women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects 6-12% of
      reproductive-aged women within the general population. Currently, there is limited knowledge
      on the current lifestyles of women with PCOS and the psychosocial factors associated with
      PCOS.

      The researchers plan to examine potential lifestyle differences and psychosocial factors
      between PCOS and healthy women. The Research Team is also interested in the relationships
      between biological markers and lifestyle endpoints in women with and without PCOS. Previous
      literature has shown there are biological marker differences between those with and without
      PCOS. By examining these relationships, researchers may further understand whether PCOS
      status is associated with lifestyle parameters.

      To accomplish these objectives, 240 women (120 women with PCOS, 120 women without PCOS and
      with normal menstrual cycles) will be included in this study. An equal number of lean and
      overweight/obese women will be recruited within each group based on body mass index (BMI;
      Lean = 18 - 24 kg/m2 and overweight/obese ≥ 25 kg/m2). Women will be included in the PCOS
      group if they have a confirmed PCOS diagnosis from their primary care provider. Participants
      will complete a food frequency questionnaire, a sleep questionnaire, and a physical activity
      questionnaire. A researcher may also provide participants with a waist-worn accelerometer to
      monitor physical activity and a wrist-worn accelerometer to monitor sleep for a week.
      Ultrasound scans of the ovaries will be assessed and the following metabolic parameters will
      be assessed: (1) 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test; (2) dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
      scan; (3) vitals and anthropometry assessment to measure waist and hip circumference, height,
      weight, blood pressure, and heart rate; (4) fasting blood tests to detect androgens (i.e.,
      total testosterone, androstenedione, free androgen index); and (5) an (optional) subcutaneous
      fat biopsy. Women with and without PCOS will also be asked to complete a questionnaire that
      will assess the psychosocial factors (e.g., health beliefs). This can be conducted online, in
      person, or through phone.
