  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with brain metastases who are candidates for treatment with stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) are potential study participants. SRS delivers high-energy,
      precisely-focused radiation to each brain metastasis to shrink the tumor, and is the
      standard-of-care for patients with these tumors. Oxygen enhances the damaging effects of
      radiation on tumor cells. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy increases oxygen levels in all
      kinds of tissues, including tumors. The purpose of this trial is to study whether it is
      feasible to treat patients with HBO just prior to receiving SRS, given the timing constraints
      of treating sequentially with HBO and then SRS. Patients will undergo HBO treatment followed
      by the placement of a Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame then transported ,via stretcher, to
      receive SRS. The transfer and placement of the head frame needs to be completed within the
      15minute time frame. The trial's secondary objectives are to determine whether it has any
      effects on outcomes and quality of life. As part of study participation patients will be
      asked to complete quality of life questionnaires as well as mini mental status
      questionnaires. These will be done prior to treatment and at follow up appointments
      throughout the next 3 years while participating in the study. Patients will be given the
      option to participate in the optional bio marker blood draw study which would require
      patients to have blood drawn at three time points, pre-treatment, the day after treatment and
      at their first follow up visit.

    <description>For the primary outcome variable of feasibility,the 20 evaluable patients will be analyzed on the basis of the amount of time required from leaving the HBO chamber to beginning the SRS for the target lesion(T1).The goal for each patient is for T1 to be no greater than 15 minutes.We anticipate a learning curve for the team members of this study.
The primary endpoint of feasibility is defined as having been achieved if more than 50% of the 20 evaluable patients start SRS treatment within 30 minutes of leaving the HBO tank:in other words,T1 is &lt;=30minutes &gt;50% of evaluable patients.</description>

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients must give informed consent indicating they are aware of the investigational
             nature of this treatment

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 70% (Zubrod score 0 to 1)

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             prior to start of study therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with the following conditions are not eligible to participate in this trial:

          -  Pregnant women or women of childbearing potential without adequate contraception

          -  COPD with C02 retention

             drive
