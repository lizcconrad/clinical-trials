  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, diabetes has emerged as one of the most significant co-diseases that many
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients develop. Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 (T2D) diabetes results when
      either the body does not make enough insulin or the body does not respond correctly to this
      insulin, respectively. Insulin is a hormone which is made by cells in the pancreas and helps
      carry glucose (sugar) from the food we eat to the cells of the body for energy. While cystic
      fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) has many features similar to both T1D and T2D, patients with
      CF may not have the same symptoms as either T1D or T2D patients. Currently, there is little
      understanding of CFRD and the best options for treatment remain unclear.

      The purpose of this research study is to examine and understand the various mechanisms that
      contribute to CFRD and gain a better understanding of potential means to treat CFRD. In
      particular, we plan to study the effects of incretin hormones that can enhance insulin
      production in CF patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) was considered to be a consequence of
      damage to the pancreas therefore the cells contained in the pancreas--i.e.--islets that house
      beta cells, which make and release insulin (similar to T1D). Recent evidence suggests that
      other factors may also be associated that are similar to those with T2D. For example,
      patients with T2D, have decreased secretion of incretins, hormones released by the small
      intestine in response to nutrients from food which act, among other things, to increase
      insulin secretion from Beta cells of the pancreas. When patients with T2D are treated with
      incretin hormones, their pancreatic Beta cells release more insulin (measured as 'second
      phase insulin secretion'). Currently, we do not know if patients with CFRD have decreased
      incretin secretion like T2D or if treating CFRD patients with incretin hormones will improve
      their insulin levels. This study will measure insulin release from the Beta cells from CFRD
      patients (second phase insulin secretion) that are being given incretin hormones in the
      veins. This will be compared with insulin release when the same patients are given a placebo
      (salt containing solution). The patients and the research team will not know what is being
      given until all the results are collected. The results will provide unbiased evidence if
      incretins will help improve insulin release in CFRD patients.

    <description>The key endpoint of interest will be the change in second phase insulin response derived from the Glucose-Potentiated Arginine (GPA) test. The GPA test will measure insulin (and other glucose controlling hormones) which will be a measure of pancreatic endocrine function in response to injection of arginine. Arginine is a naturally occurring amino acid (substance) in the body. It will be given in the veins to make the pancreas secrete insulin. After the first injection of arginine, a glucose infusion will be started in order to raise the level of sugar in the blood to 230 mg/dl. Once the level is achieved, arginine will be injected again and blood samples are measured. After a 2 hour break, the glucose infusion will be started to achieve a blood sugar of 340mg/dl and arginine injection will be repeated. Comparison of responses with incretin vs. placebo will be performed using statistical methods, specifically, paired t-test or Wilcoxon matched pair test.</description>

The GPA test will be performed for the 340 mg/dL glucose levels but no incretin will be infused during this part of the test.
