    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, 2-period, placebo-controlled, single-center, crossover study,
      efficacy study demonstrating the therapeutic equivalence of the test cellulose disc (matrix)
      in EMLA patch and the current commercial cellulose disc (matrix) in EMLA patch in healthy
      subjects.

      This study will be a double-blind, randomized, 2-period, placebo-controlled, crossover study
      in healthy male and female subjects, performed at a single study center. Prior to inclusion,
      informed consent will be obtained. A brief medical history, including limited demographic
      data (gender, age and ethnicity) will be recorded, and eligibility for inclusion to the study
      will be established through a physical inspection of hands. Subjects will be shown how to
      complete the VAS. Visual analogue scale (VAS) as a research tool is frequently used for the
      assessment of pain severity and relief. VAS is easy to use and can be applied in a variety of
      settings; results are reproducible. VAS data are sensitive to treatment effects and can be
      analyzed using parametric statistical techniques. At each specific study visit, each subject
      will undergo a left-right comparison of two patch preparations, followed by a repeated test
      with an alternate combination of preparations. Thus, the study will comprise: Visit 1: EMLA
      Test Patch plus Placebo Patch OR EMLA Test Patch plus EMLA current Reference Patch. Visit 2:
      EMLA Test Patch plus EMLA current Reference Patch OR EMLA Test Patch plus Placebo Patch.
      There will be a washout period of at minimum of 4 calendar days between treatment periods
      (visits). No follow-up visit is needed. Any adverse event (AE) that is ongoing at the last
      visit will be followed up as appropriate.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of anesthetic efficacy of EMLA Test Patch with the marketed EMLA patch (EMLA current Reference Patch) by pain reduction assessment.</measure>
    <time_frame>At test procedure 1 and at test procedure 2 (which is after 4 days of washout period following test procedure 1).</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the anesthetic efficacy in pain reduction after an intravenous needle insertion whether or not actual IV insertion was achieved will be evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). The degree of pain experienced will be assessed on a 100 mm horizontal, non-graded paper-based VAS, with the endpoints representing &quot;no pain&quot; (0 mm), to &quot;the worst possible pain&quot; (100 mm). The VAS scores will be listed by subject, treatment sequence (TP/TR and TR/TP, where T=test, R=reference and P=Placebo), treatment (T, R and P) and hand (left, right).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with Adverse events (AEs), skin sensation and reactions as variables of safety and tolerability.</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization until test procedure 2 or last study visit, whichever is later.</time_frame>
    <description>AEs will be collected from the start of randomization throughout the treatment period up to and including the Follow-up Visit. Any AE that is ongoing at the last visit will be followed up as appropriate. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent. Local skin sensations will be assessed by asking about injection site sensations (sensation experienced before removal of the patch), this will be rated on a four-point scale: none, mild, moderate or severe. Skin reactions will be performed after removal of the patch to inspect the area which has been in contact with the cream and the patch. Two separate assessments will be made - one for the skin in contact with the cream and one for the skin which had been in contact with the adhesive border.</description>
