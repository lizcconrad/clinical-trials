        Inclusion Criteria:

        Candidates must meet ALL of the following criteria to be enrolled in the study.

          -  Is ambulatory, able and willing to comply with the study protocol and has provided
             written informed consent

          -  Age 21-85, inclusive

          -  Trans-septal catheterization is determined to be feasible by the treating physician

          -  NYHA class II-IV heart failure of any etiology

          -  Symptomatic with MR grade ≥ 2+

          -  LVEF &lt; 40%

          -  LVEDD &gt; 50 mm and ≤ 75 mm

          -  No anticipated change in patient's cardiac medication regimen anticipated throughout
             the course of the study.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator and heart surgery team, the patient is not an
             appropriate candidate for surgery, and the use of the ARTO System is technically
             feasible

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Candidates will be excluded from enrollment in the study if ANY of the following conditions
        apply.

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, the femoral vein and internal jugular vein cannot
             accommodate a 16 F catheter or the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter
             would interfere with advancement of the catheter or ipsilateral DVT is present

          -  Significant structural abnormality of the mitral valve (e.g., flail, prolapse, leaflet
             calcification)

          -  Significant mitral annular calcification

          -  Hemodynamic instability (systolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg without afterload reduction or
             cardiogenic shock or the need for inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon pump)

          -  Prior mitral valve surgery or valvuloplasty or any currently implanted prosthetic
             valve or VAD

          -  History of, or active, rheumatic heart disease

          -  History of Atrial Septal Defects (ASD), whether repaired or not

          -  History of previously repaired PFO or PFO associated with clinical symptoms (e.g.,
             cerebral ischemia) within 6 months of the planned investigational procedure

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, an atrial septal aneurysm is present that may
             interfere with transseptal crossing

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL or dialysis dependent

          -  No access to coronary sinus and/or great cardiac vein

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3

          -  Evidence of active infection (fever with temperature &gt; 38°C and/or WBC &gt; 15,000) or
             endocarditis

          -  Echocardiographic evidence of mass intracardiac thrombus

          -  Patients on prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy (asprin + any P2Y12 inhibitor) that
             cannot be discontinued.

          -  Percutaneous coronary intervention or surgery anticipated within the 6 month follow up
             period following the investigational procedure

          -  Biventricular pacing initiated or anticipated within 6 months of the planned
             investigational procedure

          -  Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 12 weeks of the planned
             investigational procedure

          -  Stroke or TIA within 6 months of the planned investigational procedure

          -  GI bleeding within 6 months of the planned investigational procedure

          -  Intravenous drug abuse or suspected inability to adhere to follow-up

          -  Patients in whom TTE, TEE or ICE is contraindicated

          -  Contraindication to CT scan

          -  A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to study or procedure medications
             (specifically aspirin, clopidogrel and heparin) that cannot be adequately managed
             medically

          -  A known allergy or hypersensitivity to nickel

          -  A known need for any other cardiac surgery including surgery for coronary artery
             disease, atrial fibrillation, pulmonic, aortic or tricuspid valve disease

          -  In the judgment of the Investigator, patients in whom the presence of a permanent
             pacemaker or pacing leads would interfere with placement of the test device or the
             placement of the test device would disrupt the leads

          -  Irreversible bleeding disorder, history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or
             refuses blood transfusion

          -  Evidence of disease or condition expected to compromise survival (&lt; 1 year) or ability
             to complete follow-up assessments

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints. [Note: Trials requiring extended follow-up for products that were
             investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not considered
             investigational trials]
