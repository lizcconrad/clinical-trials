  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The THRIVE study is a healthy retail intervention that improves the food environments in
      tribally owned and operated convenience stores in the Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation of
      Oklahoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The THRIVE study is a cluster randomized trial, using a community-based participatory
      research approach, of &quot;healthy makeovers&quot; in eight convenience stores owned and operated by
      the Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. The study will test the ability of
      tribal nations to increase fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption among tribal
      members through environmental and policy approaches. Investigators hypothesize that tribal
      members exposed to the highest doses of the intervention (i.e. those who visit the
      intervention convenience stores the most) will increase their fruit and vegetable intake.
      Individual-level changes in fruit and vegetable intake will be measured via a survey
      administered to a cohort of 1600 American Indian shoppers before and after the intervention.
      A multimedia manual, Website, and documentary film will be created as part of the
      implementation of THRIVE to engage tribal citizens, enhance local knowledge, and guide other
      tribes to improve their food and physical activity environments.
