  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Dr. Shi recently proposed a new technique as Ossification of anterior
      decompression surgery, which is also called anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion
      (ACAF) , for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and cervical canal
      stenosis（CSS）. Yet, the effectiveness and safety should be further studied.

      Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of clinical outcomes between
      ACAF surgery and Anterior cervical corpectomy decompression and fusion（ACCF）in patients with
      OPLL and CSS . A study hypothesis is that ACAF surgery outcomes will be equal even better and
      lower surgical complications which compared to ACCF surgery.

      Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial with randomized, controlled, multicenter
      research design. The OPLL patients will be randomly assigned in one of the two treatment
      groups: ACAF surgery and ACCF surgery. Five outcome measures will be collected pre-operative
      for baseline, and then at1, 12, 24, 48, 96,240weeks post-operative follow-up visits,
      including: (1)JOA) .(2)VAS. (3)NURIC Graded .(4)NDI . (5) radiological parameter. After
      randomization, the ACAF group will receive anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion
      and the ACCF group will receive anterior cervical corpectomy decompression and fusion.

      Background: Although anterior and posterior decompression surgery are both reported to treat
      patients with myelopathy caused by OPLL（Posterior longitudinal ligament ossification）. The
      surgical strategy of the disease is still controversial when the OPLL is multilevel and
      severe. Novel techniques for better and safer results are required. Dr. Shi recently proposed
      a new technique as Ossification of anterior decompression surgery, which is also called
      anterior controllable antedisplacement and fusion (ACAF) , for ossification of the posterior
      longitudinal ligament (OPLL) with myelopathy. Yet, the effectiveness and safety should be
      further studied.

      Purpose: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of clinical
      outcomes between ACAF surgery and Anterior cervical corpectomy decompression and
      fusion（ACCF）in patients with OPLL. A study hypothesis is that ACAF surgery outcomes will be
      equal even better and lower surgical complications which compared to ACCF surgery.

      Methods: This study is a randomized clinical trial with randomized, controlled, multicenter
      research design. The OPLL patients will be randomly assigned in one of the two treatment
      groups: ACAF surgery and ACCF surgery. Five outcome measures will be collected pre-operative
      for baseline, and then at1, 12, 24, 48, 96,240weeks post-operative follow-up visits,
      including : (1) Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scales to assess the spinal cord
      functions.(2)Visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain relief. (3)NURIC Graded to assess
      walking function.(4) Neck Disabilitv Index(NDI) to assess cervical function . (5)
      radiological parameters to assess ossification forward distance. And the pre &amp; postoperative
      radiological parameters, and surgical complications were also investigated. The investigator
      performing the outcome measures will be blinded to group assignment, and therefore will not
      participate in treatment. After randomization, the ACAF group will receive anterior
      controllable antedisplacement and fusion and the ACCF group will receive anterior cervical
      corpectomy decompression and fusion.

      Data Analysis: T test or wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to examine the differences in
      the five measures between groups and at the six different time frames with the α level set at
      0.05. Chi square test will be used to compare the differences in the surgical complications
      data over time and between groups.

    <time_frame>At 1 week pre- and 1, 12, 24, 48,96，240 weeks post-operative follow-up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>JOA total score up to 17 points, the lowest 0 points. The lower the score, the more obvious the dysfunction. Improvement index = post-treatment score - pre-treatment score, post-treatment score improvement rate = [(post-treatment score - pre-treatment score) / 17 - pre-treatment score] × 100%. By improving the index can reflect the improvement of patients before and after treatment and clinical efficacy. The improvement rate can also correspond to the commonly used efficacy criteria: cure is 100% improvement, improvement is greater than 60% effective, 25-60% is effective, and less than 25% is ineffective.</description>

    <description>NURIC Graded presented by NURIC in 1972 used to assess improvement of Walking function。s divided into 6 levels, 0 - Although there are symptoms, but not based on the basis of spinal cord involvement (no limb numbness, decreased muscle strength and other symptoms); Grade 1 - spinal cord involvement (numbness of the limbs, decreased muscle strength and other symptoms), but normal gait; Level 2 ---- mild gait abnormalities, does not affect the work; Level 3 ---- abnormal gait, affecting work; Level 4 ---- Need to support before walking; Level 5 ---- can not walk.</description>
