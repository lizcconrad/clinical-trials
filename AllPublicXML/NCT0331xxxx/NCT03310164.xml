  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence have implied that microbiota from airway and gut might be involved in the
      pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the cross-talk between
      respiratory and gastrointestinal microbiome in COPD is still undetermined. The study is aimed
      to investigate the interaction between lung and gut flora, and their role in the process of
      COPD.

      Despite the high prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), there continues
      to be a large gap in our understanding of disease pathogenesis and mechanisms accounting for
      large variability in disease phenotype. Cigarette smoking is the principal cause of COPD, but
      only approximately 15% of adults with substantial tobacco exposure develop clinical COPD.
      Besides, bacterial colonization or infection is also considered as an important factor in
      COPD. There are very limited data from microbiome studies that suggest that respiratory and
      gastrointestinal microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of COPD. However, the
      cross-talk between between lung and gut microbiome, and their relationship with various
      clinical phenotypes of COPD. Here, we conducted 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing to evaluate the
      link between the lung-gut axis and the clinical phenotypes of COPD, such as lung function,
      emphysema, symptoms, exacerbations, inflammation levels and metabolic features.
