  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is the evaluation of concomitant association of
      ultrafractionated irradiation and Temodal® in patients with inoperable primary glioblastoma
      multiforme; study of tolerance and objective response rate.

      The secondary purposes of this study are the evaluation of progression free survival, global
      survival and tolerance through toxicity study. The therapeutic response according to
      methylation or not of MGMT is also evaluated.
