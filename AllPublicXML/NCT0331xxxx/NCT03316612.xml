  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) has been linked to ageing, and many metabolic
      diseases. The findings of previous experiments suggested that the extracts from
      polyphenol-rich bilberry might inhibit the formation of AGEs. This is a randomized
      double-blind trial, aims to study the effect of Vaccinium Myrtillus L. natural extracts on
      AGEs and human metabolism. Firstly, we will investigate the efficacy of Bilberry extracts on
      lowering the levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Secondly, we will conduct 16S
      rRNA sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric
      (UPLC-MS/MS) detection to explore the role of bilberry extracts on gut microbiota as well as
      metabolites.

    <masking_description>The all details of groups assignment are arranged and controlled by the research designers. The color, shape, and external packaging of the bilberry extract and placebo are consistent (brown oval tablets). Each bottle of tablets will be marked with the name (or identify number) of the participants by research designers. Thus, the grouping of participants is blind to the rest of the researchers (like outcomes assessors).</masking_description>
