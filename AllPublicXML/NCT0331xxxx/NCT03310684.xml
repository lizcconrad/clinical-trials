  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric primary hypertension is increasingly common, occurring in 5-10% of normal-weight
      children and up to 25% of children with obesity. It is a risk factor for adult cardiovascular
      and renal disease. But even during childhood, hypertension is associated with significant
      morbidity, including cognitive impairment and organ damage. In the heart and kidneys, this
      organ damage is characterized by thickened heart muscle (left ventricular hypertrophy) and
      spillage of protein in the urine (albuminuria). Obese children are also at risk for fatty
      liver disease. However, the cause of pediatric primary hypertension, the role of obesity, and
      the mechanisms behind heart and kidney injury are poorly understood. Due to these
      limitations, there are no first-line medications, and treatment is often inadequate. An
      altered renin-angiotensin system may cause primary hypertension and related organ damage.
      Evidence suggests uric acid, FGF23, klotho, and obesity play a role in renin-angiotensin
      system-mediated injury. An improved comprehension of the pathophysiology of pediatric primary
      hypertension could enhance clinical care by targeting treatment to the cause of disease and
      informing novel measurement of organ damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposal is to begin to elucidate the origins of pediatric primary hypertension and
      determine how it causes cardiac and renal disease. The primary hypothesis is than an altered
      renin-angiotensin system leads to the development of pediatric primary hypertension-related
      organ damage in the heart and kidney, specifically left ventricular hypertrophy and
      albuminuria. It is postulated that relative increase in angiotensin (Ang) ll tone compared to
      Ang-(1-7) tone in the circulation and the kidney (measured in the plasma and urine,
      respectively) leads to disease. The secondary hypotheses are that abnormalities in
      renin-angiotensin system tone are related to higher uric acid and FGF23, lower klotho, and,
      with concurrent obesity, contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The investigators
      will recruit 100 subjects aged 5-17 years who are referred for a new diagnosis of pediatric
      primary hypertension to the Pediatric Nephrology clinic at Brenner Children's Hospital, 50
      normotensive subjects with obesity recruited from the Brenner Families-in-Training program,
      and 10 healthy normotensive from a general pediatrics clinic in the Wake Forest Baptist
      Health System.
