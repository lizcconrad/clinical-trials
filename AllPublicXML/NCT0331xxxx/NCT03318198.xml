  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized cross over trial investigating the effect of intensive attending supervision of
      residents caring for inpatients on the medical service on both patient safety and educational
      outcomes. Hypothesis: increased attending supervision would improve patient safety and
      resident education.

      Background While the relationship between resident work hours and patient safety has been
      extensively studied, little research has evaluated the role of attending supervision on
      patient safety and education.

      Investigators conducted a 9-month randomized, cross-over trial on an inpatient medicine
      teaching service where 22 faculty provided either: 1) direct supervision where attendings
      joined work rounds on established (previously admitted) patients or 2) standard supervision
      where attendings were available, but did not join work rounds. Each faculty member
      participated in both arms in random order. The primary safety outcome was rate of medical
      errors. Secondary safety outcomes included deaths and transfers to the intensive care unit.
      Resident education was evaluated via a time motion study to assess resident participation on
      rounds and surveys to measure resident and attending educational ratings.

    <measure>Measurement of the rate of medical errors defined as preventable adverse events and near misses. Patient Safety Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Using a previously validated protocol (PMID:24871238) to assess these outcomes, five research nurses reviewed the medical records, formal incident reports from the hospital incident-reporting system, daily pharmacy reports, pharmacy paging logs and solicited reports from nurses working on the study units and noted any adverse events or near misses. Four physician investigators, blinded to attending and intervention, classified each suspected incident as an adverse event, near miss or exclusion (an incident determined to be neither a medical error or adverse event). Physician reviewers further classified all adverse events as preventable or non-preventable. Medical Error rates are reports as number of events per 1,000 patient days</description>

    <measure>Resident Engagement on Rounds: Educational Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time motion study of the amount of time residents and faculty speak during rounds. Time was measured by a research assistant using a Microsoft access program embedded on an IPAD that recorded length of time. Time measurement outcomes are reported in minutes</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resident and Faculty Perception of Education, Educational Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 20 question survey based on prior literature (PMID: 25340363) asking about resident and faculty experience with different levels of faculty supervision. The survey questions each were followed by a 5 point scale with a range from strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree to strongly disagree. Strongly agree represents a better outcome. There were no subscales.</description>

    <description>Attendings were randomized at the start of the study to begin in the enhanced supervision arm where they attended resident work rounds. They then crossed over to the control arm where they did not attend work rounds. The outcomes were assessed between the two periods during which the attending participated in the study; attending work rounds vs. not attending work rounds.</description>
