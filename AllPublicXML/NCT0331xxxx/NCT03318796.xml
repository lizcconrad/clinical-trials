  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this PAS is to assure the continued safety and effectiveness of the
      Tryton Side Branch Stent™ with main branch approved DES in the treatment of de novo native
      coronary artery bifurcation lesions with side branch diameter ranging from ≥2.5 mm to ≤3.5 mm
      and main branch diameter ranging from ≥2.5 mm to ≤4.0 mm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        General Inclusion Criteria

          1. The patient must be ≥18 and ≤ 90 years of age;

          2. Acceptable candidate for CABG;

          3. The intention to treat the side branch of the target bifurcation based on angiographic
             evaluation

          4. The patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations;

          5. The patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of
             the study, agrees to its provisions and has been provided written informed consent,
             approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB).

          6. Planned use of FDA approved and commercially available drug-eluting stents (DES) for
             subject's index procedure Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          7. a) Single de novo lesion in a bifurcation involving both the main branch and the side
             branch b) The bifurcation: main branch and side branch with a visual diameter stenosis
             ≥ 50% (Medina classification 1.1.1; 0.1.1; 1.0.1) by visual assessment;

          5. Known allergy to cobalt chromium

          6. Hypersensitivity or contraindication to cobalt-chromium or structurally-related

             receive the recommended dual anti-platelet (aspirin and an approved P2Y12 inhibitor)
             and/or anticoagulant therapy

             Angiographic Exclusion Criteria:

          9. Left main coronary artery disease (protected and unprotected);

         10. Trifurcation lesion;

         11. Totally occluded target vessels (TIMI flow 0 or 1);

         12. Moderate to Severely calcified target lesion(s);

         13. Highly calcified target lesion(s) requiring rotational atherectomy;

         14. Target lesion has excessive tortuosity unsuitable for stent delivery and deployment;

         15. Angiographic evidence of thrombus in the target lesion(s);

         16. Tryton Stent placement without angioplasty pre-dilatation of the main branch and side
             branch (i.e., direct stenting is contraindicated)

         17. Tryton Stent placement alone, without implantation of a main branch stent

         18. An untreated significant (&gt;50%) stenosis proximal or distal in either the side branch
             or main branch;

         19. Impaired runoff in the treatment vessel with diffuse distal disease;
