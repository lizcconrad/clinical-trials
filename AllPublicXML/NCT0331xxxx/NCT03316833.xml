      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the
      new-generation zotarolimus-eluting stent Resolute Onyx in the treatment of unprotected left
      main coronary artery disease (ULMCAD), both isolated or in association with two- or
      three-vessel coronary artery disease.

      The ROLEX study is a prospective, non-randomized, European, multi-center registry.

      Four hundred and fifty patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease (ULMCAD)
      will be enrolled at up to 40 European sites. The main objective of the study is to assess the
      safety and efficacy of the new-generation zotarolimus-eluting stent Resolute Onyx in the
      treatment of ULMCAD, both isolated or in association with two- or three-vessel coronary
      artery disease
