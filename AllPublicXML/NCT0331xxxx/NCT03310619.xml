  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study to determine
      the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and patient reported quality of life of JCAR017 in
      combination with various agents. The first combination, defined as Arm A, will evaluate
      JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab. Within each arm, cohorts and subcohorts will test
      different doses and schedules of the combination agent(s).

      The study will consist of 2 parts: dose finding (Phase 1) and dose expansion (Phase 2).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a global, open-label, multi-arm, multi-cohort, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study to
      determine the safety, tolerability, PK, efficacy and patient reported quality of life of
      JCAR017 in combination with various agents. This protocol is intended to evaluate various
      drug combinations with JCAR017, as separate arms, over the life of the protocol, using the
      same objectives.

      During the Phase 1 part, different arms may be opened to test JCAR017 in combination with
      combination agent(s). Within each arm, different doses and schedules of JCAR017 and the
      combination agent(s) may be tested in several cohorts and subcohorts per arm. During the
      Phase 2 part of the study, the expansion of any dose level and schedule that has been shown
      to be safe may occur.

      Arm A will test JCAR017 in combination with durvalumab in adult subjects with R/R aggressive
      B-cell NHL.

      All subjects from Phase 1 and Phase 2 will be followed for 24 months following JCAR017
      infusion. Post-study follow-up for survival, relapse, long-term toxicity (including new
      malignancies), and viral vector safety will continue under a separate long-term follow-up
      (LTFU) protocol for up to 15 years after the JCAR017 dose as per health authority regulatory
      guidelines.
