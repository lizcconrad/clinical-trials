      Pilot study to investigate the effect of choline chloride in cystic fibrosis patients with
      liver steatosis by comparing their status before and after the intervention
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within this single arm pilot study patients with cystic fibrosis and liver steatosis receive
      choline chloride (2x0.5 gram three times a day) as a food supply for 88 days. D9-choline
      metabolism is measured before and after the intervention phase. Hypothesis of the study is,
      that supplying choline augments the secretion of phosphatidyl choline and lipoprotein (VLDL)
      from the liver and therefore results in a measurable reduction of the triglyceride storage of
      the liver.
