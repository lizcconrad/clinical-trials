    <measure>Tear Film Lipid Layer Thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 hours of contact lens wear time</time_frame>
    <description>The lipid layer of the tear film will be viewed for each eye. A validated color scale will be used as measurement of thin film lipid layer by the imaging interferometric colors. The measured lipid layer thickness may range from 10 (thinnest) to 240 (thickest) nanometers (nm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear Film Stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 hours of contact lens wear time</time_frame>
    <description>A videokeratometer will be used to assess the stability of the tear film, by displaying disturbances to the reflected ring pattern. Non-invasive tear break-up time (NIBUT) will be the standard clinical measurement used to indicate the stability of the pre-ocular tear film. The measurement, NIBUT, involves three measurements on each eye.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tear Film Lipid Pattern</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 2 hours of contact lens wear time</time_frame>
    <description>Using a slit lamp and Tearscope, the characteristics of the tear film will be assessed. The pattern of the lipid layer will be graded on a 7-type scale: None, Open Meshwork, Closed (Tight Meshwork), Flow (Wave), Amorphous, Colors, Other.</description>
