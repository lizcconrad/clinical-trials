  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Copeptin is a glycopeptide released by the post-pituitary gland. In case of decrease in blood
      volume or blood pressure, it is secreted in the serum in an equimolar quantity to arginine
      vasopressin (AVP) . Unlike AVP, copeptin is readily assayable in serum and its prognostic
      value has been recently observed during cirrhosis. However, the pathophysiological
      relationships between serum copeptin concentrations and indirect markers of inflammation are
      unknown.

      The main objective of this multicenter pilot study is to study the relationship between serum
      copeptin and markers of inflammatory stress in cirrhotic patients with ascites. It is indeed
      in this population with high-risk of complications that most need biomarkers of events (like
      death) are needed. The main secondary objective is to evaluate the prognostic interest at 6
      months of the variation of copeptin between day 0- day15.

      The investigators wish to include prospectively 100 cirrhotic patients with ascites requiring
      prolonged hospitalization in the Hepato-gastroenterology departments of the Besançon, Nancy
      and Reims hospitals. The inclusion and follow-up periods will be six months each. At the
      inclusion of the patients we will evaluate the correlations between the plasma concentration
      of copeptin and 1 / the severity of cirrhosis (Child-Pugh and MELD scores) and serum sodium;
      2 / systemic inflammation markers (CRP, leukocytes, IL-6 and lipopolysaccharides), 3 /
      calprotectin concentration in ascites. &quot;
