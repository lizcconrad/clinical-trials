    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the outcomes of patients who receive a
      certain type of skin substitute called RestrataTM Wound Matrix (Restrata™). Results of this
      study may be used to make decisions on whether to conduct additional studies on this
      particular wound matrix product. RestrataTM has been cleared by the Food and Drug
      Administration for use in certain types of ulcer treatments, including the type that will be
      part of this study (diabetic foot ulcers).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age 18 or older

          -  Patient's ulcer must be diabetic in origin, located at least in part on the plantar
             surface and larger than 1cm2 after the run-in period. Debridement will be done prior
             to randomization. Subject's informed consent for participating in this study, must be
             obtained prior to proceeding with sharp debridement

          -  Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
             mellitus per ADA).

          -  Ulcer must be present for a minimum of four weeks before enrollment/randomization,
             with documented failure of prior treatment to heal the wound. A two-week run in period
             will precede enrollment/randomization in the trial to document the indolent nature of
             the patients selected

          -  Patient does not exhibit clinical signs / symptoms of infection upon gross observation
             (at least 3 of the following: pain, redness, purulence, exudate, temperature) or have
             been diagnosed with an active infection at time of screening

          -  Patient is willing to provide informed consent and is willing to participate in all
             procedures and follow up evaluations necessary to complete the study

          -  Patient has adequate control of diabetes, as demonstrated by one of the following
             within 30 days of screening:

               -  HbA1c &lt; 12%

               -  Serum Creatinine &lt; 3.0mg/dl

          -  Patient has adequate circulation to the affected extremity, as demonstrated by one of
             the following within the past 60 days of the first screening visit:

               -  Dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test (TcPO2) with results

                  ≥30mmHg, OR

               -  ABIs with results of ≥0.7 and ≤1.5, OR

               -  Doppler arterial waveforms, which are triphasic or biphasic at the ankle of
                  affected leg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with an ulcer probing to bone (UT Grade IIIA-D)

          -  Patients whose index diabetic foot ulcers are greater than 25cm2

          -  Patient has an additional wound within 3cm of the study wound

          -  Patients not in reasonable metabolic control

          -  Patients with a known history of poor compliance with medical treatments

          -  Patients who have been previously enrolled into this study, or are presently
             participating in a clinical trial with DFU indications

          -  Patients with known or suspected local skin malignancy to the index diabetic ulcer

          -  Patients diagnosed with autoimmune connective tissues diseases

          -  Patients that have received a graft material on the study ulcer within the previous 30
             days

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Patients who are taking medications that are considered immune system modulator

          -  Study wound has closed &gt; 30% over the two-week run-in period

          -  Patients with a known allergy to resorbable suture materials
