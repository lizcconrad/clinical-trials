  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant Pleural Effusion (MPE) is a collection of fluid inside the chest caused by cancer.
      It is a common medical problem and often causes severe breathlessness. Patients with this
      condition generally have a very poor survival and so it is extremely important that they are
      given effective treatment as soon as possible to minimise the amount of time they have to
      spend in hospital.

      Standard treatment for MPE involves an admission to hospital to drain the fluid and then
      attempt to prevent the fluid from returning by sticking the lung to the inside of the rib
      cage with medical talc powder which acts like glue. This is called talc pleurodesis (TP) but
      unfortunately it fails in about 30% of patients. This is usually because the lung has not
      fully re-expanded and has not made contact with the inside of the ribs. When this happens,
      the fluid can be effectively treated with a different type of drainage tube called an
      indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) which tunnels under the skin and is drained at home by the
      district nurses.

      It is thought that pressure measurements taken from the fluid as it is drained may be able to
      show doctors whether or not the lung will re-expand before patients are committed to either
      TP or an IPC. In this research we wish to test if these measurements can be used to choose
      which is the best first treatment option (TP or IPC) for patients with MPE. We have called
      this 'EDIT management'. Since it is uncertain whether this new approach will work, patients
      will be randomised to have either standard treatment or EDIT management. We will compare the
      two groups to assess whether the patients who had EDIT management had to have fewer repeat
      procedures over the following 3 months.
