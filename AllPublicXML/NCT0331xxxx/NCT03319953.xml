  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether motivation/reward deficits observed in
      schizophrenia are attenuated and whether cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia
      is improved by add-on TAK-041 administration to antipsychotics in participants with stable
      schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-041. TAK-041 is being tested to treat
      people who have stable schizophrenia. This study will look whether motivation/reward deficits
      observed in schizophrenia are attenuated and whether cognitive impairment associated with
      schizophrenia is improved in people who take TAK-041 in addition to standard care.

      The study will enroll approximately 32 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) in 1:1 ratio to one of the two treatment sequences â€”which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need) to receive either TAK-041 40 mg or Placebo first and then will be
      crossed over to receive the opposite Intervention

      All participants will be asked to take oral suspension on Day 1 of each period. There will be
      a wash-out period of 35 days between the dosing days in Period 1 and 2.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 126 to 154 days. Participants will make a multiple
      visits to the clinic plus a final visit 77 days after receiving their last dose of drug for a
      follow-up assessment.

    <description>The MID task is a reward anticipation paradigm that robustly engage the VS, a key area associated with coding incentive reward. Dysfunctional processing of reward information is associated with motivational impairments in schizophrenia. Motivational impairment is a key aspect of negative symptoms, and has been associated with reduced activity in the VS.</description>
