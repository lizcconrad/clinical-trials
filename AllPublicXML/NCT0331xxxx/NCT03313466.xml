  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of internet-based cognitive
      behavioral therapy (iCBT) vs usual care for insomnia. The target population is patients
      prescribed medications for insomnia who have not had a dispensation of these medications in
      the preceding six months. The primary outcomes is dispensed days supply over the subsequent
      one year. Secondary outcomes include all types of health system clinical encounters. The
      investigators hypothesize that the group randomized into iCBT will have less insomnia
      medications dispensed than usual care controls, and less clinical encounters..
