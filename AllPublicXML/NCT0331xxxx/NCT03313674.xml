  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a subtype of Major Depressive Disorder, characterized by
      a recurrent temporal relationship between the season of year, the onset and the remission of
      a major depressive episode. Estimates of the annual prevalence state that 1-6% of the
      population will develop SAD with the larger prevalences found at greater extremes in
      latitude. SAD is most likely triggered by the shortening photoperiod experienced in the
      winter months leading to a deterioration of mood. Recent cross-sectional neuroimaging studies
      have found cellular and neurotransmitter changes in response to seasonality, ultimately
      having an impact on the affect of patients. Conversly, this study aims to investigate the
      changes in neurocircuitry related to depression and euthymic states. Patients with SAD offer
      a unique ability to study these changes since they have predictable triggers for the onset of
      depression (i.e. the winter months) and remission (i.e. the summer months).

    <description>Sigh-SAD measures Depressive Severity specifically in SAD patients. It contains 29 items, with the total score ranging from 0 to 29. Higher values in the scale indicate worse depression severity.
Of the 29 items, 21 question (adapted from the Hamilton Depression scale) are used to determine typical depression severity, with an additional eight items for the &quot;atypical&quot; symptoms which are presented in seasonal affective disorder. The final score is summed, with equal weighting, to give the total score.</description>
