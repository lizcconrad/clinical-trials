      This is a Phase 1, single-dose, open-label, dose-escalation study. The study will be
      conducted in three parts (i.e. regimens) in an outpatient setting as follows:

        -  Regimen A: FATE-NK100 as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumor
           malignancies.

        -  Regimen B: FATE-NK100 in combination with trastuzumab in subjects with human epidermal
           growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) advanced breast cancer, HER2+ advanced gastric
           cancer or other advanced HER2+ solid tumors.

        -  Regimen C: FATE-NK100 in combination with cetuximab in subjects with advanced colorectal
           cancer (CRC) or head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), or other epidermal growth
           factor receptor 1 positive (EGFR1+) advanced solid tumors.
