  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Needle biopsy samples are routinely collected to evaluate cytomorphology, immunohistochemical
      markers and for mutational analysis. With regular use of immunotheraputic interventions,
      needle biospy has become more frequent and requires bigger samples for an increasing battery
      of tests. There has been no clear consensus on which biopsy needle yields the best biopsy
      sample. It is unclear if large 19g needle offers better yield than a 22 g needle. Although
      previous studies comparing 21, 22 and 19g needles have suggested that larger needles yield
      larger biopsy sizes, conflictng studies have shown that larger biopsies lead to bloodier
      samples with potentially smaller fragments of tissue, offering no improvement in diagnostic,
      yield, adequacy or sample size.

      This study compares biopsy samples collected using 19g and 22g needles from patients of non
      small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) scheduled to undergo endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and
      transbroncial needle aspiration (TBNA).

      Primary Objective To compare the diagnostic yield of 22g and 19g EBUS transbronchial needle
      aspirate (TBNA)

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To compare the sample adequacy of 22g and 19g EBUS TBNA

        2. To compare the sample quality of 22g and 19 g EBUS TBNA

    <intervention_model_description>All abnormal lymph nodes able to be visualized by EBUS will be biopsied with sequential passes until a macroscopic specimen can be seen in the sample container. Each needle size will be used to take consecutive passes until the sample is complete and each pass will consist of 15-20 agitations. The needle size to be used first will be chosen by permuted block randomization scheme by the statistician. After all passes are done with the first needle, the alternate size needle will be used to biopsy the same lymph node. Samples will be placed in separate containers of formalin. Any subsequent lymph nodes in the same patient will be biopsied with the alternate sized needle first. Further, any lung nodules or masses that can be adequately visualized by EBUS where biopsy is clinically indicated will be sampled with both 22g and 19g TBNA needles in the same fashion. However, these lesions will be randomized separately from any lymph nodes biopsied during the case.</intervention_model_description>
