  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at evaluating the safety and efficacy of everolimus plus exemestane in
      Chinese postmenopausal women with ER+ HER2- ABC after recurrence or progression on letrozole
      or anastrozole.

      The rationale of this study is based on the following:

        -  Proven everolimus activity in breast cancer in combination with exemestane

        -  Efficacy and manageable safety profile of everolimus in combination with exemestane in
           the Asian subpopulation of BOLERO-2
