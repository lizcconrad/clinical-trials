      High mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease in end-stage renal disease patients been
      described by epidemiological and clinical studies. It accounts for approximately 50 percent
      of deaths in dialysis patients. Although controversial, this may be due to the presence of
      excess vascular calcification particularly in the form of extensive coronary artery
      calcification which can be observed even in very young dialysis patients. It was suggested
      that abnormalities of the right ventricular function in patients with end-stage renal disease
      were largely due to pulmonary hypertension which usually develops secondary to pulmonary
      artery calcifications.

      Primary whose mechanisms are incompletely known, is another vascular disease entity recently
      described in chronic kidney disease particularly in patients undergoing haemodialysis. It
      corresponds to 5th subtype of World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension classification
      established in 2008 in Dana Point and updated in 2013 in Nice. Pulmonary hypertension is
      defined by Pulmonary arterial pressure mean ≥25 mm Hg at rest measured by right heart
      catheterization. Its pathophysiological mechanism is controversy maybe explained by vascular
      calcification, blood flow in arteriovenous fistula and fluid overload. Primary pulmonary
      hypertension is a major problem of haemodialysis patients because of its high prevalence,
      sometimes reaching 68% and by its significant morbidity and mortality.
