      Primary Objective:

        -  To assess efficacy of Nasacort® (triamcinolone) nasal spray, 55 µg per dose, in
           comparison with Flixonase® (fluticasone) nasal spray, 50 µg per dose, by reflective
           total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) (24 h) after 28 days of treatment compared with
           baseline (0 day of treatment) in adult patients suffering from PAR (perennial allergic
           rhinitis).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate safety of Nasacort® (triamcinolone) nasal spray, in comparison with
           Flixonase® (fluticasone) administered for 28 days by assessment of adverse events
           reports.

        -  To evaluate patient and physician satisfaction after 28 days of treatment by 5-point
           scale.

        -  To estimate improvement of quality of life during the study by mini Rhinoconjunctivitis
           Quality of Life Questionnaire (miniRQLQ).
