  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will prospectively enroll 30 neonatal and pediatric ECMO patients at a
      single pediatric Level 1 trauma center. The patients will be randomized into two arms; one
      arm will receive unfractionated heparin and the other arm will receive bivalirudin. There
      will be 15 patients in each arm for a total of 30 patients.

      Primary aim will be to compare the efficacy of bivalirudin to unfractionated heparin.

      The investigators will prospectively enroll 30 neonatal and pediatric ECMO patients at a
      single pediatric Level 1 trauma center. The patients will be randomized into two arms; one
      arm will receive unfractionated heparin and the other arm will receive bivalirudin. There
      will be 15 patients in each arm for a total of 30 patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that neonatal and pediatric ECMO patients receiving bivalirudin
      will spend more time at goal anticoagulation and will experience less hemorrhagic and
      thrombotic complications when compared to patients receiving unfractionated heparin. Primary
      aim will be to compare the efficacy of bivalirudin to unfractionated heparin. The
      investigators secondary aim will be to define the incidence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic
      complications in patients receiving bivalirudin during ECMO.
