      This study is aimed to characterize Russian population of Usher patients.

      Tasks:

      Stage 1. Formation of the primary cohort of patients. Patients pre-recruiting will be
      performed based on Deaf-Blind Support Foundation &quot;Con-nection&quot; patient database analysis.
      Patients with clinically confirmed Usher syndrome will be evaluated according to available
      data of the clinical examination.

      Stage 2. Clinical examination of patients.

      Each patient will undergo the following diagnostic procedures according to the unified
      protocol:

        -  Visometry (with correction and without correction)

        -  Ophthalmoscopy

        -  Perimetry

        -  Optical coherence tomography

        -  Electroretinography

        -  Visually evoked potentials

        -  Refractometry

        -  Pneumotonometry

        -  Biomicroscopy

        -  Tonal audiometry

        -  Electronic audiometry (ASSR test)

        -  Acoustic impedance measurement

        -  Vestibulometry

        -  Electronystagmography

        -  Any additional examinations and consultations if necessary

      Medical record will be developed and maintained for each patient consisting results of
      extended clinical examination.

      Stage 3. Genetic study of patients. All enrolled patients will undergo single 4 ml peripheral
      venous blood sampling. DNA will be extracted from leucocytes. DNA samples will be analyzed
      and placed for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen. Statistical and bioinformatic analysis
      of detected genetic mutations in the study cohort will be performed.
