  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with incurable cancer, general deterioration in their ability to walk, exercise
      and care for themselves is often regarded as an inevitable consequence of this. In 2015,
      Hospice UK published a report advocating &quot;Rehabilitative Palliative Care&quot;.

      However there is limited robust evidence on which to base this approach. Reviews of the
      literature show limited study numbers but do suggest that rehabilitation may be feasible for
      advanced cancer patients. However key components were not clear and no recommendations could
      be given.

      This trial is designed primarily to test the feasibility of a rehabilitation programme
      (exercise and nutritional supplementation) in advanced cancer patients. Feasibility will be
      the primary outcome measure including rates of recruitment and compliance. Secondary outcome
      measures include impact on physical function, nutritional status, quality of life for
      patients and their carers. We will also assess the health economic impact by assessing
      patient health facility use throughout the trial.

      40 patients with advanced cancer living in the community will be recruited from two hospice
      palliative care teams in Edinburgh. These patients will be randomised in to either the
      treatment arm: the rehabilitation programme plus standard care, or the control arm: standard
      care alone. The treatment arm will consist of an 8 week rehabilitation programme, supervised
      at weekly clinics by a physiotherapist and dietician.

      To minimise contamination the control group will be offered the treatment at the end of the 8
      weeks (waiting list control).

      Measurements will be made for both groups and compared at baseline (week 0), midpoint (week
      5) and endpoint (week 9). Recommendations for a larger UK wide trial will be made from the
      findings of this study.
