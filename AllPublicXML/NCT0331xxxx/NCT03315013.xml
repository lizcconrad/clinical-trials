  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In its 2017 revision of the global guidelines for HIV care and treatment, the World Health
      Organization called for rapid or same-day initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for
      eligible patients testing positive for HIV. In sub-Saharan Africa, where most HIV patients
      are located, studies continue to document high losses of treatment-eligible patients from
      care before they receive their first dose of antiretroviral medications (ARVs). Among
      facility-level reasons for these losses are treatment initiation protocols that require
      multiple clinic visits and long waiting times before a patient who tests positive for HIV is
      dispensed an initial supply of medications. Simpler, more efficient, accelerated algorithms
      for ART initiation are needed, including strategies for rapid initiation in patients with
      symptoms of tuberculosis, most of whom do not have active TB.

      In July 2017, the original SLATE study (SLATE I) completed enrollment in South Africa. One of
      the most striking findings of the study so far is the large proportion of patients who
      &quot;screened out&quot; of the SLATE algorithm and were referred for additional services rather than
      started on ART immediately. Among 298 patients assigned to the intervention arm and evaluated
      for immediate treatment eligibility under the SLATE algorithm, 149 (50%) screened out, two
      thirds of these (100/149) due to symptoms of TB. The vast majority of the TB suspects
      (93/100, 93%) tested negative for active TB.

      The SLATE II study will revise the original SLATE algorithm to provide a pathway for
      immediate ART initiation for some patients with TB symptoms. Under SLATE II, patients with TB
      symptoms will be clinically evaluated by the study nurse and will receive a urine point of
      care LAM (lipoarabinomannan antigen of mycobacteria) test. Those with milder symptoms and a
      negative LAM test will be offered immediate ART. Those with more serious symptoms and/or a
      positive LAM test will be asked to return the next day to receive TB test results and either
      immediate ART or TB treatment. All intervention arm patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic)
      will be asked for a sputum sample for Xpert testing, and positives will be contacted on the
      next day. The SLATE II algorithm will also incorporate other improvements identified from
      SLATE I.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SLATE II is be a pragmatic, individually randomized evaluation to determine the effectiveness
      of the revised algorithm in increasing ART initiation, compared to standard care, among
      non-pregnant adult patients. Six hundred HIV-infected adult patients not yet on ART will be
      enrolled during a routine clinic visit and randomized to receive the intervention or standard
      care. Patients in the intervention arm will be administered a revised version of the SLATE
      screens, including the TB add-on; those found eligible under the algorithm will be offered
      immediate treatment initiation, while those who are not eligible will be referred for
      standard clinic care. Patients in the standard arm will be referred for ART initiation under
      standard clinic procedures. All care after the initial visit will be by the clinic under
      standard care. Primary outcomes will be ART initiation within 7 days of study enrollment and
      viral suppression within 8 months of study enrollment.

      The study is being conducted at three healthcare facilities (clinics) in South Africa. In
      September 2017, the South African National Department of Health instructed all clinics to
      offer same-day ART initiation to eligible patients but provided little guidance on
      determining eligibility. SLATE II will help to create such guidance. If successful, it will
      improve on the SLATE approach to collecting and interpreting a minimum set of patient data
      that will avoid delaying treatment initiation for the majority of patients who are eligible
      for immediate ART, while deferring initiation in the minority who should not start
      immediately.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (&gt;18 years) (initiating children and adolescents on ART is likely to
             require additional information and adherence support, making the SLATE algorithm less
             applicable to pediatric populations)

          -  Confirmed HIV-positive test result at any time (may have been diagnosed previously)

          -  Self-report that patient is not currently on ART and has not been prescribed ART in
             the past three months

          -  Presented at the study clinic for any HIV-related reason or other reason that led to
             referral for HIV testing or care

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion because treatment guidelines for
             pregnant women differ from those for non-pregnant adults; most pregnant women are
             diagnosed with HIV and initiated on ART in antenatal clinics, not general adult HIV
             clinics)

          -  Not intending to return to this clinic for further HIV care in the coming year (i.e.
             intends to seek further care somewhere else)

          -  Not willing to be traced by phone or in person for follow-up care if test results
             received after the enrollment visit indicate that further care is needed

          -  Not physically, mentally, or emotionally able to participate in the study, in the
             opinion of the investigators or study staff

          -  Not willing or able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study

          -  Previously enrolled in the same study or the SLATE I study
