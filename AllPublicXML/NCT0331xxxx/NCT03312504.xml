  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a neuromuscular training
      program in decreasing sport and recreational injuries and improving healthy outcomes in
      junior high school students (grades 7 to 9). The neuromuscular training program is
      implemented as a 15-minute warm-up at the beginning of the students' physical education
      classes over a three-month period. This study is a randomized controlled trial design,
      involving twelve schools over a three-year period. Upon enrolment into the study, schools are
      randomly assigned to the intervention (neuromuscular training) group, or the control group.
      The control group includes a standard-of practice warm-up consisting of aerobic components
      and static stretching.

      A study athletic therapist visits the schools each week to assess and record information on
      any injuries sustained by study participants. Baseline health and physical fitness is
      measured at baseline, and again at 3-month follow-up in study participants to assess changes
      over the course of the program.

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized controlled trial. Upon enrolment into the study, a school will be randomly assigned to the intervention (neuromuscular training warm-up) or control group (standard-of-practice warm-up). Schools that have been randomized to the control arm will be invited to participate in the study in the following year as an intervention school. Schools that have been randomized to the intervention arm will be invited to participate in the study in the following year as a maintenance school (will continue with the intervention).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants (teachers and students) are not aware of what arm they are randomized to; however, they are aware that there are two arms. The primary investigators performing the analysis and overseeing all decisions are blinded to the schools receiving the intervention vs control program.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sport or recreational injury</measure>
    <time_frame>Injuries are recorded if sustained at any point over the course of the study (each school participates for 3 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Any injury sustained through a sport or recreational activity that resulted in time loss from physical activity participation (unable to return to the same session or missed at least one day of participation), or required medical attention.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in body mass index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over a 3-month period.</time_frame>
    <description>Height (cm) and weight (kg) are measured at baseline, and again post-intervention at 3-months. Height and weight are used to calculate body mass index, calculated as: weight(kg)/height(m)^2</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in waist circumference</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over a 3-month period.</time_frame>
    <description>Waist circumference (cm) is measured at baseline, and again at 3-month follow-up once the intervention in complete. Waist circumference is measured following the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology-Canadian Physical Activity, Fitness and Lifestyle Approach protocol: circumference is measured at the midpoint between the anterior superior iliac spine and the bottom of the ribs, at the end of a normal expiration while the participant crosses their arms over their chest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in vertical jump height</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over a 3-month period</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical jump height (cm) is measured at baseline, and again post-intervention at 3-month follow-up. The height is calculated as the difference (in cm) between the standing reach height, and the maximum reach measured while jumping from the best of three trials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in VO2max</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over a 3-month period</time_frame>
    <description>The PACER 20-m shuttle run is used to indirectly measure VO2max. Participants run the 20-m shuttle run at baseline, and again post-intervention at 3-month follow-up. Their score (recorded in number of laps) and used in a regression equation to predict maximal oxygen consumption.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in timed unipedal eyes-closed dynamic balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over a 3-month period</time_frame>
    <description>Balance times are measured at baseline, and again post-intervention at 3-month follow-up. The participant stands on an unstable foam pad (Airex balance pad) on one foot, with their eyes closed and hands on their hips. Time is recorded in seconds for each foot, and the best of three trials on each foot is used to assess changes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Y-balance reach distance</measure>
    <time_frame>Changes over a 3-month period</time_frame>
    <description>Normalized composite reach distance is measured using the Y-balance test at baseline and again post-intervention at 3-month follow-up. The participant balances on one foot while pushing a sliding block as far as they can with their other foot, while maintaining balance. This is repeated for a total of three reach directions on each foot: anterior, postero-lateral, and postern-medial. Reach distances for each of the three directions are normalized as a percentage of leg length of the reaching leg, and summed to produce a normalized composite reach distance.</description>

    <description>Schools randomized to the intervention arm receive a workshop outlining a neuromuscular training program to be used as a warm-up for 15 minutes at the beginning of each physical education class. The warm-up consist of high-intensity aerobic, strengthening, agility, plyometric, and balance components. The workshop is designed to last two hours, and includes a video outlining the warm-up components, practice time, and group discussions for action planning to address potential barriers to the program.</description>
