  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to confirm safety and performance of the Anatomical Shoulder
      Domelock System when used in hemi or total shoulder arthroplasty by analysis of standard
      scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event records.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-controlled PMCF study involving orthopaedic
      surgeons skilled in hemi and total shoulder arthroplasty procedures. A minimum of five study
      centers will be involved and a total number of 123 implants will be included into the study.

    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is defined by the performance of the Anatomical Shoulder Domelock System at 5 years, which is assessed by the Constant and Murley score.
The Constant and Murley score is a 100-point functional shoulder assessment tool in which higher scores reflect increased function. The subjective variables are pain (15 points) and function (activities of daily living - sleep, work, recreation/sport; 20 points), for a total of 35 points. The objective variables are active range of motion (clinician assessment; 40 points) and strength (25 points), for a total of 65 points.</description>

    <time_frame>10 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is defined by the survival of the implant at 10 years which is based on removal or intended removal of the prosthesis and will be determined using Kaplan Meier method.</description>

          -  Patient is skeletally mature

          -  Patient is suffering from severe shoulder pain and disability requiring unilateral or
             bilateral HSA or TSA based on physical exam and medical history

          -  Patient has failed conservative treatment

          -  Patient meets at least one of the following indications:

               -  Advanced wear and tear of the shoulder joint resulting from degenerative,
                  posttraumatic or rheumatoid arthritis

               -  Avascular necrosis

               -  Conditions consequent to earlier operations

               -  Rheumatoid arthritis

               -  Revision of shoulder prosthesis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to give consent or to comply with the follow-up program

          -  Patients who have any condition which would in the judgement of the Investigator place
             the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study. Any patient who is
             institutionalized, or is a known drug abuser, a known alcoholic or anyone who cannot

          -  Patient meets at least one of the contraindications:

               -  Patient's physical conditions that would impair adequate implant support and/or
                  prevent the use of an appropriately sized implant, e.g., previous surgery,
                  insufficient quality or quantity of bone, neuromuscular compromise or vascular
                  deficiency in the affected limb in sufficient degree to endanger the success of
                  the intervention e.g., absence of musculoligamentous supporting structures, joint
                  neuropathy or other conditions that may lead to inadequate skeletal fixation

               -  Signs of infection
