    <textblock>
      ARQ 092 is being investigated for patients with overgrowth diseases and/or vascular anomalies
      with genetic alterations of the PI3K/AKT pathway and may be available for patients who are
      ineligible for an ongoing ARQ 092 clinical trial or have other considerations that prevent
      access to ARQ 092 through an existing clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe overgrowth diseases and/or vascular anomalies with confirmed somatic genetic
             alterations of PIK3CA or AKT

          2. Are unable to participate in an ongoing ARQ 092 clinical trial

          3. Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent. In the case of a minor,

          5. Not eligible for any other available therapy for the diagnosed overgrowth disease
             and/or vascular anomaly with confirmed somatic genetic alterations of PIK3CA or AKT

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently enrolled in an ongoing clinical study of ARQ 092 or other investigational
             drug

          2. Currently being treated with any inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
