  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHRINK (Standard cHemotherapy Regimen and Immunotherapy with NKR-2) is an open-label Phase I
      study to assess the safety and clinical activity of multiple administrations of autologous
      NKR-2 cells administered concurrently with a standard chemotherapy treatment (FOLFOX) in
      potentially resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

      The trial will test three dose levels. At each dose, the patients will receive three
      successive administrations, two weeks apart, NKR-2 cells. The study will enroll up to 36
      patients (dose escalation and expansion phases).

    <time_frame>through study completion (up to month 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the time from resection of liver metastases to recurrence of tumor or death from any cause. The progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as time from study registration in the study to the disease progression or death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>The event-free survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion (up to month 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The event-free survival (EFS) is defined as the time from registration in the study to any of the following events: progression, non-resectability, local or distant recurrence, or death from any cause.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion (up to month 28)</time_frame>
    <description>The overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from study registration in the study to death. If death does not occur before the patient's last study visit, then the survival will be censored at the date when patient is known to be alive.</description>
