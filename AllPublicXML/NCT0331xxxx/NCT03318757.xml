  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine quantitative and qualitative differences in
      patients' post-operative pain levels following elective orthognathic surgery after the local
      administration of a liposomal bupivacaine injection.

      A primary objective is to determine whether using a liposomal bupivacaine injection placed
      locally at the conclusion of elective orthognathic surgery will decrease pain levels (as
      determined by VAS scores). A secondary objective is to examine whether using a long acting
      liposomal bupivacaine injection locally at the conclusion of elective orthognathic surgery
      leads to decreased use of narcotics post-operatively.

      Participants in Group 1 (study group) will receive ExparelTM (133 mg/10 ml - 4 ml into the
      maxilla, and 6 ml into the mandible). This will be injected into the soft tissue and gingiva
      surrounding the surgical site at the time of wound closure. Participants in Group 2 (standard
      of care) will receive bupivacaine 0.5% (4 ml into the maxilla, and 6 ml into the mandible)
      injected into the soft tissue and gingiva surrounding the surgical site at the time of wound
      closure. Participants in Group 3 (placebo group) will receive a placebo (normal saline - 4 ml
      into the maxilla, and 6 ml into the mandible) injected into the soft tissue and gingiva
      surrounding the surgical site at the time of wound closure.

      Post-operatively, all participants will be cared for utilizing the current standard
      post-operative pain management protocol for all patients undergoing elective orthognathic
      surgery at Boston Medical Center. This consists of acetaminophen 325 mg given every 4 hours
      as a scheduled medication; patients also receive an additional 325 mg of acetaminophen for a
      reported pain level of 1-3, 5 mg of oxycodone for a reported pain level of 4-6, and 10 mg of
      oxycodone for a reported pain level of 7-10. All participants will be provided the same
      methods of postoperative pain control following their elective orthognathic surgery.

    <time_frame>4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 72, and 96 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>After surgery, participants will document in a pain journal what their pain level is based on a smiley face visual analog scale (VAS) from 0-10, where 0='no pain' and 10='worst possible, unbearable, excruciating pain'. They will rate their pain using the VAS 14 times - every 4 hours the first 48 hours and then at 72 and 96 hours post surgery. Higher scores are associated with more severe pain. The participant will return the pain journal at their post operative assessment visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post operative narcotic use</measure>
    <time_frame>daily up to the 2 week post surgical visit</time_frame>
    <description>The time and dosage of narcotics used in the postoperative period will be documented in the participants' medical record records while hospitalized and documented in the participants' pain journal once discharged. The data from the medical records and pain journal will be used to assess total narcotic pain use.</description>
