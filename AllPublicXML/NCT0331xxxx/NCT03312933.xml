    <measure>Foot and Ankle Ability Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>when transitioning out of the boot at 4 or 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported outcome measure developed to assess physical function of patients with foot and ankle impairments. It is divided into two subscales: Activities of Daily Living (21 items) and Sports (8 items). Each item is score on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;No Difficulty&quot; to &quot;Unable to do.&quot; The overall score is reported as a percentage with 100% as no dysfunction.</description>

    <measure>Short Form 36</measure>
    <time_frame>when transitioning out of the boot at 4 or 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item scale designed to report on health related quality of life. The score is reported as 9 sub-scales: Physical functioning, Role functioning/ physical, Role functioning/ emotional, Energy/fatigue, Emotional well-being, Social functioning, Pain, General health, Health change. Each sub scale is reported as a score from 0 (worst outcome) to 100 (best outcome).</description>

    <measure>VAS Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>when transitioning out of the boot at 4 or 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scales are used to measure values that range across a continuum of values, such as pain. It is a single item survey that is reported as a score from 0, &quot;No pain,&quot; to 100 &quot;The worst pain possible.&quot;</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients enrolled in the study must have an injury that requires wear of a CAM
             walking boot for at least two weeks and have ambulation ad libitum without other aids
             (e.g crutches, canes, scooters, wheelchairs, etc.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they are a recent post-operative patient
             for lower extremity injury, have an additional acute injury to a lower extremity or
             back other than the foot or ankle injury being treated by the CAM walking boot at the
             time of initiation of treatment, have an ongoing or history of lower extremity joint
             injury, arthritis, or back pain or have restricted weightbearing as instructed by a
             physician (i.e. for ankle fracture that cannot weightbear).
