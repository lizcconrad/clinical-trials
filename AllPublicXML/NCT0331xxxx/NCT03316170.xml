  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this pilot clinical trial are: 1) To evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a new approach to smoking cessation induction treatment in cancer survivors
      with low social resources, and 2) To assess the effectiveness of said treatment for key
      events in the process of smoking cessation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot (Phase II) randomized clinical trial with randomization in a 1:1 ratio. The
      control group will receive a brief consultation (10-15 minutes via phone) about free or
      low-cost resources that may help them address unmet social support needs. Additionally, a
      written directory of a range of social support resources will be delivered to them via mail.
      The treatment group will receive the aforesaid intervention plus brief advice to quit smoking
      (10-15 minutes via phone). Additionally, a written summary of the benefits of smoking
      cessation, evidence-based approaches to quit, and the basics of nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT) will be provided via mail. The treatment group will also receive a free, 2-week supply
      of nicotine patches and lozenges delivered via mail. As a pilot, this study focuses on the
      outcomes of feasibility (i.e., accrual and retention) and acceptability (e.g., participants'
      perceptions of appropriateness and effectiveness) as opposed to efficacy (though this is also
      important). The emphasis on smoking cessation induction (that is, the inducement or promotion
      of a quit attempt) is an important aspect of the study design and is appropriate for smokers
      across the continuum of motivation to quit.
