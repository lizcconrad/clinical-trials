  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Samples will be collected to determine human genetic variation, fecal and oral microbial
      communities, and metabolome products. Several evolutionary and ecological diversity metrics
      will be distilled to test: a) if microbiome variation within each ethnicity is less than that
      between ethnicities; b) if microbiome variation is finely structured according to genetic
      relatedness; and c) if dietary variation impacts human genome x microbiome associations.

      To characterize the human gut microbiome under highly controlled dietary intake in healthy
      normal weight adult participants who differ by ethnicity: White non-Hispanic and Black
      non-Hispanic adults. Samples will be collected to determine human genetic variation, fecal
      and oral microbial communities, and metabolome products. Several evolutionary and ecological
      diversity metrics will be distilled to test: a) if microbiome variation within each ethnicity
      is less than that between ethnicities; b) if microbiome variation is finely structured
      according to genetic relatedness; and c) if dietary variation impacts human genome x
      microbiome associations.

    <description>A microbial community profile will be generated for each individual using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S rDNA microbial gene sequence. This community profile of each subjects microbiome will be assessed from a minimum of 10,000 sequences per individual at multiple timepoints. The profile will be used to quantify how inter-individual variation of the microbiome varies across ethnicities.</description>
