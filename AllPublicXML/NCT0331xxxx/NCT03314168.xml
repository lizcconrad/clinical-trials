    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the effects of different volumes of combined training on
      fatigue, neuromuscular variables, morphological, cardiorespiratory capacity, and quality of
      life, in breast cancer (BCa) women undergoing primary treatment. Two thirds will be the
      intervention group that will perform combined training, while the other third will be the
      control group that will have physiotherapy sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although chemotherapy and radiation are mainstream treatment modalities, patients will often
      experience treatment-related side effects such as impairments to the neuromuscular and
      cardiovascular systems and reduction in quality of life (QoL).To date, numerous positive
      effects on neuromuscular and aerobic parameters in response to resistance and aerobic
      training have been reported when both training modalities were simultaneously performed (i.e.
      combined training - COMB) in BCa patients. However, there is a lack of data regarding the
      prescription of this modality in BCa patients, as the necessary dose of resistance training
      for significant improve in fatigue, neuromuscular, and quality of life. In this sense, no
      previous studies investigate the effect of different volumes of resistance training in BCa
      patients, providing important informations about the prescription in this clinical
      population.
