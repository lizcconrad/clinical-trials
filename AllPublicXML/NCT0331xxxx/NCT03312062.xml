    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of foam rolling on elbow
      proprioception, strength and functional motor performance with healthy participants . Study
      group will receive foam rolling exercise. Control group will receive no foam rolling
      exercise. Control group will be given a brochure including information about proprioception
      and foam rolling.

      There is no information in literature about the effects of foam rolling on elbow
      proprioception, strength and functional motor performance. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate long-term effects of foam rolling with healthy participants. Study group will
      receive foam rolling exercise actively by themselves on elbow.

      Foam rolling exercise will be applied 10 times each for 1 minute. These exercises will be
      performed as 2 sets. After each set will be a resting period for 30 seconds.A total of 12
      sessions of exercise will be performed three times a week. Second evaluation will be
      performed after 4 weeks. Then the follow up evaluation (third evaluation) will be performed 4
      weeks later. Control group will receive no foam rolling exercise. They will be handed a
      brochure about the proprioception and its role in injury prevention and foam rolling. Control
      group will be evaluated for the first time. Afterwards, second evaluation will be performed
      after 4 weeks and follow up after 4 more weeks.

    <intervention_model_description>There are 2 groups. Study group will receive foam rolling exercise. Control group will receive no foam rolling exercise. They will be handed a brochure about the proprioception and its role in injury prevention and foam rolling . Study group will be evaluated before foam rolling exercise . Afterwards, second evaluation will be performed after 4 weeks and follow up after 4 more weeks. Control group will be evaluated for the first time. Afterwards, second evaluation will be performed after 4 weeks and follow up after 4 more weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Foam rolling exercise will be performed actively. Participants will use a foam roller for exercise. They will position the foam roller on the chair. Afterwards, they will use their body weights to rub the elbow area (biceps brachii muscle) with this foam. There will be 2 sets and each set will be 1 minute. Single set contains 10 repetitions in 1 minute with 30 seconds resting period between sets.</description>
