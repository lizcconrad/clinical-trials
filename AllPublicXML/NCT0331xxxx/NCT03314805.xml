  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy usually is recommended after surgery for breast cancer patients who are
      at significant risk for disseminated disease. Chemotherapy has been demonstrated to reduce
      the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Anthracycline-based regimens, including doxorubin or
      epilubicin, are the breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy standards of care. Fatigue has also
      been identified as the most problem for breast cancer patients under adjuvant chemotherapy.
      In the current study, it is aimed to show that PG2 (astragalus polysaccharides) treatment
      among stage II/III breast patients under adjuvant EC regimen in reduction of
      chemotherapy-induced toxicity and encouraging compliance with chemotherapy.
