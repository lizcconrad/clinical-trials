  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with multifactorial genesis.
      Recent research suggests a numerical and functional deficit of regulatory T (Treg) cells as
      an important contributing factor to the pathology seen in SLE. Treg cells play important
      roles in dampening overt stimulation of effector cells, as seen in many autoimmune diseases.
      As Treg cells are highly dependent on interleukin-2 (IL-2), application of low doses of IL-2
      leads to markedly increased numbers and improved functionality of Treg cells in mice and
      humans. Several clinical trials investigated the safety of low-dose IL-2 treatment in
      different autoimmune diseases, including SLE. The trials conducted so far mainly focused on
      an increase in Treg cells after IL-2 treatment, not evaluating in detail the effects on other
      immune cells, presumably also playing important roles in the pathogenesis of SLE. For this
      reason, the investigators of this trial aim to conduct a complete phenotyping of cellular and
      soluble components in the blood of SLE patients treated with low-dose IL-2. Furthermore, the
      investigators want to offer this promising treatment to SLE patients in a controlled
      framework of an investigator initiated clinical trial.
