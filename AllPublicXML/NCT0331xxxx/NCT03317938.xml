  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Defecatory disorders like chronic constipation and faecal incontinence affect 25% of the
      population with rising incidence. Defecatory disorders pose a major health care burden and
      are poorly recognized and treated. The need for better diagnostics and therapeutics is
      substantial. Currently management options for these patients are limited, partly due to the
      fact that control of defaecation and continence is multifactorial but also due to the fact
      that it is difficult to identify the exact cause of patients' incontinence.

      Current assessment of patients with constipation and faecal incontinence include endoscopic
      assessment to rule out intraluminal organic cause for patients' symptoms, endoanal ultrasound
      scan / MRI to assess patients' pelvic floor anatomy and anorectal manometry to assess
      anorectal function. All tests are susceptible to measurement artifacts, with a high
      inter-individual variation with significant overlap between healthy asymptomatic and
      symptomatic patients.

      Endoluminal Functional Lumen Imaging Probe (EndoFLIPÂ©) is a novel technology, originally used
      to measure the dimensions and function of a hollow organ. The proposed study intends to use a
      modified EndoFLIP to integrate several technologies into one which will save time and reduce
      test variability. A major difference from previous EndoFLIP studies are that the device will
      be defecated rather than providing static data from one location in the anal canal.

      In the proposed studies investigators will assess defecatory function in subgroups of Hong
      Kong patients suffering from chronic constipation and faecal incontinence and determine
      biomarkers to increase the diagnostic value of anorectal testing. Investigators will study up
      to 70 patients with anorectal disorders and 40 healthy control subjects. Investigators
      anticipate to improve diagnostics of anorectal disorders considerably.
