    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0-t) is defined as area under the concentration versus time curve from time zero (pre-dose) to the time of the last measurable concentration.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor.

          -  Participant must have advanced solid tumor that is not amenable to surgical resection
             or other approved therapeutic options that have demonstrated clinical benefit.

          -  Participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0
             to 2.

          -  Participant must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
             Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

          -  Participant has archived diagnostic formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor
             tissue available for analysis.

          -  Participant has adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiation therapy, immunotherapy, biologic, or any investigational therapy within a
             period of 21 days, or herbal therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             ABBV-399.

          -  Participant has known uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system.
             Participants with brain metastases are eligible after definitive therapy provided they
             are asymptomatic off systemic steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 2 weeks prior
             to first dose of ABBV-399.

          -  Participant has unresolved clinically significant adverse events &gt;= Grade 2 from prior
             anticancer therapy except for alopecia or anemia.

          -  Participant has had major surgery within 21 days prior to the first dose of ABBV-399.
