      The investigators assess and compare the efficacy of anemia treatment in pregnant women with
      anemia of chronic disease with true iron deficiency and in women with iron deficiency anemia.

      Fifty anemic pregnant women with moderate anemia were prospectively observed and treated in
      the Anemia clinic at the Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich. All patients
      had singleton pregnancies. All pregnant women fulfilled criteria of moderate iron deficiency
      anemia defined as hemoglobin (Hb) between 8.0 and 9.9 g/dl and serum ferritin &lt;15 μg/l. In
      all women, the analyses of a blood count, iron status, erythropoietin, cross reactive protein
      (CRP), folic acid and vitamin B12 were conducted. According to hemoglobin level at the start
      of the therapy, the women were either treated with intravenous iron and rhEPO or with
      intravenous iron only twice weekly. Patients with an Hb level between 9.0 and 9.9 g/dl (33
      patients) received 200 mg iron sucrose (VENOFER®, Vifor Int., St. Gallen, Switzerland)
      intravenously twice weekly (group A). If response to therapy was poor (i.e. Hb increase &lt;0.7
      g/dl) after 2 weeks (13 patients), patients additionally received rhEPO (10,000 U EPREX®,
      Janssen-Cilag, Baar, Switzerland) (group B). This cut-off for adequate primary response the
      investigators choose on the basis of previous experience. Patients with an Hb between 8.0 and
      8.9 g/dl (17 patients) received iron sucrose (Venofer) and rhEPO (Eprex) twice weekly from
      the start of therapy (group C).

      Sufficient overall response to therapy (the difference of baseline hemoglobin and after
      therapy) was defined as Hb increase &gt;1.0 g/dl. The maximum total iron dose was 1,600 mg,
      therefore therapy was stopped if the maximal iron sucrose dose was administered, or target Hb
      &gt; 10.5 g/dL was achieved.
