  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, multicenter, triple-arm Phase Ib/II study is designed to assess
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib administered as a
      single agent (Arm A), cobimetinib plus venetoclax (Arm B), and cobimetinib plus venetoclax
      plus atezolizumab (Arm C) in participants with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Two
      successive cohorts will evaluate the safety of cobimetinib plus venetoclax and that of
      cobimetinib plus venetoclax plus atezolizumab in the selected population during the safety
      run-in phase of the study. Once the dose levels have demonstrated acceptable safety during
      this phase, randomization will begin for all treatment arms (Arms A, B, and C).
