      Background Despite advances in symptom management, children undergoing cancer treatment often
      suffer from moderate to severe symptoms of nausea/vomiting, pain, and fatigue along with
      psychological distress. Pharmacologic treatments of symptoms can cause side-effects.
      Patients, parents, and clinicians have expressed interest in including non-pharmacologic
      approaches to improve symptom management. Acupuncture/acupressure is a promising adjunctive
      therapy to usual care. More evidence is needed from well-designed trials with larger samples
      and rigorous designs in order to make definitive recommendations about the routine inclusion
      of acupressure among pediatric patients being treated for childhood cancer.

      Design and Methods 390 participants will be randomized 1:1 into 2 study arms (195 in each
      arm). Arm A participants will be offered usual care and professional acupressure five times
      weekly (15-20 minute sessions) and a parent/caregiver will be instructed in acupressure
      delivery for the child as symptoms arise. Arm B participants will receive usual care alone.
      (At the study end, Arm B parents will be offered acupressure instructions.) Children will be
      enrolled for ~30 days which can occur with one month of continuous hospital-based treatment
      or two months of intermittent hospital-based treatment (inpatient treatment or daily
      outpatient radiotherapy for Neuro-Oncology patients). Parent and child participants will
      receive a follow-up interview one month after completion of the intervention (Arm A) or the
      final symptom assessment (Arm B).

      Significance This is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an
      acupressure intervention to decrease treatment-related symptoms in 390 patients in treatment
      for a childhood cancer.

      AIMS

      Aim 1: To assess the benefits and risks of an acupressure intervention plus usual care
      compared to usual care alone for children receiving hospital-based treatment for a childhood
      cancer. The study hypothesizes that patients in the acupressure arm will report decreased
      nausea/vomiting and improved management of cancer-related symptoms compared to usual care
      alone. We will test the following hypotheses:

      1a. Primary outcomes: Children receiving acupressure will report reduced nausea/vomiting
      measured as a composite variable compared to the usual care alone group.

      1b. Secondary outcomes: Children receiving the acupressure intervention will have reduced
      levels of each; nausea, vomiting, and rescue antiemetic use compared to the usual care alone
      group.

      1c. Secondary outcomes: Children receiving acupressure will report reduced pain interference
      and pain intensity, reduced fatigue, anxiety, depression, other treatment-related symptoms,
      and greater positive affect compared to the usual care group. Children receiving acupressure
      will use less rescue pain medication compared to the usual care alone group.

        1. d. Greater dose of acupressure will lead to greater improvement of primary and secondary
           outcomes.

           Aim 2: To assess the benefits and challenges of providing the acupressure intervention
           for parents.

        2. a. The parent/caregiver in Arm A will report decreased post-traumatic stress symptoms,
           reduced parent anxiety and depression, and increased caregiving self-efficacy 4 weeks
           after the end of professional acupressure.

      2b. An open-ended question for parents in the intervention arm will elicit information on the
      experience of providing acupressure for their children.

      DESIGN The goal of the study is to describe the benefits and risks of an acupressure
      intervention to decrease nausea/vomiting and other treatment-related symptoms compared to a
      control group receiving usual care. This study is a comparative effectiveness pragmatic
      clinical trial. Participants will be randomized 1:1 into 2 study arms. In Arm A children will
      be offered professional acupressure five times weekly along with usual care for ~30 days of
      hospitalization (continuous) or two months of hospitalization (intermittent) for an
      approximate total of 20 semi-standardized acupressure treatments. Treatments take
      approximately 20 minutes each. A parent/caregiver will be instructed in how to deliver
      acupressure to his/her child as symptoms arise using a simplified protocol with educational
      handouts. In Arm B participants will receive usual care alone. All usual care is defined
      according to COG supportive care guidelines. After the final study assessment
      parents/caregivers will be given instruction on how to deliver acupressure. Outcomes will be
      assessed in all children and parents in Arm A and Arm B at baseline, three times a week, and
      at a once month follow-up.

    <time_frame>30 days hospitalization (continuous or intermittent over 2 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Nausea will be measured using the PeNat scale, validated for ages 4-18+ years. Four levels of nausea are defined on this scale: none, mild, moderate and severe, using faces, a preferred method of measuring distress among children.60 In the case where a child cannot report on nausea, parent report will be sought. Parents report of child's nausea severity was found to be significantly correlated with child reports. Patients ages 19-21 will be given PeNat for comparability, as well as an adult validated instrument.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Specific eligible disease: Patients must have been diagnosed and be in treatment for a
             childhood cancer or a similar disease. Examples of cancers that will be included in
             the trial are: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, lymphoma,
             rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, Hodgkins and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, and Pediatric
             Brain Tumor (malignant and non-malignant are included since they receive the same
             treatments).

          2. Adequate number days of hospital-based treatment: Children, adolescents, and young
             adults (ages 5-21) are eligible if they will be in treatment for enough days to
             receive a regular dose of acupressure and parents can be trained and monitored. This
             is defined:

               -  when a child has an anticipated hospitalization of at least 5 continuous days,
                  (e.g. BMT, ALL induction, AML) or

                    -  8 days over 3 weeks (i.e. osteosarcoma patients are typically hospitalized
                       for 2 days, then one week later, 4-5 days, then again for 2 days equaling &gt;8
                       days over 3 weeks) or

               -  children with brain tumors who receive outpatient radiation in the next hospital
                  building, five days/week for 6 weeks.

          3. Inclusion of caregiver: Availability and willingness of a caregiver to deliver
             acupressure for children ages 5-17. For young adults ages 18-21 participation of a
             parent, or close friend or family member is preferred but not required.

          4. Ages 5-21 years' old

          5. Parent ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness
             to sign it as well as child assent where required. See Table 1 below for age cut-offs.

          6. English or Spanish speaking.

          7. Admitted to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital San Francisco or Oakland site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Either the child or the parent has a mental health or medical condition that, in the
             opinion of investigators or the treating oncologist, would make it difficult to
             participate in the study.

          2. Children who do not meet the above criteria.

          3. Children who meet the above criteria, but whose treating oncologist advises against
             study participation for physical health, mental health (parent or child) or logistical
             reasons.
