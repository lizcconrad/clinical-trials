  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is an important sexually transmitted infection. There has been an epidemic of
      syphilis amongst men who have sex with men in the United Kingdom in the last decade. Early
      infection with syphilis causes a genital ulcer followed, in the absence of treatment, by a
      generalised illness often accompanied by rash. Studies on the pathogenesis of syphilis have
      been limited because it is not possible to grow syphilis outside of the body. New approaches
      using molecular tests allow the immune response of the patient to infection to be measured
      directly from a swab of a genital ulcer or rash and/or a blood sample and also allow the
      whole genetic sequence of the bacteria to be obtained from a swab.

      In this study the investigators will collect swabs from ulcers or rashes and a blood sample
      from patients with syphilis and measure both the response of the patient immune system and
      the genetic sequence of the bacteria. Patients will be enrolled at sexual health clinics in
      the United Kingdom. Patients will receive standard medical care including standard treatment
      for syphilis in line with national guidelines. Standard management already includes
      collection of a swab and a blood sample. For this study an additional swab sample and an
      additional 5ml of blood will be collected for use in this research project. By better
      understanding host immune system responds to infection with syphilis the studies aims to gain
      better insights in to the pathogenesis of this important sexually transmitted disease.
