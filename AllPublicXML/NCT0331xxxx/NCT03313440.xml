  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some dietary fibres, including wheat fibres, have shown to increase fecal bulk and improve
      stool. In previous studies, this effect on fecal bulk was especially studied for intact wheat
      fibers. Moreover, in most studies, the wheat fiber was offered daily as a single dose in
      cereals. In this study, we investigate whether an increased intake of extracted wheat fiber,
      implemented at several time points in a normal daily dietary pattern, can also increase fecal
      bulk and improve stool frequency and consistency. Here we want to demonstrate that an
      increase in VITACEL Wheat Fiber intake will enhance fecal bulk, both wet and dry weight and
      that the enhanced wheat fiber intake will also increase stool frequency and consistency. The
      study is a double-blind crossover design in which the intervention is based on products
      enriched by VITACEL Wheat Fiber and control products. Both the control and fiber-enriched
      intervention will last for 10 days with a wash-out period of at least 4 days. The study will
      be conducted with 25 healthy male human volunteers in the age between 18-70 years old.Persons
      will be assigned to the intervention groups. In one of the intervention periods participants
      receive 'control boxes' with products low in wheat fiber and in the other period they will
      receive boxes with products enriched with VITACEL Wheat Fiber. During an intervention period
      of 10 days participants will receive 10 boxes, one for each day. In the last 5 days of the
      intervention + 1 additional day after the intervention (so in total 6 days), participants
      will collect their fecal samples to analyse fecal bulk. Daily also a diary has to be kept and
      questionnaires have to be completed to check compliance to the intervention and assess stool
      consistency, gut-related complaints.
