      relation to the risk of renal stone disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have investigated the association between tea consumption and renal stone
      disease, but the results are still unclear. Besides, the impact of the duration of tea
      consumption has not yet been investigated in the aforementioned studies. The present study
      was conducted as a retrospective research to investigate the relationship between both tea
      consumption amount and time and renal stone disease. Information on tea consumption was
      obtained by four closed-ended questions in questionnaires, and the diagnosis of renal stones
      was established on the results of abdominal sonography.
