  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal in this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive remediation program
      that was designed specifically to address the concerns related to cognitive difficulties that
      are often reported among women in the menopausal transition. This cognitive remediation
      program has been created to provide our clients with an opportunity to learn more about the
      relation between menopause and cognitive function, to learn new strategies to enhance
      thinking skills (e.g., memory, attention) and to hear about lifestyle changes that are known
      to have a beneficial effect on mental functioning.
