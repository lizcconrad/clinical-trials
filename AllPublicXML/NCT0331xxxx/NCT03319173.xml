  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study explores whether selective memory complaints (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      and the comorbidity of Metabolic Syndrome symptomatic of peripheral and cerebral
      hypo-metabolism with corresponding epigenetic shifts in global DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)
      methylation (away from nutrient availability and toward biosynthesis) are initiated by
      chronic metabolic inflexibility, over-activation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)
      pathway, and the deregulation of neural oxidative phosphorylation.

      Nutritional epigenetics denotes gene-diet interactions and highlights the modulatory role of
      nutrition in aging and age-related diseases such as cancer, CVD (cardiovascular disease),
      diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders. Nutrients are a source of epigenetic modification;
      they are able to regulate the placement of histone modifiers distinguishing phenotype from
      genotype. The energy status of the cells (fed or fasted) modulates the regulation of global
      DNA methylation via the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyltransferase inhibitor,
      S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) axis and whole blood histamine levels. Insulin resistance and
      hyperinsulinemia dysregulate cellular signals leading to metabolic inflexibility. Chronic
      elevations in insulin with long-standing impairments in glucose delivery are associated with
      profound changes in epigenetic patterns due to over-activation of the mTOR kinase pathway and
      repression of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). Dietary ketosis is
      known to change the metabolic status of the cells by increasing the AMP/ATP (adenosine
      monophosphate/adenosine tri-phosphate) ratio. AMPK activation adapts rRNA (ribosomal
      ribonucleic acid) synthesis away from growth/biosynthesis and toward ATP availability and
      utilization, thereby, attenuating the progression of hypo-metabolic diseases in the body and
      the brain at the level of the genome.

      The study will explore whether early stage memory loss (SMC &amp; MCI) and the comorbidity of
      Metabolic Syndrome are symptomatic of peripheral and cerebral cellular hypo-metabolism
      induced by chronic insulin resistance. We will attempt to show that consequential to systemic
      hyperinsulinemia, aberrant crosstalk between the mitochondria and nuclear genome results in
      the dysregulation of the regulatory kinases mediating metabolic state and
      intracellular/extracellular signaling: mTOR and AMPK. The suppression of AMPK signals with
      chronic overexpression of mTOR signaling will adapt rRNA synthesis away from nutrient
      availability and toward ATP consuming processes: the biosynthesis of cholesterol,
      triglycerides, glycogen with inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, histone acetylation with a
      down-regulation of NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide coenzyme) and SAHH
      (S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase) cofactors leading to global DNA hypo-methylation and local
      hyper-methylation, suppression of the SAM/SAH ratio, the inhibition of SIRT (sirtuin)
      expression and normalized whole blood histamine levels. These epigenetic shifts mediate
      global metabolic inflexibility by channeling fuel substrates toward cytosolic, substrate
      level phosphorylation (SLP) via over expression of the glycolytic enzymes including PDK
      (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) and away from mitochondrial oxidation mediated by the
      suppression of PDC (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), the major regulatory gateway of
      metabolism between glycolysis and citric acid cycle. We will attempt to show that activation
      of the AMPK pathway via induced and controlled dietary ketosis will inhibit mTOR signaling
      away from the biosynthesis of energy and SLP toward the generation of ATP by increasing the
      cellular AMP/ATP ratio, thus regulating oxidative metabolic signals and attenuating global,
      cellular hypo-metabolism evidenced by marked reductions in lipid synthesis and LP-IR score
      (particle concentration and size), HgA1c (hemoglobin A1c), fasting insulin/HOMA-IR
      (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance), blood ketones, fasting triglycerides
      together with epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation status including normalized whole
      blood histamine levels and homocysteine regulation. Improvement in cerebral glucose
      metabolism and corresponding diagnosis of SMC/MCI will be assessed by the objective changes
      in the outcome measures of MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), MMSE (Mini-Mental State
      Exam) and BVMT-R (Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised) administered at baseline and week
      12.

    <intervention_model_description>To assess differences between the control and experimental groups, a mixed model will be fit for each variable separately using both baseline (week 0) and post program (week 12) values for each subject. Models will include week, group, and their interaction as fixed effects, gender as a covariate, and subject as a random effect. To assess significant differences, we will use the difference at week 12 adjusted for the baseline difference, and will report p-values, least squares means, and 95% confidence intervals. Further analysis of treatment effects over time will be examined by comparing the within-group differences over time.</intervention_model_description>
