  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ceftobiprole is a very active new cephalosporin on staphylococci resistant to methicillin
      (SEMR: Staphylococcus epidermidis Resistant to Meticillin, SAMR: Staphylococcus aureus
      Resistant to Meticillin) and / or vancomycin; it is also very active on pneumococci resistant
      to penicillin and / or 3rd generation cephalosporins. This new drug has AMM in nosocomial
      respiratory infections, Animal work shows the efficacy of ceftobiprole in gram negative
      bacillus meningeal infections.

      The rationale of this study is based on the antibacterial spectrum of ceftobiprole, which
      would therefore be useful in the treatment of staphylococcal bacterial meningitis resistant
      patients (SEMR or SAMR) encountered in intensive care and / or neurosurgery and in the
      treatment of pneumococcal meningitis.

      To validate these possibilities, it is necessary to know the concentrations of ceftobiprole
      in the meningeal space.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients (&gt; 18 years)

               -  Provision of informed consent prior to any study specific procedures

               -  Female patients of childbearing potential may be entered if pregnancy testing is
                  negative and the patient agrees to abstain from procreational sexual intercourse
                  or must use double-barrier contraceptive measures for the duration of the study

          -  Presence of an indwelling external CSF access device (ventriculostomy or lumbar drain)

          -  Presence of inflamed meninges as a result of documented or suspected meningitis or
             ventriculitis. Patients with both clinical symptoms (fever, headache, meningismus, and
             altered mentation) and laboratory parameters (CSF leukocytosis, defined as a CSF white
             blood cell count [WBC] of &gt;103, elevated CSF protein, defined as CSF protein of &gt;1g/l,
             reduced CSF glucose, defined as CSF glucose of &lt;0.3g/l, or a positive CSF Gram stain
             or culture) indicative of CNS infection were deemed to have definitive bacterial
             meningitis/ventriculitis. Inflamed meninges were defined as the presence of &gt;5
             leukocytes/mm3 of CSF.

          -  Person with antibacterial treatment (including treatment for the current meningitis or
             ventriculitis)

          -  Glycemia above 3 mmol/l and below 10 mmol/l

          -  Natremia below 145 mmol/l

          -  Capnia below 45 mmHg

          -  No other patient included within 72 hours from D0 (treatment period) of the previous
             patient

          -  Agreement of the scientific committee

             cephalosporin

          -  Hypersensitivity to cephalosporin

          -  Immediate and severe hypersensitivity to β-lactam antimicrobial other than Mabelio and
             other cephalosporins

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women

          -  Renal insufficiency defined as creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min

          -  Patient with creatinine clearance &gt; 150 mL/min

          -  Patients with conditions known or suspected to alter pharmacokinetics (i.e., burn or
             cystic fibrosis patients)
