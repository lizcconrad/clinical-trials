      Aim. — To describe the adverse drug reactions (ADR) and the drugs involved in pediatrics.

      Methods. — An observational study on all ADR notifications recorded in the French
      pharmaco-vigilance database by the Regional Pharmacovigilance Center of Champagne-Ardenne
      between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2014 involving children from 0 to 17 years inclusive
      was performed. For all notifications, we studied the patient and the ADR characteristics

      Pediatry aged under 18 years accounted for around 22% of the French general population.

      Data regarding drug safety from clinical trials are insufficient in this population.
