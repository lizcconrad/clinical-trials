  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, single-arm, phase I/phase II clinical study to evaluate efficacy and safety
      of chimeric antigen receptor T cell immunotherapy (CAR-T) in the treatment of hematopoietic
      and lymphoid malignancies. A total of 50 patients are planned to be enrolled over a period of
      2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeted against CD19 have demonstrated
      unprecedented successes in treating patients with hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies.
      Besides CD19, many other molecules such as CD22, CD30,BCMA, CLL-1, etc. may be potential in
      developing the corresponding CAR-T cells to treat patients whose tumors expressing those
      markers. Investigators have developed a high efficient platform for constructing different
      CARs and preclinical studies have demonstrated effective killing of corresponding target
      cells. In this study, investigators will evaluate their safety and efficacy in patients with
      different types of hematopoietic and lymphoid malignancies. The primary goal is safety
      assessment including cytokine storm response and any other adverse effects. In addition,
      tumor targeting and disease status after treatment will also be evaluated.

    <description>Patients will be drawn 50-100 ml blood to obtain enough peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CAR-T manufacturing. The T cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with CAR lentiviral vector, expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. Chemotherapy will then be given. Following tumor burden reassessment, CAR-T cells will be infused.</description>
