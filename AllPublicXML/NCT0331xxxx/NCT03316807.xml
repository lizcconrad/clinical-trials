  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uptake, adherence, and completion of vaccination among HIV-infected adults were low, and
      their immune function and immune response to hepatitis B vaccination were also suboptimal,
      indicating that the current practice of hepatitis B vaccination can't protect HIV-infected
      adults from HBV infection. And the persistence of immunity induced by hepatitis B vaccination
      remains a challenge.

      This is a randomized, open-label trial, conducted among HIV-infected adults with drug
      rehabilitation. This study will compare the immunogenicity, immune persistence, and safety of
      three intramuscular 20µg and 60µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccines at months 0, 1, and 6
      among HIV-infected adults.

      Participants are randomized in a ratio of 1:1 into 20 µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine
      group or 60µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine group. The 20 µg group will receive three
      intramuscular injections of the 20 µg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, while the 60 µg group
      will receive three intramuscular injections of the 60 µg dose at months 0, 1 and 6,
      respectively. HBsAg and anti-HBs will be tested during the study period. Adverse reactions
      will be recorded after vaccination.
