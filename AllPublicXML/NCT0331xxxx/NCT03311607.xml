      The safety and effectiveness of AmBisome 15 mg/kg, given over 15 days in 5 biweekly infusions
      of 3 mg/kg on an outpatient basis, is evaluated in clinically diagnosed PKDL patients of 12
      years and older in a highly endemic area in Bangladesh. This is a prospective study, with the
      objective to assess final cure 12 months after treatment.

      The safety and effectiveness of AmBisome 15 mg/kg, given over 15 days in 5 biweekly infusions
      of 3 mg/kg on an outpatient basis, was evaluated in clinically diagnosed PKDL patients of 12
      years and older in a highly endemic area in Bangladesh. This was a prospective study, with
      the objective to assess final cure 12 months after treatment. Clinical response was monitored
      at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and safety during and up until one month after
      treatment. A total of 280 patients recruited between 8 April and 25 November 2014 received
      AmBisome. Of these, 272 were assessed at 12 months.
