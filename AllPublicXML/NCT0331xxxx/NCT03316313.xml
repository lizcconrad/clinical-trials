      The purpose of this study is to determine whether patient education improves Hepatitis C
      screening in the primary care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C is a chronic, asymptomatic infection that progresses to liver cirrhosis and
      cancer in the later stages if left untreated. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      recommends a one-time screening for high risk birth cohort between the years 1945-1965. Prior
      studies have evaluated methods to improve screening for hepatitis c with focus on increasing
      awareness in health professionals. Targets included nursing staff and electronic medical
      records. This study targets providing patients with education resources to see if screening
      rates improve.
