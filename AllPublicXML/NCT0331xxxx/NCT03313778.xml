             listed below, must be clinically disease-free at study entry (i.e., subjects in the
             adjuvant setting). Subjects will be permitted to complete any standard of care
             adjuvant therapy prior to study entry, and those not eligible for any standard of care
             adjuvant treatment, or who decline such treatment, are permitted to consent to this
             study, as long as all treatment options have been transparently disclosed and
             documented in the Subject's medical record

          -  Part B: Subjects must have one of the histologically- or cytologically-confirmed
             unresectable (locally advanced or metastatic) solid malignancies listed below, AND
             have measurable disease at study entry defined by RECIST 1.1. AND be considered
             suitable for treatment with pembrolizumab; in this study pembrolizumab will be
             considered an investigational study drug.

               1. Non-small cell lung cancer (subjects in Part B must either lack EGFR sensitizing
                  mutation or ALK translocation per local test results, or must have progressed on
                  approved standard of care treatment for EGFR or ALK positive NSCLC)

                  adenocarcinoma and endometrial cancer

          -  Part A: subjects must have a FFPE tumor sample available (e.g., from their prior

          -  Part B: subjects must have at least 1 lesion amenable to the mandatory fresh tumor
             biopsy at study entry and provide a biopsy suitable for the NGS required for this
             study.

          -  Subjects must have resolution of toxic effect(s) from prior therapy to Grade 1 or
             less. Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy or alopecia are an exception to this
             criterion. If a subject received major surgery or radiation therapy of &gt; 30 Gy, they
             must have recovered from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention to
             Grade 1 or less

          -  Subject is willing to use an adequate method of contraception for the course of the

                  clinical study within 4 weeks of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab
                  (note only a 2 week wash out is required from prior pembrolizumab treatment)

               2. Any chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2
                  weeks of the first dose of mRNA-4157 or pembrolizumab
