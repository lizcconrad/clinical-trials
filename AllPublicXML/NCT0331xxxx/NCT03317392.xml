    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of olaparib and how well it
      works with radium Ra 223 dichloride in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate
      cancer that has spread to the bone and other places in the body. Olaparib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radioactive drugs,
      such as radium Ra 223 dichloride, may carry radiation directly to tumor cells and not harm
      normal cells. Giving olaparib and radium Ra 223 dichloride may work better at treating
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of olaparib in combination with radium Ra 223
      dichloride (radium-223). (Phase 1) II. Evaluate the radiographic progression-free survival
      (rPFS). (Phase 2)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate safety and tolerability as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      II. To evaluate radiographic PFS as stratified by disease extent (=&lt; 20 or &gt; 20 bone lesions)
      and prior docetaxel use (yes or no).

      III. Evaluate radiographic PFS in patients harboring or lacking evidence of homologous
      recombination deficiency (HRD).

      IV. Evaluate prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate as defined by &gt;= 50% decline in
      PSA from baseline.

      V. Evaluate total alkaline phosphatase response defined as a reduction of &gt;= 30% from the
      baseline value, confirmed &gt;= 4 weeks later.

      VI. Evaluate time to PSA progression as defined by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working
      Group (PCTWG) 3 criteria.

      VII. Evaluate radiographic objective response rate as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumor (RECIST) version 1.1.

      VIII. Evaluate time to increase in the total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level defined as an
      increase of &gt;= 25% from baseline at &gt;= 12 weeks, in patients with no decrease from baseline,
      or as an increase of &gt;= 25% above the nadir, confirmed &gt;= 3 weeks later, in patients with an
      initial decrease from baseline.

      IX. Evaluate time to initiation of next active anti-cancer therapy (including androgen
      receptor[AR] signaling agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or investigational
      agents).

      X. Evaluate time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE). XI. Evaluate overall survival
      (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate impact on quality of life (QOL) as determined by Functional Assessment of Cancer
      Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

      II. Estimate the frequency of mutations in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair pathway in
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) as determine by
      Oncopanel testing and by whole exome sequencing (WES).

      III. Characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes and immune
      markers by whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS) in each arm.

      IV. Characterize changes in the peripheral T-cell and T-cell receptor repertoire at baseline,
      during treatment, and at progression in each arm.

      V. Evaluate changes in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in patients each treatment arm.

      VI. Assess the prevalence of germline mutations in homologous recombination genes in all
      enrolled patients.

      VII. Correlate homologous recombination gene germline mutation status with PSA response by
      treatment arm.

      VIII. Evaluate family history of cancers in the study population and correlate family cancer
      history with germline mutation status.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of olaparib followed by a phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive radium Ra 223 dichloride intravenously (IV) over 1 minute on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive radium Ra 223 dichloride IV over 1 minute on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also continue to receive olaparib as in Phase I.

      ARM II: Patients receive radium Ra 223 dichloride as in Arm I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
