      A-REPEAT (Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor -EGFR- rechallenge and plasma genotyping of
      patients with advanced colorectal tumors) is a Greek, investigator-initiated, single arm
      open-label phase II study of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in combination with chemotherapy
      in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Patients with a metastatic, histologically
      proven colorectal carcinoma RAS wild type will be treated with a combination of panitumumab
      and third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX,FOLFIRI or
      irinotecan monotherapy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few clinical studies have evaluated the role of anti-EGFR therapy rechallenge in metastatic
      colorectal cancer patients and there is no prospective clinical trial assessing the activity
      of treatment rechallenge with panitumumab-based therapy after initial progression. This study
      aims at exploring the concept of evolution and expansion of RAS wild type clones in order to
      restore sensitivity of the tumor to prior anti-EGFR therapy after a time interval in which a
      different, non-anti-EGFR second-line therapy is administered. Based on aforementioned data,
      it is hypothesized that rescue through rechallenge with panitumumab-based third-line therapy
      combined with chemotherapy could be associated with further response and clinical benefit. A
      significant component of the proposed prospective trial is exploratory translational: cell
      free plasma and platelet-based genotyping for genetic mutations in different time points will
      be undertaken in order to study the genetic composition of the metastatic tumour at
      initiation of and at progression through, anti-EGFR rechallenge therapy.

      Primary endpoint will be to evaluate the efficacy, in terms of overall response rate, of the
      addition of panitumumab rechallenge to standard third-line irinotecan-based or
      oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer initially
      treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line
      chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agents.

      Exploratory endpoints include to identify, in the context of translational research, tumour
      tissue and blood-based biomarkers with prognostic/predictive significance in patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer treated with rechallenge panitumumab in combination with
      standard third-line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, who were initially
      treated with, and benefiting from, first line irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based
      chemotherapy combined with an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, followed by second line
      chemotherapy not containing anti-EGFR agent.
