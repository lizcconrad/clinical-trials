  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the oncology area, neuropathic pains are relatively frequent and can be induced by
      surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. In usual practice, some units are using qutenza in
      order to reduce neuropathic pain even though using of this patch for a population of cancer
      patients has never been demonstrated so far in a prospective study. The present prospective
      study proposes to evaluate the qutenza efficacy in peripheric neuropathic pain in cancer
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Drugs for neuropathic pains are generally represented by antidepressants, anti-epileptics,
      opioids, lidocaine patch. However, these drugs can frequently be insufficient, and/or can
      lead to side effects. Qutenza (8% capsaicin patch) presents an interesting alternative.

      Qutenza efficacy has been shown in five principal studies conducted on 1988 adults affected
      by moderate or severe neuropathic pains. All patients presented Postherpetic neuralgia, or
      HIV associated therapy, or painful diabetic peripheric neuropathies. These studies led to
      qutenza approbation in Europe and in States in 2009.

      In oncology, neuropathic pains are relatively frequent and can be induced by the three big
      actors of the anti-cancerous therapeutic arsenal (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). In
      usual practice, some units are usually using qutenza, but the use of this patch for this kind
      of patients has not been shown in a prospective study. Advantages of this treatment are
      numerous, and results presented in other therapeutic area are encouraging its use in
      oncology.

      The present prospective study proposes to evaluate the qutenza efficacy in peripheric
      neuropathic pain in cancer patients.
