  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Resistant starch (RS) is a type of fiber that has unique digestive properties that can impact
      overall health including glucose homeostasis and satiety. RS found in potatoes can be
      increased by using certain cooking methods and serving temperatures. The purpose of this
      trial will compare the acute glycemic and satiety responses after consuming potatoes
      differing in RS content that are 1) baked then chilled or 2) boiled and consumed hot in
      overweight females on two separate occasions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potatoes are a low-cost, nutrient-dense dietary staple in the U.S. rich in complex
      carbohydrates, potassium, magnesium, and fiber, but low in fat and sodium. Starch is the main
      complex carbohydrate found in potatoes that yields glucose to contribute to overall energy
      needs. Another type of starch found in potatoes is resistant to amylase hydrolysis in the
      small intestine which is resistant starch (RS). Trials using RS as a functional ingredient
      (~15-30 g/day) in healthy and overweight adults resulted in improvements in postprandial
      glucose, insulin sensitivity, satiety hormone response, and subjective satiety. Limited data
      exists using RS naturally found in commonly consumed foods, such as potatoes. Altering the
      cooking methods and serving temperatures of potatoes can influence the amount of RS to impact
      glucose, satiety hormone response, and subjective satiety. Using a cross-sectional,
      cross-over design, the aim of this study will determine how potatoes 1) baked and chilled or
      2) boiled and consumed hot influence postprandial glycemic parameters, satiety hormones
      (glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide),
      subjective satiety, and subsequent energy intake in overweight females.

    <description>Participants will follow the same protocol for each arm with a minimum of 1-week wash-out period between arms. For each arm, fasting blood will be collected then 200 g of potato will be consumed. Postprandial blood will be collected 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Subjective satiety will be assessed using Visual Analogue Scale three times, as well as 48-hour subsequent dietary intake.</description>
