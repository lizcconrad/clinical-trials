  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemodynamic insufficiency after birth is seen commonly in babies born prematurely and is
      associated with adverse outcomes. In current clinical practice, a combination of blood
      pressure and clinical signs is used to guide therapy. However, blood pressure is a poor
      surrogate of systemic and organ (brain) blood flow distribution during transitional
      circulation. This state is characterised by increased peripheral vascular resistance and
      increased afterload causing myocardial depression and impaired blood flow distribution in
      spite of 'normal' blood pressure. Echocardiography-Doppler (Echo-D) measurement of superior
      vena cava (SVC) flow has been proposed as a more clinically relevant marker of circulatory
      impairment shortly after birth than systemic hypotension. When there is low SVC flow, several
      small-scale clinical trials have suggested dobutamine as the optimal therapeutic option.
      However the associations between SVC flow and short- and long- term outcomes are not strong
      enough to allow SVC flow alone to be the basis for the inclusion of patients into a
      confirmatory trial to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of dobutamine.

      NeoCirc-001 - The primary objective is to answer some important questions required for the
      design of a subsequent placebo-controlled trial (NeoCirc-003), which will evaluate the
      effectiveness of a new neonatal formulation of dobutamine to treat haemodynamic insufficiency
      in the first 72 hours after birth in babies born at less than 33 weeks' gestation.
      Observational data will be collected from this population with a view to determining the
      degree to which diagnostic measures influence treatment decisions. The primary outcome is
      death or worst cranial ultrasound (CUS) appearance at or before 36 weeks' gestation.

      NeoCirc-001A - The primary objective is to estimate the elimination half-life, and
      consequently the time to steady-state of dobutamine in extremely premature neonates.

      NeoCirc-001B - The primary objective is to construct a population pharmacokinetic
      pharmacodynamic model that will be validated using samples collected during the confirmatory
      trial (NeoCirc-003).

    <description>NeoCirc-001A: Half-life of the neonatal formulation of dobutamine.
The first sample will be drawn after the end of the infusion, at the time when dobutamine ceases reaching the systemic circulation of the neonate, defined as time end (te). To calculate the end of infusion (te) the dead space used in each unit will be taken into account (see below). The second sample will be taken at different study time points after the end of infusion:
5 min after te
15 min after te
45 min after te
2 hours after te
6 hours after te Two infants will be allocated to each time point. Sampling times will be assigned randomly to the patients.</description>
