  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients affected by multivessels coronary artery
      stenosis, represent a clinical relevant problem. The management and prognosis of these
      patents are supported by few literature data. Therefore, in this study authors enrolled real
      world diabetic vs. non diabetic patients admitted for STEMI and associated to multi vessels
      coronary disease. Then these diabetics were divided in incretin users (6 months of incretin
      treatment before study enrollment) vs. never incretin users. In these patients authors
      studied all cause mortality, cardiac mortality, and major adverse cardiac events at 12 months
      follow up.

    <textblock>
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients affected by multivessels coronary artery
      stenosis represent a class of patients really challenging to treat. In fact, treatment,
      clinical management, and prognosis are supported by few literature data. Therefore, in this
      study authors enrolled real world patients admitted for STEMI and associated to multi vessels
      coronary disease. Multivessels (Mv) coronary stenosis were characterized by non obstructive
      coronary stenosis (NOCS) as coronary lesions &lt;50% with fractional flow reserve &gt; 0.8.
      Therefore, STEMI was treated by percutaneous coronary intervention by primary angioplasty and
      direct stenting (DES stenting) of culprit vessel lesion. Then these STEMI-Mv-NOCS patients
      were divided in diabetics vs. non diabetics, and received conventional full medical therapy
      for STEMI. Then these diabetics were divided in incretin users (6 months of incretin
      treatment before study enrollment) vs. never incretin users. Study outcomes were all cause
      mortality, cardiac mortality, and major adverse cardiac events at 12 months follow up.
      Authors studied these study outcomes comparing diabetics vs. non diabetics at 12 moths follow
      up, and diabetics incretin-users vs. never-incretin-users.

        Diabetics and non diabetics patients admitted for STEMI. In this population authors
        selected STEMI patients with multivessel (Mv) non obstructive coronary diseases (NOCS).
        These STEMI-Mv-NOCS had coronary lesions and stenosis &lt;50%, with fractional flow reserve
        &gt;0.8. In diabetics authors selected incretin users (6 months of incretin treatment before
        study enrollment) vs never-incretin-users diabetics.
