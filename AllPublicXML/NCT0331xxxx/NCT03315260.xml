  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to answer the research question: Are Japanese bone metastatic CRPC patients
      satisfied with their Ra-223 treatment, and what factors drive such satisfaction? It also aims
      to determine patient anxiety regarding prostate cancer while on treatment with Ra-223, and
      assess the effect on quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a local, Japanese, prospective, longitudinal, observational, company-sponsored,
      multi-center, single arm study that will describe treatment satisfaction with Ra-223 in 150
      bone metastatic CRPC patients on 1st to 3rd line CRPC therapy. All outcomes will be obtained
      using PRO questionnaires at 4 time points: before treatment, during treatment, and at 1-month
      after the last treatment cycle.

    <measure>Change in patient satisfaction with treatment using the Cancer Therapy Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CTSQ measures patient satisfaction in 3 domains:3 domains related to patients' satisfaction with cancer therapy: Expectations of Therapy (ET, 5 items), Feelings about Side Effects (FSE, 4 items) and Satisfaction with Therapy (SWT, 7 items). These 3 dimensions will be examined.</description>

    <measure>Change in bone-related symptoms using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Quality of Life Measurement in Patients with Bone Pain (FACT-BP)</measure>
