  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. Literature shows increasing
      evidence that dysfunction of ocular microcirculation in the optic nerve influences the
      progression of glaucoma. Laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) represents a non-invasive method to
      quantify ocular perfusion also at the ONH. LSFG enables noninvasive quantification of
      microcirculation of the optic disc in Japanese glaucoma patients

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Caucasian men and women aged over 50 years

          -  Subject is generally healthy with no current significant or a history of a significant
             neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary (including asthma), hepatic, metabolic,
             rheumatic, autoimmune, hematological or renal disorder, as determined by the
             investigator's clinical judgment through collection of medical history and performance
             of a physical examination. A significant disorder is defined as a disease or medical
             condition associated with impaired health status, requiring regular or current medical
             treatment and/or follow up. For the purposes of this study, an investigator may
             classify a medical condition as a nonsignificant disorder despite the fact that the
             subject receives treatment. Subjects having controlled Stage 1 hypertension (blood
             pressure of 140-159 mmHg systolic and/or 90-99 mmHg diastolic) are eligible for
             participation in this study

          -  Normal open angle in a gonioscopic examination

          -  Presence of glaucomatous optic disc changes in biomicroscopy and

          -  Visual field defects in at least two visual field examinations (Reliability criteria:
             fixation errors &lt; 20%, false positives &lt; 15%, and false negatives &lt; 33%) Or

          -  Abnormal circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thinning (RNFL evaluated by OCT)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of ocular or systemic disease causing optic nerve damage

          -  History of IOP greater than 21 mm Hg (corrected by CCT)

          -  Participation in a clinical trial in the 3 weeks preceding the study

          -  Ocular surgery (including intravitreal injection) during the 3 months preceding the
             study

          -  Ametropia &gt; 6 Dpt

          -  Smoking

          -  pre- or perimenopausal women

          -  Relevant ophthalmic diseases/conditions that could interfere with LSFG measurements
             (e.g. optic nerve head drusen, tilted disc, etc.)

          -  Opacities of the cornea (e.g. corneal scars, corneal oedema), the lens (e.g. LOCS-II
             grading &gt; 2, posterior capsule opacification) or the vitreous (e.g. vitreous
             haemorrhage, asteroid hyalosis)

          -  Patients who are not able to cooperate or with insufficient ability to fixate (tremor,
             nystagmus)

          -  Blood donation in the 3 weeks preceding the study

          -  Symptoms of a clinically relevant illness in the 3 weeks before the first study day

          -  Ocular infection or clinically significant inflammation

          -  Pregnancy, planned pregnancy or lactating
