  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility and efficiency of incorporating 19F MR
      functional lung imaging into the routine assessment of lung cancer patients prior to thoracic
      radiotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      Determine feasibility by evaluating if:

      PO1: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer are able to successfully complete pre- and
      post-radiotherapy 19F MR imaging scans as scheduled.

      Secondary Objective:

      Determine efficiency by evaluating if:

      SO1: Determine efficiency by evaluating if 19F MRI data can be successfully analyzed and
      incorporated into the radiation planning system.

      SO2: Determine efficiency by evaluating if the incorporated 19F MRI functional data can be
      successfully used to generate radiotherapy plan in a timely manner.

      SO3: Determine if pre- and post radiotherapy 19F MRI scans can be readily compared to observe
      changes in pulmonary function.

      Hypotheses Investigators hypothesize that functional 19F MR imaging assessment is feasible in
      the lung cancer patient population and that the acquired images can be efficiently analyzed
      and integrated into radiotherapy planning.
