  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to determine the safety and efficacy of abdominal wall
      transplantation as a treatment for the reconstruction of abdominal wall defects. Abdominal
      wall transplantation may be performed alone or in combination with another transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within this protocol we propose to perform abdominal wall transplantation in 5 subjects,
      either as an isolated abdominal wall or in combination with another organ transplant. Each
      subject will be followed for a study period of 18 months.

      Participants receiving an isolated abdominal wall transplant will be treated with
      immunosuppression known to prevent rejection of allografted tissues and designed to minimize
      exposure to calcineurin inhibitor based immunosuppression by using a drug called Belatacept.
      This will include monthly infusions for the 18-month study period that will take place at
      Duke University Medical Center.

      Participants receiving an abdominal wall in combination with another organ transplant will
      receive the standard immunosuppression therapy as the non-vascularized composite allograft
      organ transplant. These patients will be studied to determine efficacy of the abdominal wall
      transplant to restore function of the defective abdominal wall for a study period of 18
      months at Duke University Medical Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Candidates between 18-65 years old

          -  Willingness and legal ability to give consent

          -  Abdominal Wall in combination with another organ transplant: they must be eligible for
             the non-vascularized composite allograft organ transplant at Duke

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignancy at evaluation or history of malignancy that precludes transplantation

          -  Pregnancy: Women who are of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 48 hours of transplant and agree to use reliable contraception
             with two contraceptive methods for a minimum of 2 years following abdominal wall
             transplantation. Subjects seeking to become pregnant following 2 years will be made
             aware during the consent process that the effect of pregnancy on the transplanted
             abdominal wall and vice versa is unknown.
