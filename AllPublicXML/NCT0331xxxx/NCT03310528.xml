  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at the effectiveness of current anesthesia
      guidelines regarding food and drink prior to surgery in patients who are likely to have food
      and drink remain in their stomach longer than might ordinarily be expected.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Examine the utility of ultrasound examination of the stomach in estimating aspiration risk in
      patient populations whose aspiration risk is currently poorly understood. Evaluate the
      applicability of current pre-surgical fasting guidelines in the same patient populations
      whose aspiration risk is poorly understood.

      Evaluate the residual gastric contents in patients presenting for upper GI endoscopy
      procedures who have adhered to pre-operative fasting guidelines. Evaluate the residual
      gastric contents in patients presenting for upper GI endoscopy procedures who have not
      adhered to pre-operative fasting guidelines. Only patients expected to have an oral-gastric
      tube placed during upper GI endoscopy procedure will be included. Both groups will be
      evaluated to learn if their residual gastric contents conform to currently-accepted standards
      for low aspiration risk.
