  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to describe the impact of vaginal reconstruction, including an intraperitoneal
      vaginal vault suspension for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) on pelvic anatomy using dynamic
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 in 11 women will undergo surgery for POP by age 80 years. POP occurs due to a
      defect or weakness of the pelvic floor, resulting in the herniation of pelvic organs through
      the vagina. The goal of surgical interventions has historically been thought to restore
      normal pelvic anatomy. Restoration of pelvic anatomy has been demonstrated following pelvic
      reconstructive surgery by way of significantly improved postoperative Pelvic Organ Prolapse
      Quantification (POPQ) scale measurements. Furthermore, improved POPQ measurements have also
      been shown to be positively correlated with improved patient satisfaction.

      More recently, attention has turned toward using imaging studies to describe the
      postoperative anatomical changes seen in pelvic reconstructive surgery. The purpose of this
      study is to describe the impact of vaginal reconstruction, including an intraperitoneal
      vaginal vault suspension for POP on pelvic anatomy using dynamic MRI of the pelvis.

      The primary aim is to compare postoperative dynamic pelvic MRI measurements to preoperative
      measurements in patients who undergo prolapse repair vaginally including anterior, posterior
      and intraperitoneal vaginal vault suspension repairs for POP.
