  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a global public health problem. The postoperative mortality and disability
      rate of hip fracture is high, and early surgery is still the most effective treatment method,
      but these patients are often associated with concurrent heart and lung and other organ
      dysfunction, anesthesia and surgery are extremely risky, mainly associated with high
      incidence of complications in the pulmonary and cardiovascular system, and anesthesia plays a
      vital role in ensuring that these patients can safely and effectively get through the
      perioperative period.

      The research on the relationship between anesthetic methods and hip fracture surgery
      prognosis mainly focuses on comparison between neuraxial anesthesia (including spinal
      anesthesia and epidural anesthesia) and general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation until
      now. In addition to general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation and neuraxial anesthesia,
      ultrasound-guided lumbar plexus and sciatic nerve block has been widely used in hip fracture
      surgery in recent years, especially for some high-risk patients with cardiopulmonary
      dysfunction. However, it is not clear whether ultrasound-guided combined lumbar plexus and
      sacral plexus block with sedative anesthesia can improve the prognosis of elderly patients
      with hip fracture, and in this study, we plan to make a prospective, multicenter, randomized
      controlled clinical trial to compare the effects of general anesthesia with endotracheal
      intubation and ultrasound-guided combined lumbar plexus and sacral plexus block with sedative
      anesthesia on the prognosis of elderly patients with hip fracture to clarify the clinical
      value of combined lumbar plexus and sacral plexus block with sedative anesthesia in elderly
      patients with hip fracture.

    <description>Sepsis-related organ failure assessment score, also known as sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), is used to track a person's status during the stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure. The score is based on six different scores, one each for the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, coagulation, renal and neurological systems.Both the mean and highest SOFA scores are predictors of outcome. An increase in SOFA score during the first 24 to 48 hours in the ICU predicts a mortality rate of at least 50% up to 95%. Scores less than 9 give predictive mortality at 33% while above 11 can be close to or above 95%.</description>

    <description>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment. The MMSE test includes simple questions and problems in a number of areas: the time and place of the test, repeating lists of words, arithmetic such as the serial sevens, language use and comprehension, and basic motor skills.</description>
