  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are consistent evidences through epidemiologic studies in different places, reinforced
      by occupational asthma records studies, that cleaning workers have a high risk in developing
      asthma. These risk determinants are not totally known. The air around the worker may have
      some higher and lower molecular weight with different concentration peaks from removed dust
      of the cleaning process and volatile substances from cleaning products. Cleaning activities
      may occur in different places. Although the relationship between rhinitis and asthma is
      already established, there are not many studies about occupational rhinitis-related work
      place. This study aimed to investigate airway inflammation and respiratory symptoms of
      cleaning workers from different workplaces.

      Were recruited to participate in the study individuals from four different workplaces:
      Hospital; University; Housekeeper and Control (office workers). The research was performed in
      Cacoal city, Rondonia, Brazil. Smokers (active), pregnant, lactating, and individuals at
      continuing therapy for treating disorders of the airways were excluded.

      Clinical profile and respiratory symptoms employees evaluation were performed using the
      European Community Respiratory Health Survey for occupational diseases evaluation (ECRHS),
      and the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) - Asthma module.

      Nasal swab was collected for evaluation of upper airways inflammation, according to Ronchetti
      et al protocol, using a sterile swab that was moistened with 1mL saline solution; both
      nostrils were scraped using this swab. Twenty minutes after this, laminas were stained using
      May-Grunwald-Giemsa to eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and epithelial
      cells identification. Cells were analyzed using a Nikon E600 optical microscope (Nikon,
      Canada), of 1.000 x magnitude. Whenever possible a total of 200 cells were counted in two
      slides.

      Statistical analysis were performed using Anova variance (Kruskal-Wallis) and Dunn's test for
      comparisons between groups. To evaluate the association between the qualitative variables we
      used the chi-square, Statistical software Sigma Plot 12.0 and SPSS 21.0. The confidence
      interval was 95% (p &lt;0.05).
