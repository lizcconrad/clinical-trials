  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a major concern during and after cancer therapy with severe impact on quality of
      life. Yet, sound comparable data on fatigue prevalence, severity, and impact on daily life
      across different tumor entities is lacking. Furthermore, little is known about the current
      state of screening, counselling and treatment of fatigue.

      Thus, the FiX-Study aims to assess such data to identify patient groups with especial need
      for an improved fatigue management and treatment.

      A minimum of n=3000 patients about equally distributed about the 16 most common tumor
      entities shall be recruited between year 1 and 2 after primary cancer diagnosis via the
      cancer registry Baden-Württemberg. Data on fatigue (EORTC QLQ-FA12, BFI), quality of life
      (EORTC QLQ-C30), depression and anxiety (PAQ-4), and information about screening and
      treatment of fatigue will be assessed via self-reported questionnaires. Clinical data
      regarding tumor and treatment characteristics will be derived from the cancer registry.

      This trial is imbedded in a larger research agenda on fatigue and will provide the basis for
      the development of an individually-tailored fatigue program.
