    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted distal
      gastrectomy for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma（cT1-4a, N-/+, M0）.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming
      the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive
      procedures. The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted
      distal gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of
      robotic and laparoscopic assisted distal gastrectomy in the treatment of gastric
      adenocarcinoma （cT1-4a, N-/+, M0）.
