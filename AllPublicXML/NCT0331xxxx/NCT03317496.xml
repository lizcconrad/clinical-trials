  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open label, multicenter, safety and clinical activity study of avelumab
      in combination with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of adult patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Initially, avelumab will be evaluated in combination
      with pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) (Cohort A1) and in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with
      cisplatin-eligible urothelial (bladder) cancer (UC) (Cohort A2). As more information is
      learned about other anti-cancer immunotherapy agents, in future portions of the study,
      avelumab may be combined with chemotherapy and other anti-cancer immunotherapy agents in
      patients with these same or different tumor types.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2, open label, multicenter, safety, clinical activity, pharmacokinetic
      (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) study of avelumab in combination with chemotherapy with or
      without other anti-cancer immunotherapies, as first-line treatment of adult patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Initially, avelumab will be evaluated in
      combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Cohort A1) and with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with
      cisplatin-eligible urothelial cancer (UC) (Cohort A2).

      Given the growing preclinical and clinical indications that combinations of anti-cancer
      immunotherapies potentially improve patient outcomes compared to results seen with single
      agents, in portions of the study to be added in the future, avelumab will be evaluated in
      combination with both standard-of-care chemotherapy and other anti-cancer immunotherapies in
      patients with advanced malignancies. Each cohort in the study will consist of a Phase 1b
      lead-in portion to evaluate safety and a Phase 2 cohort expansion to evaluate safety and
      efficacy.

      In the Phase 1b safety lead-in portion, up to 12 patients will be enrolled into each cohort
      and evaluated for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) during the first 2 cycles of treatment. If
      investigational products administration in a cohort is deemed safe in the Phase 1b lead-in,
      enrollment will be expanded into the Phase 2 cohort expansion. Up to approximately 40
      patients in each cohort (including those enrolled in the Phase 1b lead-in and those enrolled
      in the Phase 2 cohort expansion) will be enrolled and treated with avelumab plus chemotherapy
      in the initial portion of the study and, in future portions of the study, with avelumab plus
      chemotherapy with or without other anti-cancer immunotherapies.
