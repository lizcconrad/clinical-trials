  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study evaluates the effect of perinatal use of probiotics on the number of
      diagnosed viral, bacterial and fungal infections in pregnant women and on the maintenance of
      a health pregnancy. In addition, the effect of probiotics intake during pregnancy and
      breastfeeding on the infant's overall health status will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout pregnancy women undergo many biological changes, including alterations in their
      microbiota. These infections can exacerbate pregnancy complications and increase the risk of
      preeclampsia and preterm birth. The present study aims to evaluate the potential effects of
      perinatal use of probiotics on the number of diagnosed viral, bacterial and fungal infections
      in pregnant women and on the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy. Potential infections include
      but are not limited to influenza/colds, bacterial vaginosis, mastitis, candidiasis, urinary
      tract infection and gingivitis. Additionally, the benefits of probiotic intake by the mother
      on the infant during pregnancy and breastfeeding will be evaluated.

    <description>This includes any viral, bacterial and fungal infection (e.g. bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis, urinary tract infection, mastitis, cold, flu, gingivitis, etc.). A vaginal swab and saliva sample will be taken at every visit on site throughout pregnancy. The vaginal swab will be used for the detection of Bacterial Vaginosis and Candidiasis. Other required swab samples will be collected if an infection occurs (e.g. vaginal, mouth, throat, nose, etc.). If an infection is suspected by a participant in-between a scheduled visit, the participant will come on site to be checked by a doctor. If the participant is subsequently diagnosed with an infection, a saliva sample will need to be taken at this time.</description>
