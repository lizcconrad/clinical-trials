      This research study is studying a combination of drugs as a possible treatment for metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer.

      The drugs involved in this study are:

        -  Cabozantinib (XL184)

        -  Nivolumab
    </textblock>

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of Nivolumab
      and Cabozantinib as a treatment for any disease.

      The FDA has not approved Cabozantinib for this specific disease but it has been approved for
      other uses. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved nivolumab for
      this specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      Cabozantinib has been used in some phase I studies and information from those other research
      studies suggests that cabozantinib may help to shrink or stabilize breast cancer.

      Cancers are recognized by the immune system, and under some circumstances, the immune system
      may control or even eliminate tumors. An antibody is a natural protein made by the immune
      system that binds other proteins and molecules to fight infection and its ill effects.
      Antibodies stimulating the immune system have been developed for treatment of human cancers.
      Nivolumab is an experimental antibody drug that may make the immune response more active
      against cancer.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking at how the participant's type of breast
      cancer responds to the combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed invasive breast
             cancer, with metastatic disease. Participants without pathologic or cytologic
             confirmation of metastatic disease should have unequivocal evidence of metastasis from
             physical examination or radiologic evaluation.

          -  Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor expression both &lt;10% by
             immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 negative by IHC or non-amplified as determined by
             the current ASCO-CAP criteria. If patient has more than one histological result, the
             most recent one has to be considered for inclusion.

          -  Participants must have measurable disease by RECIST version 1.1

          -  Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy, if tumor is safely accessible,
             at baseline and 7-14 days prior to C3D1. Participants for whom newly-obtained samples
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or participant safety concern) may submit an
             archived specimen.

        Note: After the first 6 participants undergo biopsy on cabozantinib, we will review their
        adverse event profiles to ensure no more than a 20% rate of grade 3 or higher bleeding or
        wound healing complications occur. If more than 2 patients (&gt;20%) have safety concerns, we
        will reassess the safety of collecting the research biopsies. Full review of all grade
        (including grade 1 and 2) may also prompt changes and will be reviewed by the study team.
        Exelixis may be consulted if necessary.

          -  Prior chemotherapy: Participants may have received 0-3 prior chemotherapeutic regimens
             for metastatic breast cancer and must have been off treatment with chemotherapy for at
             least 14 days prior to registration. Participants should also be adequately recovered
             from acute toxicities of prior treatment.

          -  Prior biologic therapy: Patients must have discontinued all biologic therapy at least
             14 days prior to registration.

          -  Prior radiation therapy: Patients may have received prior radiation therapy in either
             the metastatic or early-stage setting. Radiation therapy must be completed per the
             following timelines:

               -  Radiotherapy to the thoracic cavity or abdomen within 4 weeks prior to
                  registration.

               -  Radiotherapy to bone lesions within 2 weeks prior to registration.

               -  Radiotherapy to any other site within 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  In all cases, there must be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior
             radiotherapy.

          -  The subject is ≥18 years old.

          -  ECOG performance status ≤1(Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/mcL

               -  hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dl

               -  Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤1

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
             screening

          -  Childbearing potential is defined as: participants who have not reached a
             postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause

             and/or uterus).

          -  Female and male participants of childbearing potential must agree to use an adequate
             method of contraception. Contraception is required starting with the first dose of
             study medication through 150 days (5 months) after the last dose of study medication .
             Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include
             bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of hormonal
             contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and
             copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated
             in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

             evidence of progression for ≥ 1 month after treatment, and no ongoing requirement for
             corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (magnetic
             resonance imaging or CT scan) completed during screening. Any corticosteroid use for
             brain metastases must have been discontinued without the subsequent appearance of
             symptoms for ≥2 weeks prior to registration. Treatment for brain metastases may
             include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, or a combination as deemed appropriate
             by the treating physician. Participants with CNS metastases treated by neurosurgical
