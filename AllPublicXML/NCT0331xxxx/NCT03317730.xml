  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To confirm the feasibility of studying Xtampza ER during radiotherapy (RT) for locally
      advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) as part of a prospective clinical trial. Investigators
      will also assess pain control, quality of life, and drug related toxicity during RT and
      during short term follow-up.

    <measure>Feasibility of Xtampza ER during radiotherapy (RT) for locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of administering Xtampza ER during RT is defined as continuation of the medication throughout RT. The number of patients who discontinue Xtampza ER due to difficulty with administration, perceived inefficacy, or toxicity will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine Pain Control (at time of enrollment)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be assessed using:
Pain Intensity Numeric Rating Scale - a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst possible pain.
Brief Pain Inventory - a patient completed 2-page questionnaire rating severity of pain and how pain interferes with functioning. The pain severity score is calculated by averaging the 4 questions related to this topic (each question is a 0-10 scale, with higher numbers indicating worse pain). The pain interference score is calculated by averaging the 7 questions related to this topic (each question is a 0-10 scale, with higher numbers indicating worse functional interference). The remaining items included in the Brief Pain Inventory will be recorded but do not contribute to a score.</description>

    <description>The FACT - Head &amp; Neck questionnaire will be administered at time of enrollment, completion of RT, and at follow-up.
The FACT - Head &amp; Neck questionnaire is a battery of 39 questions across 5 domains, with each response given on a 0-4 scale, with 0 indicating no problem and 4 indicating severe problem. The average of responses within each domain will be calculated.</description>

    <description>This study will enroll patients scheduled to receive radiation therapy (RT), but RT details are not specified by this protocol. Patients taking long acting opioid analgesics prior to enrollment will be converted to an equivalent dose of Xtampza ER at the time of enrollment. For the remaining patients not previously prescribed opioid analgesics, Xtampza ER will be initiated when 2 or more daily doses of short acting opioids are required, resulting in a total daily dose of at least 30mg morphine sulfate equivalent. During RT, pain will be assessed on a weekly basis using the PI-NRS and the dose of Xtampza ER will be adjusted at the discretion of the treating physician, with recommendation to maintain an equivalent of 100% daily opioid requirement. Assessment for tapering of Xtampza ER will begin 1 month following the completion of RT at the time of first follow-up.The study period will end 3 months following the final fraction of RT.</description>
