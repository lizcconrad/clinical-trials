  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, augmented reality (AR) has gained attention but little is known concerning its
      repercussion in individuals when considering some mental and physiological aspects.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AR glasses on some
      cognitive and physiological functions in an attempt to determine its safety for workers.

      Twelve volunteers were tested during two separate randomized sessions: one with AR glasses
      (ARGlass) and one in normal condition (Normal). Participants had two perform different tasks
      of a 90 minutes total duration. Before, during and after these tasks, two feet balance, one
      foot balance, precision balance, stroop and memory tests were performed. Also, heart rate and
      electromyographic activity of some muscles were recorded. Finally a survey was filled to
      determine, for example fatigue, pain or comfort.
