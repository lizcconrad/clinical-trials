  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded study with a 2-arm parallel design. Healthy
      adults aged 60 through 64 years of age with no history of pneumococcal vaccination will be
      randomized equally to receive either a single intramuscular dose of multivalent pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine followed 1 month later with a dose of saline or Prevnar 13 followed 1 month
      later with a dose of PPSV23 (control group).

             not including, the 65th birthday) at enrollment.

          2. Healthy adults, including adults with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease
             not requiring significant change in therapy or requiring hospitalization within 3
             months before receipt of investigational product, as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, laboratory screening, and clinical judgment of the investigator.

          3. Female subjects who are not of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous vaccination with any licensed or investigational pneumococcal vaccine, or

          2. History of microbiologically proven invasive disease caused by S pneumoniae.

          3. Serious chronic disorder including metastatic malignancy, severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring supplemental oxygen, end-stage renal disease with
             or without dialysis, clinically unstable cardiac disease, or any other disorder that,
             in the investigator's opinion, excludes the subject from participating in the study.
