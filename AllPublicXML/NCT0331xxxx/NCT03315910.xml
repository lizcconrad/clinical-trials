  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to help determine the most effective type or combination of treatments to offer
      patients seeking lung cancer screening who are smokers to help them reduce the number of
      cigarettes they smoke, or quit smoking. The investigators long term goal is to increase the
      benefits of lung cancer screening by providing a blue print of best practices for screening
      sites to deliver tobacco treatment to their patients who are smokers, in a way that does not
      add burden to screening site staff and increases the chances of patients quitting smoking.

    <arm_group_label>Message Framing (Gain vs. Loss)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Overall, a robust body of health communication literature demonstrates that gain-framed messages may be more effective than loss-framed or non-framed (neutral) messages for encouraging smoking cessation. In other words, quitting messages that promote smoking cessation are more persuasive if they emphasize the benefits of quitting (gain-framed) rather than the risks (loss-framed) of persistent smoking (25, 26). Included with the written communication of their LDCT-LCS results, participants will receive a printed individualized quitting message that emphasizes either the benefits of quitting (gain-framed) or the risks of continuing to smoke (loss-framed).</description>
