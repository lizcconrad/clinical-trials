  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The propose of the study is to test the effectiveness of Reach for Control (RFC) as compared
      to Michigan MATCH to improve asthma symptoms, asthma management and lung functioning and to
      decrease ED visits and admissions for youth with poorly controlled asthma when integrated
      into hospital emergency departments and delivered by community health workers. The study is a
      hybrid implementation-effectiveness design and will test RFC for use in real world, public
      healthcare settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in the emergency department at Children's Hospital of Michigan;
      CHM). 170 adolescents with poorly controlled asthma and their primary caregivers will be
      enrolled. Families will be randomly assigned to six months of home-based family treatment
      consisting of either RFC or Michigan MATCH , a model program endorsed by the State of
      Michigan for treatment of poorly controlled asthma. Treatment content of RFC consists of
      weekly sessions focusing on asthma education, asthma management skills, improving home-school
      community for asthma, access to care and case management. MATCH includes asthma education but
      is less intensive and does not focus on family management skills. Treatment will be provided
      by community health workers (CHWs) employed by a community agency providing MATCH as their
      standard of care. Consent and data collection will be completed in the home at baseline with
      additional data collection visits at 6, 12 and 18 months after baseline. Data collection is
      completed by project research assistants and consists of questionnaires and interviews with
      the adolescent and parent to assess asthma management, asthma symptoms and hospital
      utilization. The adolescent also completes a pulmonary function test on a portable spirometer
      and is observed using medication devices to assess asthma care skills objectively.The data
      analyses will be intent-to-treat, meaning that all randomized participants are included
      regardless of the intervention dose received. Trial data will analyzed using the linear mixed
      effect models.

    <description>Identifies family strengths and weaknesses in the management of pediatric asthma across a variety of domains. This is a semi-structured interview that is rated on seven to nine 9-point subscales with higher scores indicating better management. The rating manual provides elaboration and brief examples at key anchor points for each rating scale. A FAMSS summary score is computed for each family by taking a mean across all subscales.</description>

    <description>In Phase 1 (weeks 1-4), the CHW conducts an initial intake and then completes a comprehensive functional analysis (FA) of behavior to determine the causes of poor asthma management for each youth regarding asthma management. In Phase 2 (weeks 5-20) is a treatment phase and consists of a combination of mandatory cognitive-behavioral skills training (CBST) modules (received by all families) and flexible CBST modules chosen and individualized based on the results of the Phase 1 FA. This includes but not limited to In-vivo Asthma Skills Training, Improving Family Communication and Behavioral Contracting. Phase 3 (weeks 21-24) involves termination planning and relapse prevention</description>
