    <textblock>
      Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity profile of the combination of
      cyclophosphamide and ATO (Arsenic Trioxide) in subjects with relapsed refractory AML.

      Determine the efficacy of ATO and cyclophosphamide in this population, as defined by response
      rate, response duration, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).

      Determine the number of transplant-eligible subjects who are successfully bridged to stem
      cell transplantation or donor lymphocyte infusion.

      This is an open label phase 1 study of fixed dose ATO (Arsenic Trioxide) and escalating doses
      of cyclophosphamide using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. All subjects will be treated
      with sequential cycles of 3 days of ATO at 0.15 mg/kg/d IV followed by Cyclophosphamide as a
      single IV dose on day 4 along with mesna at a dose equal to the cyclophosphamide (for doses
      ≥1000 mg/m2) and hydration for a maximum of 6 cycles. ATO and Cyclophosphamide will be
      repeated every 28-42 days. Treatment will be given inpatient for the first cycle, with the
      option of outpatient treatment for subsequent cycles. Subjects may remain on study in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum six cycles. Toxicity
      assessments will be performed continuously; DLT determination will be made based on adverse
      events (AEs) that occur during cycle 1 (day 1-28). An expansion cohort of ten subjects at the
      maximum tolerated dose will occur at the conclusion of dose escalation.
