  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A leak from a colorectal anastomosis is a post-operative complication surgeons fear the most,
      following colonic resection. Over the years, there have been multiple suggestions for
      intraoperative tests for the integrity of the colorectal anastomosis.

      Two of the most common tests that are performed routinely are:

        1. Air tight leak test - filling the pelvis with saline and insufflating air trans anal -
           looking for air bubbles in the saline filled pelvis.

        2. Injecting diluted dye (methylene blue) trans anal, and looking for blue dye stains on
           gauze pads covering the outer side of anastomosis.

      The aim of the study is to compare the two methods, and to assess if there is a superior
      method. A secondary aim is to establish standards to perform the test, mainly to assess the
      appropriate pressure to apply on the anastomosis.

      In this prospective study patients scheduled to undergo colonic resection of their distal
      part of the colon/ rectum with colorectal anastomosis, will have both testing methods
      performed sequentially and will be followed post-operative to assess the yield and
      sensitivity of the testing methods.

    <description>Intraoperative testing of colorectal anastomoses
Insert a Foley catheter through the anus into the rectum.
Insufflate the Foley balloon with 5 cc of air.
fill the pelvic space with 500 CC of warm saline
Insufflate air into the rectum up to a pressure of 35 mmH2o as measured by external manometer
Remove the saline from the pelvic space.
Inject methylene blue in to the rectum up to a pressure of 35 mmH2o measured by external manometer
Remove the methylene blue from rectum.
NB the above procedures are standard practice for assessing the quality of colorectal anastomoses during colorectal surgery.
The purpose of the study is to compare these standard methods of evaluation to determinant which method is superior</description>
