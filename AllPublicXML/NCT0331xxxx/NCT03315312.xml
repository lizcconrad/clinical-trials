      Occlusal caries management in first permanent molars: a pragmatic randomized clinical trial
      in child dental care

      Aim of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of fissure sealants and fluoride
      varnish in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial and evaluate whether some specific patient
      groups benefit more from any particular treatment.

      The high risk children (having a previous caries experience at 5 years of age) from 2009,
      2010 and 2011 birth cohorts (6-, 7- and 8-year-olds) from three counties (Østfold, Oppland
      and Hedmark) are selected. Children with at least two erupted first permanent molars in the
      same jaw randomly receive resin-based sealant or a fluoride varnish (Duraphat) during a
      routine dental examination. Children who already developed caries, had restorations or
      fissure sealants placed in first molars were excluded from the present study.

      Fluoride varnish and resin-based fissure sealants are randomly applied on contra-lateral
      teeth where each child serves as its own control. This study uses a natural clinical setting,
      where clinicians use methods and procedures that are routinely applied in public dental
      clinics. The study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics South
      East (2016/2002/REK sør-øst C).

      Sample size calculations: Based on the assumption that 80% of the treated teeth do not get
      caries and that 10% difference in caries development constitutes a clinically meaningful
      difference, it is required to recruit 180 participants in the study for the split-mouth
      design. Considering a potential maximum of annual 20% drop-out rate and a 3-years follow-up,
      the study will need to recruit 400 participants in order to have at least 206 children at the
      3 years of follow-up.

      Treatments are provided by either dentists or dental hygienists during routine dental
      examinations. Caregivers of eligible children are informed about the study, the participation
      is voluntary and an informed written parental consent is obtained in accordance with the
      directions of the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics. In this study, a clinician
      selects a random treatment for the first tooth by choosing one of the two cards, while a
      collateral tooth receives an alternative treatment. Subsequently, treatments provided and
      materials used are recorded on a treatment registration form. During this study, clinicians
      follow their conventional clinical procedures for applying sealants or fluoride varnish.
      Information on patient's caries experience and quality of oral hygiene are recorded on
      treatment registration form. Fluoride varnish is applied three times, at baseline, 6 months
      and 12 months.

      Caries on occlusal surfaces of first molars detected at later 24 and 36 months follow-ups
      will be recorded in the follow-up registration form. The main study outcome is caries
      occurrence on occlusal tooth surfaces.
