  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a light meal and a high-fat meal on
      the bioavailability (absorption) of of BMS-986205 commercial tablet in healthy participants.
      Eligible participants will receive a single dose of BMS-986205 under fasted or fed (high-fat
      meal or light meal) conditions on Day 1 and Day 15. The safety, tolerability and movement of
      the BMS-986205 into, through and out of the body (pharmacokinetics/PK) under these conditions
      will be assessed.
