      To evaluate the effect of oral administration of herbarium mixture Guazuma ulmifolia (GU) and
      Tecoma stans (TS) on metabolic profile in type 2 diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical trial was carried out 40 type 2
      diabetic patients independently of their basal hypoglycemic treatment. At beginning and at
      end of the study, BMI, waist circumference, a metabolic profile (fasting glucose, HbA1c,
      lipids and biosecurity profile), were measured. The patients were randomly assigned to
      receive the herbarium mixture (GU/TS) 1 g before each meal, or placebo for a period of 90
      days. All patients received therapy medical nutrition.
