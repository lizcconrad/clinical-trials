  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an assisted rehabilitation treatment
      through a robotic exoskeleton device on the functional recovery in a group of patients with
      hemiparesis from lesion of the first motor neuron (post-stroke), compared with a group of
      patients subjected to a conventional rehabilitation treatment. The patients enrolled in the
      study are chronic stroke injured with right hemiparesis of moderate to severe degree, by the
      system injury pyramid, never undergoing rehabilitation treatment with robots.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fugl-Meyer Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The null hypothesis tested in this study was the change in motor function domain of the upper extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer assessment in the Robotic Group (Robotic Treatment) would be the same as the one obtained by the Control Group (Conventional Treatment)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>functional scale: Bimanual Activity Test (BAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BAT is a functional scale designed to quantify the contribution of patient's affected upper limb to execute 25 common Activities of Daily Living such as Loosen and tighten the cap of a bottle , or unscrew a bolt. The elapsed time for accomplishing each task is measured and the therapist also give a score (ranging from 1 to 4) about the quality of each movement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>modified Ashworth (MA) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MA scale (Bohannon and Smith, 1987) is used to evaluate spasticity of the upper limb and to assess abnormal muscle tone at the shoulder and elbow. The MA scale is a 6-point scale: scores range from 0 to 4, where lower scores represent normal muscle tone and higher scores represent spasticity or increased resistance to passive movement. MA scores were averaged across the two joints and across testing directions (flexion, extension) to estimate abnormal muscle tone in the upper extremity (Zackowski, Dromerick et al., 2004)</description>

    <arm_group_label>Conventional treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The conventional treatment arm was conducted according to a set of exercises that were specifically designed in order to match the robotic treatment. Patients received both physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) session, administered by the physiotherapists of the hospital. The therapist will provide a specific conventional treatment comparable with the robotic treatment in terms of session time and therapeutic goals.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Robotic treatment</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The patients enrolled in the robotic arm are going to be undergone a series of passive, assisted and active mobilization in upper limb task-oriented exercises implemented in 3d virtual environments. Briefly speaking, these tasks promote the upper arm multi-joints coordination during the execution of reaching movements and grasping actions of fixed virtual objects displaced in the space.</description>

    <intervention_name>Upper Arm Rehabilitation Light Exoskeleton (RH-LEXOS)</intervention_name>
    <description>RH-LEXOS is a robotic exoskeleton device to support the rehabilitation of stroke patients. This system is conceived for the force assistance, integrated in a Virtual Reality system that allows implementing rehabilitative exercises highly interactive and engaging for the patients. Passive, assisted and active mobilization of upper arm is provided through the use of the exoskeleton robotic device within high intensive, repetitive, task-oriented exercises and an objective and reliable mean for monitoring patients' progress.</description>
