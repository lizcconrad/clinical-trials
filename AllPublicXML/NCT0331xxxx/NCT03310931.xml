  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether Thromboelastography (TEG) parameters on
      admission might be predictive for early neurological deterioration in acute ischemic stroke
      patients, specifically for the DWI lesion evolution within the first week after stroke onset.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early neurological deterioration (END ) is a major concern in stroke care, consistently
      associated with adverse clinical outcomes.END is a heterogeneous complex of
      pathophysiological and clinical entities. Despite some straight forward causes, DWI lesion
      growth is reportedly a primary underlying mechanism. Early recognition of END risk would
      allow for timely identification and proper intervention, improving stroke health care.

      Thromboelastography (TEG) measures the coagulation process from initial clotting cascade to
      clot strength, providing an integrated picture of two separate but simultaneously occuring
      components of coagulation, thrombosis and lysis. It has been reported to be associated with
      short and long-term outcome in patients with trauma, coronary artery diseases , pulmonary
      embolism and, most recently, stroke prevention.The purposes of this study is to evaluate how
      effective TEG is on predicting END, by producing a range of TEG values correlated with
      clinical and radiological assessment.

        The study population includes consecutively admitted patients with acute ischemic stroke in
        Dongguan people's Hospital. Patients would take TEG study within 6 hours after admission,
        as well as other routine lab tests. Serial MRI studies would be taken on admission and
        followed up on 7th day afterward, except when patients experience END, in which case
        followup MRI should be preformed immediately.
