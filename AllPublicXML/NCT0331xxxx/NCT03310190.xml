    <textblock>
      A study to assess the real-life management and use of healthcare resources during the
      initiation of venetoclax in participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with the
      deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]) who have received at least 1 prior
      therapy or participants with CLL without del(17p) who have received at least 1 prior therapy
      and for whom there are no other available treatment options.
