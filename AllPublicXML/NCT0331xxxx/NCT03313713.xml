  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial carried out on moderately
      hypercholesterolemic subjects who will consume 3 g per day of beta-glucans, in order to
      evaluate the effects on lipid profile, glycemia and intestinal function

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to assess the mid term effects of beta-glucans on lipid profile, glycemia and
      intestinal function, moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects will be involved in a
      cross-over study and supplemented for 8 weeks with 3 g/day of beta-glucans or placebo. The
      two intervention periods will be spaced by a 4 week washout period
