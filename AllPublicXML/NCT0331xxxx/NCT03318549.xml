      Better understand the impact of visual impairment on daily task performance in patients with
      eye diseases of the visual pathways, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD).

      Longitudinal study, with biannual visits, including patients with: glaucoma, suspected of
      having glaucoma, non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies, AMD, retinal degenerations, other
      diseases involving the visual pathways, besides healthy controls. Subjects will perform
      standard ophthalmological exams, and the following research tests: psychophysical, eye
      tracking, electroencephalogram, driving simulator, virtual reality, balance assessment, and
      questionnaires.

        Glaucomatous patients who have at least two consecutive abnormal and reliable standard
        automated perimetry (SAP). Patients considered suspects for glaucoma must have an IOP
        greater than 21mmHg or suspicious appearance of the optic nerve head but with reliable
        normal visual fields, defined as a PSD within 95% confidence limits and a GHT result within
        normal limits. To be considered healthy, subjects have to have IOP&lt;22mmHg with no history
        of elevated IOP and with at least two reliable normal visual fields, defined as a PSD
        within 95% confidence limits and a GHT result within normal limits. Age related macular
        degeneration will be classified if presence of sings of the disease on posterior
        biomicroscopy (fundoscopy), indirect ophthalmoscopy or Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
        exams. Other retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa or with other diseases
        affecting the visual pathways such as ischemic neuropathy or optic neuritis may also be
        included.
