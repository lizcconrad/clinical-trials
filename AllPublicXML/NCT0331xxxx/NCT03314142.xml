    <description>Ten healthy, normal weight subjects (male: 7, female: 3) after 10-14 hr fast, consumed 50g available carbohydrate from white bread and glucose, two times, in different weeks as reference foods along with 250ml water; and 50g available carbohydrates from bread enriched with coarse wheat bran (CB), bread enriched with fine wheat bran (obtained by milling the coarse bran) (FB) and the FB in which 10% of the flour was substituted with carob seed flour (CSFB), tested once, in different weeks along with 250ml water. Fingertip capillary blood glucose samples were taken at baseline, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120min. The first glucose sample was taken exactly 15min after the first bite of food or drink.</description>
