      A single dose trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of testosterone and anastrozole from
      subcutaneous testosterone and anastrozole (T+Ai) in premenopausal women
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is of open label single centre design. The serum concentrations of testosterone and
      plasma concentrations of anastrozole will be measured in 12 premenopausal women. Participants
      will be stratified in a 50:50 manner in two BMI (Body Mass Index) groups, &lt;25 and 25 kg/m2,
      respectively. There will be a lead group of two participants in whom the serum/plasma
      concentrations will be examined after the first four weeks, to determine whether the sampling
      schedule adequately describes the serum/plasma concentration-time profiles or should be
      adjusted.
