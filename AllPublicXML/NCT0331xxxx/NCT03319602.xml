      Study Design This is a single-center, randomized, blind investigator, 2-way crossover study
      design. Enrolled participants had severe hypoxia being treated at Intensive Care Unit
      associated with a hospital in Hornu (Epicura).

      The study consisted of two intervention periods of 2 weeks separated by a washout period of
      20 minutes. (Figure 1) The objective of the study is to determine whether adjunctive mask of
      our design (Double Trunk Mask - DTM) has an effect on increasing arterial pressure in Oxygen
      (PaO2) diagnosed with severe hypoxia.

      The protocol and informed consent documents were reviewed and approved by a recognized ethics
      review board at the study facility. The study was performed in accordance with the
      Declaration of Helsinki.

      Statistical Analysis

      All participants who received this intervention and completed two phases of study were
      included in the efficacy analysis.

      A sample size of 15 participants was needed to provide 90% power to detect a 10 mm Hg
      difference in PaO2. ANOVA for repeated measures followed by a post hoc test were used to
      compare the difference between participants receiving (CHFONP + DTM) and CHFONP alone.

      The test was performed with a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided). Statistical analyses
      were carried out using SigmaPlot software version 11.0 (Systat Software Inc. UK).

      Adverse Event Assessment

      Safety was assessed by the number of participants with adverse events (AEs). AEs were
      collected by systematic assessment using terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
      Activities (MedDRA), version 11.1 in participants who received one or more doses of
      intervention. Adverse events during washout were not collected.

    <description>The primary endpoint was the change of PaO2. Sequence (Figure 1): The patient should be placed in semi-seated (position at 45 °) Patient will be oxygenated with high-fow nasal cannula (HFNC). Fraction delivered in Oxygen and flow rate will be adjusted to obtain a Saturation in oxygen &gt; at 90%.
Arterial gazometry will be taken after 20 and 60 minutes wih HFNC.
The clinician will associate the Double Trunk Mask (DTM) with the same parameters of the high-fow nasal cannula. Arterial gazometry will be performed after 20 and 60 minutes after placement of DTM.
After the withdrawal of DTM, arterial gazometry will be performed after 20 and 60 minutes</description>
