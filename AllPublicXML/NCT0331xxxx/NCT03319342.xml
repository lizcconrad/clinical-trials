    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that both extending kindness towards others and self-kindness
      practices may have beneficial effects on well-being. This randomized pilot clinical trial
      will investigate the efficacy of two kindness interventions -acts of kindness (to self or to
      other) and loving-kindness meditation- for use with early-stage breast cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To refine two interventions - loving kindness and acts of kindness- for use with breast
      cancer survivors using an online platform.

      II. To determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of these interventions on positive
      affect, depressive symptoms, and other aspects of well-being among women with breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I (ACTS OF KINDNESS TO OTHERS): Participants perform small acts of kindness or
      generosity for others 3 times per week for 4 weeks and complete weekly online questionnaires.

      GROUP II (ACTS OF KINDNESS TO SELF): Participants perform small acts of kindness for
      themselves 3 times per week for 4 weeks and complete weekly online questionnaires.

      GROUP III (SELF-KINDNESS MEDITATION): Participants direct kind, loving thoughts to
      themselves, via guided meditation, 3 times per week for 4 weeks and complete weekly online
      questionnaires.

      GROUP IV (CONTROL): Participants keep track of their daily activities, focusing on factual
      information rather than thoughts and feelings, on 3 separate days each week. At the end of
      the week, participants report on their activities and complete several online questionnaires.

    <measure>Depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Analyses will be conducted under the intent-to-treat principle, including all participants in their assigned condition, accomplished by fitting models to all available data for each outcome measure, including data of participants with incomplete follow-up. Linear mixed models provide valid inferences under a missing at random assumption. Differences between conditions in change over time will be examined by testing condition-by-time interaction terms. Analyses will control for any participant characteristics with baseline imbalance among conditions or that differ between participants retained.
Depressive symptoms will be measured at baseline and post-intervention using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The CES-D is a measure of symptom severity across the previous week, and total scores range from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate greater severity of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Psychological well-being measured by the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Analyses will be conducted under the intent-to-treat principle, accomplished by fitting models to all available data for each outcome measure, including data of participants with incomplete follow-up. Analyses will control for any participant characteristics with baseline imbalance among conditions or that differ between participants retained.
Psychological well-being measured by the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF) Well-being will be measured at both baseline and post-intervention via the 14-item MHC-SF. Total scores range from 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater overall well-being. The MHC-SF is comprised of three empirically derived subscales: the 3-item Emotional Well-Being Subscale (score range: 0 to 15), the 6-item Psychological Well-Being Subscale (score range: 0 to 30), and the 5-item Social Well-Being Subscale (score range: 0 to 25). Higher scores on each subscale indicate greater well-being within that domain.</description>

Analyses will control for any participant characteristics with baseline imbalance among conditions or that differ between participants retained.
Big-5 Personality Dimensions measured by the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) measured at baseline: Personality dimensions will be measured at baseline by the 10-item TIPI. There are 5 subscales on the TIPI, each with 2-items: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience. Scores on each subscale range from 2 to 14, with higher scores indicating greater endorsement of the corresponding personality domain.</description>
