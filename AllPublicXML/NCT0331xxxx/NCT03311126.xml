      This is a phase II single-arm, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of the combination of induction chemoimmunotherapy with bendamustine and obinutuzumab
      (BO) followed by consolidation therapy and maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab in subjects
      who have not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for their MCL (i.e., prior single-agent
      rituximab is permitted, prior involved-field radiotherapy is permitted). Therapy for
      individual subjects will be risk-adapted based on results of minimal residual disease (MRD)
      testing performed after the consolidation phase. The study will be carried out at the
      University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) and participating community and
      academic practice sites within the Wisconsin Oncology Network (WON). There will be 6-10 sites
      participating in this study.

      The subject participation will include a screening period, treatment period, and a follow-up
      period. The induction chemoimmunotherapy regimen consists of bendamustine and obinutuzumab
      for 4-6 cycles, followed by consolidation and maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab in
      subjects achieving an objective response to induction therapy (i.e., complete or partial
      response; stable disease with objective evidence of tumor shrinkage. Subjects who are
      MRD-negative (determined by MRD testing on bone marrow and PB) after consolidation therapy
      will omit maintenance therapy.

      Subjects will undergo disease reassessment after C4 of induction BO chemoimmunotherapy, after
      obinutuzumab consolidation therapy, and after C4 and C8 of maintenance obinutuzumab. MRD
      testing will be done after C2 of induction (PB only), after consolidation (BMA and PB), and
      post-maintenance or EOT (PB only).

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 2 years</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For each patient, progression-free survival (PFS) will be defined as the number of days from C1D1 of induction chemoimmunotherapy to the day patient experiences an event of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. If a patient has not experienced an event at the time of analysis, patient's data will be censored at the date of the last available evaluation. The 2-year PFS probability will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. From the date of C1D1 of induction therapy to the date of progression or death; in the absence of progression or death, subjects will be followed for a minimum of 24 months after completion of study-related treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>At the end of Cycle 2 of induction therapy (each cycle is 28 days), following consolidation phase of therapy (after 6 cycles of induction, consolidation is 4 weekly doses of obinutuzumab), and within 30 days of completing protocol therapy</time_frame>
    <description>MRD defined as reduction to &gt;=10^-6 fold reduction in the IgVH unique clone of MCL (mantle cell lymphoma) by NGS (next generation sequencing).
MRD status will be evaluated after 2 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy with bendamustine and obinutuzumab, after 4 cycles of consolidation with obinutuzumab, and after an additional 8 cycles of maintenance with obinutuzumab. MRD status will be summarized using frequency and proportion with 95% confidence intervals.
MRD status will be collected on peripheral blood after cycle 2 of induction therapy, on peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate after consolidation obinutuzumab, and peripheral blood after maintenance therapy completion.</description>

    <description>Concordance between PB and BMA in predicting MRD negative status will be summarized by percent of subjects in which MRD status is concordant (i.e., both positive in the PB and BMA or both negative in the PB and BMA).</description>

Survival times of subjects who are still alive at the end of the follow-up period will be censored. OS will be summarized using point estimate of the median OS, along with the 95% confidence interval.</description>

    <description>Bendamustine is a chemotherapeutic agent that has dual functional properties of both an alkylating agent and a nitrogen mustard. Through these unique cytostatic properties, bendamustine is able to inhibit DNA transcription, replication, and repair. Bendamustine is approved in the U.S. for treatment of CLL and for indolent B cell NHLs progressing during or within 6 months of rituximab or a rituximab - containing regimen.</description>
