    <textblock>
      The study team is seeking a novel treatment for snoring involving local application of a
      nerve stimulant medication, neostigmine. In this study, neostigmine will be injected into 5
      sites of the soft palate during a standard procedure, drug-induced sleep endoscopy, to
      evaluate the effect on snoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Snoring is a major problem, affecting 40 million Americans. The disease affects patient and
      partner sleep quality as well as daytime function. Snoring treatment is limited by device
      compliance (mouth appliance, positive airway pressure) and insurance does not regularly pay
      for these devices. Surgical treatment for snoring has mixed results. As a result, there is an
      important need to develop new treatments for snoring.

      sites of the soft palate during a standard procedure, drug-induced sleep endoscopy, to
      evaluate the effect on snoring. If successful, development of a topical (non-injectable)
      version of this drug will be considered, so that the patient can apply him/herself before
      bedtime.

    <description>The data will come from the drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) audio and video recordings. Prior to the neostigmine injection, a snoring microphone will be placed over the right clavicle. Following administration of neostigmine, the patient will be observed for an additional 4 minutes to examine sound emanating from the soft palate. Total run time, instantaneous decibel levels, LAeq (average decibel level over time), and the maximum decibel level will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Artificial sleep will be induced by intravenous administration of propofol with micro boluses until clinical sleep is achieved with spontaneous respiration and observed apneas under monitored anesthesia care. Endoscopy will be performed with visualization on a monitor and recording on a digital recorder. After the patient demonstrates snoring and obstruction collapse, the patient will receive the study medication (neostigmine methylsulfate 1mg/mL) into the soft palate.</description>

    <intervention_name>Neostigmine Methylsulfate</intervention_name>
    <description>After the patient demonstrates snoring and obstruction collapse, the patient will receive the study medication (neostigmine methylsulfate 1mg/mL) into the soft palate with co-administration of intravenous glycopyrrolate 0.2mg. At each of 5 injection sites on the soft palate , 0.5 mL (0.5mg) of neostigmine methylsulfate will be administered, yielding a total of 2.5mg (2.5mL) of neostigmine methylsulfate. The medication will be administered using five 1 mL syringes filled with 0.5 mL neostigmine each. Following administration of neostigmine, the patient will be observed for an additional 4 minutes to examine both vibration and sound emanating from the soft palate. The anticipated time under sedation will be 14 minutes.</description>
