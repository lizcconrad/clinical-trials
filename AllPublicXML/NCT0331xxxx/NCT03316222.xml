  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, open-label dose escalation study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of GNS561 in patients with advanced malignancies including
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled, repeat-dose Phase 1/2a study designed to
      evaluate the safety profile and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of GNS561 in
      patients with advanced malignancies such as HCC. This study will enroll approximately 50
      patients and consists of 2 parts: Phase 1(dose escalation) and Phase 2 (continuation). All
      patients will be treated until the occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity, disease
      progression, or withdrawal of consent. In this study a treatment cycle is defined as 4 weeks
      (28 days). Patients are to take their assigned dose of GNS561, at the same time each Monday,
      Wednesday and Friday following a meal.
