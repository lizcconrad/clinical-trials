      The investigators are doing this research study to find out the effect of T6 Dermatomal
      Electrical Stimulation (delivered by a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
      unit) on stomach motor activity.

    <description>During this TENS unit stimulation arm, subjects will have a narrow tube (about the diameter of a telephone cord) placed into the subjects small intestine by the study physician and trained technician. The technician will use a small amount of fluoroscopy (radiation) to make sure the tube is placed in the proper position. About one hour after the tube has been placed subjects will be given a breakfast meal. The narrow tube (GDM) will take pressure readings after being placed. After four hours, subjects will again be given a second meal. Fifteen minutes of electrical stimulation will be given to subjects fifteen minutes before ingestion of lunch. After ingestion of lunch, 60 minutes of the electrical stimulation will be applied. When the test is done, the tube will be removed.</description>

    <description>During this no TENS unit stimulation arm, subjects will have a narrow tube (about the diameter of a telephone cord) placed into the subjects small intestine by the study physician and trained technician. The technician will use a small amount of fluoroscopy (radiation) to make sure the tube is placed in the proper position. About one hour after the tube has been placed subjects will be given a breakfast meal. The narrow tube (GDM) will record stomach pressure readings after being placed. After four hours, subjects will again be given a second meal. The TENS unit stimulation will be placed but no electrical stimulation will be given. When the test is done, the tube will be removed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy volunteers with BMI â‰¤34.99 kg/m^2 residing within 125 miles of Mayo Clinic in
             Rochester, MN; these will be healthy individuals with no unstable psychiatric disease
             and not currently on treatment for cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             renal, hematological, neurological, or endocrine (other than hyperglycemia on diet)
             disorders.

          2. Women of childbearing potential will be using an effective form of contraception, and
             have negative pregnancy tests within 48 hours of the test day.

          3. Subjects must have the ability to provide informed consent before any trial-related
             activities.

          4. Eligible individuals will be asked to avoid taking additional medications and
             supplements for one week before and after the test day, unless reviewed and approved
             by the study team.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Abdominal surgery other than appendectomy, Caesarian section or tubal ligation.

          2. Positive history of chronic gastrointestinal diseases, systemic disease that could
             affect gastrointestinal motility, or use of medications that may alter
             gastrointestinal motility.

          3. Positive history of spinal cord injury and/or chronic back pain.

          4. Significant untreated psychiatric dysfunction based upon screening with the Hospital
             Anxiety and Depression Inventory (HAD). If such a dysfunction is identified by a HAD
             score &gt;11 on either Anxiety or Depression or difficulties with substance or eating
             disorders, the participant will be excluded and given a referral letter to his/her
             primary care doctor for further appraisal and follow-up.

          5. Intake of medication, whether prescribed or over the counter (except multivitamins),
             within 7 days of the study. Exceptions are birth control pill, estrogen replacement
             therapy, thyroxine replacement therapy, low dose analgesia or anti-inflammatory
             medications (Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen) and any medication administered for
             co-morbidities as long as they do not alter gastrointestinal motility.

          6. Subjects may also be excluded from participation for other factors at the discretion
             of the principal investigator.
