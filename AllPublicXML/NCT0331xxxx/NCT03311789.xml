  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase I/II trial in biliary tract cancer (BTC) patients. The purpose of
      this trial is to evaluate the safety and effect of PD-1 inhibitor in combination with
      gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic BTCs.

      The primary objective: 6-month progression free survival (PFS). The second objectives:
      objective clinical response(according to RECIST version 1.1), safety, symptom control and
      quality of life (QoL) (according to EORTC QoL C30 and BIL 21), overall survival. The
      exploratory objectives: assessment of immunological response (cytokines, lymphocyte
      phenotype, immunoglobulins), and evaluation of pathological, immunological and clinical
      predictive factors for response/toxicity.
