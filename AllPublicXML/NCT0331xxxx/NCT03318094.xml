  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand the contribution of sympathetic
      vasoconstriction to impaired insulin-mediated vasodilation and subsequently insulin-mediated
      glucose uptake. The investigators will test the hypothesis that removal of sympathetic
      vasoconstriction can result in improvement in insulin-mediated vasodilation and subsequently
      sensitivity to insulin-mediated glucose uptake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that obese subjects have impaired Nitric Oxide (NO)-mediated
      dilation; and those who develop insulin resistance tend to be more obese, have higher insulin
      levels and greater sympathetic activity. Furthermore, we have made the novel observation that
      autonomic blockade improves glucose utilization in obese subjects with insulin resistance,
      providing a causal relation between sympathetic activation and insulin resistance. The
      autonomic blockade also improved NO-mediated dilation in obese subjects, which may improve
      glucose uptake by promoting glucose delivery.

      The investigators will enroll obese insulin-resistant subjects and in parallel experiments
      two comparator groups: obese insulin sensitive subjects, and healthy lean control subjects.
      We will assess the effects of insulin (hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) on microvascular
      recruitment, and forearm glucose uptake on two separate occasions randomly assigned and at
      least one month apart, during an intrabrachial infusion of the alpha-adrenergic blocker
      phentolamine (blocked day) or saline control (Control day).

    <description>The Primary Outcome will be the change in CEU induced by insulin during hyperinsulinemic clamp compared to baseline. To test the null hypothesis that insulin will not produce any changes in microvascular blood volume using CEU in response to Î±-adrenergic blockade (phentolamine) in the isolated forearm model.</description>
