  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and, tolerabilitytolerance, pharmacokinetices
      and immunogenicity of escalating single doses and subsequent multiple dose of Gentuximab
      Injection in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors and to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose（MTD） and dose limiting toxicities（DLT）.with single and subsequent
      multiple intravenous infusion in patients with late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors and
      to provide a basis for the protocol design of later clinical trials.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and
      immunogenicity, and tumor response of multiple dose of Gentuximab Injection in patients with
      late recurrence of metastatic solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety profile of Gentuximab Injection will be explored together with the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumour response to treatment with Gentuximab Injection
      to recommend the dosing regimen for further clinical studies. The pharmacokinetic properties
      of Gentuximab Injection will be evaluated after single and multiple dose administrations at
      different dose levels.

SD was neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameter since treatment started.</description>

    <description>Patients are assigned to a dose level at the time of study entry and scheduled to receive i.v. of a single dose. The patient enter the subsequent multiple dose i.v. in a 7-day cycle if no DLT in 21 days after the first dose. The study period of each subject will be up to 4 cycles until the tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD will be determined by assessing DLT in each cohort from cohort 1 to 6, using a 3+3 dose escalation model. Cohort A begin at 4mg/kg IV and the dose escalated in separate cohorts from 8mg/kg IV, 12mg/kg IV，16mg/kg IV and 20mg/kg IV. If there is no DLT observe in any of these 3 patients in 7 weeks, then the trial proceeds to enroll 3 patients into the next higher dose cohort. If one subject develops a DLT at a specific cohort, an additional 3 patients are enrolled into that same dose cohort. Development of DLTs in more than 1 of 6 patients in a specific dose cohort suggests that the MTD has been exceeded, and further dose escalation is not pursued.</description>
