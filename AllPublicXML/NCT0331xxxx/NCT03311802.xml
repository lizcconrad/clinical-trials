    <textblock>
      This was a cross-sectional investigation conducted from December 2015 to July 2017, in 15
      selected rural villages of 2 districts of Vientiane municipality, Lao PDR. Target population
      was interested people, both men and women of age range between 30 to 70 years, living in the
      selected community. Someone diagnosed with diabetes and/or using any anti-diabetic drug was
      excluded.

      The study protocol initiated with the interview on demographic and behavior information with
      each participant, followed by physical exam and blood pressure measurement.

      Fasting glucose were measured.

      All participants were invited to meet with the researcher.

      Demographic data comprises of age, gender, family history of diabetes including parents and
      sibling, female with history of having baby weighing more than 4 kg, gestational diabetes,
      and history or current of dyslipidemia (triglycerides &gt;150 mg/dl, LDL-C â‰¥ 100 mg/dl, HDL-c &lt;
      35 mg/dl), and behavior data were smoking habit, physical inactivity (less than 150 min/week
      or 3 day/week) were collected by interview.

      After that each participant was appointed for blood pressure measurement. Body mass index was
      computed from body weight (kg) divided by body height (m2) using the weight and height scale.

      Waist Circumference was measured at the midpoint between the superior border of iliac crest
      and the lowest rib using measuring tape with the subject in the position of standing relax
      and in underclothes

      Hip circumference is measured at the level of maximal gluteal protrusion

      Blood pressure (BP) value was done with the participants, after 5 minutes relaxing, sitting
      up right with their upper arm positioned at heart level and measured by Omron blood pressure
      monitor.

      Fasting Plasma Glucose was utilized to identify an individual who is normal, has either
      pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. Venous blood samples were collected 5 ml from
      antecubital vein into the test tube
