  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A range of devices has been developed to administer inhaled therapy for asthma, including dry
      powder inhaler (DPI) devices. ELLIPTA is a DPI that is preloaded with a drug therapy to treat
      asthmatic subjects. The objective of this study is to revise ease of use items developed for
      adults to be appropriate for completion by pediatric subjects in future clinical trials and
      to evaluate the newly developed items in subjects with asthma aged 5 to 11 years and their
      caregivers. This is a cross-sectional, qualitative study that will involve pediatric subjects
      with asthma who are currently using an asthma maintenance inhaler and their caregivers. Two
      rounds of repetitive cognitive interviews will be conducted with 16 subjects in each
      interview set. Each interview will last approximately 45 minutes. Data provided by pediatric
      subjects and their caregivers during interview will be collected as field notes and audio
      recordings which will be transcribed.
