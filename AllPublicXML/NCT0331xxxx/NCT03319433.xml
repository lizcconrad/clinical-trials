  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia for caesarean section is invariably associated with variable degree of
      hypotension. Hypotension that occurs may be detrimental to various organ system due to
      inadequate perfusion. Various methods and agents have been tried in order to address this
      problem. However, this calamity is far from over.

      Perfusion index is one such attempt to address the problem of hypotension by predicting which
      group of parturient may develop hypotension. This is a type of non-invasive method of
      assessing the relative vascular tone with the use of pulse oximeter which calculates the
      ration of pulsatile versus the non-pulsatile component of the blood flow. During normal
      physiological changes in pregnancy, there is relative loss of vascular tone which predisposes
      this group of patient to sudden development of hypotension after the sympathetic block due to
      spinal anesthesia.

      Thus, the aim of the study is to use the non-invasive perfusion index data to predict the
      occurrence of hypotension in a parturient so that helps us to guide fluid and other drug
      therapy to address the problem of hypotension.
