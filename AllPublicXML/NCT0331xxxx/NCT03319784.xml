  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients will be identified in the clinic with rotator cuff tendonitis or a low-grade
      partial-thickness tear of the rotator cuff that are either insulin-dependent or
      insulin-independent diabetics. Patients will be informed about the current prospective study
      and written consent will be obtained. Patient information about kidney function, current
      diabetic medication type, dose and frequency will be obtained in clinic. If there is a
      diagnosed kidney function abnormality, the patient will be excluded from the study. Patients
      will be asked about their most recent HbA1C. If HbA1C has not been checked within the past 3
      months, the patient will have HbA1C checked in the lab either same day as the injection or
      the following day. Patients will be randomized into two patient groups: Toradol (Ketorolac)
      injection group (n=30) and or Steroid injection group (n=30). The randomization will be done
      using an online randomization tool: http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm.

      Patients assigned to Toradol group will receive 60mg of Toradol (Ketorolac) mixed with 8mL of
      1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000. Those assigned to Steroid group will receive 80mg of
      Kenalog (Triamcinolone Acetonide) mixed with 8mL of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:100,000.

      Patients will be blinded to the kind of injection they receive, but the physicians who
      perform the injection will not be blinded for the medical record purposes. The injection will
      be done under ultrasound guidance to the subacromial space. Continuous blood glucose
      measurement will be started in an hour within the injection. An instructional session about
      continuous glucose monitoring will be given to the patients by our research team immediately
      following the injection. The blood glucose levels will be monitored for 1 week following the
      injection. The data will be collected on the patient's return to clinic in 2 weeks. Pain
      score based on a visual analog scale will be obtained prior to injection, 5 min, 3 days, 1
      week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after injection. Shoulder range of
      motion, patient satisfaction, QuickDash score, and ASES survey score will be measured in
      clinic 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injection.

      Day 1: Patient will be seen in the clinic. Patient will be provided information about the
      study, consented and recruited to the study. Obtain pre-injection HbA1c. If no previous
      HbA1c, obtain a new one on the following day in the morning Injection will be administered to
      the patient. Pain score will be obtained prior to injection and 5 min after injection. Blood
      glucose measurement will be started in an hour of the injection and will last for one week
      after the injection.

      Day 3: Patients will be contacted by phone for pain score.

      1 Week: Patients will be contacted by phone for pain score. 2 Weeks: Patient will be seen at
      clinic for a follow up and for pain score. 4 Weeks: Patient will be seen at clinic for pain
      score and for range of motion, QuickDASH, and ASES scores.

      6 Weeks: Patients will be contacted by phone for pain score. 8 Weeks: Patient will be seen at
      clinic for pain score and for range of motion, QuickDASH, and ASES scores.

      12 Weeks: Patient will be seen at clinic for pain score and for range of motion, QuickDASH,
      and ASES scores.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood glucose level</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants' blood glucose will be measured 5 minutes after injection and three times daily for one week following injection; Alternatively, using Continuous Glucose Monitoring sensors, blood glucose will be monitored for 1 week following injection.</time_frame>
    <description>The peak and average glucose levels, and duration of the increase will be used as the surrogates of the primary outcome. The peak and average glucose levels will both share the same unit of measure (mg/dL). The duration of the increase will measure the number of hours that the patient experienced an increasing level of glucose.</description>

    <description>Pain scores will be measured using the Visual Analog Scale. Scale: 0 - 10 0 - No pain; 5- Moderate pain; 10 - Extreme pain Lower values = better outcome No subscales will be used</description>

    <measure>QuickDASH</measure>
    <time_frame>QuickDash score will be measured in clinic 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injection.</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH is a shortened version of the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) Outcome Measure. Instead of 30 items, the QuickDASH uses 11 items to measure physical function and symptoms in people with any or multiple musculoskeletal disorders of the upper limb.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) Shoulder Score</measure>
    <time_frame>ASES survey score will be measured in clinic 4, 8, and 12 weeks after injection.</time_frame>
    <description>The ASES questionnaire is composed of both a physician-rated component and a patient-reported component. The patient questions focus on joint pain, instability, and activities of daily living.
For this study, we will not be using the physician-rated questionnaire and no subscales will be used.
ASES Patient-rated questionnaire
Total of 100 maximum points (Weighted 50% for pain and 50% for function) -Higher the score, better the outcome
Pain portion:
-The final pain score (maximum 50 points) is calculated by subtracting the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from 10 and multiplying by five.
Functional portion:
10 questions rated on a 4-point ordinal scale (from 0-3)
Maximum of 30 points. The raw score is multiplied by 5/3 to make the maximal functional score out of 50 possible points. The pain and functional portions are then summed to obtain the final ASES score.</description>
