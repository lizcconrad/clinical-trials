      The investigators aim to improve adherence to follow-up recommendations for an abnormal Pap
      and effectively reduce disparities in cervical cancer risk and disease among rural and
      low-income urban women.

7 questions asking the following
Was the patient navigator helpful (yes with comments/no)
What could the navigator done better (multiple choice and area to add comments)
Did you use any of the resources the navigator told you about (yes with comments/no)
Would you recommend this type of helper to a family member or friend (yes/no)
Were there parts you didn't like or didn't find helpful (yes with comments/no)
Do you think the patient navigator helped you get to your clinic appointments (yes/no)
If available, would you find it helpful to talk to the patient navigator more (yes/no)</description>

    <description>In Phase 1 of the study (first five months), the investigators will enroll new patients when they call them to remind them of their first colposcopy appointment. If patients consent, the investigators also will assess their basic needs during the call. Those who screen positive for at least one unmet basic need, will be referred to the 2-1-1 helpline at their clinic visit (or this information will be sent to them if they miss their clinic visit).
All women enrolled in our study will be asked to complete our basic needs survey and take a follow-up survey at the time of their first colposcopy visit.
For patients in phase 1, the follow-up survey will only assess acceptability of the basic needs survey (five questions)</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>-In Phase 2 of the study (second five months), new colposcopy patients will be approached and consented in a similar fashion as in Phase 1 and asked to complete the basic needs survey. However, this time, patients who screen positive with at least one unmet basic need will be offered assistance by a life navigator (a trained case manager) who will contact the patients by phone within 2 business days of completing the survey.
The life navigator will connect patients with community resources in each area to help with their unmet basic needs.
All women enrolled in our study will be asked to complete our basic needs survey and take a follow-up survey at the time of their first colposcopy visit.
Patients enrolled in phase 2 will be asked the same five questions in addition to seven more assessing perceived effectiveness of the life navigator</description>

    <description>The life navigator will contact women identified with unmet basic needs within two business days of completing the baseline survey.
The life navigator in our study will: (1) identify and assess women's needs; (2) jointly generate solutions to address the needs; (3) develop plans to carry out the solutions, including; (4) help prioritize among multiple needs; (5) identify community resources that could help solve the problem; (6) determine eligibility for services; (7) help women access available resources by scheduling appointments and provide appointment reminders; (8) prepare women to interact with service agencies and/or act as an advocate on their behalf; (9) provide instrumental support such as arranging transportation; (10) actively intervene to resolve barriers to basic needs solutions; (11) oversee follow-up of problem solving actions; and (12) review progress made towards resolving unmet basic needs and adapt solutions accordingly.</description>
