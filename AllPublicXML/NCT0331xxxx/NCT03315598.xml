  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment in the
      patients with the following neuropathic pain related syndrome.

        -  Postherpetic neuralgia

        -  Failed back surgery syndrome

        -  Diabetic neuropathy

        -  other peripheral neuropathy

      Patients with refractory neuropathic pain who do not respond to conservative treatment for
      more than 3 months should be included. Acupuncture treatment is maintained for 2 months in
      oriental medicine hospital. The effect is evaluated through the numeric rating score and the
      validated questionnaire.

    <measure>Change from baseline Numeric rating scale pain score (0-10) at 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At 4-week follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) is an 11-point scale from 0 to 10 for patient self-reporting of pain. Change from the baseline NRS pain score at 4 weeks will be noted as percentage (%).</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the score of the short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8-week follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The main component of the SF-MPQ consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe. Three pain scores are derived from the sum of the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors. The SF-MPQ also includes the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) index of the standard MPQ and a visual analogue scale (VAS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline score of Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BFI-SF) at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8-week follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) rapidly assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8-week follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The self-report measure Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) reflects a patient's belief about the efficacy of treatment.
1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change from baseline (the initiation of treatment); 5=minimally worse; 6= much worse; 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>5-pointed patient satisfaction scale</measure>
    <time_frame>At 8-week follow-up visit</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-pointed patient satisfaction scale is an 5-point scale for patient self-reporting of satisfaction with treatment.
Very satisfied
Satisfied
Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied
Dissatisfied
Very dissatisfied</description>

    <description>lectroacupuncture is a form of acupuncture where a small electric current is passed between pairs of acupuncture needles. According to some acupuncturists, this practice augments the use of regular acupuncture, can restore health and well-being, and is particularly good for treating pain.</description>
