  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical investigation will be performed to generate clinical data on clearances and
      removal rates (for ß2-microglobulin, myoglobin, phosphate, creatinine, and urea) as well as
      biocompatibility of the modified polysulfone membrane to obtain CE-certification according to
      the European Medical Device Directive for the FX Coral 600 (TD 16-1) dialyzer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FX Coral (TD 16-1) dialyzer is a new development with a modified polysulfone membrane and
      is not CE marked yet. The purpose of the clinical evaluation is to generate clinical data for
      the CE approval.
