    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate superior accuracy with the Navio ™
      Robotic-assisted Surgical System in achieving desired post-operative mechanical alignment,
      compared to TKA procedures using standard instruments. An additional study purpose is to
      document clinical and patient-reported outcomes in subjects receiving TKA with the Navio ™
      system.

    <textblock>
      Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) has become an effective and reliable treatment for arthritis of
      the knee (1). TKA is associated with low morbidity and mortality, and its effectiveness in
      reducing joint pain and improving range of motion is well established. In 2014, over 750,000
      knee replacements were performed in the US (2).

      A significant innovation in TKA has been the introduction of computer navigation and
      robotic-assisted surgery (3). One such technology is the Navio™ Robotic-assisted Surgical
      System. This system is a semi-autonomous image-free system. During the surgery, the surgeon
      maps the condylar landmarks and determines alignment indices to define the volume and
      orientation of bone to be removed. The tools to remove the bone and place the implants are
      controlled and manipulated by the surgeon with the guidance of a 3-dimensional digital map of
      the surgical surface.

      Originally the Navio™ system was launched for use in unicondylar knee replacement only. To
      date, there have been over 1000 unicondylar knee replacement surgeries using the system. In
      2017, Smith &amp; Nephew Inc. expanded the indications for the Navio™ system to include TKA. The
      purpose of this multicenter, prospective study is to evaluate outcomes associated with this
      new indication.

        To eliminate the potential for selection bias, Investigators should screen all subjects
        undergoing a Navio™ assisted TKA. In order to do so, only the existing information obtained
        per standard routine medical procedures will be used. No study-specific screening
        procedures, activities or questionnaires will be performed during pre-screening.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject requires primary total knee arthroplasty with the Journey II BCS or
             Cruciate-Retraining (CR) Systems due to degenerative joint disease (primary diagnosis
             of osteoarthritis, post-traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis.

          2. Subject was considered skeletally mature at the time of cone implantation (at least 18
             years or older.)

          3. Subject agrees to consent to and to follow the study visit schedule (as defined in the
             study protocol and informed consent form) by signing the IRB/EC approved informed
             consent form.

          4. Subject plans to be available through two (2) years postoperative follow-up.

          2. Subject has condition(s) that may interfere with the TKA survival or outcome (i.e.,
             Paget's or Charcot's disease, vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, uncontrolled
             diabetes, moderate to severe renal insufficiency or neuromuscular disease, or an
