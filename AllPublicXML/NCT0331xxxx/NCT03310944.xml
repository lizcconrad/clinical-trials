      Primary Objective:

      To assess the relative bioavailability of sotagliflozin following single doses of 3
      sotagliflozin prototype tablet formulations p1, p2 and p3 versus the reference tablet
      formulation in fasted conditions in healthy subjects.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetic characteristics of sotagliflozin and its 3-O-glucuronide
           following single doses of 3 sotagliflozin prototype tablet formulations p1, p2 and p3
           and of the reference formulation in fasted conditions in healthy subjects.

        -  To assess the clinical and laboratory safety of single oral doses of 3 sotagliflozin
           prototype tablet formulations p1, p2 and p3 and the reference tablet formulation in
           fasted conditions in healthy subjects.

      Total duration is 37 to 75 days for each subject, with 2 to 21 days screening period; 4
      dosing days, i.e. one in each of the 4 treatment periods. Observation period in each
      treatment period is 6 days. Washout between dosing days is 7 to 10 days. Follow-up visit is
      14-21 days after last dosing.

             and complete physical examination).

          -  Normal vital signs after 10 minutes resting in supine position:

          -  95 mmHg &lt;systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;140 mmHg,

          -  45 mmHg &lt;diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;90 mmHg,

          -  40 bpm &lt;heart rate (HR) &lt;100 bpm.

          -  Standard 12-lead electrocardiogram parameters after 10 minutes resting in supine
             position in the following ranges; 120 ms&lt;PR&lt;220 ms, QRS&lt;120 ms, QTc≤430 ms if male and
             QTc≤450 ms if female with normal electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing unless the
             Investigator considers an ECG tracing abnormality to be not clinically relevant.

          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range, unless the Investigator considers an
             abnormality to be clinically irrelevant for healthy subjects; however serum
             creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
             aminotransferase), and international normalized ratio (INR) should not exceed the
             upper laboratory norm. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should not exceed
             normal control more than 10 seconds. Total bilirubin out of normal range can be
             acceptable if total bilirubin should not exceed 1.5 the upper limit with normal
             conjugated bilirubin values (unless the subject has documented Gilbert syndrome).
