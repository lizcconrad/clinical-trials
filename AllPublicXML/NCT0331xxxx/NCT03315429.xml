  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Chronic heart failure (HF) is frequently accompanied by functional mitral regurgitation (FMR)
      caused by left ventricular (LV) remodeling and subsequent papillary muscle displacement
      resulting in mitral valve (MV) leaflet tethering, dilatation and flattening of the mitral
      annulus and reduced closing forces. Up to moderate FMR affects the majority of patients with
      systolic heart failure - roughly 80% - still independently increasing mortality. Every fifth
      patient with chronic heart failure experiences a progression of FMR during the first three
      years of follow up despite guideline directed heart failure therapy, which is independently
      associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, MR is well known to have a strong dynamic
      component not only during the cardiac cycle at rest and with exercise.

      Aims of the study:

      The investigators therefore aim to assess whether stress tests in patients with functional
      mitral regurgitation unmasks significant dynamic mitral regurgitation or might aid to
      identify patients at risk of FMR progression in patients with functional mitral regurgitation
      in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) under guideline directed medical
      therapy.

      Study design:

      The investigators will prospectively perform stress tests in all patients with non-severe FMR
      that are routinely seen in the heart failure outpatient clinic.

      Study patients:

      Patients with stable chronic heart failure on optimal medical therapy, who undergo routine
      ambulatory clinical control visits in the heart failure outpatient ward of the Medical
      University of Vienna, will be included in the present study. A written informed consent will
      be obtained before inclusion. Inclusion criteria will be a non-severe FMR, an age of at least
      18 years and stable heart failure related medical therapy in the last 3 months.

      Methods:

      All patients that are willing to participate will undergo stress testing (i.e. volume
      challenge and low dose dobutamine stress) to determine whether patients display severe
      dynamic FMR under stress conditions. Within the registry patients will be followed-up during
      routine ambulatory visits for three years. Patients with severe dynamic functional mitral
      regurgitation will be compared to patients without severe dynamic FMR. Record of clinical
      events during the FUP will be performed. Routine laboratory parameters, have been measured at
      inclusion. Additionally, neurohormone patterns will be measured at baseline and at peak
      stress.

      Sample size:

      Expecting a prevalence of severe dynamic FMR of 20%, the investigators would include a total
      of 150 chronic heart failure patients taking also into account a study-dropouts of 20% ( loss
      of follow-up and mortality).
