  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate effects of inhibiting glucocorticoid activation on skin
      function and wound healing in patients with type 2 diabetes. Half of patients will be given a
      drug to inhibit glucocorticoid activation and the other half will be given a placebo.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucocorticoids are known to impair skin function and wound healing which are also
      compromised in patients with type 2 diabetes. The enzyme 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
      type 1 (11β-HSD1) activates glucocorticoids in target tissues including skin. Pre-clinical
      data demonstrate that 11β-HSD1 inhibition improves skin function and wound healing but this
      has not been investigated in man.

      Using the 11β-HSD1 inhibitor AZD4017, we will investigate if

        1. Oral AZD4017 inhibits 11β-HSD1 activity in skin

        2. AZD4017 is safe and well-tolerated in patient with T2DM

        3. Oral AZD4017 regulates skin function

        4. Systemic glucocorticoid levels and skin 11β-HSD1 activity, independently or in
           combination correlate with measures of skin function

      Study feasibility will also be assessed; if successful, data from this pilot study will
      inform power calculations for a future trial to investigate the ability of 11β-HSD1
      inhibition to promote foot ulcer healing in type 2 diabetes.

    <description>AZD4017 is a novel orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of 11β-HSD1 enzyme activity. It is potent and highly selective in vitro and in vivo. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of 11β-HSD1 activity (cortisone to cortisol conversion) is 2nM. AZD4017 is selective (&gt; 2000x) for 11β-HSD1 over human recombinant 11β-HSD2 and the closely-homologous enzymes 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 in vitro.</description>
