  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study to be performed will utilize already FDA-approved marketed products in healthy
      adults for the purpose to generate data for establishing rate of drug delivery of Lidoderm®
      topical patch (manufactured by Endo Pharmaceuticals) and the lidocaine 5% patch (manufactured
      by Mylan Pharmaceuticals) in healthy adults, and to ensure the safety of individuals
      utilizing these types of products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topical drug delivery systems in the form of patches are convenient, attractive, and easy to
      use. Lidocaine is a very popular patch available on the United States market today. Accurate
      determination of the rate and extent of drug release and absorption is crucial to ensure the
      safety of individuals using these and other types of patches. The drug delivery rate can be
      determined early in the development process by using in vitro skin flux permeation studies,
      and later in humans by accurately quantifying residual drug from patches post-wear and in
      pharmacokinetic studies. In this study the investigators will employ two types of evaluation
      to determine the rate and extent of drug release and absorption from lidocaine patches,
      namely residual drug analysis post-wear and pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy adult
      volunteers. In addition, the investigators will compare the serum drug concentrations
      following patch and intravenous administration in order to determine the absolute
      bioavailability of these patches. Positive outcomes of this project will identify appropriate
      methods to determine the rate and extent of drug release and absorption from topical patches,
      and will help regulatory agencies in the development of Guidances for Industry regarding the
      characterization of drug release and absorption kinetics to ensure the safety of individuals
      utilizing these types of products.
