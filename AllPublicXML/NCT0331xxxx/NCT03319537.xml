    <description>If none of the initial cohort of 3 has a dose-limited toxicity the dose level will be escalated. If one has a DLT that dose level will be expanded with 3 more patients. Dose escalation will stop if ≥2 DLTs are seen at a dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of the 6 patients at that level has a DLT. If no patient in the 3-patient cohort has a DLT and the dose level is under final consideration of the MTD, an additional three patients will be treated at that level for confirmation.</description>
