  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the oxidative stress and brain damage biomarkers induced
      by tDCS in patients with AD and to assess the long term neurophysiological and behavioral
      effects after repeated daily tDCS sessions for 10 days. Thirty AD patients diagnosed
      according to 2011 McKhann criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 10 real anodal tDCS
      or sham at 2mA intensity for 20 minutes per session daily. All patients will be evaluated at
      baseline, at the end of the sessions and 1, 2, and 3 months later with neurophysiological and
      behavioral examination.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the oxidative stress and brain damage biomarkers induced
      by tDCS in patients with AD and to assess the long term neurophysiological and behavioral
      effects after repeated daily tDCS sessions for 10 days. Thirty AD patients diagnosed
      according to 2011 McKhann criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 10 real anodal tDCS
      or sham at 2mA intensity for 20 minutes per session daily. Patients were classified into two
      groups using closed envelope. One group will receive 10 sessions real tdcs and other group
      will receive sham tdcs.

      The study will be a double-blind, placebo controlled, within subject, parallel design.

      tDCS will be delivered bilaterally by a constant current electrical stimulator connected to a
      pair of sponge electrodes. The investigators will use a non-cephalic reference electrode for
      tDCS: stimulating electrode will be placed over the left temporo-parietal lobe for 20 minutes
      and then over the right temporoparietal lobe for another 20 minutes in AD patients, while the
      reference electrode will be placed over the right deltoid muscle. The stimulating current
      will be anodal DC at 2 mA intensity delivered for 20 minutes per session for 10 days. All
      patients will be evaluated at baseline, at the end of the treatment and 1 and 2,and 3months
      later with neuropsychological and behavioural examination.
