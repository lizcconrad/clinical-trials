      Pilot test the novel educational patient-directed intervention to demonstrate the feasibility
      of the novel educational approaches developed in improving patient's willingness to achieve
      remission or low disease activity in RA. Upon agreement to participate, the patient
      participants will provide information on their treating physician. This information will be
      used to invite physicians to complete the physician-educational intervention and offered CME
      credits for completing the activity.

      The investigators will recruit participants from a patient registry (1:1 intervention:
      control) that meet the eligibility criteria. The recruited patients will complete the
      educational intervention (if randomized to the intervention arm) and the study outcomes will
      be collected immediately after the intervention and also after the patients most proximate
      rheumatologist visit (up to 6-months later).

    <description>Name of Scale: Choice predisposition scale The scale measures the willingness to change medication. The scale is a 11-point likert type scale that is scored from not willing at all (minimum) to extremely willing (maximum) with an unsure option (neutral).
Higher scores (closer to the maximum) indicate a willingness to change medication and desire to further improve their RA disease activity.</description>
