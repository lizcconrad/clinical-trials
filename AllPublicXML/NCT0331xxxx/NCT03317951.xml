  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally and represent a major
      economic burden on health care systems. The investigators have developed a novel integrated
      care concept (NICC) which combines telemedicine with intensive support by a call center, an
      integrated care network including in- and outpatient care providers and guideline therapy for
      patients with heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) or therapy resistant hypertension
      (TRH). The aim of the study is to show that NICC is preferable over guideline therapy alone.
      The investigators aim at including approximately 2930 patients who are either inpatients or
      referred to the outpatient clinic of the participating hospitals by their treating physician.
      The study will thus inform care providers whether quality of care can be improved by an
      integrated care concept providing telemedicine through a 24/7 call center approach.

      Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally and represent a
      major economic burden on health care systems. Positive effects of disease management programs
      have been shown for patients with heart failure (HF). Remote monitoring and telemonitoring
      with active intervention are beneficial in atrial fibrillation (AF) and therapy resistant
      hypertension (TRH), respectively. For these patients, the investigators have developed a
      novel integrated care concept (NICC) which combines telemedicine with intensive support by a
      call center, an integrated care network including in- and outpatient care providers and
      guideline therapy for patients.

      Methods: The aim of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of NICC over guideline
      therapy alone. The trial is designed as open-label bi-center parallel-group design with two
      groups. Patients will be included if they are either inpatients or if they are referred to
      the outpatient clinic of the hospitals by their treating physician. Randomization will be
      done individually with stratification by cardiovascular disease (AF, HF, TRH), center and
      admission type. Primary endpoints are based on the 1-year observation period after
      randomization. The first primary endpoint is the composite endpoint consisting of mortality,
      stroke and myocardial infarction. The number of hospitalizations form the second primary
      endpoint. The third primary endpoint is identical to the first primary endpoint plus cardiac
      decompensation. Adjustments for multiple testing are done using a fall back strategy.
      Secondary endpoints include patient adherence, health care costs, quality of life and safety.
      A sample size of 2930 gives 80% power at the two-sided 2.5% test-level for the first primary
      endpoint. The power for the second primary endpoint is 99.8% at this sample size, and it is
      80% with 1086 patients.

      Discussion: This study will inform care providers whether quality of care can be improved by
      an integrated care concept providing telemedicine through a 24/7 call center approach. We
      expect that cost of the NICC will be lower than standard care because of reduced
      hospitalizations. If the study has a positive result, NICC is planned to be immediately
      rolled out in the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. The trial will also guide additional
      research to disentangle the effects of this complex intervention.

    <description>The care center is at the heart of the NICC structure. It will be available 24/7. It is the core platform to share information for all NICC patients in the care process and serves as integration point between the professional groups. The care center is utilizing the NICC platform for care coordination and patient monitoring. The NICC platform enables patient management from the distance and allows treating physicians to observe and follow the health status of patients daily. Using the NICC tablet, patients provide information from home about their health status. They will receive feedback about their therapy, measurements and reminders and motivation to follow care plans. The communication allows for a regular evaluation of the patient's situation, a review of the therapy and coordination of necessary adjustments with care providers. The general intervention rules are based on the current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for treating AF, HF and TRH patients.</description>
