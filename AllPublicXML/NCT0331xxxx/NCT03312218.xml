  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spaced education is a promising theory-driven strategy to improve clinical competence. Our
      aim is to improve the clinical competence of Family Physicians, an outcome associated with
      the quality of care delivered to Canadians.

      Research Question: Among family medicine residents, does enhanced feedback through an app
      providing alerts and test questions (spaced education), compared to the same app without
      alerts and enhanced feedback (no spaced education), improve competence as measured by the
      certification examination? In building this proposal for a definitive trial, the
      investigators have support from coast to coast. In addition to key clinician educators, the
      team includes knowledge users from the organization responsible for the certification
      examination in Family Medicine, methodologists and experienced researchers who study how
      mobile apps can promote engagement with clinical information. The team has the right blend of
      expertise in medical education and cluster randomized trials.

      Approach and Methods: The investigators will follow an organizational participatory research
      approach, and propose a cluster randomized controlled trial. Setting: All incoming family
      medicine residents in Canada will be eligible to participate. Intervention site residents
      will receive alerts through an app to adaptively reinforce the learning of clinical content
      based on cases and test questions (spaced education). Residents in the control group will
      receive the same app providing identical clinical cases and test questions-on-demand, but
      with alerts inactivated (no spaced education). The primary outcome will be scores on the
      certification examination. This routinely collected data will be provided to the team by the
      College of Family Physicians of Canada.

      Expected Results and Conclusion: Spaced education will improve examination scores. This will
      inform educational practice by providing evidence to optimize the training of residents.
