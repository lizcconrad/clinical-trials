  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. An FDA-mandated
      reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes might reduce the health burden of tobacco by
      reducing the prevalence of smoking. The proposed project will test the impact of nicotine
      reduction on smoking behavior and smoke exposure in a setting where participants are
      restricted from using their usual brand cigarettes.

      Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. An FDA-mandated
      reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettes might reduce the health burden of tobacco by
      reducing the prevalence of smoking. The proposed project will test the impact of nicotine
      reduction on smoking behavior and smoke exposure in a setting where participants are
      restricted from using their usual brand cigarettes.Smokers will be confined to a hotel for
      two hotel stays (five days/ four nights each) during which they will only have access to the
      investigational cigarettes provided to them. The nicotine content of the investigational
      cigarettes may differ between the two weeks. Participants will enter the hotel in groups of
      10 and everyone in a given stay will receive the same investigational cigarette. The first
      aim will assess measures of smoke and nicotine exposure including urinary cotinine and
      expired carbon monoxide. The second aim will assess behavioral measures of smoking including
      cigarettes smoked per day and puff topography.
