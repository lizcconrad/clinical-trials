      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of vibro-oscillatory therapy through an electromedical
      equipment in improving body contour and appearance of cellulite.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective and comparative longitudinal clinical study will be
      performed in 30 women with cellulitis. Patients will be submitted to data collection and
      evaluation and before and after vibration-oscillatory therapy.

      HYPOTHESES: Patients are expected to show improvement in body contour and cellulite after
      vibration-oscillatory therapy.

      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A descriptive analysis will be done before and after
      vibration-oscillatory therapy, with frequency tables for categorical and descriptive
      variables (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values) for continuous or
      numerical variables. In order to compare the main variables between the groups and the
      collection times, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures will be used.
      Tukey's test will be used to compare the groups. The significance level adopted for the
      statistical tests will be 5% or p &lt;0.05.

      After approval by the institutional committee of Research Ethics, the subjects will be
      approached by the researcher responsible on the day of their evaluation, where they completed
      the registration form, after a brief analysis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the
      present study, the individuals included in the study will be collection of anthropometric
      data: weight, height, BMI, perimeter of the treated region, assessment of the degree of
      gynoid lipodystrophy, clinical inspection and photographic study of the treated area,
      ultrasound examination to assess the thickness of the dermis and hypodermis and the
      examination with Cutometer ® to assess the viscoelasticity of the skin.

      Patients will be divided according to the degree of cellulite they present and will be
      treated with vibration therapy, such as the Modellata® electromedical equipment (Ibramed-
      Brazilian Industry of Electronic Equipment), being performed three times a week for two
      months totaling 16 sessions by a dermato-functional physiotherapist.

      Data collection and evaluation will be performed before and after treatment.
