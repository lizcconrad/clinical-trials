  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 2-arm open-label, randomized comparative phase II study in each of two
      separate cohorts (non-squamous NSCLC and squamous NSCLC) according to histology.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive four cycles of standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Upon
      confirmation of response or tumor stabilization, patients will be registered and allocated
      into two cohorts based on the tumor histology and each cohort will be randomized into two
      arms. The experimental arm will receive combination of durvalumab + tremelimumab, the other
      arm is according to standard of care.

      The objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a maintenance approach with the
      combination immunotherapy with durvalumab + tremelimumab improves progression-free survival
      (PFS) compared to standard of care in patients with advanced NSCLC. Each cohort is powered
      separately based on PFS.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For inclusion in the study, patients should fulfill the following criteria

               -  Histological diagnosis of NSCLC; for non-squamous NSCLC: no known sensitizing
                  EGFR-mutation, no known EML4-ALK translocation. When a patient with non-squamous
                  NSCLC has a KRAS mutation, further testing for EGFR and EML4-ALK is not
                  necessary. For squamous NSCLC, EGFR and EML4-ALK testing is not necessary.

               -  Availability of adequate in quality and quantity archived tumor material for IHC
                  PD-L1 testing; (Preferably 15 but 8 mandatory slides or block of tumor tissue
                  will be collected);

               -  Stage IIIB or IIIC not eligible for radical treatment or stage IV according to
                  TNM8 (Ref. 6);

               -  Brain metastases should be treated with local therapy (stereotactic radiotherapy
                  or whole brain radiotherapy), and patients should be asymptomatic, without
                  treatment with steroids for four weeks before enrollment. Before enrollment, new
                  brain imaging (contrast-CT or gadolinium-MRI) is needed to demonstrate that there
                  is no progression in the brain when the last brain imaging is more than four
                  weeks earlier. Screening for brain metastases is not necessary in patients that
                  were previously not diagnosed with brain metastases and that are without signs
                  indicative of brain metastases.

               -  â‰¥ 18 years of age at time of study entry;

               -  Evaluable disease with CT or MRI according to RECIST 1.1 (except for patients
                  with a CR after 4 cycles of platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, these patients
                  are also eligible);

               -  Stable disease or response by RECIST criteria response after 4 cycles of
                  platinum-based doublet chemotherapy;

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) â‰¥ 1.5 x 109/L (&gt; 1500 per mm3)

               -  Platelet count â‰¥ 100 x 109/L (&gt;100,000 per mm3)

               -  Serum bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not
                  apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent
                  hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis
                  or hepatic pathology)AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) â‰¤ 2.5 x institutional upper limit of
                  normal; for patients with liver metastases â‰¤ 5 x institutional upper limit of

               -  Measured or calculated creatinine clearance â‰¥45 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault
                  formula (Appendix E)

               -  Haemoglobin â‰¥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Patient with following autoimmune or inflammatory disorders are eligible:

               -  Vitiligo or alopecia

               -  Hypothyroidism (eg, following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement

               -  Any chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy

               -  Active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation
                  with the study investigator

               -  Celiac disease controlled by diet alone

               -  Patient with history of another primary malignancy are eligible in the following
                  cases:

               -  Malignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease â‰¥5 years
                  before the first dose of IP and of low potential risk for recurrence

               -  Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence
                  of disease

               -  Adequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease

               -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy
                  test within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment.

        Note: women of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal females capable of
        becoming pregnant (i.e. females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months,
        with the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy). However, women who have been
        amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if
        the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body weight,
        ovarian suppression or other reasons.

          -  Patients of childbearing / reproductive potential should use adequate birth control
             measures, as defined by the investigator, during the study treatment period and from
             screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy or 180 days after
             the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination. A highly effective method of
             birth control is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate (i.e. less
             than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Such methods include:

          -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with
             inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal)

          -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,
             injectable, implantable)

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)

          -  Bilateral tubal occlusion

          -  Vasectomized partner

          -  Sexual abstinence (the reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in
             relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle
             of the patient)

          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first
             dose of study treatment, from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab
             monotherapy or 180 days after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination
             therapy or pemetrexed.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study
             including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations including follow
             up;

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations.
