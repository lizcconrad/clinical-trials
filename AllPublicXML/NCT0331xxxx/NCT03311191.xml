  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study aims to determine if there are differences in oxygen consumption between
      chronically sun exposed and less sun exposed skin. This study uses a new imaging device that
      can detection oxygenation properties skin in a non-invasive manner.

    <textblock>
      Sun and ultraviolet light exposure has both short term and long term effects on skin. While
      the short term effects, such as sunburn, are understood, chronic long-term sun exposure can
      cause changes to the skin that are not well characterized. One particular alteration may be
      how the skin consumes oxygen, a change that may be linked to biochemical alterations that
      have been observed in past studies. Measuring skin oxygen consumption has traditionally been
      difficult as the tools available have not been easy to incorporate into clinical studies. In
      this study, we overcome this barrier through the use of a new non-invasive oxygen-sensing
      device that can rapidly measure skin oxygenation properties such as oxygen consumption. This
      observational study will measure the oxygenation properties of both chronically sun exposed
      and less sun exposed skin in the predefined groups of both young and older men and women.

        The study is designed to gather data from two different age groups of men and women to
        evaluate the differences in skin oxygen properties, if any, between chronically sun exposed
        and less sun exposed skin. This study makes use of an oxygen sensing bandage device that
        can quantitatively measure both tissue oxygen partial pressure and oxygen consumption rate.
        Due to its early stage in development, the device has not yet been designed to control for
        high melanin content of skin. Thus only subjects with lower melanin content (i.e.
        Fitzpatrick skin types I - IV) will be included in the study. In addition, tattoo markings,
        scarring or significant natural discolorations can interfere with the imaging results by
        absorbing blue light and subjects with any of these will be excluded.
