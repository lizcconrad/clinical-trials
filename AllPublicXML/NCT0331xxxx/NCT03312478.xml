      Primary Objective:

      To measure the association between a parental history of diabetes and the odds of an
      offspring being Type 1 diabetics.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To document the profile of Type 1 diabetes patients.

        -  To document the glycemic parameters (Fasting blood glucose [FBG] and glycosylated
           hemoglobin [HbA1c]) of Type 1 diabetes.

        -  To capture the current therapeutic management.

      The overall duration of this study is expected to be 12 months. The recruitment period for a
      given center will be four months following site initiation of that center. telephonic
      follow-up for all the patients shall be conducted after 15 days ± 5 days.

      *Each patient (cases as well as controls) will be required to undergo laboratory tests for
      insulin autoantibodies and hemoglobin A1c tests. Both the tests will be conducted through
      centralized laboratories for all recruited patients.

      Since the result of insulin auto-antibodies test is one of the inclusion criteria, it is
      mandatory for all patients to undergo this test, and detailed information for the same has
      been included in the informed consent form.
