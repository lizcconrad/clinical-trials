  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamics is a comprehensive study of the lower urinary tract. Although the information
      obtained from urodynamics answers several questions and assists in guiding therapies for
      patients, the testing environments is unnatural and may be distressing for patients. This may
      impact the results of the study, as it is not uncommon for patients to be unable to void for
      the test due to their distress. Often to alleviate the distress, music or soothing noises are
      used in the background. The study aims to identify simple environmental factors which may
      improve patient experience with urodynamic testing. The population will include patients with
      existing appointments for urodynamics testing at the Mayo Urology Clinic. The investigators
      plan to assess patient satisfaction and comfort during this assessment using a visual analog
      scale questionnaire. The environmental variables will include music of the patients'
      preference, the sound of running water, or no background noise at all. By asking patients to
      complete a questionnaire, The investigators will be able to assess ways to improve patient
      comfort in a commonly used urologic assessment.
