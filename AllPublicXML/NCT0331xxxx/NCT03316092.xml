    <textblock>
      Oral Hydoxychloroquine is a very popular medication widely used by patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and other diseases. Ocular side effects of this
      medication are very serious and causes loss of central vision. In most patients these side
      effects are dose related, cumulative. This means that the risk of side effects would increase
      in all patients with continued use of the medication. In few people use of the medication
      would not be recommended if they have some bilateral macular problems. This is because the
      side effects of this medication does cause serious degredation of the macula in both eyes.

      The ocular side effects of Hydroxychloroquine has been known for long time. Due to the
      seriousness of these side effects all possible efforts were done to prevent them. Preventing
      these side effects would ideally need prior screening of all patients who are to use oral
      Hydroxychloroquine. If patients are not screened prior to oral Hydroxychloroquine use they
      should be examined as soon as possible after starting this medication. Advances in
      technology, specifically the advent of optical coherence tomography, made screening and
      monitoring for Hydroxychloroquine toxicity much more easier and reliable meantime.
