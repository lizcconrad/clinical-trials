  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to obtain a blood sample from patients with actinic keratoses
      undergoing routine Photodynamic Therapy, in order to measure biomarkers that are relevant to
      VitD and 5FU metabolism and might be predictive of PDT outcome. The biomarkers to be examined
      include serum VitD levels at the time of PDT, and the presence/absence of gene alleles that
      correlate with expression of several proteins involved in VitD and 5FU metabolism. The
      presence of these biomarkers will be correlated to the improvement in AK lesion counts at the
      patient's routine follow-up visit 3 months after PDT treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have been scheduled to receive PDT in our noninvasive cutaneous oncology clinics
      will be given written information prior to their visit, including a copy of the Informed
      Consent (IC) that describes the purpose of the study. If the patient indicates that he/she is
      interested, the physician or study nurse will review the IC with the patient on the day of
      PDT and answer all questions. After the patient signs the IC, the patient will have their
      blood drawn by a caregiver who has completed PTS Phlebotomy Training.

      DNA samples will be stored in a locked minus 80 degree ultrafreezer, in Dr. Maytin's
      laboratory (room ND4-25A in the Lerner Research Institute). The samples will be maintained
      for up to 10 years.

      Blood sample tubes and data sheets in the laboratory will be labeled with a code consisting
      of the first 5 digits of the patient's 8-digit MRN along with the date that the phlebotomy
      was performed (i.e. the date of the blood draw). This should ensure anonymity of the data
      while preventing mistakes when linking the laboratory results to the correct patient. Study
      personnel with password-protected access to the database registry will use the code to
      unequivocally identify the subject's file within the Oracle database and thereby enter the
      subject's laboratory results into the proper data field.

      The Informed Consent document informs the subject that he/she can withdraw permission for use
      of their samples at any time, and explains how to do this by contacting the Principal
      Investigator (PI) in writing.

      Information will not be disclosed to third party outside of Cleveland Clinic for research
      purposes.

      Blood samples will be collected on the date of Photodynamic Therapy. A total of 13.5mL of
      blood will be collected between 2 tubes (3.5mL gold top tube and a 10 mL lavendar top
      Vacutainer tube with EDTA). The biomarkers to be examined include serum VitD levels at the
      time of PDT, and the presence/absence of gene alleles that correlate with expression of
      several proteins involved in VitD and 5FU metabolism.

        The desired population for this study is 100 patients who have at least 10 nonhypertrophic
        actinic keratosis lesions present on the face, scalp, forearms, chest, or legs and are
        scheduled to receive Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) at the Cleveland Clinic noninvasive
        cutaneous oncology clinic.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females, at least 18 years of age

          -  Patient has nonhypertrophic actinic keratosis, at least 10 AK lesions present on the
             face, scalp, forearms, chest, or legs at the time of PDT treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:
