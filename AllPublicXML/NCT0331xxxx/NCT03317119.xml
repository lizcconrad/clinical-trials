    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of trametinib and TAS-102 in
      treating patients with colon or rectal cancer that has spread to other places in the body or
      cannot be removed by surgery. Trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as TAS-102, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving trametinib and TAS-102 may
      prevent cancer cells from dividing and work better in treating patients with colon and rectal
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of trametinib and
      trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 (TAS-102) in patients with
      chemotherapy-resistant metastatic colorectal cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the safety of the combination of trametinib and TAS-102 across all investigated
      dose levels.

      II. Describe the clinical activity including objective response rate (ORR), progression-free
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the combination in an expansion cohort using
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination agent TAS-102 orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) on days 1-5 and 8-12 and trametinib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then bi-annually
      thereafter.
