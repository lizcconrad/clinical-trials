  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental study will evaluate the effect of corticision on accelerating the leveling
      and alignment of lower crowded incisors compared with the control untreated group using cone
      beam computed tomography.

      The study sample will consist of 26 patients with less than 6 mm crowding. The sample will be
      allocated randomly into two experimental groups.

      The brackets and passive SS wire will be applied with radiographic metal guides between each
      tooth to allow for accurate corticision site 2 mm below the gingival papilla and to prevent
      tooth roots injury. The dentoalveolar changes occurring after leveling and alignment of lower
      anterior teeth will be evaluated using CBCT radiographs, Frequency, degree of root
      resorption, and the incidence of bone dehiscence will be assessed in relation to initial
      situation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crowding is the most common form of malocclusion. Different methods have been used to resolve
      crowding, including extraction and nonextraction. Corticision is an important methods to
      accelerate tooth movement in crowded cases. Cortical bone incision without flap elevation
      enhances turnover rate of surrounding structures and decreases the time for leveling and
      alignment. In orthodontics, CBCT imaging has been applied to evaluate impacted teeth and root
      resorption. But the data are very rare regarding the application of CBCT in tooth movement.
      So CBCT will be used in this research to evaluate the amount of external apical root
      resorption (EARR) and presence of dehiscence in the lower anterior teeth in the crowded
      cases. Furthermore, the duration of alignment will be compared between corticision group and
      non-corticision group.
