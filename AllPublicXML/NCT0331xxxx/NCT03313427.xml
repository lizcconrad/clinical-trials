  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that early physical therapy intervention, initiated during
      the NICU stay and up to 2 months corrected age, based on the family-centered model, could
      promote preterm infants motor development in short-term (2 months corrected age) and
      long-term (8 months corrected age).

      There is a high evidence level of different systematic reviews, which support the effectivity
      of early intervention with preterm infants.

      The principal aim of this randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of
      early physiotherapy intervention to promote motor development in preterm infants at 2 and 8
      months corrected age.

      The secondary purpose is to study the motor development of those preterm infants who received
      early physical therapy intervention.

    <description>At the UCIN:
Parental education to empower them on motor development and parent-infant relationship. Consisted on 6 sessions during the first weeks at the NICU.
Tactile and kinaesthetic stimulation managed by parents. 2 times a day, 15 minutes each, during 10 days.
At home:
Psychomotor Development Program for the baby; comprised of different exercises, in different phases, depending on child maturation stage. Started after hospital discharge until 2 months corrected age.</description>
