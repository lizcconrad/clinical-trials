      It is estimated that &gt; 200 million patients in the world undergo surgery each year of which
      approximately 10 million will suffer from a myocardial injury in the perioperative period.
      Mortality is high in patients with myocardial injury since it often goes undiagnosed and
      management is unclear. In contrast to myocardial infarction diagnosed in the emergency room
      (non-surgical patient) where treatment is well established today, patients suffering from a
      perioperative myocardial injury have a poorer outcome. Additionally, the patho-physiology of
      myocardial injury is unknown in the individual patient, non-invasive diagnostic tools are not
      widely available and treatment remains unknown.

      Most cases of myocardial injury in Non-cardiac surgery (MINS) are seen within the first 48-72
      h after surgery and a majority have no symptoms. Many patients developing MINS are &lt; 65 years
      old and non-diabetics, an age group that usually does not have coronary artery disease. A
      elevated Troponin T (TnT) without symptoms or ECG changes, typically occurring in the
      perioperative period, is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality. Surgical trauma also
      causes an increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines, which together with sympathetic
      over-activity and platelet activation, leads to a hyper-coagulant state, and in turn may
      cause coronary thrombosis. It is possible that some cases of MINS also result from oxygen
      supply-delivery mismatch. To our knowledge, no study has investigated the cause of MINS in
      patients presenting with increased TnT in the perioperative period. Our aim is therefore to
      investigate patients having MINS in order to better understand its aetiology and subsequently
      develop focused strategies to reduce risks.

      Introduction:

      It is estimated that &gt; 200 million patients in the world undergo surgery each year of which
      approximately 10 million would suffer from a myocardial injury in the perioperative period.
      Mortality is high in this group of patients since it often goes undiagnosed, the
      patho-physiology of myocardial injury is unclear, non-invasive diagnostic tools are not
      widely available and treatment is unknown.

      Multiple studies have shown that &gt; 10% of patients &gt; 65 years and undergoing non-cardiac
      surgery have an increase in Troponin T (TnT). In the POISE study including 8331 patients, the
      authors found that 5.7% of the placebo group suffered from a myocardial injury within the
      30-day postoperative period. In the recently published data from the VISION study including &gt;
      15,000 patients, the authors demonstrated that patients with peak perioperative TnT values of
      &lt; 0.01, 0.02, 0.03-0.29 and &gt; 0.30 ng/L had a 30-day mortality of 1%, 4%, 9.3% and 16.9%
      respectively. Furthermore, an elevated TnT without symptoms or ECG changes are an independent
      predictor of 30-day mortality. It is possible that some cases of myocardial injury in
      Non-cardiac surgery (MINS) result from oxygen supply-delivery mismatch due to severe
      perioperative hypotension, and possibly persistent tachycardia but coronary artery thrombosis
      cannot be excluded in these patients. It is well known that surgical trauma causes an
      increase in several pro-inflammatory cytokines which, together with sympathetic
      over-activity, leads to a hypercoagulable state due to platelet activation, and a
      predisposition to thrombosis. In one study, it was found that approximately 1/3 of the
      patients had evidence of intracoronary thrombosis at autopsy.

      Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary artery (MINCA) has recently received
      greater attention in the literature. The underlying patho-physiology responsible for MINCA
      revealed the presence of a typical myocardial infarct on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
      in only 24% of patients, with myocarditis occurring in 33% and no significant abnormality in
      26%. A rare cause of MINCA is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also called stress cardiomyopathy.
      Recently, coronary angiography using computerized tomographic angiography (CTA) has added a
      new dimension to the diagnostic armamentarium available to the clinician. Using advanced
      imaging techniques and low radiation, it is today possible to determine quite accurately
      coronary artery anatomy and thereby determine stenotic lesions in the coronary vasculature.
      Echocardiography can be easily performed by an experienced technician, the images stored
      digitally and evaluated subsequently by specialists. The availability of continuous
      perioperative monitoring of several hemodynamic indices as well as regular blood gas
      analysis, may enable determination of oxygen demand-supply mismatch.

      Methods:

      This is a case-control study in patients undergoing major, non-cardiac surgery. Permission
      will be obtained from the Ethics committee prior to patient recruitment and Good Clinical
      Practice guidelines will be followed in all patients. Verbal and written informed consent
      will be obtained from all patients willing to participate in the study. The study will be
      registered in an international database before start of patient recruitment. Patients would
      be assessed for inclusion in the preoperative anaesthetic clinic and a detailed preoperative
      history taken and examination performed to exclude myocardial ischemia or heart failure. The
      following laboratory tests would be performed preoperatively (baseline values): routine
      bloods, creatinine, urea, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), C-reacting proteins
      (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, TnT, N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-pro
      BNP), lipid profile, 12-lead EKG and echocardiography (ECHO).

      Anaesthesia and Surgery The surgical and anaesthetic techniques would be determined by
      physicians responsible for the patient and according to established hospital routines and
      practices. Patient records would be used for the determination of adverse events according to
      a standardized protocol. Patient characteristics, pre-operative risk factors, laboratory data
      and follow-up data would be obtained from medical records. Prophylaxis against deep vein
      thrombosis, surgical infections and fluid and electrolyte balance would also follow hospital
      practice. All included patients would be admitted to the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU)
      overnight, and longer if deemed necessary by the attending Anaesthesiologist. Patients would
      be continuously haemodynamically monitored and anaesthesia records would be maintained for
      independent assessment by a blinded reviewer. Hs-TnT would be repeated in all patients at 24,
      48 and 72 h postoperatively. Plasma NT-pro BNP would be re-assessed at 24 h. A 12-lead EKG
      would be recorded in all patients with elevated high-sensitivity TnT (hs-TnT) at the time of
      first occurrence and 48 h later. Platelet function tests, microparticles as well as
      coagulation tests would be performed periodically in the perioperative period. Further
      laboratory tests would be performed as needed at the discretion of the attending physician.

      Coronary artery angiography would be performed within 5 days of detecting a rise in TnT in
      the study population as well as the control group. The amount of calcium in the vessel wall
      can be automatically quantified and the plaque can be evaluated as calcified, non-calcified
      or of mixed composition. The amount of calcium in the vessel wall can be automatically
      quantified and the plaque can be evaluated as calcified, non-calcified or of mixed
      composition. The coronary CTA examinations will be analyzed independently by 2 experienced
      readers who are blinded to all clinical information.

      Echocardiography: Protocolized ECHO would be performed 24 h after detection of raised TnT in
      the study group, and at corresponding time period in a matched group of controls. The ECHO
      will be recorded and subsequently interpreted by a blinded experienced clinical
      physiologist/cardiologist to determine wall motion abnormalities and systolic and diastolic
      function.

      When deemed necessary by the attending Cardiologist, the following may also be performed:

      Conventional invasive coronary angiography: This will only be done at the discretion of the
      attending Cardiologist and in agreement with the patient and surgeon at an appropriate time
      point after surgery, if deemed necessary.

      The control group will be matched for age, sex and co-morbidities described in the revised
      cardiac risk score (myocardial ischemia, cardiac failure, stroke, diabetes mellitus, renal
      insufficiency and major-risk surgery) (ref) and grouped into &lt; 3 risk factors and &gt;/= 3 risk
      factors.
