      Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a Ving Tsun (VT) reactive balance training programme
      on reactive balance control, muscle strength, balance confidence and falls in
      community-dwelling older adults.

      Hypothesis: The VT group subjects will have improved post-training reactive balance control,
      muscle strength, balance confidence and fall incidence outcomes than the active controls.

      Design and subjects: In this prospective, randomised, single-blinded controlled trial,
      approximately 114 healthy seniors (55-70 years old) will be randomly assigned to either the
      VT group (n~57) or control group (n~57). Interventions: Subjects in the VT group will receive
      VT reactive balance training (3 hours/week) for 3 months, whereas subjects in the control
      group will receive no VT training but will jog 3 hours/week during the intervention period.

      Study instruments and outcomes: Primary outcome measures: reactive balance control, as
      indicated by lower extremity muscle activation onset latency; hip and ankle strategies and
      centre of pressure movements will be measured by electromyography, electrogoniometry and a
      force platform, respectively. Secondary outcome measures: knee muscle strength, balance
      confidence and fall history will be assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer,
      Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (Chinese) and interviews, respectively (pre-,
      post- and follow-up measurements).

      Data analysis: Data will be analysed using repeated-measures analysis of (co)variance
      followed by post-hoc tests, as appropriate (alpha = 0.05).

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the effects of a Ving Tsun (VT) martial exercise programme on reactive balance
      control, lower limb muscle strength, balance confidence and falls in community-dwelling older
      adults.

      Study design:

      This will be a prospective, non-randomised and controlled intervention trial.

      Subjects:

      Approximately 40 healthy older adults will be recruited from elderly community centres by
      convenience sampling through poster advertising. Eligible subjects will be allocated to
      either the VT group (n ≈ 20) or control group (n ≈ 20).

      Outcome measurements:

      All subjects will be assessed before the intervention (baseline tests) and shortly after the
      3-month intervention (post-tests). All subjects, regardless of group assignment, will undergo
      the following baseline tests and post-tests in random order.

      Primary outcome measures Reactive balance control including lower extremity muscle activation
      onset latency and centre of pressure movement in standing.

      Secondary outcome measures Lower extremity (knee) muscle strength, balance confidence and
      fall history.

      Data analysis:

      Data will be analysed using repeated-measures analysis of (co)variance followed by post-hoc
      tests, as appropriate (alpha = 0.05).

The mean of the total item score (0-100) will be used for analysis. Higher scores indicate better balance confidence.</description>

    <description>The VT training regimen is designed to improve reactive balance control, lower extremity muscle strength and balance confidence in the elderly. It comprises 9 VT sticking-hand drills that must be practised with a partner. Participants will be trained to respond rapidly to upper body perturbations and to maintain body balance. Those joined the VT training group will attend a one-hour supervised VT training session at an elderly community centre 2 times per week for 12 weeks.</description>
