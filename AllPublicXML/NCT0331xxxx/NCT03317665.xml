      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of hernia recurrence with the use of
      biologic and prosthetic mesh in ventral hernia repair.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incisional hernias are very common, leading to over 380,000 operative repairs done annually.
      Despite the commonality of this problem, there has been no single operative repair that has
      become the standard. This is due to the high recurrence rates with all types of repairs,
      especially primary suture repair. Because of this, most repairs are done with some type of
      mesh, either made out of a prosthetic material or biologic material. Mesh repairs, however,
      have their own problems, namely surgical site infections and potential bowel erosion.
      Potential complications associated with prosthetic mesh for hernia repairs include: adverse
      reactions to the mesh, mesh erosion, stricture formation, adhesions resulting in bowel
      obstruction, enterocutaneous fistulas, injuries to nearby organs, nerves or blood vessels,
      infection, chronic pain and hernia recurrence. Potential complications associated with
      biological mesh include: adverse inflammatory response, laxity, eventration, and recurrent
      herniation. To address these mesh related complications, the separation of components
      technique was developed to reduce tension on the midline repair and the underlay technique
      was developed to place the mesh in the retrorectus space. Nevertheless, this technique still
      has a significant recurrence rate.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of biological or
      prosthetic mesh in incisional hernia repair, by assessing the associated rates of hernia
      recurrence and complications.
