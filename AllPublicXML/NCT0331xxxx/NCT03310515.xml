  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies to assess the effectiveness of interventions to prevent HIV infection depend upon
      robust estimates of Baseline HIV incidence rates. The changing landscape of high-risk
      populations, as well as the evolution of biomedical pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
      interventions, requires a contemporary evaluation of HIV incidence as well as demographic,
      behavioral and other subject factors which may impact HIV incidence. This is a prospective
      cohort study to measure HIV-1 seroincidence in a study population of HIV-1 uninfected Chinese
      men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) who are at high-risk of HIV
      infection. Approximately 550 subjects who are male sex at birth and have sex with men shall
      enter the study, which will allow for a 10% drop out rate to maintain 500 subjects at the
      conclusion of the cohort. This is a single arm cohort study to determine HIV-1 seroincidence
      rates in high risk MSM and TGW when combined with a comprehensive prevention package
      including HIV and safe sex counseling, provision of condoms and water-based lubricant, and
      sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and referral for treatment. It will be
      determined what proportion of high-risk MSM and TGW who are given a comprehensive HIV-1
      prevention package will acquire HIV-1 infection.
