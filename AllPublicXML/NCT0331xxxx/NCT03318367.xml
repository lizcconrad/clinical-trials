    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies a virtual reality education module in reducing anxiety and
      increasing knowledge in patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy. A virtual
      reality education module may be useful in helping patients understand what they can expect to
      happen during their radiation treatments and help reduce stress relating to the radiation
      treatments.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if a virtual reality education module for prostate cancer patients is
      effective in increasing patient comprehension and decreasing patient anxiety related to
      radiation treatments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. This pilot study could have implications for a broader patient base undergoing radiation
      therapy.
