  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TFOA) is highly prevalent in older adults, and often causes
      symptoms and functional limitations. Physical activity is widely advocated in people with
      TFOA, and running is an easy and accessible activity that provides many benefits on general
      health. However, running induces high knee loads, which could potentially contribute to
      symptoms of runners with TFOA. Previous studies have suggested that running gait
      modifications can help in decreasing symptoms and knee loading in runners with knee
      conditions. Yet, no study has been conducted in runners with TFOA. This intervention study
      will investigate the effects of a 4-week running gait retraining program on symptoms and
      running biomechanics in runners with TFOA. We hypothesize that running modifications will
      decrease symptoms, improve function and reduce knee loading.

    <description>Over a 4-week period, runners will be asked to increase their step rate to reduce knee loading during running. Specifically, they will have to increase their preferred step rate by 10% during weekly laboratory running sessions as well as during habitual running training. In the laboratory, runners will be provided with live visual/auditory biofeedback on step rate and asked to target a specific value representing 110% or preferred step rate. During their individual running sessions, runners will be wearing a GPS-enabled watch that will provide feedback on live step rate, and they will be asked to maintain the same value as in the laboratory.</description>
