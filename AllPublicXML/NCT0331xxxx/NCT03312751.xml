  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to expand the knowledge on the efficacy and safety of emapalumab
      (previously known as NI-0501) as a treatment for primary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
      (HLH) patients, with special focus on long-term outcome and quality of life assessments.
      Emapalumab can be administered as the first-line therapy, to patients not previously treated
      with the current standard of care, or can be given to patients who have either failed or were
      unable to tolerate the available standard of care.

      Emapalumab is to be administered until the start of conditioning, with an anticipated
      duration ranging from a minimum of 4 weeks to approximately 12 weeks and not exceeding 6
      months.

      After treatment completion, patients will continue in the study for long-term follow-up until
      1 year after either HSCT or last emapalumab infusion (if HSCT is not performed).
