      First-in-human, Phase 1b safety study of the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) XMT-1536
      administered as an intravenous infusion once every three weeks. Patients with tumor types
      likely to express NaPi2b will be enrolled. In addition to safety assessments, the
      pharmacokinetics of the drug will be assessed along with ADC activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study of XMT-1536 in patients with tumors likely to express NaPi2b,
      focusing on patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and non-squamous non-small cell
      lung cancer. XMT-1536 will be administered as an intravenous infusion once every three weeks.
      The study consists of two segments: dose escalation (DES) and expansion (EXP). The DES
      segment will study small groups of patients who receive increased doses. A Safety Review
      Committee will be established to review the data from each dose level before moving to the
      next higher dose. Dose escalation will stop when a patient or patients experience 2 or more
      dose-limiting events. At this point, the maximum tolerated dose or recommended Phase 2 dose
      will be established and the EXP segment will begin. This segment consists of 3 parallel
      cohorts of patients to confirm the MTD or RP2D and estimate the objective response rate in
      each selected patient population. All adverse events will be graded according to the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria version (CTCAE v4.03). Throughout the
      study, pharmacokinetics will be measured using proprietary assays developed by Mersana. ADC
      activity will be measured via RECIST.
