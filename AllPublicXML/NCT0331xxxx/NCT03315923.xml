  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare annualized relapse rate, expanded disability status
      scale, Gad-enhanced brain lesions, and side effects after administration of rituximab and
      glatiramer acetate among patients with active progressive multiple sclerosis during a one
      year follow up through a randomized clinical trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinative disease of central
      nervous system. Active progressive MS means progressive accumulation of disability which is
      also associated with clinical relapses and/or new/enlarged Gad-enhanced brain lesions. This
      form of the disease leads to high rates of morbidity and mortality among patients. Different
      immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents are recommended by researchers to decrease
      relapses and improve disability among MS patients. The effect of these medications on
      different phenotypes of MS are mostly investigated solely and very small number of
      comparative studies are conducted to evaluate the superiority of these medications on each
      other.

      Glatiramer acetate is one of the known MS medications which is being used to control relapses
      from a long time ago and different clinical trials have shown its partial efficacy among MS
      patients. On the other hand, rituximab is one of the medications which is recently suggested
      for treatment of MS and currently phase II clinical trials are conducted to evaluate the
      efficacy of this medication among patients. As previously stated, there is a lack of clinical
      trials to compare the efficacy of suggested medications among progressive patients. To fill
      this gap, we aimed to compare the efficacy of these two medications on annualized relapse
      rate, disability, and Gad-enhanced brain lesions among patients with active progressive MS
      through a randomized clinical trial during a one-year follow-up period.

    <measure>Disability measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>expanded disability status scale will be measured in the baseline and after 12 months of intervention. This scale measures the disability of patients with a score, ranging from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death due to MS). This score is assigned to the patient by the neurologist and after neurological examination. The patient will be given a score in this scale according to the observed disability. The scores will be compared at the end of study.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive 1g of rituximab in 500 cc normal saline serum through intravenous infusion for two times, with two weeks interval, which is assumed as one treatment course. The treatment course will be repeated in 6 months. Along with rituximab, 100 mg methylprednisolone, 10 mg chlorpheniramine, and 500 mg acetaminophen will also be injected to decrease side effects of rituximab.</description>
