  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes implementation science principles to culturally adapt a pre-existing
      web-based application (WebApp) for use with college students. The ADAPT-ITT process will be
      utilized to adapt the WebApp to a diverse (race, ethnicity, gender/sexual identity) college
      population with a focus on life skills and holistic self-care as reinforcement to currently
      available primary prevention programming available to incoming students. The study hypothesis
      is that the adapted WebApp will be usable, acceptable, and students will be willing to use it
      as a reinforcement to current university primary prevention programming. The study team will
      also monitor retention of participants over the academic year.

    <measure>3-Month Usability</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item System Usability Scale will be used to evaluate the usability of WebApp in the intervention group only. The System Usability Scale (Brook, 1996) includes 10 items that are rated from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). To get a final score the: 1) First, one is subtracted from the score of the odd items; 2) Second, the responses are subtracted from 5 for the even-numbered items; 3) Then the responses are summed and multiplied by 2.5 to get a range of 0-100. A score above 68 is considered above average.</description>

    <description>The 5-item System Acceptability Scale (investigator created) will be used to evaluate the acceptability of the WebApp in the intervention group only. An investigator-created acceptability scale with 5-items will be used to measure acceptability. Four items are scored from 1 (Strongly Agree/Very Likely) to 5 (Strongly Disagree/Very Unlikely) and one item assess the frequency of use of the WebApp from 1 (Never) to 5 (Multiple times a week). Each item will be evaluated individually and no total score will be computed.</description>

    <measure>3-Month Sexual Violence Victimization</measure>
    <time_frame>3-months</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Sexual Experiences Survey will be used to measure participants' experiences of sexual violence victimization. The revised Sexual Experiences Survey - Short Form Victimization (Koss et al., 2007) includes 10 items that are used to assess the frequency of seven victimization behaviors and then uses three questions to explore the sex of the perpetrator and if the participant believes they were raped. We will be items 1-7 to assess the number of times an individual has experienced victimization over the last 3 months from 0 to 3+ times. The results will be scored as a percentage of participants who have experienced each individual behavior and the percentage who report that they have experienced a rape.</description>

    <description>Fifteen items from the Relationship Control sub-scale of the Sexual Relationship Power Scale will be used to measure power dynamics within participants' sexual relationships at 3-months. The Relationship Control Sub-scale Items (Pulerwitz, Gortmaker, &amp; DeJong, 2000) are scored from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 4 (Strongly Disagree).

    <description>The 22-item modified Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance scale will be used to measure attitudes endorsing rape myths at 3-months. The modified Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (McMahon &amp; Farmer, 2011) is scored from 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). It includes four sub-scales (She asked for it, He didn't mean to, It wasn't really rape, and She lied). The items in each sub-scale can be summed for a total score and the the scores for the entire scale can be summed for a cumulative score. Higher scores indicate greater rejection of rape myths.</description>
