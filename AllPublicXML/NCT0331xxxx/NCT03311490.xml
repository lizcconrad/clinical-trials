    <textblock>
      This pilot study will establish the preliminary effect and safety of using Spraino® to
      prevent lateral ankle sprains amongst athletes competing in indoor sports at sub-elite level,
      with a one-year follow-up.

      All recruited participants will have a history of lateral ankle sprain in the preceding 24
      months prior to the initiation of the trial. Half of the included participants will receive
      Spraino® to prevent lateral ankle sprains (intervention group). The other half will receive
      no intervention (&quot;do-as-usual&quot; control group). Both groups will be permitted to continue or
      initiate any usual care of their choice, except Spraino® in the control group. Short Message
      Services (SMS) will be used for registration of injury and exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory trial (named &quot;The Spraino Pilot Trial&quot;) is to establish the
      preliminary effect and safety of using Spraino® to prevent lateral ankle sprains amongst
      athletes competing in indoor sports at sub-elite level (handball, basketball, floorball and
      badminton) when compared to a &quot;do-as-usual&quot; control group.

      It is a randomized controlled pilot trial (Pilot-RCT) with a two-group parallel design and
      blinded outcome assessment. The trial will include prospective injury and exposure
      registration using a Short Message Services-system (SMS-Track) throughout a 52-week follow-up
      period (one calendar year).

      It is anticipated that 500 participants, which approximates to 250 in each group, will be
      enrolled in the trial. The enrollment process will cease when at least 250 participants have
      been allocated to the intervention group. Only athletes participating in indoor sports with a
      history of a lateral ankle sprain in the preceding 24 months are eligible for inclusion in
      the trial. The participants will be randomized (1:1 allocation ratio) using numbered lots.
      The randomization process will ensure stratification for gender, sports discipline and level
      of play.

      A full trial protocol, based on the &quot;SPIRIT 2013 explanation and elaboration: guidance for
      protocols of clinical trials&quot; (Chan et al., 2013) and the &quot;PREPARE Trial guide&quot; (Bandholm et
      al., 2017), will be published and made publicly available. The trial report will adhere to
      the CONSORT 2010 statement, using the extension for randomized pilot and feasibility trials.

      Being an exploratory pilot trial, the study is designed with a flat outcome structure with
      multiple evenly valued outcome measures. Thus, no primary and secondary outcome measure
      hierarchy exists.

    <description>Participants allocated to the intervention group will use Spraino® as a measure to prevent future lateral ankle sprains during all on-court practice sessions and matches. Spraino® is an adhesive polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE or &quot;Teflon&quot;) patch. It is developed with the intent of minimizing lateral shoe- surface friction whenever initial contact is carried out in an inverted position of the ankle joint. Each Spraino® PTFE patch has a minimum durability of 20 hours use and will be provided by the trial sponsor, Spraino® ApS. The participants allocated to the intervention group will receive four pairs of the Spraino® patches via postal service or by hand delivery on a monthly basis, or upon request if material is worn out prematurely during the 52-week trial period.</description>
