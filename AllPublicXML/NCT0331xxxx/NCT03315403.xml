    <description>The number of DNA copies of every study subject with a positive qPCR will be determined. We will determine the optimal cut-off value to distinguish between colonisation and infection by comparing the number of DNA copies of controls with a positive lytA PCR and patients with a pneumococcal pneumonia proven by routine microbiological tests. We will use this cut-off value for outcome measure 1 and determine the amount of patients with aan qPCR proven pneumococcal pneumonia.</description>
