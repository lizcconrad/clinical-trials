  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 3 study is a randomized, double-blinded, comparator controlled, parallel-group,
      multicenter study of aQIV versus the US-licensed 2017-2018 adjuvanted trivalent influenza
      vaccine (aTIV-1, Fluad), and versus an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (aTIV-2),
      containing the alternate B strain.
