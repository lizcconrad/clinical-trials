  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The carotid body is located at the bifurcation of the internal and external carotid arteries.
      It is a chemoreceptor that plays a role in the sympathetic nervous system and in the
      development and maintenance of hypertension. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk
      factor and is associated with coronary artery disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, and
      heart failure.

      The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of a catheter-based
      system to ablate the carotid body and reduce blood pressure (BP) in patients with resistant
      hypertension and to confirm sustainability of the treatment benefits long-term as seen
      following surgical CB removal.

    <intervention_name>Catheter-Based Carotid Body Ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>The Cibiem Transvenous Ultrasound System (CTUS) is a catheter based device delivering ultrasound energy to ablate the carotid body. The procedure is done via a percutaneous insertion of the CTUS and advancement through the femoral vein to the jugular vein in subjects with difficult to control hypertension. The procedure duration is expected to range between 60 to 90 minutes and is performed under fluoroscopic and ultrasound image guidance.</description>
