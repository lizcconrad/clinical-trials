  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1960's, intraoperative administration of opioids is considered a keystone of
      anesthesia as well as hypnotics and muscle relaxants. Synthetic opioids were introduced to
      achieve hemodynamic stability during anesthesia. They allow an inhibition of the sympathetic
      system without cardiovascular collapse and histamine release. Since then, anesthesia has
      changed from inhalation to multimodal anesthesia with lower doses of hypnotic. In 2017, the
      intraoperative objectives of hypnosis, hemodynamic stability, immobility and anticipation of
      postoperative analgesia can be achieved without opioids. Moreover, opioid administration
      consequences are neither scarce nor benign for the patient. Perioperative opioids are
      associated with nausea and vomiting, sedation, ileus, confusion/delirium, respiratory
      depression, increased postoperative pain and morphine consumption, immunodepression,
      hyperalgesia and chronic postoperative pain. Among these complications, hypoxemia, ileus and
      confusion/delirium are the most frequent.

      Efficacious multimodal analgesia and anesthesia are the basis of successful fast-track
      surgery. These multidrug regimens aim at decreasing postoperative pain, intra- and
      postoperative opioid requirements, and subsequently, opioid-related adverse effects and to
      fasten recovery. Opioid-free postoperative analgesia has been recommended for more than 10
      years. Opioid-free anesthesia (OFA) is based on the idea that hemodynamic stability can be
      achieved without opioids during anesthesia. OFA is multimodal anesthesia associating
      hypnotics, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, local anesthetics, anti-inflammatory
      drugs and alpha-2 agonists (Dexmedetomidine).

      Proofs of the effect of OFA on reducing opioid-related adverse effects after major or
      intermediate non-cardiac surgery are still scarce. We hypothesized that the reduced opioid
      consumption during and after surgery allowed by OFA compared with standard of care will be
      associated with a reduction of postoperative opioid-related adverse events.
