      Background &amp; Aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of
      cancer-related death in the world. The 5-year recurrent rate of HCC after first curative
      resection is 77%~100%. Laparoscopic repeat liver resection (LRLR) has been shown in small
      retrospective studies to be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent hepatocellular
      carcinoma (rHCC) in selected patients, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been
      increasingly performed for treating recurrent tumors involving the liver after hepatectomy.
      The aim of this study was to compare the short-term and long-term outcome of laparoscopic
      hepatectomy (LH) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of rHCC.
