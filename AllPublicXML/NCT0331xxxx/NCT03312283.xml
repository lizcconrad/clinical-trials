  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double-blind, two-group parallel, positive-controlled clinical
      trial at four centers.

      The primary objective is to assess the initial clinical safety of intravitreal injection of
      QL1205 or Lucentis® in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet-AMD).

      The secondary objective are to assess the initial clinical effectiveness and pharmacokinetic
      characteristics of intravitreal injection of QL1205 or Lucentis® in patients with wet
      age-related macular degeneration (wet-AMD).

      Subjects would sequentially enrolled according to the protocol in one of two cohorts.Subjects
      would receive a single 0.5mg of QL1205 or Lucentis® once a month for three months through
      vitreous injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Sign the informed consent form, and willing to receive follow-up according to the time
             stipulated by the trial;

          2. Aged ≥50 years or ≤80 years, male or female (including the boundary value);

          3. The target eye must meet the following requirements; Has newly occurring or relapsed
             subfoveal and perifoveal active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) lesions secondary
             to AMD; The total area of all types of lesions is ≤30 mm2(the area of 12 optic discs);
             The best corrected visual acuity is 78-19 letters (equivalent to Snellen visual acuity
             of 20/32 to 20/400); No refractive media opacity or myosis affecting fundus
             examination;

          4. The best corrected visual acuity of the subject's non-target eye is ≥19 letters
             (equivalent to Snellen visual acuity of 20/400).

        Note: If the subject's eyes both meet the inclusion criteria, the investigator will
        determines the target eye from a medical point of view.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following eye conditions:

          1. The investigator judges that the target eye is currently suffering or used to suffer
             from non-exudative AMD disease affecting macular detection, or ocular diseases
             affecting central visual acuity (including central venous obstruction, diabetic
             retinopathy, uveitis, vascular striation, pathological myopia, retinal detachment,
             macular hole, etc.);

          2. The target eye's CNV is secondary to diseases other than AMD, such as trauma,
             pathological myopia,etc.;

          3. Either eye has previously received drug treatment for CNV (e.g., Lucentis, Avastin,
             Eylea, Composin, Acaconac, triamcinolone, steroids, etc.)

          4. The target eye has subretinal hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic area is ≥ 50% of the total
             area of the lesion, or the subfoveal bleeding area is ≥ 1 optic disc area;
