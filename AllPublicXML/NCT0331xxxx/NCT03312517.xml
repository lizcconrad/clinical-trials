      Phase IV 3-Way Double-blind, Randomized, Crossover Study to Compare the Awakening Threshold
      Effects (responsivity) of Belsomra 10 mg and 20 mg to Placebo in non-elderly Insomniacs

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an interventional single site study using a double blind, randomized 3-way
      crossover design with Belsomra 10 mg and 20 mg compared to a placebo. The total number of
      enrolled patients proposed is 12. A cross-over design is utilized so participants will be
      exposed to all treatment conditions in a controlled order (Belsomra 10 mg, 20 mg and
      placebo). Both men and women with insomnia will be utilized as the study population to
      improve the generalizability of outcome data. Subjects with other sleep disorders or unstable
      medical/psychiatric disorders will be excluded from the trial. Inclusion criteria will be men
      and women &gt;18 and &lt; 65 years of age.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment sequences using a Latin square design. After
      a subject has qualified for the study, the next sequentially available randomization number
      will be assigned. The subject will be administered study drug corresponding with this
      assigned number.

      During the night of each respective Polysomnography (PSG) assessments, subjects will be
      awoken at the approximate T-max of the active drug (2.5 hrs), with a matching placebo
      condition at the same time point using an identical responsivity protocol for each condition.
      The rationale for this is that t-max represents the time of greatest potential risk for a
      hypnotic in terms of balance, responsivity, and memory. Responsivity will be assessed using
      the Auditory Awakening Threshold test (AAT) and will be measured at 2.5 hours post dose for
      the Belsomra 10 and 20 mg (BEL), and placebo (PBO) conditions. Responsivity will be assessed
      at the approximate time above immediately after 5 minutes of consolidated (without arousals)
      NREM ( Non- rapid eye movement) stage 2 sleep has occurred.
