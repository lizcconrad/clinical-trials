  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a novel approach to assess the use of ultrasound to support the identification of
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on a screening questionnaire, and potentially to
      predict a difficult pediatric airway. The investigators hope to determine if a combination of
      simple bedside clinical tests can be used to identify OSAS in patients who present for
      surgery with clinical signs of OSAS but without a formal polysomnography.
