      Influenza vaccination is indicated for all adults, but the immunogenicity of vaccination has
      not been assessed in all situations. We are conducting a prospective unblinded study of
      influenza vaccine recipients.

    <textblock>
      Influenza vaccination is indicated for all adults, but the immunogenicity of vaccination has
      not been assessed in all situations. In particular, immune responses following influenza
      vaccination have not been studied in the setting of advanced melanoma and in the context of
      various anti-tumor treatments. In this study, we will look at the immune response of subjects
      receiving vaccination.
