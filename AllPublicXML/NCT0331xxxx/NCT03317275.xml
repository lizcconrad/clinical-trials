  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the injection, the facet joints have to be defined according to standard
      radiological techniques (e.g. MRI and physical correlation). Patients are then sent to
      18F-Fluoride-PET/MRI imaging, in order to localize facet joints with increased uptake. Facet
      joints to be injected are again defined according to the location(s) of highest uptake as
      demonstrated by 18F-Fluoride-PET/MRI.

      The defined injection sites before and after PET/MRI are compared. In equal defined injection
      sites, patients are sent for infiltration as scheduled, otherwise patients are randomized
      into two groups.

      One group will undergo facet injection(s) according to the 18F-Fluoride-PET/MRI result, with
      standard injections performed under CT-guidance by the radiology department of the study
      site. The control group will undergo facet injections blinded to the 18F-Fluoride-PET/MRI
      results, but based on current standard clinical practise (MRI and clinical correlation).

      The patients are asked to complete a validated pain and function questionnaire immediately
      before the facet joint injection, at 15 minutes, 1 day, 1 week and 1 month after the
      injection, as performed routinely in our institution.

      The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the value of 18F-Fluoride-PET/MRI
      imaging in patients with low back pain with evidence of painful facet joint arthropathy,
      which would potentially benefit from facet joint injections.
