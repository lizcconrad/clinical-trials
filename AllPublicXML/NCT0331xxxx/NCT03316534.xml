      The specific research questions addressed in the present study are:

        -  to investigate the impact of treatment with low-dose aspirin in HIV-1-infected patients
           treated with ABC and test it would result in decreased in vivo platelet activation and
           platelet hyperreactivity

        -  to investigate if aspirin has the same effects in HIV-infected as in HIV-uninfected
           patients.

      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may reduce the deleterious effects of HIV on the
      cardiovascular system by decreasing viral load and chronic inflammation; however some
      antiretrovirals enhance cardiovascular risk due to direct adverse effects on platelets or the
      endothelium.

      Abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) and tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) are the most widely used
      nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) associations in HAART. ABC has been
      initially considered as one of the most benign antiretroviral drugs due to a better metabolic
      profile than other nucleoside analogues, but since the D.A.D. study reported an association
      between the use of ABC and an increase in cardiovascular risk there has been controversy
      around this drug.

      Clinical evidence suggests that in vivo platelet activation and platelet hyperreactivity
      contribute to adverse cardiovascular events and hyperreactive platelets may transform a
      normal reparative response to a mild arterial injury into an unwanted thrombotic event.

      Aspirin is the cornerstone in the prevention of atherothrombotic events, as it has been shown
      to be effective both in the primary and secondary prevention of MI (6), and its beneficial
      effects likely involve the modulation of inflammatory and immune pathways. But despite
      heightened awareness regarding elevated CVD risk among HIV-infected patients, aspirin or
      others antiplatelet therapy were markedly underprescribed among HIV-infected patients at risk
      for CVD events (7).

      Based on this, the proposed study will assess whether low-dose aspirin, in well-characterized
      HIV-1-infected patients treated with ABC, would result in decreased in vivo platelet
      activation and platelet hyperreactivity. Moreover will be investigate if aspirin will have
      the same effects in HIV-infected as in HIV-uninfected patients.

    <intervention_model_description>HIV subjects (all on ABC therapy) who fulfilled thee admission criteria will be randomized to either of 2 groups (A or B) with 20 subjects each that received placebo or aspirin (100 mg/daily) for two weeks. At the end of the two week period (T15), patients of group A will be switched to placebo, while group B will be switched to aspirin for another 2 weeks (T30).
