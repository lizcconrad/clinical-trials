      The objective of this prospective controlled clinical trial is to compare the esthetic and
      radiographic outcomes following immediate implant placement with or without labial plate
      dehiscence defects using bone augmentation in combination with an absorbable collagen
      membrane. Subjects in need of one implant replacing tooth to be removed in the maxilla within
      region 13-23 are included. Thirty patients are recruited. They are divided into two groups:
      intact labial plate and compromised labial plate. No implant-supported temporary restorations
      are used during the ﬁrst 4 months. After a screw-retained provisional phase of 2 months, a
      ﬁnal impression is taken at implant level and take-in definitive crown. Patients are recalled
      for oral hygiene maintenance and prosthetic controls every 6 months for the entire duration
      of the study.

          -  Missing a single tooth in the maxillary anterior region

          -  Presence of adjacent natural teeth

        Exclusion Criteria:

             depths≥4 mm in combination with bleeding on probing.

          -  Conditions that might lead to a possibly lowered regenerative capacity of the bone,
             for example, osteoporosis and Paget's disease

          -  Pregnant or expecting to be pregnant

          -  History of drug and alcohol abuse

             example, uncontrolled diabetes (defined as HBA1c level&gt;7%)

          -  Radiotherapy in the head and neck area

          -  On certain medications like bisphosphonates or steroids currently or within the past
             three months

          -  Absence of adjacent teeth

          -  Unwillingness to return for the follow-up examination

          -  Smokers (more than 20 cigarettes per day). Subjects smoking &lt;20 cigarettes per day
             were requested to stop smoking before and after surgery
