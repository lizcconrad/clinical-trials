  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme involved in the development and functioning of the
      immune system. Deficiency of ADA results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a fatal
      inherited immune disorder. GSK2696273 is a gene therapy that aims to insert ADA function into
      blood cells and halt or reverse the conditions caused by decreased ADA enzyme levels, such as
      impaired immune function. It is important to consider long term follow-up of patients who
      have received GSK2696273, including evaluation of the risk of insertion near certain genes
      that may lead to unexpected activation of those genes (oncogenesis). The objective of this
      study is to evaluate the use of a new technique to identify where GSK2696273 has become
      inserted in the genetic sequence, and potential implications for patient care. This new
      technique is known as sonication linker mediated polymerase chain reaction (SLiM-PCR) for
      retroviral insertion site (RIS) analysis. The study will recruit at least 15 pediatric or
      adult patients with ADA-SCID who have been treated with GSK2696273, either in previous
      clinical trials or as a registered product. Recruitment for the study may remain open for up
      to 2 years even if 15 subjects are recruited sooner. Study participation will last for up to
      5 years. A total of 5 blood samples will be collected from each subject at approximately
      annual intervals. STRIMVELIS is a trade mark of the GSK group of companies.

    <measure>Mean abundance measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy and precision of SLiM-PCR methodology will be assessed using whole blood samples, taken from subjects treated with GSK2696273, spiked with control insertion site deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The mean abundance will be calculated between subjects at every time point, within subjects over time points and between the same sample within a time point within a subject.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of clone abundance of more than 5 percent</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Abundance of clones in subject's samples will be measured by SLiM-PCR, where abundance estimates will be derived from the number of individual sheared DNA fragments and the number of DNA barcodes in the linker sequences.</description>

    <measure>Shannon diversity index measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Shannon diversity index is an index that is commonly used to characterize species diversity in a community. The diversity of the clones in subject's samples will be determined using Shannon diversity. Shannon diversity index will be summarized using mean and coefficient of variation.</description>

    <description>GSK2696273 is a gene therapy that aims to restore ADA function in hematopoietic cell lineages and prevent the immunological manifestations. GSK2696273 is a cluster of differentiation (CD) 34+ cell enriched dispersion of human bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells for infusion which have been transduced with a retroviral vector containing the human ADA gene.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, pediatric or adult, subjects with ADA-SCID, who have been previously
             treated with GSK2696273.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent or signed informed consent provided by the
             subject's parent or legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of concomitant condition(s) that in the Investigator's opinion makes
             participation in the study unsuitable or may prevent compliance with the protocol
             requirements.

          -  Unlikely to comply with the requirements of the protocol (i.e. attendance for blood
             sampling on an approximately annual basis).

          -  Transportation of viable samples to the European Union (EU) central laboratory from
             the subject's home country is not possible.
