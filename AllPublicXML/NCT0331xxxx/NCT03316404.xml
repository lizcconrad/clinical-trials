      To develop a test to characterize and monitor Multiple Sclerosis (MS) disease status and
      therapy response from a participant's home by analyzing the gene expression from participant
      self-collected blood samples using a novel fingerstick collection kit.

    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that damages the central nervous system
      (CNS) and disrupts communication to and from the brain by attacking the myelin sheath
      surrounding neurons. It impairs control of bodily functions and leads to clinical disability
      as the disease progresses. The worldwide population is estimated at 2.5 million. MS typically
      develops in young adults; primarily women in their early 30s. The etiology of MS is not fully
      understood, but it is noted that the prevalence of MS differs with geography and ethnicity.

      Biomarker signature panels are important tools for monitoring treatment response and
      screening for individuals who are unlikely to benefit from certain therapies. To establish a
      baseline and further characterize gene expression in MS, blood samples from individuals with
      MS will be collected. A rapid blood test to predict a treatment response would be an
      innovative diagnostic product that could aid in identifying individuals that may benefit from
      the targeted therapy. In the long term, such a test could bring significant clinical benefits
      by enabling individualized treatment to better control the disease, unburdening healthcare
      costs, and dramatically improving the management of MS.

      In order to analyze gene expression data from individuals diagnosed with MS, the study will
      collect blood samples and information from up to 1500 subjects for analysis.

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2</arm_group_label>
    <description>Cohort 2 may be conducted at selected clinical sites where MS treatment-na√Øve patients who are entering a new treatment paradigm will be sought. At the clinical site, patients will be qualified, consented, and a small amount (up to 1mL) of blood will be collected. Between approximately 1 week and 6 months of treatment on the new drug, the participant will be sent another blood collection kit for microsample collection and a brief questionnaire at home. A final sample will be collected between 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. Within 6 months of initiating treatment, the site will be asked to provide information regarding the health and treatment status of the participant.</description>
