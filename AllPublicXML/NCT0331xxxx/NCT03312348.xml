  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A variety of different diseases may cause a limp in a child, and in younger children it is
      particularly challenging to isolate the area affected. Children of this age group are unable
      to identify a specific region of pain, so clinical examination and parental interpretation is
      the only method of localising the area of discomfort. Potential problems that may affect
      children include inflammation, fractures, infection, juvenile arthritis or movement in the
      growth plate in the hip, among other diseases. Aside from an obvious source of injury, it is
      challenging for a clinician to distinguish between these different potential causes or the
      area of the problem without repeated visits, non-specific blood tests and the use of x-ray
      imaging: a form of radiation that carries with it a small risk of carcinogenic effect. Once a
      region of the lower limb is identified, an x-ray image of the affected area is often takenÍ¾
      however, it is not possible to image the entire leg, so the importance of the initial
      examination by a clinician is evident. The aim of this research project is to assess the
      potential of high resolution infrared (IR) imaging technology in the identification of a
      focus for the cause of a limping child. The IR camera used for imaging is able to observe an
      entire limb, so the need to localise an area for imaging would be removed. In addition, if
      successful, infrared imaging could reduce the number of children exposed to x-ray radiation
      unnecessarily, whilst stream-lining medical practice by reducing the time to make a diagnosis
      along with unnecessary visits and tests. We aim to explore whether non-invasive IR
      thermographic camera imaging assists with the clinical diagnosis in children presenting with
      an acute limp. This study represents a pilot evaluation as a test of concept.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children age 9 months -16 years old who attend the Emergency Department (ED) of the
             Sheffield Children's Hospital for an acute (less than 48 hours) limp. Inclusion is
             subject to both the patient and carer having read (or being read to in very young
             children) the information sheets and both the patient and carer consenting to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with multiple injuries (e.g. those involved in serious car accidents), or
             those who have difficulty understanding the nature of the study (e.g. non-native
             English speakers, those with disabilities impairing their understanding of the study
             etc.) will be excluded. Patients/carers in whom consent has not been obtained or
             refused will also be excluded.

        Children who attend the ED with safeguarding concerns or in whom child protection
        suspicions arise during the consultation will be excluded. These children have a separate
        assessment process which would be significantly different to the study cohort.
