    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical and molecular effect of daily exposure to low doses of the
      fragrance contact allergen oxidized R-limonene. Three groups of participants are included: 1)
      Patients with a previous positive patch test to oxidized R-Limonene, 2) patients with a
      previous doubtful patch test to oxidized R-limonene and 3) healthy controls with no contact
      allergy to oxidized R-limonene
