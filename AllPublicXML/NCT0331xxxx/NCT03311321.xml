  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The life span of adults with end-stage renal disease is reduced, and cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) accounts for approximately half the deaths among those undergoing hemodialysis (HD).
      Vascular calcification is a key process in the development of atherosclerotic and
      arteriosclerotic CVD, and contributes significantly to the greater mortality rates and CVD
      events in HD patients. Recently, there has been growing interest in the vitamin K-dependent
      matrix Gla protein (MGP) and its role in inhibiting vascular calcification. Animal studies
      have revealed that the vitamin K-dependent protein MGP may reduce the progression of vascular
      calcification, possibly by means of improving vascular function. The relationship between MGP
      and vitamin K lies in the fact that inactive matrix Gla protein requires vitamin K to
      carboxylate it for its activation. Currently, data in HD patients are scant and equivocal on
      the effects of vitamin K supplementation on CVD risk outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this
      8-week randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial is to determine whether
      daily vitamin K supplementation can favorably alter measurements of endothelial function and
      arterial stiffness in HD patients.

Where will the data be made available? The de-identified data will be made available for research purposes only by contacting the principal investigator.
Please explain any limits to data sharing that might be required. Even though the final research data will be stripped of identifiers prior to release for sharing, the investigators believe that there remains the possibility of deductive disclosure of subjects with unusual characteristics. Thus, the principal investigator will make the data available to users only under a data-sharing agreement that provides for: (1) a commitment to using the data only for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and (3) a commitment to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.</ipd_description>
