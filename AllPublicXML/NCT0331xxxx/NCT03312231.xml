    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study in healthy males and non-pregnant
      females 19 years and older that is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and
      immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic 2017 monovalent inactivated influenza A/H7N9 virus vaccine
      (2017 H7N9 IIV) administered at different dosages given with AS03 adjuvant and phosphate
      buffered saline (PBS) diluent, with AS03 adjuvant only, and without adjuvant. Eligible
      subjects will be randomized into 5 study groups, stratified by age. The study will enroll up
      to 420 individuals 19-64 years old and up to 300 individuals who are 65 years old and older.
      Study duration is approximately 16 months with subject participation duration approximately
      13 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety and
      reactogenicity following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered intramuscularly
      at different dosages approximately 21 days apart given with or without AS03 adjuvant; 2) to
      assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut) antibody responses
      following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered intramuscularly at different
      dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without AS03 adjuvant, stratified by age of
      recipient.

      females 19 years and older. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic 2017 monovalent inactivated influenza
      A/H7N9 virus vaccine (2017 H7N9 IIV) administered at different dosages given with or without
      adjuvant. 3.75 mcg of HA per dose will be administered with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
      diluent and AS03 adjuvant, 7.5 mcg and 15 mcg of HA per dose will be administered with AS03
      adjuvant only, and 15 mcg and 45 mcg of HA per dose will be administered without adjuvant.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of 5 study groups, stratified by age. The study
      will enroll up to 420 individuals 19-64 years old and up to 300 individuals who are 65 years
      old and older. The study duration is approximately 16 months with subject participation
      duration approximately 13 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the
      safety and reactogenicity following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered
      intramuscularly at different dosages approximately 21 days apart given with or without AS03
      adjuvant; 2) to assess the serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralizing (Neut)
      antibody responses following receipt of two doses of 2017 H7N9 IIV administered
      intramuscularly at different dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without AS03
      adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient. The secondary objectives are: 1) to assess
      unsolicited non-serious adverse events (AEs) following receipt of two doses of a 2017 H7N9
      IIV administered IM at different dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without AS03
      adjuvant; 2) to assess medically-attended adverse events (MAAEs) including new-onset chronic
      medical conditions (NOCMCs), potentially immune-mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs), and all
      serious adverse events (SAEs) following receipt of two doses of a 2017 H7N9 IIV administered
      IM at different dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without AS03 adjuvant; 3) to
      assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses approximately 7 and 21 days following
      receipt of a single dose, and approximately 7 days following receipt of two doses of 2017
      H7N9 IIV administered IM at different dosages approximately 21 days apart with or without
      AS03 adjuvant, stratified by age of recipient.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 years of age and older, inclusive.

          4. Are in good health. - As determined by medical history and physical examination to
             evaluate acute or currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined
             as those that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the
             assessment of the safety of subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations.
             Chronic medical diagnoses or conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no
             hospitalizations, ER, or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms that need
             medical intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no
             change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of
             deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,
             insurance company, etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same
             class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.
             Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as
             determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will
             not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic
             or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator
             or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
             to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the
             exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria),
             herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted.

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0°F.

          6. Pulse is 47 to 100 bpm, inclusive.

          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive (subjects &lt;65 years of age), 85
             to 160 mmHg, inclusive (subjects = / &gt; 65 years of age).

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive.

          9. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is less than 30 mm per hour.

         10. Women of childbearing potential must use an acceptable contraception method from 30
             days before first study vaccination until 60 days after last study vaccination.

             - Not sterilized via tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, salpingectomy,
             hysterectomy, or successful Essure placement (permanent, non-surgical, non-hormonal
             sterilization) with documented radiological confirmation test at least 90 days after
             the procedure, and still menstruating or &lt;1 year of the last menses if menopausal.

             -- Acceptable contraception includes non-male sexual relationships, abstinence from
             sexual intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with vasectomized
             partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the subject receiving
             the first study vaccination, barrier methods such as condoms or diaphragms with
             spermicide or foam, effective intrauterine devices, NuvaRing, and licensed hormonal
             methods such as implants, injectables, or oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;).

         11. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have an acute illness, as determined by the site principal investigator or appropriate
             sub-investigator, within 72 hours prior to study vaccination.

             - An acute illness which is nearly resolved with only minor residual symptoms
             remaining is allowable if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, the residual symptoms will not interfere with the
             ability to assess safety parameters as required by the protocol.

          2. Have any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, is a contraindication to study
             participation.

             - Including acute or chronic medical disease or condition, defined as persisting for
             at least 90 days, that would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury,
             render the subject unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere
             with the evaluation of responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial.

          3. Have immunosuppression as a result of an underlying illness or treatment, a recent
             history or current use of immunosuppressive or immunomodulating disease therapy.
