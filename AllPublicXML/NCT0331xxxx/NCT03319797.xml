      Prospective, Multicenter, Single-arm Phase III Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and
      Safety of NOVOCART® Inject plus in the Treatment of Cartilage Defects of the Knee. The
      primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate efficacy of NOVOCART® Inject plus for the
      treatment of cartilage defects of the knee based on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score (KOOS) responder rate 24 month after transplantation.

      The present study is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm phase III clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOVOCART® Inject plus in the treatment of patients with
      cartilage defects of the knee (medial or lateral femoral condyle or tibial plateau, trochlea
      or patella) caused by traumatic events or osteochondritis dissecans. The study will include
      adult patients between 18 and 65 years of age and pediatric patients (14 to 17 years) with
      closed epiphysis.

      A total of 96 patients will be enrolled in the NOVOCART® Inject plus trial at about 20
      clinical study sites in Europe. It is expected that each study site will enroll 3 to 9
      patients.

      The trial will consist of three phases (including screening, treatment and follow-up phase)
      with a maximum duration of 5 years and 4 months.

      The treatment with NOVOCART® Inject plus requires 2 surgeries. During the first surgery
      autologous chondrocytes for transplant production will be harvested arthroscopically, then
      NOVOCART® Inject plus will be transplanted during a second surgery about 3 to 4 weeks later.
      In general, NOVOCART® Inject plus transplantation can be performed arthroscopically. However,
      depending on the defect localization, mini-arthrotomy may be indicated.

      Eligibility will be assessed preoperatively at visit 1 (screening) and (up to a maximum of 3
      months later) intraoperatively during the first arthroscopy (visit 2). During visit 2,
      cartilage biopsy samples will be taken from eligible patients and sent to TETEC AG for
      NOVOCART® Inject plus manufacturing. Transplantation will then be performed during a second
      arthroscopy 3 to 4 weeks later (visit 3).

      All patients will be followed up for 5 years post NOVOCART® Inject plus transplantation with
      assessments at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months as outlined in the schedule of events
      and treatment at the end of this synopsis.

      NOVOCART® Inject plus will be applied in conjunction with a rehabilitation program according
      to the rehabilitation regimen defined in the clinical study protocol.

      The primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed after a follow-up of 24 month post
      NOVOCART® Inject plus transplantation (primary analysis). Long-term data will be assessed
      after an additional 3 years follow-up (follow-up analysis).

      An interim analysis of efficacy and safety data will be performed when 63 patients (66% of
      the planned number of patients) are evaluable for the primary endpoint.

          2. Patient has grade II cartilage defects according to the ICRS or ICRS-OCD
             classification in the target knee.

          3. Patient has more than 2 grade III or IV cartilage defects according to the ICRS or

             from the defect location to be treated in the study. Prior biologic reconstructive
             procedures are accepted, if the previously treated defect is the same defect that is
             planned to be treated with NOVOCART® Inject plus (i.e. the prior method has failed)
             and these procedures were performed ≥ 24 months prior to screening visit 1.

          6. Patient had other prior surgical interventions interfering with the assessment of the
             NOVOCART® Inject plus treatment. Prior diagnostic arthroscopies with debridement and
             lavage are acceptable.

          7. Patients with subchondral bone defects more than 2 mm deep (after resection of

             leg imaging in standing position and in anteriorposterior (a.p.) or rather
             posterioranterior (p.a.) projection. The Mikulicz line is not allowed to deviate more
             than 5 mm of the eminentia intercondylaris. If alignment is necessary, surgery has to

             Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV), syphilis
             (Treponema pallidum) or active hepatitis B or C (HCV) infection with verified
             antigens. Patients with a cured hepatitis B or C infection and/or verified antibodies
             are not excluded.
