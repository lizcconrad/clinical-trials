  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle protein synthesis can be stimulated by ingestion of protein sources, such as whey,
      casein or soy. Protein supplementation can be useful to restore protein turnover after
      exercise but also to preserve skeletal muscle mass and function in aging adults. Ingestion of
      large doses of essential amino acids (EAA) or certain protein supplements may be an effective
      strategy to induce muscle protein synthesis. However, in many cases, it may not be practical
      or feasible to consume a large volume of amino acids or protein required for an effective
      response by muscle. Several evidences show how reduced strength and muscle mass, even in
      early life, are predictors of early mortality which explicit the importance of developing
      more effective methods to improve muscle quality. Therefore, identifying the better sources
      of protein that have higher anabolic potency is of high significance.

      The goal of this study is to determine the anabolic potency and efficacy of a new and novel
      Whey Protein Hydrolysate mixture (WPH) on skeletal muscle protein synthesis in healthy young
      subjects (age 20-35 yr). Previous studies on rats indicate WPH induces significant increases
      in muscle protein synthesis compared with carbohydrates or whey-amino acid mixture. WPH
      contains mostly peptides, which have physiological effects and could be absorbed more
      rapidly. Preliminary data from preclinical study has also demonstrated that WPH can stimulate
      muscle protein synthesis at lower doses compared with intact whey proteins. Thus, WPH could
      be absorbed more rapidly and may maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Although there
      is substantial data on the individual effects of BCCA and intact protein such as whey, there
      have been no clinical investigations that have explored the efficacy of WPH for stimulating
      muscle protein synthesis in humans.

      Therefore, the investigators propose that WPH will increase muscle protein synthesis.

      They will compare the response of WHP to the response of WHEY when equal protein is provided
      in both treatments.

      10 healthy subjects will be recruited and will receive both WPH and WHEY supplementation in a
      single blind crossover design. Muscle protein synthesis will be measured on both occasions.
      This acute study will allow to determine whether low dose WPH supplementation will be an
      effective nutritional treatment to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in young adults.
      Importantly, this study will provide the necessary preliminary data to design future short
      and long-term clinical trials to improve muscle function and skeletal muscle mass in clinical
      populations.

      The central hypothesis will be tested in 10 healthy young adults (20-35 yr). The subjects
      will be studied in the post-absorptive state on two different days, during which they will
      randomly assigned to drink a WPH or WHEY mixture.

      Measures of muscle protein synthesis will be taken at baseline, one and three hours following
      nutrient ingestion.

      The expected outcome of the proposed work is the identification of a new nutritional strategy
      for activating skeletal muscle protein synthesis. The findings of the proposed studies will
      have a positive impact, because they will allow us to translate this information into
      evidence-based clinical interventions to improve muscle size, strength and function and
      improve recovery after conditions associated with muscle wasting.
