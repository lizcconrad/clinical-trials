  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase III, single-centre, randomized, 2-arm, parallel-group, double blind,
      placebo-controlled study, consisting of a screening phase (Days -14 to -1), a 4-week
      double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment phase and a 4-week follow-up phase.

      Subjects: Type 2 diabetic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) not requiring
      revascularization, with sub-optimal glycemic control (HbA1c 7.5-8.5%) on their current
      anti-hyperglycemic regimen

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dapagliflozin or placebo.

      Subjects will undergo screening assessment in the 14-day period preceding administration of
      the first dose of study drug on Day 1.

      Primary Objective The primary objective is to assess the effect of dapagliflozin on
      myocardial insulin sensitivity Secondary Objective The secondary objective is to assess
      global heart function, and metabolic systemic effects of dapagliflozin, and glycemic control.

      The study aims to enroll patients with type 2 diabetes with poor glycemic control, and with
      coronary artery disease not requiring revascularization, who have already undergone, under
      routine cardiological assessment, a positron emission tomography (PET) 13NH3 scan in order to
      assess the cardiovascular function. Thus, the study aims to assess whether the improvement in
      cardiac metabolism obtained with dapagliflozin is greater than that obtained with normal
      clinical practice (according to Standards of Care).
