  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a rare, life-threatening condition characterized by
      uncontrolled hyperinflammation which may develop on the background of systemic Juvenile
      Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA). NI-0501 (Emapalumab) is a monoclonal antibody neutralizing
      interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a key cytokine which contributes to the inflammation and tissue
      damage seen in MAS. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of NI-0501 in sJIA patients developing MAS, presenting an inadequate response to
      high dose glucocorticoid treatment.
