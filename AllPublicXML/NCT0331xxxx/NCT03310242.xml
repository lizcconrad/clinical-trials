    <description>Quality of life measured using EQ-5D-5L scale. The EQ-5D is a standardised measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health status. In description part, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D); mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three-level (EQ-5D-3L) or five-level (EQ-5D-5L) scale. The 5-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) was developed to improve such constraints of the three-level scale.
EQ-5D-5L scale can define 3,125 (=5^5) different health states, and the 5-digit number can be converted into a preference weight which is also referred to as a single weighted index score. The index score of a value set derived from the general population sample can be regarded as a &quot;societal valuation of the respondent's health state&quot; in that country.</description>
