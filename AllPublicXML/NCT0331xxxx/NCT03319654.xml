  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects about 10% of all couples and is defined by a failure to achieve a
      clinical pregnancy within a year of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Up to one third
      of these couples will not have an identifiable cause after routine investigation, id est
      idiopathic infertility. The current diagnosis of male infertility relies on the World Health
      Organization (WHO) 2010 criteria which focus on concentration, motility and morphology in
      comparison to cut-off values of a fertile population. Alas, the relevance of the conventional
      semen analysis for the choice of treatment and the predictive value for an infertile couple
      with idiopathic or mild male infertility embarking on medically assisted reproduction (MAR)
      remains questionable. In other words, there is a strong clinical need to distinguish fertile
      from infertile men through new sperm function testing and to be able to select both the
      patient population who will benefit from MAR as well as the type of treatment.

      Numerous studies utilizing different techniques for assessing sperm DNA fragmentation support
      the existence of a significant association between sperm DNA damage and pregnancy outcomes.

      In this prospective cohort study the investigators aim to study the role of sperm DNA
      fragmentation analysis in selecting the patient who will benefit from intra-uterine
      insemination (IUI) therapy since IUI is still considered the first step in MAR and is
      performed at a large scale in Belgium and worldwide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Couples seeking fertility treatment after at least 12 months of unprotected intercourse are
        eligible. All couples underwent basic fertility investigations which included semen
        analysis, evaluation of menstrual cycle, and tubal patency testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Double sided tubal disease, severe endometriosis (classified as revised American Society
        for Reproductive Medicine stage III or IV), premature ovarian failure, and known endocrine
        disorders (such as Cushing's syndrome or adrenal hyperplasia), azo√∂- or necrozoospermia
