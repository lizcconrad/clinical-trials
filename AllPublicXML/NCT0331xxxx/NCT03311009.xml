  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, stratified, ascending dose, single
      center study, in three semi-sequential cohorts of 10 male and female subjects of
      nonchildbearing potential with Osteoarthritis (OA), administered GLPG1972 or placebo. Per
      cohort, 10 subjects will be randomized in a 4:1 allocation ratio to active treatment with
      GLPG1972 or matching placebo. In each cohort, OA subjects will be stratified for age (50- 64
      years and 65-75 years) with a minimum of 2 of each sex per age group.

             phenytoin, within 4 weeks before first study drug administration

             (e.g., St. John's Wort) and grapefruit/grapefruit products, Seville oranges, or any

         11. History of malignancy within the past 5 years.

         12. Clinically significant abnormalities detected on 12-lead ECG of either rhythm or
             conduction (e.g., QTcF ≥ 450 ms for males and QTcF ≥ 470 ms for females, or a known
             long QT syndrome).

         13. Significant blood loss (including blood donation [&gt; 450 mL]), or transfusion of any
