  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Fracture</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>: Alpha (A),Restoration is intact and fully retained. Bravo (B), Restoration is partially retained with some portion of the restoration still intact.
Charlie (C), Restoration is completely missing.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>marginal integrity</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha (A), Visual inspection and explorer, the explorer does not catch when drawn across the surface of the restoration toward the tooth, or, if the explorer does not catch, there is no visible crevice along the periphery of the restoration. Bravo (B), Visual inspection and explorer, the explorer catches and there is visible evidence of a crevice, which the explorer penetrates, indicating that the edge of the restoration does not adapt closely to the tooth structure. The dentin and/or the base is not exposed, and the restoration is not mobile. Charlie (C), Explorer, the explorer penetrates crevice defect extended to the dentino-enamel junction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>marginal discoloration</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha (A) Visual inspection, There is no visual evidence of marginal discoloration different from the color of the restorative material and from the color of the adjacent tooth structure. Bravo (B), Visual inspection, There is visual evidence of marginal discoloration at the junction of the tooth structure and the restoration, but the discoloration has not penetrated along the restoration in a pulpal direction. Charlie (C), Visual inspection, there is visual evidence of marginal discoloration at the junction of the tooth structure and the restoration that has penetrated along the restoration in a pulpal direction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>color match</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha (A) Visual inspection The restoration appears to match the shade and translucency of adjacent tooth tissues. Bravo (B), Visual inspection, the restoration does not match the shade and translucency of adjacent tooth tissues, but the mismatch is within the normal range of tooth shades. (Within normal range: Similar to silicate cement restorations for which the dentist did not quite succeed in matching tooth color by his choice among available silicate cement shades.) Charlie (C), visual inspection , the restoration does not match the shade and translucency of the adjacent tooth structure, and the mismatch is outside the normal range of tooth shades and translucency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>caries</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha (A) Visual inspection, the restoration is a continuation of existing anatomic form adjacent to the restoration. Bravo (B), Visual inspection, there is visual evidence of dark deep discoloration adjacent to the restoration (but not directly associated with cavosurface margins).</description>
