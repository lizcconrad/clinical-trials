  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about the causes of gastrointestinal
      dysfunction after spinal cord injury. It has been thought that the microbiome (the community
      of bacteria in the body) may be one such cause. The study will examine whether changes in the
      distal gut microbiome are related to gastrointestinal dysfunction in persons with Spinal Cord
      Injury and Non-Disabled Controls.

        Persons with a Spinal Cord Injury:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-65

          2. ≥ 1 year post-injury

          3. Spinal cord injury resulting in Tetraplegia or Paraplegia (C5-T6) and motor complete
             or incomplete (AIS A-C) impairment. Injury level and impairment will be confirmed by
             an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) exam conducted less than 2 years before
             study entry. If longer than 2 years, a certified rater will repeat the exam.

          4. Self -reported history of constipation or other gastrointestinal dysfunction (e.g.,
             extended bowel care time or difficulty in bowel emptying)

          5. Willingness to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently hospitalized

          2. American Spinal Injury Association (AIS) D-E

          3. Self-reported history of Crohn's disease or diverticulitis, gastric
             blockage/obstruction or swallowing disorder

          4. Gastrointestinal surgery ≤ 3 months prior to study

          5. Implanted cardiac pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator, morphine (pain), or intrathecal
             pump

          6. Concurrent use of surface functional electrical stimulation (FES)

        Neurologically-Intact Persons:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 or over

          2. Willingness to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Self-reported history of Crohn's disease or diverticulitis, gastric
             blockage/obstruction or swallowing disorder

          2. Gastrointestinal surgery ≤ 3 months prior to study

          3. Implanted cardiac pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator, morphine (pain), or intrathecal
             pump
