    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyze a multi-component sleep/wake protocol for
      optimization of environmental factors (noise, light, nursing activities) as well as
      non-environmental factors (pain, mechanical support devices, procedures) to improve quality
      of sleep and decrease incidence of ICU delirium in the Cardiovascular and Surgical ICU
      (CVICU/SICU).

    <description>During the day, a nurse will observe if the following elements were completed for each participant:
no caffeine after 3 pm
encourage activities to prevent napping (document % of day spent napping)
Lights on, blinds/door open
Reasonable effort for some noise in room
Eye glasses, hearing aids applied
Chair position/mobility at least 2x30 minutes
At night, a nurse will observe if the following elements were completed for each participant:
Appropriate pain control
Optimize room temperature
Warm bath before 2200
TV off by 2200
Prevent unnecessary alarms after 2200
Close curtains to room by 2200
Dim room lights by 2200
Family out of room by 2200
Door partially or fully closed after 2200
Number of RN interruptions after 2200
Offer eye mask/ear plugs
Medications administered for sleep (dilaudid, fentanyl oxycodone, haldol, quetiapine, propofol, melatonin, or other)
Dim hallway lights by 2200
Nurses station quiet</description>
