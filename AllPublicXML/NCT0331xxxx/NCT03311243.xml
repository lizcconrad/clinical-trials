  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the effect of local non surgical periodontal therapy on the
      systemic pro-inflammatory markers in the β-thalassemia (TM-β) patients with chronic
      periodontitis and systemically healthy demographically matched controls with chronic
      periodontitis. Both groups will receive non surgical periodontal therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment modalities in patients with thalassemia include long-term transfusion therapy, iron
      chelation, splenectomy, allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation and supportive measures.
      Attempts to downgrade the systemic proinflammation and thereby reducing the morbidity of the
      disease warrants investigation in patients with β-thalassemia (TM-β). In blood disorders, as
      with most other diseases, achieving and maintaining inflammatory homeostasis is essential and
      necessary for survival. Both TM and gingival diseases cause increased levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokines in the body fluids. Moreover, higher prevalence of gingival
      diseases is reported in children with TM. With oral hygiene maintenance and care,
      down-regulation of the systemic burden of the disease might be attained which will
      subsequently aid in achieving reduced morbidity in children with TM.

      Both the groups will receive non surgical periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) with
      the chlorhexidine containing adjunct in the form of a mouthrinse. Additionally, they will be
      taught standard tooth brushing technique (Fones technique). Participants will receive both
      verbal instructions and practical demonstrations.
