    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, non-randomized, single-arm, open label, single center clinical trial to
      determine the tolerability and safety of pirfenidone in patients with BOS associated with
      lung GVHD after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Such a trial is a necessary step prior
      to an evaluation of efficacy, as pirfenidone is known to be associated with adverse events
      (AEs) of the liver, gastrointestinal system and skin, organs frequently affected in GVHD.
      Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled, all patients will follow the same drug titration
      approach. The primary endpoint will be drug tolerability as measured by: the number of
      patients that are able to maintain the recommended dose of pirfenidone (2403 mg/d) without
      dose reduction lasting more than 21 days, due to adverse events (AEs). Changes from Baseline
      to Week 52 will be studied using validated health-related quality of life scales. Eligible
      patients aged &gt; 18 years must have a diagnosis of BOS according to pre-specified criteria.
      Patients will be required to have an %FEV1 or %FVC decline &gt;20% from pre-transplant baseline
      and symptoms of dyspnea, or cough. Eligible patients will enter the Screening Period, which
      may last up to 28 days. The dose of pirfenidone will be titrated over 3-8 weeks. Patients
      will have a telephone assessment at Week 1 and 2. An in-clinic assessment will occur every
      1-3 months as part of their usual clinical care in the Stanford University Lung GVHD clinic.
      Patients will complete an AE and dosing compliance diary. If patients discontinue study
      treatment early for any reason, they will continue with all scheduled study procedures
      through Week 52. All deaths will be reviewed by a Mortality Assessment Committee (MAC). An
      external Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor patient safety during the study.

    <measure>The number of participants that do not require a reduction in drug dose for more than 21 days due to adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will count the number of participants that do not require a reduction in drug dose of more than 21, non-continuous days due to adverse events. Tolerability will be assessed during continuous treatment. If the medication dosage increase results in the reoccurrence of a moderate adverse event or serious adverse event, lasting more than 21 days, then the event would be defined as &quot;not tolerated&quot;. If adverse events resolve before 21 days, then participants will attempt to again up-titrate the Pirfenidone dose, as tolerated. If at least 25% of participants tolerate the drug, then investigators will deem that this study demonstrates adequate tolerability to proceed to a larger trial to examine drug efficacy.</description>
