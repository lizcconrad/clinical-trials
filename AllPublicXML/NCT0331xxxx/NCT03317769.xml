  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a validation study to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and impact of a
      mobile psychosocial intervention to enhance social functioning in people with schizophrenia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to employ an innovative and evidence-based mobile intervention that
      includes a neuroscience-informed computerized social cognition training program, a Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant videoconferencing tool that we will
      use for psychoeducational group therapy, and peer-to-peer secure social networking for
      individuals with schizophrenia, in a parallel arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      clinical trial to assess feasibility and initial efficacy, to investigate the intervention's
      effects on symptoms, social cognition, and quality of life, and to prepare for a large-scale
      efficacy trial in adults with schizophrenia.

    <measure>Social Functioning utilizing the Social Functioning Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Between-group magnitude of change in social functioning utilizing the Social Functioning Scale. The Social Functioning Scale (SFS) was constructed specifically to tap areas of social functioning that are crucial to the community maintenance of individuals with schizophrenia. The 7 domains include: social engagement/withdrawal, interpersonal behavior, pro-social activities, recreation, independence-competence, independence-performance, and employment/occupation. The raw scores for each domain are converted to scaled scores, with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. Higher scores are indicative of greater social functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Symptoms utilizing the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Between-group magnitude of change in negative symptoms utilizing the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) is a medical scale used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. A rating from 1 to 7 is given to each of the 30 different symptoms. The 7-point rating represents increasing levels of psychopathology: 1= absent, 2=minimal, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=moderate severe, 6=severe, and 7=extreme. Of the 30 items included in the PANSS, 7 constitute a Positive Scale, 7 a Negative Scale, and the remaining 16 a General Psychopathology Scale. The scores for these scales are arrived at by summation of ratings across component items. Therefore, the potential ranges are 7 to 49 for the Positive and Negative Scales, and 16 to 112 for the General Psychopathology Scale. Higher scores are indicative of greater symptomatology.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life utilizing the Abbreviated Quality of Life Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 9 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Between-group magnitude of change in quality of life utilizing the Abbreviated Quality of Life Scale. The Quality of Life Scale (QLS) is a scale commonly used as a measure of functioning in schizophrenia. The Abbreviated QLS (aQLS) includes 7 items representing all four interdependent theoretical constructs of the original 21-item QLS. Behavioral anchors are presented for each item, scored on a 0 (severe impairment) to 6 (high functioning) scale. Higher scores are indicative of greater quality of life.</description>
