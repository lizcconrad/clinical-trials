    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, un-blinded, Phase II study in males and non-pregnant females, who are
      in good health, 19 to 64 years of age. This study is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic AS03 (GSK) adjuvanted 2017 monovalent
      inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine, when two doses are administered 21 days apart either
      sequentially or simultaneously (within 15 minutes) with licensed seasonal influenza vaccine.
      Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups. The study will enroll
      approximately 150 individuals who have no history of influenza A/H7N9 infection or prior
      receipt of an influenza virus H7 subtype vaccine. Study duration is approximately 16 months
      with subject participation duration of approximately 13 months. The primary objectives of
      this study are: 1) to assess the safety and reactogenicity following sequential or
      simultaneous IM administration of 2 doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and one dose of
      seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4); 2) to assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses
      against A/H7N9 at approximately 21 days following receipt of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted
      2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM approximately 21 days apart; 3) to assess the serum HAI and
      Neut antibody responses against the seasonal influenza strains at approximately 21 days
      following receipt of IIV4.

      This is a randomized, un-blinded, Phase II study in males and non-pregnant females, who are
      in good health, 19 to 64 years of age. This clinical trial is designed to assess the safety,
      reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of a pre-pandemic AS03 (GSK) adjuvanted 2017 monovalent
      inactivated influenza A/H7N9 vaccine (2017 H7N9 IIV) manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (3.75 mcg
      of HA per dose with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) diluent), when two doses are administered
      21 days apart either sequentially or simultaneously (within 15 minutes) with licensed
      seasonal influenza vaccine. Subjects will be randomized into one of three treatment groups.
      Group 1 will receive two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV, each dose administered IM
      approximately 21 days apart, and one dose of licensed seasonal IIV4 will be administered IM
      simultaneously (within 15 minutes) with the first dose of AS03 adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV.
      Group 2 will receive one dose of IIV4 approximately 21 days prior to the IM administration of
      two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV; each dose of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV will
      be given approximately 21 days apart. Group 3 will receive one dose IM of IIV4 as an
      un-blinded comparator. The study will enroll approximately 150 individuals who have no
      history of influenza A/H7N9 infection or prior receipt of an influenza virus H7 subtype
      vaccine. Study duration is approximately 16 months with subject participation duration of
      approximately 13 months. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the safety
      and reactogenicity following sequential or simultaneous IM administration of 2 doses of
      AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and one dose of seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4); 2) to assess
      the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses against A/H7N9 at approximately 21 days following
      receipt of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV administered IM approximately 21 days
      apart; 3) to assess the serum HAI and Neut antibody responses against the seasonal influenza
      strains at approximately 21 days following receipt of IIV4. The secondary objectives are: 1)
      to assess unsolicited non-SAEs following sequential or simultaneous IM administration of
      AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and seasonal influenza vaccine (IIV4); 2) to assess MAAEs,
      including NOCMCs and PIMMCs, following sequential or simultaneous IM administration of
      AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV and IIV4; 3) to assess the HAI and Neut antibody responses at
      21 days following receipt of 1 dose of AS03-adjuvanted 2017 H7N9 IIV.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study procedures.

          2. Are able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available for
             all study visits.

          3. Are males or non-pregnant females, 19 -64 years of age, inclusive.

          4. Are in good health.

             - As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or
             currently ongoing chronic medical diagnoses or conditions, defined as those that have
             been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of the safety of
             subjects or the immunogenicity of study vaccinations. Chronic medical diagnoses or
             conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, Emergency Room
             (ER), or urgent care for condition and no adverse symptoms that need medical
             intervention such as medication change/supplemental oxygen). This includes no change
             in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of
             the chronic medical diagnosis or condition in the 60 days prior to enrollment. Any
             prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company,
             etc., or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same class of
             medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change
             in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by
             the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be
             considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as
             needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or
             assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity and do not indicate a worsening of
             medical diagnosis or condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment
             and study vaccination are acceptable provided there was no deterioration in the
             subject's chronic medical condition that necessitated a medication change, and there
             is no additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses
             to study vaccination. Note: Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the
             exception of inhaled corticosteroids as outlined in the Subject Exclusion Criteria),
             herbals, vitamins, and supplements are permitted.

          5. Oral temperature is less than 100.0°F.

          6. Pulse is 47 to 100 beats per minute (bpm), inclusive.

          7. Systolic blood pressure is 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive (subjects &lt;65 years of age), 85
             to 160 mmHg, inclusive (subjects = / &gt; 65 years of age).

          8. Diastolic blood pressure is 55 to 95 mmHg, inclusive.
