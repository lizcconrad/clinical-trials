  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), produced mainly in enteroendocrine cells, participates in
      energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism by regulating islet hormone secretion,
      gastrointestinal motility, and food intake, making GLP-1 agonist a treatment for diabetes and
      obesity. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that GLP-1 also has
      cardio-protection effects. GLP-1 agonists is able to improve markers of cardiac function,
      reduce myocardial infarct size and post-myocardial infarction remodeling in experimental
      myocardial infarction. And GLP-1 infusion improved left ventricular function and increases
      myocardial salvage in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The investigators'
      previous study found that GLP-1 analogues attenuated ischemia-reperfusion induced apoptosis
      of stem- and myocardial microvascular endothelial cells, and liraglutide (a GLP-1 analog)
      usage during hospital stay can prevent no-reflow and improve heart function in AMI.
      Therefore, the investigators carried out a cohort study to evaluate the association between
      plasma GLP-1 and in-hospital complications in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction.
