  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a trend to offer personalized care in many medical domains. In the field of labor
      pain, it appears that maternal satisfaction about care is multifactorial, and that labor pain
      is only one of its determinants, competing with psychological and sociological factors.
      Furthermore, labor pain is also multifactorial, depending on predisposition to pain, the way
      analgesia is conducted, and other environmental factors. We wish to develop predicting models
      of maternal satisfaction, in order to offer in the future a better tailored analgesia.

  <detailed_description>

      The observation shall be conducted at 3 major points of measurement throughout labor:

        1. Pre-, i.e. at the systematic visit for anesthesia, during the 3rd trimester of
           pregnancy. The collected variables will be: demographic, morphometric, socioeconomic,
           psychometric. The latter shall consist in a short questionnaire-based assessment by:
           Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 5-points Mental Health Inventory, Life
           Orientation Scale. As soon as it will be validated, a Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire
           shall be added.

        2. Intra-, i.e. clinical data from the anesthesia file: conduction of epidural analgesia,
           labor pain, drug consumption, obstetrical outcomes.

        3. Post-, i.e. maternal satisfaction assessed by a set of seven 11-point numerical rating
           scales at day2 post childbirth, along with a written short qualitative assessment.

      Different multivariable statistical models shall be used to identify the patients profiles
      and the possible determinants of satisfaction: descriptive (factorial analyses) and
      inferential (GLM or longitudinal).
