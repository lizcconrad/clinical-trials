    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a public health problem with enormous
      personal, and social losses. According to the National Mexican HIV/AIDS survey, more than
      235,000 new cases of HIV infection were reported in Mexico between 1983 and 2015.

      HIV infection is characterized by persistent immune activation and constant turnover of T
      cells. This leads to a precipitous fall in the number of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, as well as
      to an early immunosenescence phenomenon that conditions susceptibility to opportunistic
      infections and a profound decrease in circulating and mucosal T cells. In these patients,
      modulation of the immune response represents a promising mechanism to maintain immunological
      homeostasis and prevent the development of pathology. From this perspective, it is feasible
      that lesser immune activation - rather than accelerating the progression of infection - may
      be an important actor in controlling infection and delaying the progression from chronic
      infection to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) .

      The administration of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) has resulted in a reduction
      in the mortality of these patients, although the occurrence of late morbidity due to both
      infection and treatment has increased. Unfortunately, even in cluntries with complete
      coverage for HIV-infection, a large group of patients do not start treatment until late
      stages, in which immunosenescence is profound and the possibilities of immunological recovery
      (increase in T cell counts CD4 +, normalization of the CD4 + / CD8 + index, decrease in
      susceptibility to opportunists, normalization in the cellular response to vaccines) are very
      low. In this context, finding new immuno-modulatory strategies that are both easily
      applicable and potentially improving survival and quality of life is crucial.

      The therapeutic use of neuroimmune regulators in HIV infection has been poorly explored. In
      brief, the nervous system has evolutionary mechanisms of reflex control of the inflammatory
      response, such as cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex (RCA). Cholinergic stimulation through
      the use of nicotinic agonists has shown promising effects in murine and cellular models of
      systemic inflammation. Since cholinergic agonists are rapidly degraded or cause side effects,
      we performed a pilot study using pyridostigmine (Mestinon®), an acetylcholinesterase
      inhibitor (ACh-E), in HIV-infected patients. We observed that administration of
      pyridostigmine decreases the activation and proliferation of HIV-infected T cells, reduces
      the production of interferon (IFN) -gamma and increases that of interleukin (IL) -10
      (Valdés-Ferrer SI et al., AIDS Research And Human Retrovir 2009). In a second open-label
      pilot study in seven chronically infected patients with full virological suppression but
      without concomitant elevation of CD4+ T cell counts, we found that the addition of
      pyridostigmine to ART led to a sustained and significant increase in the number of CD4 + T
      cells (PRS record: NCT00518154; in preparation for publication). These results suggest that
      the addition of pyridostigmine to antiretroviral therapy may be beneficial in achieving and
      maintaining immunological homeostasis in patients with HIV.

      The present study will address the potential effectiveness of add-on pyridostigmine (90mg,
      once per day, per oris) on CD4+ T cell counts, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, as well as ex-vivo markers of
      T cell phenotype and activity. The study is designed as a 24-week crossover study where
      patients will start a 12-week of pyridostigmine or placebo, and then crossing-over for an
      aditional 12 weeks (placebo-to-pyridostigmine, and pyrodistigmine-to-placebo).

      Since pyridostigmine is a commonly used drug for both myasthenia gravis and as a preventive
      in biological warfare cases, if our hypotheses are correct, the results will be easily
      extended to clinical practice, as there is enough long-term evidence of utility and safety of
      the drug.
