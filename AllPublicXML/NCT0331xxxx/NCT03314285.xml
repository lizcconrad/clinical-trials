  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic neck pain on sleep quality and to
      determine the factors that may be related to sleep disturbance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that chronic neck pain affects sleepiness negatively. However, there are no
      studies on chronic neck pain and sleep quality. In this study, we would like to determine
      whether there is a link between chronic neck pain and sleep quality and the factors that may
      be related.

    <time_frame>30 day</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality to be measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale.The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale is a 19-item self-rated questionnaire for evaluating subjective sleep quality the previous month. The 19 questions are combined into 7 clinically-derived component scores, each weighted equally from 0-3. The 7 component scores are added to obtain a global score ranging from 0-21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality.</description>
