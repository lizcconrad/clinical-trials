  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to collect stool, blood, and urine from acute leukemia
      patients undergoing induction chemotherapy in order to generate preliminary data regarding
      the association between microbiota and chemotherapy-induced gut barrier damage. This study
      consists of inpatient collections of blood, urine, and stool while the patients are
      undergoing inpatient induction therapy. Patients will not be scheduled for any additional
      procedures or testing beyond what is required for clinical care.
