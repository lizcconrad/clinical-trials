  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this pilot study is to conduct a preliminary trial to evaluate the
      acceptability and feasibility of adding a transdiagnostic, emotion-focused group intervention
      (the Unified Protocol, UP) to treatment as usual (TAU) in a comprehensive outpatient program
      for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and emotional distress. Only
      patients seeking services or engaged in care at an existing outpatient program at MGH (the
      Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Young adults with substance use disorder (SUD) commonly experience co-occurring emotional
      distress in the form of affective/emotional disorders (i.e. anxiety, depressive, and related
      disorders) and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs). Based on the conceptualization
      of emotion dysregulation as a transdiagnostic treatment target, the current study utilizes
      the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (UP) to target core
      psychopathological processes related to emotion dysregulation that underlie SITBs and
      emotional disorder pathology. Given its transdiagnostic format, the UP has the potential to
      address comorbidity among the emotional disorders (and other functionally similar problems
      such as SUDs) simultaneously and more comprehensively than single-diagnosis treatments.

      Patients seeking services or currently engaged in care at an existing comprehensive
      outpatient program for adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders (the MGH
      Addiction Recovery Management Service) are eligible for this study. Participants will be
      randomized to receive either UP + TAU or TAU alone. The adjunctive UP intervention consists
      of 16 twice-weekly group sessions (delivered over an 8-week period) designed to deliver
      transdiagnostic, emotion-focused CBT strategies.
