  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, analyst-blinded, randomized control trial to assess the incidence of
      intravenous (IV) fluid over-administration in the setting of pediatric dental surgeries.
      Anesthetists will be randomized to either administer their IV fluid through an infusion pump
      or a gravity drip device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the perioperative setting, IV fluids are administered to mitigate the effects of
      preoperative fasting and sources of fluid loss that are unique to surgical intervention.
      Significant harms have been associated with the over-administration of IV fluid in pediatric
      patients. Infusion pumps have been shown to reduce medication administration errors in
      inpatients receiving continuous IV infusions. In contrast, laboratory experiments have
      demonstrated that gravity driven fluid delivery systems are influenced by numerous extrinsic
      factors. To date, no work has investigated the perioperative incidence of IV fluid
      over-administration in pediatric patients randomized either to infusion pumps (intervention)
      or gravity-fed IV systems (control).
