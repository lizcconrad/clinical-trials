      The computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy will be used to treat amphetamine-type
      stimulant (ATS) addiction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The deficits in executive functions related to prefrontal-striatal circuits play a vital role
      in ATS addiction and relapse, and proposed computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy as
      the novel interventions. Focused on evaluating and training executive functions including
      working memory, inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility, and congitive bias concerning
      prefrontal-striatal circuits, neuropsychological tests, electroencephalography tests,
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and functional MRI will be used to evaluate the
      therapeutic effect of ATS addiction treatment as well as investigate the mechanisms. The
      study will be very helpful to develop novel interventions in clinical practice and decrease
      ATS-related harm for both the patients and their families.
