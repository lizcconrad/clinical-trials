  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the analgesic effect of Omnitram and tramadol during concurrent
      administration of paroxetine. Paroxetine administration is expected to diminish the analgesic
      effect of tramadol, but not Omnitram. Each participant will receive paroxetine before and
      during treatment with Omnitram, tramadol, and placebo.

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigating the steady-state oral
      pharmacokinetics and hypoalgesic effects of overencapsulated: 20 mg Omnitram (2x10 mg
      tablets), 50 mg tramadol (1x50 mg Ultram tablet), and placebo in male and female subjects
      made CYP2D6 deficient by paroxetine coadministration.

      Sixty participants in normal health, 18 to 50 years of age, who meet the entry criteria, will
      be randomized to one of the three treatments in treatment segment 1. Each arm will ingest
      three consecutive 20 mg daily doses of paroxetine. Twelve hours after the first paroxetine
      dose, subjects will be randomized to one of the treatment sequences to ingest a total of 9
      doses of Omnitram, tramadol, or placebo (one dose every 6 hours). Immediately before the 9th
      dose a blood sample will be collected to quantify plasma Omnitram, tramadol, and paroxetine.
      After the 9th study drug dose, six blood samples will be collected (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 4.0,
      and 8.0 hours after the 9th dose is administered) to quantify the Omnitram and tramadol.
      After the 9th dose, pain tolerance will be assessed with a cold pressor test (immersion of
      hand in ice cold water). Participants will washout for 11-15 days after treatment 1 and
      treatment 2. The study will analyze treatment side effects, the pharmacokinetics, and pain
      tolerance.
