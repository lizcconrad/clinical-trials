  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the hypothesis that patients receiving remote
      ischemic conditioning using the autoRIC device show statistically significant reduction in
      the prevalence of ischemia-reperfusion injury to the myocardium as compared to patients in
      the autoRIC Sham device arm (within 12-24 hours post-elective PCI procedure).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled single-blind clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of the autoRIC device to attenuate myocardial injury as measured by
      cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) levels in patients undergoing elective PCI.

      Eligible patients that are scheduled for an elective PCI or patients scheduled for a
      diagnostic catheterization procedure with orders of &quot;treat as indicated&quot; will be enrolled in
      the study. Patients will undergo remote ischemic conditioning with the autoRIC device or the
      control procedure with the autoRIC Sham device completed ≤ 1 hour prior to balloon or stent
      inflation. Subjects will have measurements of cTnI levels at baseline and 4-8 and 12-24 hours
      post completion of the PCI procedure. Adverse events will be recorded through study exit for
      all patients. Patients will be exited from the study after completion of their 30-day
      post-procedure telephone follow-up.
