             examination, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate), 12 lead ECG, clinical
             laboratory tests.

          -  Age: 18-45 years (inclusive) at the first screening visit

          -  Non-smoker for at least the past 6 months and with a pack year history of equal to or

        Part 1

          -  Relevant diseases potentially interfering with the study's aims (e.g.respiratory

             pulmonary status within the 4 weeks before baseline visit

          -  Current smoking habit or history of smoking within the 6 months before the screening
             visit.
