    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take part in this clinical research study because they have
      advanced, un-resectable stage III or IV Melanoma. If they participate they will be randomized
      to receive Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) or the combination of Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) plus
      Metformin.

      This research study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combination of
      Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) and the investigational drug, Metformin.

      Patients will be randomized into one of two groups - either Arm A or Arm B. In Arm A,
      patients will receive pembrolizumab alone. In Arm B, patients will receive both pembrolizumab
      and metformin.

      If patients are randomized to Arm A, they will be administered pembrolizumab (200 mg), by IV,
      every three weeks. Pembrolizumab can be administered up to two years, if disease does not
      progress or have unacceptable toxicity. However, if the disease progresses the patient may
      continue on the study if they are clinically stable or clinically improved.

      If patients are randomized to Arm B, they will be administered pembrolizumab (200 mg), by IV,
      every three weeks, plus metformin (500 mg), once a day for nine weeks. Metformin will be
      taken in the morning with food.

      Discontinuation of treatment may be considered for patients who have attained a confirmed
      complete response that have been treated for at least 24 weeks with pembrolizumab and had at
      least two treatments with pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial complete response
      was declared.

      Patients will be followed for 5 years after removal from study or until death, whichever
      occurs first, through standard of care visits, phone call or by medical records review.

             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects
             with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the

             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least two weeks

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxineor physiologic corticosteroid replacement
             therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of
             systemic treatment.

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit

             [HBsAg] reactive) or hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV] RNA [qualitative] is
             detected). Note: Without known history, testing only needs to be performed if there is
             clinical suspicion for Hepatitis B or C.

          -  Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
