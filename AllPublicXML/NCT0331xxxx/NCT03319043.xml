      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken at an
      outpatient clinic in Shuguang Hospital. Newly diagnosed cough variant asthma adult patients
      with the T.C.M. pattern of pathogenic-wind are randomly divided into treatment and control
      group, with 60 patients in each group. Clinical observation of the Respiratory Impedance and
      Inflammation in Cough Variant Asthma adults reated in Combination of Chanqin Granules.

      This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was undertaken at an
      outpatient clinic in Shuguang Hospital. Newly diagnosed cough variant asthma adult patients
      with the T.C.M. pattern of pathogenic-wind are randomly divided into treatment and control
      group, with 60 patients in each group. All patients enrolled are treated with Budesonide +
      Formoterol Fumarate dry power (160/4.5ug bid) for inhalation. The treatment group are given
      additional Chanqin granulate (10g bid) and placebo granulate for controlled group.
      Investigators hypothesis that Chanqin granules may reduce day &amp; night cough score as well as
      the respiratory impedance, inflammation statues, and improve T.C.M. syndrome after 8 weeks of
      treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 120 eligible participants will be randomly allocated to the placebo group and treatment group in a 1:1 ratio. Randomized sequences of each center and every packed drug were generated by an independent professor at the Drug Clinical Research Center of Shanghai University of TCM, using a stratified block randomization method with 30 blocks of block size 8 based on the PROC PLAN function of the SAS 9.2 software analysis system (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Randomization sequences will be concealed in lightproof, sealed envelopes kept by a specified project manager and the sponsor, who are not involved in the recruitment, intervention, assessment, or statistical analysis. The treatment allocation will be blinded to the participants and investigators throughout the study, and the outcome assessors and statisticians will not be involved in the participants' screening and allocation. Each patient will receive a unique randomized number corresponding to the drug according to the group allocation. Furthermore, the intervention group type will be replaced by the letter A, B as blind codes of allocation. The blind codes will not be disclosed until the statistical analysis is completed.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Impulse Oscillometry</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>The patients will be seated comfortably in a nonswivel chair. Nose clips were applied and a special mouthpiece will be used. For Impulse Oscillometry measurements (MasterScreen, CareFusion, San Diego, California) are performed according to the protocols of the European Respiratory Society. Patients will be advised to cradle their cheeks with their hands. Patients are allowed to breathe normally while the loudspeaker delivere intermittent multi-frequency impulses over a minimum of a 30-s period. A trained technician will guide and assist the patient during the procedure, which involved three to five sinusoidal readings, depending on the incidence of cough, swallowing, and holding of breath. The recordings with the best coherence at frequencies from 5 to 30 Hz will be chosen. The technician is also trained to capture subclinical leaks through the mouthpiece, and leaky recordings will be discarded. The Impulse Oscillometry parameters measured are Zrs、R5、R20、X5.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cough severity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Cough severity is measured by a validated verbal category-descriptive (VCD) scores which patients reported. =The scale has 6 discrete values: 0=no cough; 1=one short period of mild cough without hardship; 2=some short periods of cough without much hardship; 3=frequent coughing that does not affect normal daily life or sleep; 4=serious coughing that is very frequent and interferes with normal daily life or sleep; 5=distressing continuous coughing that did not stop for 24 h.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exhaled nitric oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>2 week</time_frame>
    <description>Exhaled nitric oxide is measured using a portable analyzer, the NIOX MINO (Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden). Participants performe a 10 seconds slow steady exhalation. Three successive recordings at 1-minute intervals, expressed as parts per billion (ppb), are made.</description>
