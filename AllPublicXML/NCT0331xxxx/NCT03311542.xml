      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for patient with Melanoma and Glioblastoma who have
      progressed after prior Protocol therapy including Bevacizumab, Temozolomide ( TMZ ),
      Ipilimumab, BRAF and MEK inhibitors. The patients whose tumors are EGFR, MET or ALK positive
      should first receive an EFGR or ALK inhibitor, respectively, prior to treatment with
      pembrolizumab.

      Pembrolizumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      patients with Glioblastoma and Melanoma The Expanded Access Program (EAP) for this medicine
      in the U.S. is closed. The EAP will continue outside the U.S.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient's willing to sign Informed Consent.

          -  Unresectable metastatic Melanoma / Glioblastoma / Glioma.

          -  Failed or progressed on standard of care systemic therapy including bevacizumab,
             ipilimumab, radiotherapy, regardless of prior treatment with a BRAF/ MEK/ EGFR/ MET/
             ALK inhibitors, as long as all other eligibility criteria for this study are met.

          -  Female participants of childbearing potential must be willing to use adequate
             contraception or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity starting
             with the first dose of treatment through at least 120 days after the last dose of
             pembrolizumab.

          -  Male participants must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of treatment through 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab.

          -  Results of partial genomic or full-genomic sequencing or genetic studies to determine
             the status of the patient's mutation load.

          -  ECOG performance status greater than or equal to 2

          -  Adequate kidney function: serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL or
             creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40 mL/min

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5
             x 10^9/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 10 g/dL (can be corrected by growth
             factor or transfusion), and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 10^9/L

             aminotransferase less than or equal to 3 x ULN (or less than or equal to 5 x ULN in
             case of liver metastases). If alkaline phosphatase is greater than 3 x ULN (in absence
             of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in presence of liver metastases) AND
             patient also is known to have bone metastases, the liver specific alkaline phosphatase
             must be used to assess liver function instead of total alkaline phosphatase

          -  Electrocardiogram with QTc interval of greater than or equal to 500 msec based upon
             Bazett's formula (QTcB).

          -  The Investigator believes the patient to be medically unfit to receive pembrolizumab
             or unsuitable for any other reason.

          -  Pregnancy (positive B-hCG test) or breastfeeding.

          -  Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab.

          -  Use of corticosteroids for this indication has been discontinued for at least 4 weeks
             before starting treatment in this protocol.

          -  History of or concomitant medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             would compromise the patient's ability to safely complete the treatment protocol.

          -  Meningeal carcinomatosis.

          -  Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement resulting in pulmonary dysfunction requiring active
             treatment, including use of oxygen.

          -  Expected to require any other form of systemic antineoplastic therapy while receiving
             pembrolizumab.

          -  History of clinically severe autoimmune disease (e.g., requires chronic
             immunosuppressive therapy).

          -  History of pneumonitis, organ transplant, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active
             hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
