  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence of clinical efficacy of an experimental
      dentifrice containing stannous fluoride (SnF2) compared to regular fluoride dentifrice in the
      reduction of dentinal hypersensitivity (DH). This study will be considered successful if
      there is a statistically significant difference in the primary efficacy variable, change from
      baseline in Schiff sensitivity score, after 8 weeks of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre, randomized, controlled, examiner-blind, 3 treatment arm,
      parallel group design study, stratified by maximum baseline Schiff sensitivity score (of the
      two selected test teeth), with a treatment period of 8 weeks. DH will be assessed following
      an acclimatization period of 2-6 weeks at Baseline, and after 4 and 8 weeks treatment. The
      study will be conducted in healthy participants with pre-existing self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at Screening. A standard fluoride dentifrice with no
      specific anti-sensitivity, anti-gingivitis and anti-plaque activity will be included as the
      negative control. A Chinese marketed positive control dentifrice with sensitivity benefits
      (containing stannous chloride (SnCl2)) will also be included in this study.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will assess the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score will indicate the improvement in sensitivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in tactile threshold after 8 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner will assess the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which will allow application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force will reach. The tactile threshold for each tooth will be determined by asking the participants whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant will give two consecutive 'yes' responses will be recorded as the tactile threshold. Higher tactile threshold will indicate the less sensitive are the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force will be 20g; at all subsequent visits, it will be 80g. However, in situations where participants will not give a 'yes' response at force of 80g, the tactile threshold will be recorded as &gt;80g.</description>
