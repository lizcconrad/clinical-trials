  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether the presence of night-time breathing disturbances
      (&quot;sleep-disordered breathing&quot;) in pregnant women is related to fetal growth patterns. The
      hypothesis is that fetal growth slows in the 3rd trimester in women with sleep-disordered
      breathing. Use of a nighttime breathing therapy called auto-PAP could minimize the slowing in
      fetal growth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  at least 18 years old;

          -  no more than 20 weeks pregnant;

          -  pregnant with one baby;

          -  found to have sleep-disordered breathing as measured by a sleep study. If you are
             found to have severe sleep apnea on the sleep study you will be referred for clinical
             care instead of participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  more than 20 weeks pregnant;

          -  pregnant with twins, triplets, or more babies;

          -  a current smoker, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs;

          -  currently using positive-airway pressure therapy for treatment of obstructive sleep
             apnea;

          -  diagnosed with certain conditions such as bullous lung disease, a bypassed upper
             airway, pneumothorax (collapsed lung), pneumocephalus (leak of cerebrospinal fluid,
             the fluid that the brain and spine float in), if you have had recent trauma, or recent
             nasal surgery.
