  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of 2ml versus 5ml of local
      anesthetics used in stellate ganglion blocks for the treatment of complex regional pain
      syndrome of the arm.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if 2ml of 0.2% ropivacaine is less effective in decreasing pain scores by more
      than 50% when compared to 5ml of 0.2% ropivacaine. To evaluate if 2ml of 0.2% ropivacaine is
      causes less side effects when compared to 5ml after a stellate ganglion block.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome of the arm according to
             the Budapest criteria and having already received a minimum of 3 stellate ganglion
             blocks. Only patients having received a minimum of 3 stellate ganglion blocks will be
             included since it is expected to have a progressive and sustained decrease in pain
             scores during the first 3 blocks.

          -  ASA 1 to 3 included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient refusal

          -  Contra-indications to the stellate ganglion block procedure such as coagulopathy,
             anticoagulants or anti platelet therapy other than aspirin, systemic or injection site
             infection, important neck deformity (post-radiotherapy or surgery, etc.), severe
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, contralateral diaphragm paralysis or
             contralateral pneumonectomy

          -  Allergy to local anesthetics

          -  Concomitant pain syndrome other than complex regional pain syndrome of the arm

          -  Liver or kidney failure (CrCl &lt; 30 ml/min)
