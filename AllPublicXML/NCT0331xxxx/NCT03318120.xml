  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate how the brain and motor behavior changes
      in individuals with dystonia and other involuntary movement disorders and healthy individuals
      over time with exercise training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study team plan to conduct a randomized prospective, parallel-group, controlled study to
      examine the effects of exercises in dystonia and other involuntary movement disorders.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either progressive resistance training or a control
      treatment following the modified fitness protocol. The study team hypothesize that
      progressive resistance training will result in better outcomes compared to modified fitness
      protocol.

      Data collect includes 1) data about clinical movement disorder history, age, gender, height,
      weight, and other medical conditions; 2) clinical neurological examination; 3) tests
      assessing cognitive abilities (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Stroop, Digit Span, Hopkins
      Verbal Learning Test, COWA and Animals, and Brief Test of Attention); 4) tests assessing
      motor abilities including Toronto Western Spasmodic Rating Scale (TWSTRS) and
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS); 5) measures of anxiety and depression
      (Beck Depression Index, Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Rating Scales); 5) Cervical dystonia
      related quality of life (CDQ-24); 6) Visual Analog Scales-Quality of Life (VAS QOL)
      evaluating of health related quality of life.
