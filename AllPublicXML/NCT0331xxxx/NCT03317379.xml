  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to evaluate two 6-month adjunct interventions (peer mentorship and
      social support mentorship) for individuals with eating disorders. Individuals will be
      randomized to peer-mentorship, social support mentorship, or a wait-list and eating disorder
      symptoms will be evaluated at baseline and post-treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses associated with significant morbidity and high
      relapse rates. Patients are at especially high risk of relapse after leaving structured
      treatment (e.g., hospitalization). Adjunct interventions targeting patients' motivation and
      participation in treatment at these times may help patients recover from eating disorders.
      Project HEAL is a non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce suffering caused by
      eating disorders, and they have recently developed two adjunct, mentorship-based
      interventions for patients in recovery. In the peer mentorship condition, individuals meet
      weekly with a peer mentor who has previously recovered from an eating disorder in order to
      discuss symptoms and coping strategies. In the social support mentorship condition,
      individuals meet weekly with a social support mentor who has not personally struggled with an
      eating disorder in order to engage in activities unrelated to the eating disorder. The aim of
      the current study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this intervention. The
      design of the study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial comparing peer mentorship,
      social-support mentorship, and wait-list control conditions. Participants in the study will
      be randomized to one of the three conditions for six months. Wait-list participants will
      subsequently receive either type of mentorship. Participants will complete assessments of
      their eating disorder symptoms at baseline, monthly throughout the course of the study, and
      one year after beginning the study. Outcomes will be compared between groups.

    <description>The Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory (EPSI) is a self-report questionnaire that includes 45 items covering 8 subscales: Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Purging, Restricting, Excessive Exercise, Negative Attitudes toward Obesity, and Muscle Building. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert-style scale (0 = Never; 4= Often) to describe how well each item describes the participant's experiences. Scores are derived by summing responses across the questions included in each subscale. The EPSI is part of the PhynxToolkit</description>

    <description>Participants meet weekly with an adult mentor who has not personally struggled with an eating disorder but who is dedicated to offering support. During weekly meetings, participants and mentors (and possibly 1-2 other mentees) engage in activities unrelated to the eating disorder. The goal of this program is to reduce eating disorder symptoms indirectly by exploring aspects of self outside the eating disorder.</description>
