    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a digitalized cognitive-behavioral
      treatment for anxiety among school aged children. The participants are screened from the
      general population, as a part of the routine school health care check-ups. Half of the
      children with anxiety will receive the digitalized treatment program, while the other half
      will receive education about anxiety in internet.
