      A multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) phase 1/2 study. Phase 1 will be conducted in BCG-unresponsive
      NMIBC patients to establish the safety of durvalumab monotherapy (cohort 1) and durvalumab in
      combination with BCG (cohort 2a) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) (cohort 2b).
      Provided safety is demonstrated and recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) are established in phase
      1, the study will proceed to phase 2 testing. Phase 2 will be conducted in the BCG-relapsing
      NMIBC population. In phase 2, BCG-relapsing NMIBC subjects will be randomized between
      treatment arms examining intravesical BCG in combination with novel immunotherapy agents
      (durvalumab), novel immunotherapy in combination with radiation (durvalumab + EBRT), or
      retreatment with intravesical BCG. In addition to providing additional safety data on the
      combination regimens studied, phase 2 will provide preliminary efficacy profiles for
      BCG-relapsing NMIBC subjects with and without CIS treated with each regimen. For regimens
      demonstrating a tolerable safety profile and encouraging clinical activity in this phase 1/2
      design, a randomized phase 3 trial of experimental arm therapy versus re-treatment with
      intravesical BCG therapy would be considered.

      Randomization:

      Prior to commencing accrual, each study site will be required to self-identify their site as
      a site with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT+) or without (EBRT-) the capacity to
      provide radiation therapy as specified in the durvalumab + EBRT arm. The radiation therapy
      status of each site will remain fixed throughout the course of the trial.

      Subjects enrolled in cohort 1 of Phase 1 of the protocol will receive durvalumab monotherapy
      with no randomization. For all other study cohorts in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the
      protocol, subjects registered at self-identified EBRT+ study sites will be randomized 1:1
      between all actively accruing study arms while subjects registered at self-identified EBRT-
      study sites will be randomized 1:1 between all actively accruing study arms except the
      durvalumab + EBRT arm.

      Subgroup Enrollment Caps:

      Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.

      Treatment Plan:

      Phase I:

      Upon successful screening and registration, enrollment to durvalumab monotherapy (cohort 1)
      will begin. If DLT criteria are exceeded with durvalumab monotherapy (cohort 1), the study
      will close. Provided the safety of durvalumab monotherapy is established, enrollment to
      durvalumab plus BCG (cohort 2a) and durvalumab plus external beam radiation therapy (cohort
      2b) will proceed.

      Within the durvalumab plus BCG arm (cohort 2a), treatment will begin at full-dose BCG. If the
      safety of durvalumab plus full-dose BCG (cohort 2a) is established, enrollment to durvalumab
      plus full-dose BCG will continue in Phase 2 of the study. If DLT criteria are exceeded with
      durvalumab plus full-dose BCG (cohort 2a), a one level dose reduction of BCG will be
      implemented. If DLT criteria are exceeded with durvalumab plus reduced-dose BCG (cohort 2a),
      the durvalumab plus reduced-dose BCG arm will not proceed to Phase 2 of the study. Similarly,
      if DLT criteria are exceeded within the durvalumab plus EBRT arm (cohort 2b), no radiation
      dose reductions are planned and the durvalumab plus EBRT arm will not proceed to Phase 2 of
      the study. Due to the prolonged half-life of antibody therapies, no dose adjustments are
      planned for durvalumab in any of the study arms.

      Durvalumab Monotherapy (cohort 1):

      Durvalumab 1120 mg intravenously Day 1 every 21 days x 8 cycles. Infuse over 60 minutes (± 5
      minutes).

      Durvalumab plus BCG (cohort 2a):

      Durvalumab 1120 mg intravenously Day 1 every 21 days x 8 cycles. Infuse over 60 minutes (± 5
      minutes).

      BCG re-treatment intravesical weekly x 6 doses. BCG maintenance to be administered according
      to SWOG 8507 schedule.

      Durvalumab plus External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) (cohort 2b) Durvalumab 1120 mg
      intravenously Day 1 every 21 days x 8 cycles. Infuse over 60 minutes (± 5 minutes).

      EBRT 6 Gy x 3; Cycle 1 Day 1, 3, and 5.

      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT):

      Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be examined within each arm within Phase 1 of the study.

      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D):

      Each arm examined within Phase 1 will establish the RP2D for use in Phase 2 of the study
      according to the following parameters:

        -  Within the durvalumab monotherapy arm (cohort 1), subjects will be enrolled in a 3+3
           design starting at dose level 0 (Table 2). If &lt; 1 out of 3 subjects experience DLT, dose
           level 0 will be declared the RP2D for durvalumab monotherapy. If 1 out of 3 subjects
           experience DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at dose level 0. If &lt; 2 out of
           6 subjects experience DLT, dose level 0 will be declared the RP2D for durvalumab
           monotherapy. If &gt; 2 out of 6 subjects experience DLT, a RP2D will not be established and
           the study will close.

      Within the durvalumab plus BCG arm (cohort 2a), subjects will be enrolled in a 6+3+3 design
      starting at dose level 0. If &lt; 2 out of 6 subjects experience DLT, an additional 3 subjects
      will be enrolled at dose level 0. If &lt; 4 out of 9 subjects experience DLT, an additional 3
      subjects will be enrolled. If &lt; 5 out of 12 patients experience DLT, dose level 0 will be
      declared the RP2D for durvalumab plus BCG. If &gt; 2 out of 6, &gt; 4 out of 9, or &gt; 5 out of 12
      subjects experience DLT, an additional group of durvalumab plus BCG patients will be enrolled
      at dose level -1. If &lt; 2 out of 6 subjects experience DLT, an additional 3 subjects will be
      enrolled at dose level -1. If &lt; 4 out of 9 subjects experience DLT, an additional 3 subjects
      will be enrolled at dose level -1. If &lt; 5 out of 12 patients experience DLT, dose level -1
      will be declared the RP2D for durvalumab plus BCG. If &gt; 2 out of 6, &gt; 4 out of 9, or &gt; 5 out
      of 12 subjects experience DLT, a RP2D will not be established and the durvalumab plus BCG arm
      will not proceed to Phase 2 of the study.

      Within the durvalumab plus EBRT arm (cohort 2b), subjects will be enrolled in a 6+3+3 design
      starting at dose level 0. If &lt; 2 out of 6 subjects experience DLT, an additional 3 subjects
      will be enrolled at dose level 0. If &lt; 4 out of 9 subjects experience DLT, an additional 3
      subjects will be enrolled. If &lt; 5 out of 12 patients experience DLT, dose level 0 will be
      declared the RP2D for durvalumab plus EBRT. If &gt; 2 out of 6, &gt; 4 out of 9, or &gt; 5 out of 12
      subjects experience DLT, a RP2D will not be established and the durvalumab plus EBRT arm will
      not proceed to Phase 2 of the study.

      Phase 2:

      If either of the durvalumab plus BCG (cohort 2a) or the durvalumab plus EBRT (cohort 2b)
      establishes a RP2D in Phase 1 of the study, enrollment to Phase 2 of the study will proceed.
      Upon successful screening and registration, Phase 2 subjects will be randomized to one of the
      treatment arms. Randomization will occur amongst the arms that are open to accrual at the
      time of subject registration. With the exception of patients assigned to BCG re-treatment,
      treatment of Phase 2 subjects will be administered at the RP2D's established for each regimen
      within Phase 1 of the study. Given the established safety profile of BCG therapy, patients
      assigned to BCG re-treatment within Phase 2 of the study will be treated with full dose BCG
      (dose level 0).

      It is anticipated that individual treatment arms will be closed and added during the conduct
      of the study as arms complete accrual, individual arm safety data is analyzed, and new arms
      are added. Initially, three arms are proposed in Phase 2: durvalumab plus BCG, durvalumab
      plus EBRT, and BCG re-treatment. Enrollment to Phase 2 arms will not begin until at least one
      arm has successfully completed the Phase 1 safety evaluation and deemed safe to proceed to
      the Phase 2 portion of the trial.

      Cross-over to Durvalumab Monotherapy Option:

      Phase 2 patients assigned initially to BCG re-treatment who are noted to have persistent or
      recurrent high grade NMIBC (Tis, Ta, or T1) at any post-treatment study evaluation have
      converted their disease status from BCG-relapsing to BCG-unresponsive. Such patients continue
      to meet study eligibility criteria, they may cross-over to durvalumab monotherapy treatment.

      All Trial Phases:

      Cycle Length: A treatment cycle is defined as 21 days in all arms.

      Duration of Therapy:

      Regardless of the study arm a patient is assigned, study treatment will continue for a
      maximum of 24 weeks (8 cycles) from the cycle 1 day 1 date. For patients on BCG-containing
      arms, standard of care maintenance BCG treatment according to the SWOG 8507 schedule will
      continue for a maximum of 36 months.

      Intravesical BCG Administration:

      Induction BCG Administration:

      In all arms incorporating BCG therapy, induction intravesical BCG will be administered weekly
      x 6 doses starting on Cycle 1 Day 1 in the form of 1 freeze-dried/lyophilized vial (TheraCys®
      or TICE®) reconstituted in approximately 50 mL normal saline instilled via foley catheter
      into an empty bladder and maintained in the bladder for 1-2 hours before voiding. Treatment
      will begin at full-dose BCG. A one level dose reduction will be implemented if certain DLT
      criteria are met.

      Maintenance BCG Administration:

      In all arms incorporating BCG therapy, BCG maintenance according to the SWOG 8507 schedule is
      considered standard therapy following the initial 6-week study therapy induction portion
      (65). All patients on BCG-containing arms that have not relapsed in follow up should receive
      maintenance BCG weekly for 3 consecutive weeks given 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months
      after their initial BCG treatment. On BCG maintenance treatment days, BCG therapy will be
      administered in the form of 1 freeze-dried/lyophilized vial (TheraCys® or TICE®)
      reconstituted in approximately 50 mL normal saline instilled via foley catheter into an empty
      bladder and maintained in the bladder for 1-2 hours before voiding. Any decision to alter,
      abbreviate, or modify the standard BCG maintenance schedule is at the treating urologist's
      discretion. Any deviations from the standard BCG maintenance schedule will be recorded in the
      study database.

      External Beam Radiation Therapy Administration:

      All subjects receiving durvalumab + EBRT will begin radiation therapy within 56 days
      following the TURBT. Radiation therapy will consist of three individual 6 Gy fractions
      planned approximately on Days 1, 3, and 5 of Cycle 1 only. To accommodate regional variations
      in the proximity and scheduling complexities of multi-disciplinary clinics required for
      therapy, radiation therapy may be delivered on Day 1 ± 1 day and Day 3 ± 1 day provided the
      Day 1 and Day 3 fractions are separated by 1 day. Similarly, radiation therapy may be
      delivered on Day 5 ± 2 days provided the Day 3 and Day 5 fractions are separated by 1 day.
      This will give a total dose to the gross bladder of 18 Gy. Simulation and treatment on the
      same day is permitted. The overall schema is for small field pelvic irradiation given by 3D
      conformal irradiation to the entire bladder and prostatic urethra (in men). No radiation dose
      reductions are planned.
