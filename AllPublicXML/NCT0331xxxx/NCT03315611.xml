  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the effect of 'Eucerin AtopiControl LOTION' and
      'Eucerin AtopiControl facial cream' on dermal symptoms in patients with Atopic Dermatitis
      (AD) after two 4 h challenges with grass pollen on two consecutive days. In addition, this
      clinical study with exposure of Dactyls glomerate-sensitized Patients with AD shall be used
      to compare the skin response with AD Patients not-sensitized to Dactylis glomerata to
      understand the specificity of the grass pollen exposure.

      After the screening assessments the subject's whole skin will be treated for a period of 12
      days with either 'Eucerin AtopiControl LOTION' or 'Eucerin AtopiControl facial cream' or will
      receive no treatment until Day 1 of the study. All patients will be challenged for 4 hours on
      two consecutive days (Day1 and 2) with 4000 pollen grains/m³ of Dactylis glomerata pollen. In
      this study approximately 9 subjects will be placed in the Environmental Exposure Chamber
      (ECC) at a time. At screening a blood sample will be taken for determination mutations of
      genes encoding for skin barrier proteins (e.g. filaggrin mutation). At day 1 and day 5 blood
      samples (serum) will be taken for biomarker assessments and lymphocyte proliferation assays
      (peripheral blood). The severity of atopic dermatitis will be rated (blinded observer,
      trained dermatologist) applying the 'SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index, the objective
      SCORAD, local SCORAD and Investigator Global assessment (IGA). Assessment of itch and
      sleeplessness referring to the past 24 hous will be done by a blinded observer on each day
      including baseline assessments.
