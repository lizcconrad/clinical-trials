  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of JS-001 in subjects with
      recurrent malignant lymphoma, and to evaluate its preliminary efficacy.

      The secondary objectives are to: 1) characterize the single-dose and multi-dose
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JS-001, 2) characterize the immunogenicity of JS-001; 3)
      assess the dose-efficacy relationship of JS-001 single agent, and 4) preliminarily evaluate
      biomarkers associated with the efficacy of JS-001.
