    <textblock>
      Programmed death-1 receptor ligand (PD-L1) the ligand for PD-1 is a key therapeutic target in
      the reactivation of the immune response against multiple cancers. Pharmacologic inhibitors of
      PD-1 have also demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity and are currently under active
      clinical exploration. avelumab (MSB0010718C; anti-PD-L1 is a fully human anti-PD-L1 igG1
      antibody that has shown promising efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in multiple tumor
      types.

      Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the mainstream treatments of cancer therapy along with
      surgery and chemotherapy, yet RT is the only treatment that does not leave the patients
      immunocompromised (unlike chemotherapy) and keeps the dying tumor / antigen depot within the
      host (unlike surgery), providing an opportunity for antigen presentation. Therefore, RT is a
      rational choice to combine with immunotherapy for cancer treatment.

      Screening/Baseline Procedures Assessments performed exclusively to determine eligibility for
      this study will be done only after obtaining informed consent. Assessments performed for
      clinical indications (not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for
      baseline values even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.

        -  For patients who are still receiving Avelumab: Subject will be followed every eight
           weeks (+/- 2 weeks) starting from the beginning of treatment for the first year, then
           every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) till 2 years after last dose of drug The following
           procedures will be performed at each follow up:

             -  Physical exam, PS, vital signs, medication review, AE assessment

             -  Blood collection per time table and for labs

             -  Radiographic imaging: Tumor assessments will be completed by the investigator using
                the RECIST criteria as above.

                  -  CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, if allowable by renal function

                  -  After that, survival information will be collected every 6 months until
                     patient death.

        -  For patients who have been discontinued from Avelumab : Subject will be followed 30 days
           from last dose (±7 days, or may be on date of discontinuation ±7 days if the date of
           discontinuation is more than 37 days after last dose) and then 3-4 months from last
           dose.

      The following procedures will be performed at the first two visits:

        -  Physical exam, PS, vital signs, medication review, AE assessment

        -  Subsequent anti-cancer treatment/s

        -  For first visit only, or may repeat if study drug related toxicity persists: CBC w/
           differential, LFTs, BUN, creatinine, fasting glucose, and TSH

      After that, survival information will be collected every 6 months until patient death.
