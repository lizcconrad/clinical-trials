  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent headache is one of the most common debilitating symptoms in military personnel
      suffering from mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). This study aims to assess the long-term
      effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in managing MTBI related
      headaches for up to 2-3 months by comparing the treatment effect of active-rTMS to sham-rTMS.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduce the intensity, frequency and duration of MTBI-headaches</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed daily from baseline to the 3-month post-treatment follow up visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the headache diary log that tracks the intensity, frequency and duration of MTBI-headaches (MTBI-HA)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment Quality of Life scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the self-assessed short form impact on quality of life (SF-36). The SF-36 has eight scaled scores; the scores are weighted sums of the questions in each section. Scores range from 0 - 100 where Lower scores = more disability and higher scores = less disability The sections include: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment Depression scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the administered Hamilton Scale for Depression. This contains 17 items to be rated (HDRS-17), but four other questions are not added to the total score and are used to provide additional clinical information. Each item on the questionnaire is scored on a 3 or 5 point scale, depending on the item, and the total score is compared to the corresponding descriptor.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in attention scores from Baseline to Post-Treatment visits</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the Connors continuous performance test for sustained and selective attention. This is administered on a laptop and is automatically scored.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment Global Pain scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the self-assessed global pain inventory survey. Pain will be recorded at it's worst, it's best and on average over the previous 24 hours on a 0 to 10 scale. Then the pain's impact on general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relationships, sleep and enjoyment of life will be measured on a 0 to 10 scale and added together for an overall Global Pain score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the administered CAPS, a structured interview designed to make a categorical PTSD diagnosis, as well as to provide a measure of PTSD symptom severity. The symptoms are rated for both frequency and intensity; these two scores are summed to provide severity ratings.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment memory scores</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT-R) for memory. When scoring the HVLT-R, the three learning trials are combined to calculate a total recall score and the delayed recall trial creates the delayed recall score.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-Treatment Executive Functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>The measure will be assessed at the Baseline visit, 1-Week, 1-Month, 2-Month and 3-month post-treatment follow up visits.</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be quantified through the Trail Making Test A and B and Stroop Test for executive functioning. The Trail Making Test consists of two parts in which the subject is instructed to connect a set of 25 dots as quickly as possible while still maintaining accuracy. And the Stroop Test is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Explore the treatment effect on the pain related network of the brain</measure>
    <time_frame>Subjects will have 2 functional magnetic imaging scans, at baseline and then at the 1-week post treatment follow-up.</time_frame>
