    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the sequential therapy with
      whole lung Lavage (WLL)/inhaling granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, compared
      to WLL only, for adult patients with severe autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in
      China over a two-year period.

    <description>The standard of relapse: the condition of the disease after GM-CSF inhalation meeted the standard of effective treatment or the stability criteria, and then the condition deteriorated and meeted the deteriorate standard. The standard of effective treatment: oxygenation improvement (an increase in PaO2 of more than 10mmHg and / or a reduction in A-aDO2 more than 10mmHg). The stability criteria: an increase or a reduction in PaO2 of less than 10mmHg and / a reduction or an increase in A-aDO2 of less than 10mmHg. The deteriorate standard: deteriorate oxygenation (a reduction in PaO2 of more than 10mmHg and / or an increase in A-aDO2 of more than 10mmHg).</description>

Induction period: The time of beginning is 1 week after whole lung lavage, aerosolized GM-CSF was given for 7 days (150ug bid), and then the durg was stopped for 7 days, the 2 weeks was designed as a cycle, a total of 6 cycles (3 months) were known as the induction period.
Maintenance period: maintenance period came up after the induction period. The dose of aerosolized GM-CSF was reduced to 150ug/d for three times a week, and then the durg was stopped for 7 days, the 2 weeks was designed as a cycle and maintenance period lasted for 9 months.</description>
