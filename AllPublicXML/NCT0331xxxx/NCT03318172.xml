    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore which mode is effective in the management of
      intractable chronic pain, the high-density stimulation or the conventional stimulation, in
      patients who undergo SCS implantation after successful pre-implantation SCS trial.

    <textblock>
      Since its introduction in 1967 (1), spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has become a
      well-established modality for the treatment of chronic neuropathic back and leg pain,
      including postlaminectomy syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, ext. (2-5) The mechanism
      of action remains poorly understood but is thought to involve a combination of local neural
      inhibition, excitation of nearby axons, changes in neurotransmitter physiology, and jamming
      of pathological network activity by masking intrinsic patterns of neural activity (6). It is
      generally agreed that a sensory percept (paresthesia) covering the region of pain is required
      in order to achieve maximal effectiveness (3,7), and as a result, conventional SCS settings
      typically consist of intermediate frequencies (40-60 Hz), relatively long pulse width
      (300-500 μsec), and amplitude high enough to induce a sensory percept in the distribution of
      the patient's pain (2,3,5). However, paresthesia can produce some degree of discomfort,
      particularly with changes in position and variability of activities (8). Consequently,
      sometimes there is a trade-off between pain relief and paresthesia discomfort, and the
      clinical benefits can be offset by the side-effects of the stimulation. Recent studies have
      attempted to deliver energy to the spinal cord below the threshold for paresthesia
      (&quot;paresthesia-free&quot; stimulation), with variable degrees of success in the control of
      neuropathic pain. For example, De Ridder et al. described &quot;burst&quot; stimulation (trains of five
      pulses) in 12 patients, resulting in paresthesia-free pain relief that was superior to
      conventional settings (9). In a multicenter prospective study, Al-Kaisy et al. evaluated 10
      kHz SCS (HFSCS) delivered below the sensory threshold and documented a long-term reduction in
      the mean intensity of chronic back pain (10). However, a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled crossover study comparing 5 kHz high-frequency subthreshold stimulation to
      placebo found no significant difference between the two modalities, with a tendency for
      better results during the first treatment administered, which suggests a strong placebo
      effect (11). Another randomized controlled, double-blinded, crossover study showed that
      subthreshold stimulation had significantly lower pain relief than the conventional,
      supra-threshold SCS (12). Notably, both studies included participants treated with
      conventional stimulation parameters and did not perform a &quot;trial&quot; to confirm that the study
      population would, in fact, demonstrate a response to subthreshold stimulation. Most
      systematic studies of paresthesia-free stimulation employed a high rate of energy delivery
      (high-density [HD] stimulation) that either required the development of specialized hardware
      (9,10) or modification of existing systems to allow parameters outside of normal clinical use
      (11). However, it is possible that rechargeable stimulators currently in widespread use may
      be able to deliver sufficient energy to accomplish pain relief without paresthesia in
      appropriately selected patients. Additionally, response to subthreshold stimulation might be
      heterogeneous in unpredictable ways, which implies that there might be a subset of patients
      who respond to the therapy better than others.

The IADL scale includes 8 categories labeled from A to H (A. Ability to Use Telephone, B. Shopping, C. Food preparation, D. Housekeeping, E. Laundry, F. Mode of transportation, G. Responsibility for Own Medication and H. Ability to Handle Finances). For each category, the patient should mark the description that resembles the highest functional level (either 0 or 1). A summary score ranges from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent) for women and 0 through 5 for men to avoid potential gender bias.</description>

Includes a screening question about the pain on the day, pain drawing diagrams, four items about pain intensity (worst pain, least pain, average pain, pain right now), two items on pain relief treatment or medication, and one item on pain interference, with seven sub-items (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal walk, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life). Each item for pain severity is rated from 0, no pain, to 10, pain as bad as you can imagine, and contributes with the same weight to the final score (0 to 40). The seven subitems of pain interference are rated from 0, does not interfere, to 10, completely interferes, and contributes with the same weight to the final score (0 to 70). The first item, pain drawing diagrams and the items on pain relief treatment or medication do not contribute to the scoring.</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening and follow up at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing is characterized by the tendency to magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus and to feel helpless in the presence of pain, as well as by a relative inability to prevent or inhibit pain-related thoughts in anticipation of, during, or following a painful event. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a 13-item instrument derived from definitions of catastrophizing described in the literature. The PCS ask participants to reflect on past painful experiences, and to indicate the degree to which they experienced each of 13 thoughts or feelings when experiencing pain, on 5-point scales from (0) not at all and (4) all the time. The PCS total score is computed by summing responses to all 13 items, total scores range from 0 - 52. The PCS subscales are computed as follows:
Rumination: Sum of items 8, 9, 10, 11 Magnification: Sum of items 6, 7, 13 Helplessness: Sum of items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12 Total score &lt;30= Negative and ≥30= Positive for catastrophizing</description>

    <description>Resilience embodies the personal qualities that enable one to thrive in the face of adversity. The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) contains 25 items, all of which carry a 5-point range of responses, as follows: not true at all (0), rarely true (1), sometimes true (2), often true (3), and true nearly all the time (4). The scale is rated based on how the subject has felt over the past month.
The total score ranges from 0-100, with higher scores reflecting greater resilience.</description>

The ideal treatment with SCS will be a total coverage of the pain area, however, sometimes the covered area does not perfectly match with the stimulated area (less or more area). Therefore, a simple drawing of a human body will be presented to the patients who will draw the area of pain and then the coverage of the SCS to compare and analyze the changes throughout the study.</description>

    <description>The difference between the randomization, crossover and follow-up visits (total of 6 evaluation) by asking patient to indicate the threshold at which he or she experiences paresthesia. The SCS transmitter allows several intensity levels which are tested before setting the SCS mode. Usually, the intensity level is tested from lowest and slowly increased until the patient experience paresthesia. Paresthesia threshold is different from patient to patient and it might change along time. Therefore, the intensity level marked by the SCS transmitter where the patient experienced the paresthesia will be recorded to evaluate the changes during the study period.</description>
