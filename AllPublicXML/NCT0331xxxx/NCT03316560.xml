  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated virus
      vector expressing a human RPGR-ORF15 gene (rAAV2tYF-GRK1-RPGR) in patients with X-linked
      retinitis pigmentosa caused by RPGR-ORF15 mutations. Approximately 15 participants will be
      enrolled and 3 dose levels will be evaluated in a dose-escalation format.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a non-randomized, open-label, Phase 1/2 dose escalation study.

      Approximately 15 participants will be enrolled. Each participant will receive the study agent
      by subretinal injection in one eye on a single occasion. Enrollment will begin with the
      lowest dose and will proceed to higher doses only after review of safety data by a Data and
      Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Participants in the dose escalation phase will be ≥ 18
      years of age. After the maximum tolerated dose is identified individuals ≥ 6 years of age
      will be enrolled.

      Safety will be measured by the number and proportion of participants experiencing ocular and
      non-ocular adverse events or abnormal clinically relevant hematology or clinical chemistry
      parameters. Efficacy will be measured by evaluation of changes in visual structure, function,
      and quality of life.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects with the clinical diagnosis of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) and
             a documented molecular diagnosis from a CLIA-certified laboratory of mutation within
             the ORF15 exon of the RPGR gene;

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50 (65 ETDRS letters) or worse in the study eye for
             Groups 1-3; and best-corrected visual acuity of 20/32 (75 ETDRS letters) or worse in
             the study eye for Group 4;

          -  Ability to perform tests of visual and retinal function and structure and ability to
             comply with other research procedures;

          -  Detectable remaining vision at the intended bleb region;

          -  Good general health based on a complete physical examination and hematology and
             clinical chemistry studies performed at a pre-treatment evaluation;

          -  Signed informed consent and assent (if necessary) obtained before screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing eye conditions that would preclude the planned surgery or interfere with

             vasculitis);

          -  Complicating systemic diseases (such as medical conditions causing immunosuppression
             or known sensitivity or allergy to medications planned for use in the peri-operative
             period) that would preclude the gene transfer or ocular surgery;

          -  Use of anti-coagulant agents that may alter coagulation within 7 days prior to study
             agent administration;

          -  Use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications within 3 months
             prior to enrollment;

          -  Males who are unwilling to use barrier contraception for 3 months following agent
             administration;

          -  Any other condition that would prevent a subject from completing follow-up
             examinations during the course of the study;

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, makes the subject
             unsuitable for the study;

          -  Current, or recent (the longer of 90 days or 10 half-lives of the drug) participation,
             in any other research protocol involving investigational agents or therapies;

          -  Previous receipt of any AAV gene therapy product;

          -  Study personnel or family members of the study personnel;

          -  Monocular or having BCVA less than 20/800 in the fellow eye.
