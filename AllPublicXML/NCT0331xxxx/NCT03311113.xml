  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone and joint infection (BJI) are bacterial infections that can occur after surgery
      (nosocomial infections) or de novo. They constitute a public health problem in Western
      Countries . These infections are often difficult to treat, with a high rate of
      re-hospitalizations (19.5%) caused by relapses or recurrences. The treatment of Bone and
      joint infection can be surgical and / or pharmacological . Drug treatment is based on the use
      of parenteral and / or oral antibiotics. It is a curative therapy in most cases, with a
      prolonged duration ranging from 6 weeks to several months depending on the lesions .

      Medication adherence, is a patients' behavior defined as drug intake with optimal attendance
      and regularity, as prescribed and explained by the physician. It is a key factor in the
      success of any drug therapy, as drugs don't work in patients who don't take them..

      To the knowledge of investigators, there are no published data on the adherence to antibiotic
      therapy in patients treated for Bone and joint infection. In addition to its prolonged
      duration, the antibiotic treatment of the Osteoarticular Infections may require several daily
      drug intakes and may be responsible for severe adverse effects, these three factors being
      known to adversely affect adherence.

      Prevalence, adherence patterns over time and determinants of adherence in this patient
      population are not known. Currently, drug adherence is not routinely evaluated and is not
      considered in the treatment of Bone and joint infection in the Regional Center for Complex
      Bone and joint infection of the investigators.

      A specific study evaluating adherence to antibiotic therapy in patients treated for Bone and
      joint infection appears to be justified.

    <description>Adherence will be assessed using a questionnaire adapted from the questionnaire of Girerd et al. with 6 questions. Adherence will be assessed during the antibiotic treatment, after 6 weeks of therapy in all patients included. For the included patients still treated at 3 months, it will be evaluated a second time at 3 months.</description>

    <description>Adherence to oral antibiotic therapy will be assessed by means of a questionnaire adapted from the French standardized self-assessment questionnaire of Girerd et al. This questionnaire has six questions, each question being associated with a score. Patient's drug adherence is classified into three groups based on the total score: of high, moderate and poor adherence. The questionnaire will be carried by a phone call to the patient.</description>
