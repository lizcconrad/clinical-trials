  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As mental disorders constitute a core health care challenge of the 21th century, increased
      research efforts on preventive interventions are indispensable. In the field of clinical
      psychology, indicated preventive interventions targeted to those with initial symptomatology
      appear particularly promising. Applied relaxation (AR) is a well-established intervention
      technique proven to effectively reduce tension/distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms in
      the context of treatment of a wide variety of manifest mental disorders as well as somatic
      illnesses. However, it has not been studied so far whether AR as indicated preventive
      intervention in subjects with initial symptomatology but no full-threshold mental disorder
      yet is capable to prevent a further symptom escalation. This randomized controlled trial in
      subjects with elevated tension/distress, anxiety or depressive symptomatology aims to
      investigate whether an AR intervention (10 sessions à 60 min) can (a) effectively reduce
      present psychopathological symptoms as well as (b) prevent a further symptom progression to
      full-threshold DSM-5 mental disorders. Putative mediators (physiological, emotional,
      cognitive and behavioral changes including heart rate and heart rate variability, hair and
      salivary cortisol secretion, affectivity, self-efficacy, internal locus of control and
      cognitive / behavioral coping) and moderators (sex, age, symptom severity at baseline and
      homework adherence during the intervention course) of the intervention/preventive efficacy
      will be additionally studied. Predictor and outcome measures will be assessed both
      conventionally (via personal interview, questionnaires and physiological measures during the
      respective main assessment) and with ecological momentary assessments (EMA, applied via smart
      phone over a 1-week interval following the respective main assessment) in everyday life.
