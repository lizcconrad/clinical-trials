  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to know if different imaging devices can improve the quality of
      images and visualization of imaged tissues. Also, the investigators would like to find out
      whether these changes are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. Using images
      of previous participants will allow us to demonstrate the advancement of different
      technologies, as well be used to allow comparisons between current technologies.
