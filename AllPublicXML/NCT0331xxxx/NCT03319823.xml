    <textblock>
      This is a protocol to obtain pilot data to submit a new NIH grant on Nocturnal Hypertension
      and Nocturia. In the diversity supplement to Dr. Victor's current NIH grant (Cut Your
      Pressure Too: The Los Angeles Barbershop Blood Pressure Study) the results show that
      uncontrolled systolic hypertension is an independent determinant of nocturia in African
      American men.

      the investigators now want to pursue this correlation by designing a new NIH grant proposal
      to determine whether replacing short acting with long acting drugs and dosing them at bedtime
      rather than in the morning will: A. Lower systolic blood pressure during sleep B. Improve
      nocturia and result in better sleep quality

      Aims and Significance of pilot data

      Determine:

        1. The feasibility of the Southern California Healthy Heart and Blood Pressure registry as
           an effective method to recruit African American men to participate in a new research
           program

        2. If participants are willing to comply with the study procedures including wearing an
           activity monitor, sleep study device, and ambulatory blood pressure monitor

        3. The within subject variation for repeated measures of nocturnal blood pressure by
           ambulatory blood pressure and activity monitoring

        4. If nocturnal systolic blood pressure is higher in men with self-reported nocturia ≥2
           than in men with 0-1 nocturia

        5. If use of long-acting antihypertensive medication as well as nighttime dosing of
           medication can lower nocturnal systolic blood pressure and reduce nocturia

      Purpose:

      Obtain key pilot data to show feasibility and document the reproducibility of the proposed
      measurements.

Participants who meet the inclusion criteria will be contacted by the study team. The purpose of the study will be explained, and they will be asked to sign an informed consent form. Based on their nocturnal systolic blood pressure, the investigators will assign participants to one of two treatment groups:
Group (1): Thiazide Therapy Group: Men without diabetes, and mild hypertension - a sleeping systolic blood pressure of 125-139 mm Hg, and an awake average blood pressure of &lt; 160 mm Hg.
Group (2): Combination Therapy Group: Men with diabetes, or with more severe hypertension - a sleeping blood pressure of ≥ 140 mm Hg, or an awake average blood pressure of ≥ 160 mm Hg.</intervention_model_description>

In two week intervals, labs and ambulatory blood pressure will be measured.

After 2 weeks, the investigators will monitor chemistries/electrolytes with a fingerstick point of care device and repeat ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
If sleep systolic blood pressure is &lt; 120 mm Hg, the investigators will continue treatment and repeat ambulatory blood pressure again in another 2 weeks to assess reproducibility
