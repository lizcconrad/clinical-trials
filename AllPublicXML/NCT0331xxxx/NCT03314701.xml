  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest trauma is the most common injury in the emergency trauma and rib fractures is the most
      common trauma in chest trauma. Severe rib fractures can cause paradoxical respiration and
      mediastinal swing, which has large effects on respiratory and circulatory system, result in
      acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mechanical ventilation can significantly improve the
      hypoxemia of the patients, correct paradoxical respiration, and treat the pulmonary
      atelectasis

      To compare between Biphasic Intermittent Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) ventilation and
      Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode in patients with multiple fracture ribs as
      regard:

        -  Resting Energy Expenditure

        -  Oxygenation

        -  Stability of Physiological Status as cardiovascular activity

        -  cardiac output

        -  arterial blood gas measurement including [ blood PH, arterial oxygen tension, arterial
           carbon dioxide tension, bicarbonate level and base deficit]

        -  lung and chest compliance

        -  Length of intensive care unit stay.

        -  The ICU mortality rate.

        -  The development of major complications as nosocomial infection (hospital acquired
           pneumonia and ventilator associated pneumonia), major atelectasis and pneumothorax.

    <description>Biphasic Intermittent Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) group:
Following endotracheal intubation BIPAP mode will be started with:

PRESSURE SUPPORT is difference between these two pressures [IPAP]- [EPAP]
Mandatory pressure will be delivered at rate of 10-12/min. To produce an end tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure in the range of 35-40 mmHg hypercapnia will not be allowed</description>
