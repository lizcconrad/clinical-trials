  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigated whether there were improvements in the in-hospital mortality,
      infection rate, and rate of palliative care among geriatric trauma patients after the
      implementation of new standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the resuscitation room. These
      new SOPs, comprising early whole-body computed tomography (CT), damage control surgery, and
      the use of goal-directed coagulation management, were designed for severely injured adult
      trauma patients

      This study involved the analysis of a prospective single-centre database. Patients admitted
      via the resuscitation room with need for intensive care treatment after the resuscitation
      room phase were included and compared before the implementation of the new SOPs (between 1
      January, 2000 and 31 December, 2006) and after their implementation in 2009 (between 1
      January, 2010 and 31 December, 2012) of our level-I trauma centre.
