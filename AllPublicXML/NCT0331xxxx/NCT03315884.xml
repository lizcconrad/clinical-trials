      According to the recommendations of the Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) statement and the Russian guidelines for limb ischemia
      treatment (2010), reconstructive surgery is preferred for type D lesions. Patients with type
      C lesions can be managed by either stenting or bypass surgery. Despite the fact that
      aorta-femoral reconstructions long-term results are better than the diffuse aorta-iliac
      lesions endovascular treatment results, the surgery risk is significantly higher than the
      endovascular surgery risk regarding criteria of mortality, complications, and return to
      normal activity.

      All reports of iliac arteries stenosis percutaneous angioplasty indicate that the primary
      technical and clinical success rate exceeds 90%. The figure reaches 100% in the case of local
      lesions. The technical success of iliac arteries long occlusions recanalization reaches
      80-85%. Improvement of endovascular equipment designed for the total occlusions treatment
      increases technical success of recanalization. The TASC II materials summarize the several
      large studies results which present the data on the operated segment artery patency at the
      level of 70-81% within 5-8 years of follow up. A large number of authors note the actuality
      of aortic-iliac type C and D segment lesions endovascular treatment recommendations revision
      according to the TASC II.

    <description>Retrograde femoral access. Brachial access. Standard endovascular access is performed under local anesthesia and affected arterial segment is visualized. Stenosis or artery occlusion is passed with hydrophilic guide. In case of occlusion transluminal or subintimal (often &quot;mixed&quot;) artery recanalization is performed. To maximize the preservation of the affected artery initial patency, occlusion recanalization is performed by ante-and retrograde accesses. Then stenosis or occlusion predilation is performed with balloon catheter (balloon catheter diameter is smaller than the affected artery diameter for 1-2 mm). After control angiography stent is installed in the aorta-iliac area throughout the lesion (lesion diameter corresponds to the stenotic arteries diameter). In aorta-iliac zone balloon-expandable and self-expandable stents are used.</description>

    <description>Standard access to the CFA is performed. Outflow ways and CFA capability for reconstruction are determined. The puncture of the general CFA (retrograde) is performed and the introducer 7Fr. is set. Recanalization of iliac artery occlusion. It is necessary to cross the iliac occlusion in a retrograde fashion first and secure aortic inflow before making the arteriotomy. An ipsilateral, a contralateral and a brachial approaches are used depending on the clinical situation. If the retrograde access to the aorta failed, you use the antegrade crossing of the iliac occlusion with no intention to reenter the lumen in the CFA. After the recanalization and balloon angioplasty of iliac artery we completed the procedure with endarterectomy of CFA, patch closure and iliac stenting. The preference is to perform endarterectomy and patch before iliac stenting because it can be difficult to access the true lumen in a difficult CFA lesion. Controlling angiography were performed. Closing approach.</description>
