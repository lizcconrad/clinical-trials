  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, observational study to demonstrate the clinical
      validity of the Intrinsic LifeSciences (ILS) Intrinsic Hepcidin IDx™ Test in the diagnosis
      and management of iron deficiency (ID) in adolescents and young adults. This test is
      considered non-significant risk.

    <description>ILS scientists developed the bioanalytical method for quantitation of human serum hepcidin using a Beckman FX automated liquid handling platform. The method uses a competitive ELISA format that has a proprietary sensitive and specific monoclonal antibody to hepcidin that captures native hepcidin in a sample. During the reaction a competition between a synthetic, bioactive, biotinylated hepcidin tracer and native hepcidin occurs. Bound biotinylated tracer is detected with a streptavidin-HRP conjugate and TMB substrate. Quantitation is based on an eight-point standard curve using validated, synthetic hepcidin calibrators. The standard curve and the hepcidin concentrations of patients samples are calculated using 4-parameter logistic curve fitting (Prism; Graphpad, Inc., La Jolla, CA). Serum hepcidin concentrations are expressed in ng/ml serum.</description>

      Any remaining blood, serum or plasma specimens will be stored in a deidentified fashion in an
      annotated repository at IntrinsicDX for future research on ID and anemia to be conducted by
      the participating investigators. The key to the deidentified specimens will be held at BCH
      and will not be shared with the sponsor. After the primary study has been published, the data
      will be anonymized by destroying any deidentifier keys.
