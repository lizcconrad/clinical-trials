    <textblock>
      The aims of the current study are: 1) to pilot a manualized intervention (INSPIRE - Inspiring
      Nutritious Selections and Positive Intentions Regarding Eating and Exercise) to determine
      feasibility and acceptability, and 2) to evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of INSPIRE on
      physical and psychological variables.

      The purpose of the current study is to implement an evidence-based prevention program to
      promote positive health behaviors among young adult women. It will be one of the first to
      intentionally execute a prevention program targeting well-established risk factors for both
      obesity and eating disorders in this high-risk population. Intervention content focuses on
      promoting body size diversity and emphasizing positive health and behavior change in order to
      reduce stigmatization and remain sensitive to weight-related issues. The manual was developed
      by integrating two successful existing prevention programs and expanding on previous
      prevention efforts. Specifically, the diversity of beauty ideals were highlighted to enhance
      relevance among ethnic minority women, and distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills
      training were included to target the maladaptive coping mechanisms young adults use to manage
      the stress associated with transitioning to college.

    <measure>Eating disorder behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in disordered eating behaviors will be assessed with the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. Participants will complete this one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

    <measure>Risk for obesity (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Weight will be measured (by trained staff) to the nearest ¼ kg using a digital scale and height will be measured to the nearest cm using a stadiometer; these measurements will be used to calculate BMI (kg/m2). Measurements will be taken one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

    <measure>Appearance Ideals</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in appearance ideals will be evaluated with the Body Image-Ideals Questionnaire, a self-report questionnaire that quantifies an individual's perceived discrepancy from and importance of internalized ideals for multiple physical attributes. Participants will complete this one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

    <measure>Emotion Regulation Difficulties</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in difficulty regulating emotions and tolerating distress will be assessed with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Participants will complete this one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthy Eating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in dietary intake will be assessed using the Block Food Screener, a self-report questionnaire that surveys the leading sources of fat, fiber, fruits, and vegetables in the diets of North Americans. Participants will complete this one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in physical activity during the past seven days will be assessed with the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall. This measures the frequency and duration of each physical activity performed throughout the day. Participants will complete this one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Thin-ideal internalization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in thin-ideal internalization will be assessed with the Ideal-Body Stereotype Scale - Revised. Participants will complete this one week before the program, one week after the program, and one month after the program.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to14 weeks</time_frame>
