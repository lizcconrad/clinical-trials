  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will explore whether treatment of eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus
      is associated with an improved distensibility of the esophagus. Furthermore, previous studies
      of the esophagus using EndoFlip only measured distensibility of the distal esophagus,
      specifically the distal esophagus and esophagogastric junction. Eosinophilia in EoE has been
      demonstrated to affect both upper, middle and lower esophagus. The aim is to measure
      distensibility both proximal and distal, before and after treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Presence of eosinophilia on esophageal biopsy, defined as a peak count of &gt; 15
        eosinophils per high power field (HPF) on light microscopy based on biopsies from at least
        2 of the 3 biopsy segments (upper, middle and distal esophagus)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Secondary causes of esophageal eosinophilia has been excluded, such as eosinophilic GI
             diseases, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, esophageal infection, hypereosinophilic
             syndrome, drug hypersensitivity, vasculitis, pemphigus, connective tissue diseases,
             graft vs. host disease

          2. Age &lt; 18 or &gt; 65 years

          3. Contraindication for biopsy, such as presence of esophageal varices, coagulopathy

          4. History of esophageal surgery, gastric or esophageal malignancy, anatomical
             abnormality, or major primary motility disorder (such as achalasia)
