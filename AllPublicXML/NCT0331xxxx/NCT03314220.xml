    <description>Participants in the experimental group received standard care plus our newly developed, multicomponent family-centered preoperative preparation program. This program included the following: (1) a tour of the preoperative area and recovery room; (2) a 4-min cartoon video entitled 'I am not afraid of surgery,' which was tailored to the child; this video included 29 scenes that depicted a boy's surgical journey with a particular emphasis on strategies for addressing postoperative pain; and (3) familiarization with medical equipment such as name badges, disposable hair caps, anesthetic masks, EKG leads, and pulse oximeters, which were placed on a doll, to help children understand the surgical instruments and promote better cooperation at the time of anesthesia induction.</description>
