      Epilepsy affects a significant number of children in the United States. The majority of
      patients achieve control of their seizures by conventional treatment strategies including
      medications. However, one third of patients do not achieve satisfactory seizure control with
      medications alone. Ketogenic diet and lifestyle modifications may also be tried. In some of
      these children, the seizure focus can be localized to one area of the brain and the seizures
      are resistant to conservative treatment strategies. These children may have subtle
      structural/developmental abnormalities in their brain, the most frequent of which is focal
      cortical dysplasia. These are localized areas of abnormal lamination of the cerebral cortex
      that can be extremely subtle and difficult to detect, even with state of the art magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI). More importantly, these lesions may be amenable to surgical
      resection resulting in marked decrease in frequency or even resolution of seizures.

      MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality without ionizing radiation that has played a central
      role in the assessment of anatomy, physiology/pathophysiology of children with epilepsy. It
      is particularly useful in children with refractory focal epilepsy. Prior studies have shown
      that high resolution, high-field (3T) MR imaging of the brain helps to identify subtle focal
      epileptogenic abnormalities, including focal cortical dysplasia, in some patients. However,
      there is scarce data directly comparing the performance of ultra high-field (7T) MRI,
      currently an investigative technique offering optimized contrast and signal-to-noise rations
      and superior spatial resolution, with clinically available 3T MR imaging.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ultra high-field (7T) MR imaging improves
      detection and characterization of subtle structural epileptogenic abnormalities in children
      with focal epilepsy.

      The importance of this research is that identification of a focal epileptogenic lesion in
      children with refractory epilepsy has fundamental management implications, as surgical
      removal of such lesion may dramatically improve outcomes and the chance of seizure freedom.

      1. Abstract Epilepsy affects a significant number of children in the United States. The
           majority of patients achieve control of their seizures by conventional treatment
           strategies including medications. However, one third of patients do not achieve
           satisfactory seizure control with medications alone. Ketogenic diet and lifestyle
           modifications may also be tried. In some of these children, the seizure focus can be
           localized to one area of the brain and the seizures are resistant to conservative
           treatment strategies. These children may have subtle structural/developmental
           abnormalities in their brain, the most frequent of which is focal cortical dysplasia.
           These are localized areas of abnormal lamination of the cerebral cortex that can be
           extremely subtle and difficult to detect, even with state of the art magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI). More importantly, these lesions may be amenable to surgical resection
           resulting in marked decrease in frequency or even resolution of seizures.

           MRI is a noninvasive imaging modality without ionizing radiation that has played a
           central role in the assessment of anatomy, physiology/pathophysiology of children with
           epilepsy. It is particularly useful in children with refractory focal epilepsy. Prior
           studies have shown that high resolution, high-field (3T) MR imaging of the brain helps
           to identify subtle focal epileptogenic abnormalities, including focal cortical
           dysplasia, in some patients. However, there is scarce data directly comparing the
           performance of ultra high-field (7T) MRI, currently an investigative technique offering
           optimized contrast and signal-to-noise rations and superior spatial resolution, with
           clinically available 3T MR imaging.

           The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether ultra high-field (7T) MR imaging
           improves detection and characterization of subtle structural epileptogenic abnormalities
           in children with focal epilepsy.

           The importance of this research is that identification of a focal epileptogenic lesion
           in children with refractory epilepsy has fundamental management implications, as
           surgical removal of such lesion may dramatically improve outcomes and the chance of
           seizure freedom.

        2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)

           The objectives of Investigators' project are:

           To evaluate the performance of 7T MRI in detecting structural abnormalities in children
           who have had 3T MRI-negative focal epilepsy.

           To characterize conventional and advanced neuroimaging features of epileptogenic lesions
           such as cortical dysplasias and neuroglial tumors at 7T MRI.

        3. Background High-resolution brain MRI is currently an integral component in the
           diagnostic evaluation of children with focal epilepsy. When focal epileptogenic
           abnormalities are identified, such as cortical dysplasia, the management strategy
           includes evaluation for potential surgical resection, which may dramatically improve
           outcome. The current clinical state of the art of 3T MRI has superior sensitivity over
           conventional 1.5T MRI. However focal cortical dysplasia remains one of the most common
           pathological diagnoses after pediatric epilepsy surgery, even when not detected by
           current MRI exams.

        4. Study Procedures

             1. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures. The
                investigators plan to perform 7T brain MRI in children with the diagnosis of
                epilepsy and findings on EEG suggestive of a focal structural abnormality. The 7T
                MRI exams will be performed at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) as part of their
                outpatient evaluation. The investigators plan to accrue approximately 50
                participants.

                Before recruiting children with epilepsy, approximately 2-10 healthy adult
                volunteers will be recruited for the purpose of optimizing the imaging acquisition
                protocol. These adults will be consented using a separate consent form, also
                attached to this application.

                Children will be eligible if they have already had a 3T MRI examination and do not
                have any contraindications to MR examinations. A consent form signed by the
                patients' parent/legal care giver will be required to indicate agreement to
                participate in the study. In addition, a consent form signed by the patient (if
                over 15 year of age) or an assent form signed by the patient (if between 8-15 years
                of age) will be required to indicate agreement to participate. Patient charts will
                be reviewed for history and diagnosis.

             2. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants. The
                anticipated duration of this study will be 2-5 years beginning in April 2017. The
                7T MRI exam will be performed in a single visit. This project may involve one
                additional trip to the hospital for patient subjects.

             3. Blinding, including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if
                applicable.

             4. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have
                current therapy stopped.

             5. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non-treatment group. N/A

             6. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria. Removal criteria
                will be defined as participants who are unable to tolerate the MR procedure due to
                previously unknown claustrophobia, inability to tolerate lying still for the exam
                period, or due to presence of ferromagnetic implants preventing imaging.

             7. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if
                a participant's participation in the study ends prematurely.

      Not applicable. This is not a treatment study.

      Data collection and management will be implemented with the following guidelines to ensure
      their confidentiality and safety:

        1. Confidentiality of Data: A master list separate from data forms that have only a study
           number will be used to maintain confidentiality of data.

        2. Security: The master list and backup copy will both be kept only on secure Johns Hopkins
           computers. Only de-identified data will be stored on a non-Johns Hopkins personal
           computer.

        3. Anonymization: The identifiers will be destroyed after publication. The other data will
           be retained for three years.

        4. Confidentiality: All data and records generated during this study will be kept
           confidential in accordance with Institutional policies and HIPAA on subject privacy and
           that the Investigator and other site personnel will not use such data and records for
           any purpose other than conducting the study. Safeguards are described under Data
           Collection and Management.

        5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

           a. Inclusion Criteria i. Male or female children between 6-21 years of age undergoing an
           MRI for focal epilepsy at the Johns Hopkins Hospital OR ii. Adult healthy volunteer.
           iii. Willing to undergo an additional MRI exam in the 7T scanner at Kennedy Krieger
           Institute.

           b. Exclusion Criteria i. Presence of any contraindication to MR examinations as defined
           by MRI Safety Screening Sheet ii. History of Metal in the Skull/Eyes iii. Pregnancy at
           the time of the scan iv. Patient subjects in unstable clinical condition

        6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices

             1. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.

                Only patients with a clinical indication for brain MRI examination will undergo 7T
                MRI. All examinations will be performed without intravenous contrast and in an
                outpatient setting, without the need for deep sedation or general anesthesia.
                Although classified by FDA as an investigational device, the 7T MR system has been
                ruled as a non-significant risk device by the same agency. This finding is
                stipulated in Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff --Criteria for Significant Risk
                Investigations of Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices issued July 14, 2003. A
                copy of the ruling has been uploaded in Section 3.0 for your review. In well over
                1000 studies done at 7T in the last decade at multiple institutions (University of
                Minnesota, Massachusetts General Hospital, NIH), no significant risks have been
                found. Some subjects have experienced dizziness. A potential concern with MR
                studies at high fields is radiofrequency heating due to radiofrequency power
                deposition in the subject. The FDA has set strict guidelines to guard against this
                risk. Such power deposition increases with the square of the magnetic field
                strength. However, even at 7T it is possible to stay well within these guidelines,
                especially with the pulse sequences the investigators will employ. To be 100% sure
                of compliance with FDA guidelines, the software of the manufacturer monitors power
                deposition continuously and scans are not possible to implement if the power
                deposition would exceed guidelines.

                Documents have been uploaded in Section 3.0 regarding federal guidelines supporting
                the position that a 7 Tesla MR scanner represents no significant risk to human
                subjects.

                Theoretical concepts and prior clinical studies justify the interest in applying
                high-resolution, ultra high-field MRI as a tool to evaluate detailed brain anatomy
                and physiology in children with focal epilepsy. Most studies comparing the
                diagnostic yield of 3T versus 1.5T imaging in detecting structural lesions in
                patients with focal epilepsy reached positive conclusions concerning the rates of
                newly detected lesions at 3T Very few comparative studies have investigated the
                diagnostic yield of 7T with respect to conventional MRI, however these included
                both examinations performed at 1.5T and at 3T.

                The employment of 7T MRI provides superior capability in characterizing anatomical
                and physiological brain parameters. In collaboration with MR physicists affiliated
                with Johns Hopkins and with Kennedy Krieger Institute, our imaging acquisition
                protocol should include:

                  -  High-resolution anatomical sequences, such as volumetric T1-weighted MP2RAGE
                     and 2D gray-white tissue border enhancement (TBE) Fast Spin Echo
                     (FSE)-Inversion Recovery (IR). These images are optimal for evaluating the
                     interface between the cortex and the juxtacortical white matter when
                     attempting to detect subtle focal cortical dysplasias, an important cause of
                     focal refractory epilepsy in children.

                  -  Susceptibility-weighted imaging. 7T has been shown to offer superior
                     sensitivity in detecting abnormal blood products and iron deposition in the
                     cerebral parenchyma, in addition to the exquisite depiction of the normal and
                     abnormal cerebral venous anomaly. These images may also be used for subjective
                     evaluation of oxygen extraction fraction in the brain, and for quantitative
                     mapping of iron deposition.

                  -  Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). Both
                     techniques explore the diffusivity of water molecules in the intra- and
                     extracellular spaces of the brain, along with the directionality of movement.
                     The acquisition generates parameters of white matter integrity and anisotropy,
                     including mean diffusivity, longitudinal and radial diffusivity, and
                     fractional anisotropy. With this information, detailed in vivo maps of white
                     matter fibers (tractography) can be produced, as well as maps of anatomic
                     connectivity (connectome). DKI is a novel diffusion imaging technique that
                     explores the non-Gaussian distribution of white matter molecules and is able
                     to further characterize the complexity of white matter microstructure. DKI has
                     thus far been scarcely explored in the study of pediatric neurological
                     disorders.

                  -  Resting-state functional MRI. Several studies have shown disturbance of
                     functional pathways in children with focal refractory epilepsy. This technique
                     relies on the blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect, does not require
                     tasks as in other Functional MRI (fMRI) acquisitions, and can be postprocessed
                     to generate maps of functional connectivity.

                  -  MR Spectroscopy (MRS): 1H MRS is a noninvasive imaging technique that can
                     easily be added to the conventional MRI sequences and is able to measure
                     metabolism in the brain. Metabolic changes arising from pathology that can be
                     visualized by MRS may not be apparent from anatomy. During a seizure, the
                     metabolic demands exceed the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the portion of
                     the brain that is undergoing the enhanced electric activity. Under these
                     circumstances, metabolic changes can be detected by MRS, including the
                     production of lactate and, if prolonged, the reduction of N-Acetyl Aspartate
                     (NAA), and an increase in Cho. These abnormalities can still be observed after
                     seizure activity ceases. Another common clinical scenario for the use of MRS
                     is temporal-lobe epilepsy (TLE) to help localize the source of the seizures.

                Images acquired from 7T MRI examinations will not be used in isolation to guide
                patient care. In the event that 7T discloses a focal structural abnormality of the
                brain that was not detected at 3T MRI, this finding will be evaluated by a
                multidisciplinary team responsible for care of the particular patient. Management
                decisions will then be suggested to the patient and family considering all the
                clinical, electrographic, and neuroimaging data available.

             2. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for
                non-FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant
                populations are changed.

             3. Justification and safety information if non-FDA approved drugs without an
                Investigational New Drug (IND) will be administered.

        7. Study Statistics

             1. Primary outcome variable. The primary outcome variable is the sensitivity of 7T
                brain MRI in the detection of subtle cortical abnormalities in children with focal
                epilepsy.

             2. Secondary outcome variables. The secondary outcome variables include subjective
                characterization of subtle epileptogenic lesions, and quantitative metrics from
                advanced MR sequences such as apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional
                anisotropy (FA) may be obtained from DTI sequences. Quantitative parameters may
                also be obtained from other imaging techniques such as MR spectroscopy.

             3. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis. N/A

             4. Early stopping rules. N/A

        8. Risks

             1. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected
                frequency.

                All participants will undergo the informed consent process. Children over the age
                of 15 will be asked to document their consent by signing the consent form. Children
                between the ages of 8 and 15 years of age will be asked to indicate their assent by
                signing the assent document. Assent will be obtained for children &lt;8 years of age
                by monitoring visual and vocal indications as well as body language. Parents of all
                children will be asked to document their consent of the procedure on the consent
                form.

                The effects of magnetic fields in an MRI scanner have been extensively studied, and
                there are no known risks with an MRI exam. Participants may, however, be bothered
                by feelings of confinement (claustrophobia), and by the noise made by the image
                acquisition during the procedure.

             2. Steps taken to minimize the risks. Participants will be asked about
                contraindications to MR examinations (as outlined by the MRI screening sheet).
                Participants will wear earplugs and earphones while in the magnet. Participants may
                not participate in this study if they have a pacemaker, an implanted defibrillator
                or other implanted electronic or metallic devices.

             3. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations. Adverse events,
                unanticipated problems, and study deviations will be reported to the IRB in writing
                by study personnel within 5 days of learning of the event. Serious adverse events
                will be reported immediately.

             4. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of
                confidentiality.

                There are no known or anticipated legal risks associated with participating in this
                study.

             5. Financial risks to the participants. There are no known or anticipated financial
                risks associated with participating in this study.

        9. Benefits

           a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society. i.
           Individual participant

           Individual participants may benefit by receiving higher end, non-invasive, non-contrast
           MR imaging studies that may (or may not) increase sensitivity and specificity of
           diagnosis and prognosis.

           ii. Society Society may benefit if investigators are able to establish the value of 7T
           MR imaging in focal pediatric epilepsy. By developing a high-resolution 7T brain MRI
           protocol for pediatric epilepsy, the data obtained from these exams may serve as the
           basis to alter diagnostic workup. This may ultimately improve early detection and
           characterization of lesions, and guide surgical planning, and may facilitate better
           outcomes.

       10. Payment and Remuneration

           a. Detail compensation for participants including possible total compensation, proposed
           bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.

           All studies will be performed in addition to a clinically indicated MRI appointment. No
           additional costs or billing will be generated to the patients. Subjects may receive a
           copy of their images on compact disc upon request.

       11. Costs a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants
           and identify who will pay for them.

      Patient subjects will not incur any additional costs directly related to their participation
      in this project. The 7T MRI exams will be funded by a research grant.
