      Rationale:

      Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4, is approved for the treatment of
      metastatic melanoma and significantly increases median overall survival. However, use of this
      drug is associated with immune related adverse events (IRAEs) like colitis, hepatitis,
      dermatitis, alveolitis and hypophysitis in 10-40% of the patients. In general IRAEs are
      manageable by cessation of ipilimumab in combination with treatment with corticosteroids or
      TNF-alpha blockade but they can be severe or even life-threatening. In addition, treatment
      with ipilimumab is expensive. Because of the high costs and the potential serious toxicity of
      ipilimumab, it is of great importance to identify biomarkers that correlate with clinical
      activity and can be used to select patients that will benefit from CTLA-4 blockade therapy.

      The investigators hypothesize that differences in response to treatment with ipilimumab are
      due to variability in the pharmacodynamics and -kinetics of the antibody. It is hypothesized
      that patients who do not respond to treatment with ipilimumab have lower drug levels in tumor
      tissues as compared to patients with a good response to therapy. In addition, the
      investigators hypothesize that IRAEs are associated with high drug levels in the affected
      tissue.

      To visualize molecular interactions a novel technique is used in which positron emission
      tomography (PET) is combined with labeled monoclonal antibodies. Because ipilimumab induces
      activation of T-lymphocytes it is hypothesized that uptake of 89Zr-ipilimumab in tumor
      lesions and normal tissue is different (i.e. higher) after the second administration of
      ipilimumab (3 weeks after first injection). Therefore immuno-PET scans will be performed
      after the first and after the second injection of ipilimumab.

      Objective:

      Part one: The primary objective is:

      1. To assess uptake (visual and quantitative) of 89Zr-ipilimumab in tumor lesions and
      biodistribution at two timepoints (at start of ipilimumab therapy and after the second
      injection 3 weeks later).

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. To determine the correlation between tumor targeting of ipilimumab and response to
           therapy.

        2. To assess uptake (visual and quantitative) of 89Zr-ipilimumab in normal tissues.

        3. To determine de correlation between organ targeting and toxicity

          -  Scheduled for treatment with ipilimumab.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histological or cytological documentation of cancer is required.

          -  WHO Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  At least 1 measurable lesion.

          -  Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study procedures.

             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous exposure to ipilimumab.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding subjects. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start treatment. Both men and
             women enrolled in this trial must agree to use adequate barrier birth control measures
             (e.g. cervical cap, condom and diaphragm) during the course of the trial. Oral birth
             control methods alone will not be considered adequate on this study, because of the
             potential pharmacokinetic interaction between study drug and oral contraceptives.

             necessary for at least 6 months after receiving study drug.

          -  Concurrent anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy or investigational drug therapy
             during the study or within 4 weeks after starting the study drug.

          -  Radiotherapy of target lesions during study or within 4 weeks after starting the study
             drug. Palliative radiotherapy will be allowed.
