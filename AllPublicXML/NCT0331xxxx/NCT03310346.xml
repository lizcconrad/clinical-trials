  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this prospective research registry is to collect data on treatment strategies
      and outcomes for premature newborns with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of consensus on the role of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy and other
      pulmonary vasodilators for the treatment of severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) in premature
      newborns (&lt;34 weeks gestation). However, a proper randomized, controlled trial of iNO in
      premature newborns with severe PH has not been completed. Some practices embrace the American
      Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) statement that there is no condition for which iNO should be used
      in the premature newborn, and others selectively treat premature infants with inhaled nitric
      oxide (iNO) who suffer life threatening hypoxemia due to suprasystemic PH and right-to-left
      veno-arterial admixture across the arterial duct and/or oval foramen. The number of neonatal
      intensive care units (NICUs) adopting each of these approaches is currently unknown, but it
      is possible that the former group is increasing due to administrative pressure to reduce
      uncompensated off-label iNO use. A prospective registry collection of treatment strategies
      and outcomes for this subset of premature newborns will help define current treatment
      strategies and yield important information about safety and efficacy of the different
      approaches to management, and would inform the debate more effectively than a series of iNO
      treated infants alone. Data collected includes maternal age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy and
      delivery complications, prenatal medications, infant characteristics such as Apgar scores,
      birthweight, congenital anomalies, respiratory status, pharmacologic therapy used for PH and
      its side effects, and blood gas data. Up to 100 sites in North America will be invited to
      monitor for appropriate cases.
