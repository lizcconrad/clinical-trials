  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HeSAPP is a single-center, non-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial studying
      the hemopurification strategy for acute paraquat(PQ) poisoned patients. The intervention to
      be investigated include hemodialysis (HD), hemoperfusion (HP), combined
      hemoperfusion-hemodialysis concurrent therapy (HP-HD) and conservative therapy. The object of
      the present trial is to investigate whether hemopurification therapy can reduce mortality
      compared with conservative therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with acute paraquat poisoning in the Emergency Room of the First
      Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University would be stratified according to their urine
      dithionite test results and randomly assigned to four different groups: HD, HP, HP-HD and
      control (conservative therapy) group for different treatment. Arterial blood gas test,
      complete blood count, coagulation function, liver function, pancreatic function, urine
      dithionite test, renal function and chest radiographs would be closely monitored during
      treatment. Primary endpoint is 28-day mortality. Secondary endpoints include (1) survival
      time (from the time of PQ ingestion to the time of death), all-cause mortality at the 3rd,
      7th and 60th day; (2) rate of necessary oxygen uptake and rate of mechanical ventilation; (3)
      in-hospital length of stay and ICU length of stay; (4) APACHE II score and PSS score; (5)
      rate of general complications, such as respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (AKI), acute
      liver failure, pancreas function abnormality and Multiple Organ Failure (MOF); (6) rate of
      intervention related complications, such as catheter placement related complications,
      thrombocytopenia and deep venous thrombosis; (7) rate of adverse events, which include
      unexpected death, severe hemorrhage or edema, unplanned extubation, coagulation in the
      extracorporeal circulation, blockage of cartridge, incorrect pipe connection, etc.
