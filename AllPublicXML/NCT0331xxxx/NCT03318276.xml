  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rinexin® Tab (Cilostazol 100mg, Ginkgo biloba leaf extract 80mg) has been widely used as an
      anti-platelet agent for the treatment of PAD. SID142 is a new controlled-release product
      improved patient's convenience and disadvantage of dosage regimen of previous drug. The aim
      of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of SID142 and Rinexin® Tab in patients
      with PAD

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure lower limb pain that is believed to range across a continuum of values. The amount of pain that a subject feels ranges across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain.
VAS is a 100mm horizontal line. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their state.
The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the subject marks. The higher the score, the more severe the pain.</description>
