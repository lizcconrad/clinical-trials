    <textblock>
      All women with severe preeclmapsia were given a loading dose of 4 g magnesium sulfate IV
      followed by the maintenance dose of 1 g/h infusion till the delivery. After delivery, women
      who received magnesium sulfate for 8 hours or more were randomly divided into two groups:

      Group I ( 50 cases) No magnesium sulfate received postpartum and Group II ( 50
      cases)â€”magnesium sulfate infusion is given for conventional 24 h postpartum at a rate of 1 gm
      per hour

      All women with severe preeclmapsia were given a loading dose of 4 g magnesium sulfate IV
      followed by the maintenance dose of 1 g/h infusion till the delivery. After delivery, women
      who received magnesium sulfate for 8 hours or more were randomly divided into two equal
      groups:

      Group I is the study group: No post partum magnesium sulfate doses were given. Group II is
      the control group where magnesium sulfate infusion is given for conventional 24 h postpartum
      at a rate of 1 gm per hour
