      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lentiviral gene
      transfer treatment at restoring immune function to participants with X-linked severe combined
      immunodeficiency (XSCID) who are 2 to 40 years of age, and have significant impairment of
      immunity.

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lentiviral gene transfer treatment
      at restoring immune function to participants with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency
      (XSCID) who are 2 to 40 years of age, and have significant impairment of immunity. XSCID is a
      severe genetic condition of the immune system.

      Participants in this study will be treated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      Clinical Center.

      Before the gene transfer treatment, a participant's own CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
      will have been or will be collected from the participant's blood or bone marrow. When the
      participant has the required number of HSCs harvested, then the participant's HSCs will be
      grown in tissue culture and exposed to the lentiviral gene transfer vector containing the
      corrective gene (VSV-G pseudotyped CL20-4i-EF1α-hγc-OPT). These gene corrected HSCs will be
      administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to the participant. To increase engraftment of the
      corrected HSCs, participants will receive a chemotherapy drug called busulfan on 2 days
      before the gene transfer treatment. Participants will also receive palifermin, which helps
      prevent mucositis, which is the main side effect from the busulfan.

      After the gene transfer treatment, participants will be monitored to see if the treatment is
      safe and whether their immune system improves. Participants will be followed at frequent
      intervals for the first 2 years, and less frequently thereafter so that the effectiveness in
      restoration of immune function and the safety of the treatment can be evaluated. Additional
      safety follow-up may occur through Year 15.
