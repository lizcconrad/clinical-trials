  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted, using hospital as randomisation
      unit. Hospitals in Zhejiang Province, China, will be randomised into two arms (1:1): an
      intervention arm and a control arm. Hospitals in the intervention arm will receive a
      multi-components intervention based on the Behaviour Change Wheel model, whereas hospitals in
      the control arm will receive no intervention and maintain existing care. The randomisation
      will be conducted after one-year baseline data collection. The following baseline data will
      be used for randomisation match: hospital classification, beds in stroke centre, thrombolysis
      patient number, and percentage of patients receiving thrombolysis within 60 minutes of stroke
      onset. Hospitals with no stroke centre or with &lt;20 cases received thrombolysis per year will
      be excluded from the study. The primary outcome will be difference between intervention arm
      and control arm in the percentage of patients receiving thrombolysis within 60 minutes of
      stroke onset on the follow-up stage (post-intervention).

    <description>Interventions are developed on a psychological model, the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) .The fundamental of BCW consists of three essential elements: capability, motivation, and opportunity. Improving individual's capability, providing motivation, and increasing opportunities are goals of behaviour change intervention. To achieve the goals, 9 intervention components have been proposed in the BCW framework, and 6 components will be used in current study.</description>
