  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Expression of IDO and PD-1/L1 has been found to be increased in endometrial cancer.
      Expression of these markers on the tumor cells leads to immunosuppression in the
      micro-environment of tumors that prevents immune system from attacking and killing tumor
      cells. The purpose of this trial is to target these antigens by concomitant administration of
      drugs epacadostat and pembrolizumab, thereby removing twin mechanisms of immune-suppression
      that may lead to better control of tumor growth.

      Primary Objective

        -  Evaluate the response rate (RR) and 6 month progression-free survival (PFS-6) of
           patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma when treated with
           epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by modified RECIST v1.1

        -  In a subset analysis, evaluate the response rate (RR) and 6 month progression-free
           survival (PFS-6) of patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) and recurrent or
           metastatic endometrial carcinoma when treated with epacadostat in combination with
           pembrolizumab.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab.

        -  Evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial
           carcinoma when treated with epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab as measured by
           modified RECIST v1.1.

        -  In a subset analysis, evaluate the overall survival (OS) of patients with microsatellite
           instability (MSI) and recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma when treated with

             prior to receiving their first dose of study medication or have any unresolved
             toxicity greater than Grade 1 from previous anticancer therapy, except for stable

             (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally
             killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg,
             FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Subjects receiving MAOIs or drug which has significant MAOI activity (meperidine,

             approval. The JTc must be &lt; 340 milliseconds if JTc is used in place of the QTcF.
             Subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded.

        Note: QTcF prolongation due to pacemaker may enroll if the JTc is normal.
