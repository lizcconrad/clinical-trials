  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are the group at highest risk of HIV
      infection in the United States. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has demonstrated high
      efficacy in preventing HIV infection among MSM. However, uptake in clinical settings has been
      slow for several reasons, including low awareness and education, low perceived HIV risk,
      concern for side-effects, and stigma associated with taking the medication. The purpose of
      the proposed study is to develop and evaluate a brief motivational interviewing (MI)
      intervention to promote PrEP uptake among MSM during the course of routine HIV screening at a
      public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic.
