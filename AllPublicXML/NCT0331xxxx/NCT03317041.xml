  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reducing fatigue and improving the recovery capabilities of runners has gained more interest
      over the last years. Recently, capacitive-resistive electric transfer (Tecar) therapy is
      commonly used by physical therapists to help athletes recover from muscle fatigue. However,
      empiric evidence supporting the benefits of Tecar to recovery is lacking. This study
      investigated the effects of a Tecar treatment performed shortly after an exhausting training
      session on both physiological and biomechanical parameters of running.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled crossover trial all subjects will perform two test protocols
      separated by 2 weeks. Each protocol will comprise one exhausting training session (20-min
      warm-up consisted of 15-min of continuous self-paced running followed by 5-min of fast-finish
      progression runs increasing speeds (from approximately 60% to 80% of maximal heart rate,
      participant controlled), 10 x 500 m sprints at 90% of maximal heart rate with a 2-min rest
      period between bouts and a recovery phase consisting of 10-min of slow jogging). Twenty-four
      hours after this exhausting training, subjects will perform an incremental running test on a
      treadmill (Pre-intervention test) where subjects will start at 10 km/h for 6 min after which
      speed will be increased by 2 km/h every 6 min until a 16 km/h trial is completed. One hour
      after this test, in one protocol subjects will receive Tecar therapy (Tecar treatment group);
      in the other group (Control group) participants will rest passively in a sitting position for
      30-min period. To evaluate the relevance of the changes induced by Tecar therapy/passive
      recovery, subjects will repeat the treadmill test 48 hours after the first test in both
      groups (72 hours after the exhaustive training).

    <description>The Tecar treatment group will receive 45 minutes of Tecar therapy treatment. Subjects will lay down with the face down and two metallic plaques situated under each quadriceps muscle all over all the treatment. The treatment will start with the automatic capacitive energy transfer for 10-min where the capacitive plaque is situated on the sole of each foot with an elastic band. After that, the capacitive plaque will be pulled out. Then, the resistive electrode will be moved longitudinally through different muscles with massage lotion during 15-min per each lower extremity. The treatment will conclude with the automatic capacitive energy transfer for 10-min and the capacitive plaque situated on the sole of each foot with an elastic band.</description>
