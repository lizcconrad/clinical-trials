  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acetabular fractures are the resultant from high-energy trauma or low-energy trauma in the
      elder patients. Usually, surgeons use LETOURNEL's classification or/and JUDET's one.

      Five elements are considered and associated to five type of fracture. Even more, for
      orthopaedic surgeons with less experience with these fractures, correct classification can be
      more difficult.

      So the the aim of this study is:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy of four &quot;special&quot; 3D reconstruction: a 3D reconstruction of the
           pelvis with anterior view, posterior view, endopelvic view where the opposite hemipelvis
           removed and an exopelvic view where the femoral head is removed according to the initial
           teaching of E. Letournel.

        2. Evaluate the addition of teaching of non-experimented surgeon on the accuracy of
           classifying acetabular fractures.

        3. Evaluate the addition of a digital algorithm (mobile application) on the accuracy of
           classifying acetabular fractures.

      12 reviewers will be given the different imaging of each case and will be divided in 4
      groups: novice (junior ER and ortho residents), intermediate (non-experimented orthopedic
      surgeons), intermediate with a formation on classifying acetabular fractures and finally
      experts (acetabular fracture expert surgeons) . For each patient, representative CT scans are
      provided for each assessment. The study will be divided into 3 phases separated by 4-6 weeks
      of time. In the first phase, for each patient, representative CT scans are provided for each
      assessment with 2D and multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) without 3D views. In the second
      phase, 3D views are added. In the third phase, the cases are evaluated using the &quot;Acetabular
      Diagnosis Tool&quot; To note, the evaluation of the cases is done twice in each phase separated by
      4-6 weeks and the order of the cases is changed, both in order to minimize recall bias
