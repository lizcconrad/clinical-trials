  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial designed to:
      1) demonstrate the degree to which administered andexanet doses can reverse Factor Ten A
      (FXa)-inhibitor induced anticoagulation; and 2) evaluate the safety and PK/PD of andexanet in
      healthy Japanese subjects taking direct FXa inhibitors at therapeutic doses.&quot;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be in reasonably good health as determined by the Investigator based on medical
             history, full physical examination (including blood pressure and pulse rate
             measurement), 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests. Subjects with
             well-controlled, chronic, stable conditions (e.g., controlled hypertension,
             non-insulin dependent diabetes, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism) may be enrolled based
             on the clinical judgment of the Investigator.

          2. For all cohorts except Cohort 5, subjects must be of Japanese ethnicity, defined as
             having four ethnic Japanese grandparents. Subjects may not have lived outside of Japan
             for more than 10 years. For Cohort 5, subjects must be of Caucasian race.

          3. Must be between the ages of 18 and 75 years, inclusive, at the time of signing of the
             Inform Consent Form (ICF).

          4. Agrees to have any dietary or nutritional supplements reviewed by the Investigator and
             potentially held during the study if advised by the Investigator. Standard
             multivitamin and mineral supplementation will be permitted.

          5. Agrees to comply with the contraception and reproduction restrictions of the study:

               -  Men whose sexual partner is of childbearing potential and/or who are not
                  monogamous must be using two acceptable methods of contraception, at least one of
                  which must be a barrier method (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom), for the
                  entire duration of the study and for at least 1 month following study-drug
                  administration; and men must refrain from attempting to father a child or
                  donating sperm in the 1 month following the study-drug administration. Periodic
                  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and
                  withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

               -  Men who report surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral vasectomy) must have had
                  the procedure at least 6 months before study drug administration.

               -  Surgical sterilization procedures should be supported with clinical documentation
                  and noted in the Relevant Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of
                  the case report forms (CRFs).

               -  Women of childbearing potential must be using two medically acceptable methods of
                  contraception, at least one of which must be a barrier method (e.g., non-hormone
                  containing intra-uterine device plus condom, spermicidal gel plus condom,
                  diaphragm plus condom), from the time of Screening and for the duration of the
                  study, through at least 1 month following study drug administration. Note: Oral
                  and topical hormonal contraceptive use, as well as the use of hormone-containing
                  intra-uterine devices, is not permitted due to their increased risk of
                  thromboembolism. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post- ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception; OR

               -  Postmenopausal women must have had no regular menstrual bleeding for at least 1
                  year before initial dosing and either be over the age of 60 years or have an
                  elevated plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (i.e., &gt; 40
                  milli-international units (mIU)/mL) at Screening;

               -  Women who report surgical sterilization (i.e., hysterectomy, tubal ligation,
                  and/or bilateral oophorectomy) must have had the procedure at least 6 months
                  before study drug administration. Surgical sterilization procedures should be
                  supported with clinical documentation and noted in the Relevant Medical
                  History/Current Medical Conditions section of the CRF; AND All female subjects
