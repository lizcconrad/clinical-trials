  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no study related to Indirect Calorimetry (IC) has been done among
      hospitalised Malaysian ICU adult patients with its racial mix. The aim of this study is to
      perform a cross-sectional study in Malaysian critically ill patients to determine metabolic
      determinants that might influence resting energy expenditure (REE) and to develop predictive
      equation for the estimation of energy requirement using the regression based approach to
      increase the accuracy in calorie prescriptions. In addition, expected outcome of this study
      is to determine which equations have clinical usefulness among Malaysian adult critically ill
      patients and hope to introduce into routine clinical practice in the future if IC is not
      available.

      Nutrition provision in the clinical setting relies heavily on the accurate estimation of
      energy and protein requirements. This can be done in a quick and inexpensive manner via the
      use of predictive equations. Some of the most popularly used predictive equations such as the
      Harris-Benedict equation and the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation have been widely applied within
      the clinical setting to estimate energy requirements among mechanically ventilated critically
      ill patients. However, these existing equations were not specially developed for a population
      with disease, as the equations were derived from a pool of healthy Caucasian adults. In
      addition, most of the equations for critically ill patients such as the Penn State equation,
      Faisy equation and Raurich Equation developed and validated among Caucasian in western
      country and not among Asian population. Therefore, their accuracy in predicting energy
      requirement is questionable when applied within Malaysian mechanically ventilated critically
      ill patients with its racial mix.

    <description>REE measurements were using IC (Cosmed, Quark RMR 2.0, Indirect Calorimetry Lab, Italy). A standard protocol for conducting the measurement was followed (Schlein &amp; Coulter, 2014);(P. Singer &amp; Singer, 2016); (Taku Oshima et al., 2016). Before each measurement, the metabolic monitor was allowed to warm up for 30 min, and then gas and flowmeter calibrations were performed by an experienced dietitian or healthcare professional. The REE was recorded after a 30 min non-fasting steady state according to RMR protocol and manufacturer instructions.</description>
