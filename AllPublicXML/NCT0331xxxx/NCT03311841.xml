  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of
      midazolam, dabigatran, pitavastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin following a single oral
      dose administration of a microdose cocktail in healthy participants, in participants with
      mild, moderate, severe (not on dialysis) renal impairment, and in participants with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD; on dialysis).
