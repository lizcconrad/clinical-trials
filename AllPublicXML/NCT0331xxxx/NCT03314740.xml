  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, multi-centre study aiming at comparing the efficacy of
      Olaparib and Cediranib vs. weekly Paclitaxel in terms of progression free survival (PFS) in
      platinum refractory or resistant recurrent ovarian cancer.

      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to three treatment arms:

        -  Arm A: Paclitaxel 80 mg/mq every week

        -  Arm B: Cediranib 20 mg/day + Olaparib 600 mg / day (i.e. 300 mg BD) given every day

        -  Arm C: Cediranib 20 mg/day given 5 days per weeks + Olaparib 600 mg / day (i.e. 300 mg
           BD) given 7 days per weeks
