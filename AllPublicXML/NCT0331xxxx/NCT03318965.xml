  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to compare the ability of acute physiology and chronic
      health evaluation (APACHE) scoring systems with the combination of an anthropometric variable
      score &quot;adductor pollicis muscle (APM) thickness&quot; to the APACHE systems in predicting
      mortality in the ICU. Three hundred and four patients enrolled in this prospective
      observational study. The APM thickness in dominant hand and APACHE II and III scores were
      measured for each patient upon admission. Given scores for the APM thickness, were added to
      APACHE score systems to make two composite scores of APACHE II- APM and APACHE III- APM. The
      accuracy of the two composite models and APACHE II and III systems in predicting mortality of
      patients was compared using area under the ROC curve.

      Based on the study results, the area under the ROC curves improved in composite models.
      Therefore, it seemed that considering anthropometric variables may improve prediction of
      mortality in APACHE systems.

      The baseline medical history, physical examination, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
      Evaluation score II and III (APACHE) were recorded for all patients. All data were collected
      by a single physician. The APACHE II and III scores were gathered using the method presented
      by Knaus. The dominant hand APM thickness (as reported by the patient, or the relative) was
      assessed by Caliper (Vogel, Germany) in the emergency room or at the time of the ICU
      admission. To estimate weight for the APM thickness, multivariate logistic regression
      analysis was used to determine the relation between mortality and the APM thickness while
      controlling for other physiologic variables (12 physiologic variables for APACHE II and 18
      physiologic variables for APACHE III).The area under the receiver-operating curves (ROC
      curve) to predict mortality was used to compare APACHE II, APACHE III, APACHE II- APM and
      APACHE III- APM systems.
