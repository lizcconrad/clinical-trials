  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, with
      increasing prevalence. Recent guidelines recommend aortic valve intervention (surgical aortic
      valve replacement [SAVR] or transcatheter aortic valve replacement [TAVR]) in severe AS, as
      soon as symptoms or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction occur, in order to improve clinical
      outcome and achieve LV mass (LVM) regression. The highest amount of LVM regression is
      obtained during the first year. Nevertheless, there is heterogeneity in LV remodeling and
      residual LV hypertrophy is associated with poorer postoperative improvement in cardiac
      function and morphology. Incomplete regression of LV hypertrophy at 12 months after SAVR is a
      powerful predictor of adverse outcome. Yet, the use of specific pharmacological therapy to
      improve postoperative LVM regression could be an appealing therapeutic option after aortic
      valve intervention.

      Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers (RAASb) and more particularly angiotensin-II
      receptor blockers (ARBs) are efficient in reducing LVM in hypertensive patients, as
      emphasized by several meta-analyses. In addition, ARBs improve myocardial relaxation,
      diastolic function, decreased hypertrophy and may have anti-fibrotic effects. In a recent
      retrospective study from our group, RAASb prescription after SAVR was associated with
      increased survival, but confirmation through a randomized trial is mandatory. In a
      prospective randomized single-center study, the use of candesartan was associated both with
      LV and LA remodeling as compared to the conventional management. Nevertheless, these results
      are based on echocardiographic data, which is not the gold standard for the assessment
      cardiac remodeling, and no placebo or active comparator was tested to control the impact of
      ARBs in these patients.

      The primary objective of this Phase II study is to investigate the efficacy of valsartan,
      introduced postoperatively, as compared to placebo, on 1-year changes in indexed LVM, as
      assessed by CMR, in patients undergoing aortic valve intervention (SAVR or TAVR) for AS.

      The secondary objectives are to compare the efficacy of valsartan vs. placebo in terms of
      one-year changes (difference from baseline) in cardiac function and in cardiac morphology,
      one-year exercise capacity and one-year changes in biomarkers related to cardiac function. In
      addition, the assessment of the safety of valsartan will also be considered as secondary
      objective.

      The ARISTOTE trial is a multicenter prospective phase II, randomized, double-blind study
      including patients with the diagnosis of severe AS and indication for valve intervention.

      The active treatment is valsartan, an orally active, potent, and specific angiotensin II
      receptor antagonist.

      Patients will be randomized between 2 groups (valsartan versus placebo) and the treatment
      will be initiated (80 mg daily) at 5±4 days following aortic valve intervention. The
      comparative treatment will be a placebo; tablets of valsartan and placebo have a similar
      appearance and administration mode. Patient in the control group will receive a placebo using
      the same protocol as the valsartan group.

      The patients will be cautiously monitored and any adverse events will be collected. The dose
      will be increased at 160 mg daily 13±2 days after aortic valve intervention and, if well
      tolerated, for the remaining period of the study. The tolerance will be regularly assessed
      and dose adjusted according to a pre-specified algorithm.
