  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity is a first line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), however,
      the vast majority of patients with T2D do not achieve satisfying glycemic control with
      physical activity alone, which is why pharmacological treatment with metformin is most often
      initiated.

      It is known that metformin and exercise both activates 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated
      protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle and liver, and the activation of AMPK results in
      many different metabolic effects, including improvements in glycemic control. Because of this
      similarity in mechanism of action, an interaction between metformin and exercise is
      plausible, but knowledge in the area is sparse. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the
      effects of training with and without concomitant metformin treatment, in order to investigate
      whether an interaction between the two occur.

      Subjects with impaired glucose tolerance will all undergo 12 weeks of training but will be
      randomized (1:1) to concomitant metformin/placebo treatment in a double-blinded way.
      Experimental days will be performed before randomisation (before initiation of
      metformin/placebo treatment), before initiation of the training period and after the training
      period.
