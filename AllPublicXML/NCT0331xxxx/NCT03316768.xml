  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known about the pinch and grip forces that are critical for activities of
      daily living (ADL) or work. Human success in evolution is a result of the combination of
      great brain power and great hand ability to accomplish with our hands what our minds can
      conceive. Prehensile grasp in hominins allowed tool production and today allows us to hold
      fine instruments to perform surgery or do heavy construction. The strength of our hands is
      matched against the requirements of the activities we need to perform. The hypothesis of this
      study is that many tasks have an inherent strength requirement that is independent of the
      person performing the task. Until recently, direct measurement of the forces has not been
      possible. Ultra thin sensors along with the software to interpret the information is now
      available to make this force determination possible. We have 3 primary objectives. The
      primary objective is to measure pressure distribution and resultant forces needed for 3
      categories of ADL and 2 categories of work in normal subjects. The second objective is to
      perform a similar evaluation of patients with basilar thumb arthritis and after wrist
      fracture. The third objective is to measure pressure distribution and forces needed for tool
      production and use.

      The study will measure pressures and forces for ADL and simulated work using healthy
      volunteers. Sixteen volunteers will be chosen over a range of ages but specifically include
      similar numbers of early adulthood (18-44), middle age (45-65), and elderly (&gt;65). Sixteen
      volunteers from each age group divided evenly by gender will be selected. Therefore, a total
      of 48 subjects will be tested, with an even number of male and female performing each of the
      activities listed above.

      Inclusion Critera Volunteers will be recruited through website, personnel, and community
      contacts. They will be recruited based on age and gender.

      Exclusion Criteria Patients will be excluded if they have a history of an inflammatory
      condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. They will be excluded if they have
      symptomatic osteoarthritis of their hands. Additional exclusion criteria will include known
      neurologic conditions, or prior injury that may be contributing to weakness or atrophy.

        Healthy volunteers will be recruited through website, personnel, and community contacts.
        They will be recruited based on age and sex. Helsinki approval will be obtained before
        recruiting patients. Informed consent will be obtained.
