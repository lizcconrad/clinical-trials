  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether co-administration of belimumab and a single
      cycle of rituximab will optimize treatment with belimumab, which will result in improvements
      of clinical status with a favorable safety profile, by comparing subjects randomized to
      belimumab plus rituximab versus belimumab plus rituximab-placebo. Approximately 200 subjects
      will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms; belimumab plus
      rituximab-placebo (Arm A, control), belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B, combination), or
      belimumab plus standard therapy (Arm C, reference). Arm A and Arm B will be double-blinded
      and Arm C will be open-labeled. The open-label arm will provide a qualitative reference to
      standard therapy. Belimumab will be administered as subcutaneous (SC) and rituximab-placebo
      or rituximab will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusions. The total duration of the
      study is for 104 weeks. Double-blinded phase will be for 52-weeks with subjects from Arm A
      and B who cannot tolerate discontinuation of immunosuppressant or taper of corticosteroids.
      Subjects in Arm C will continue to receive belimumab SC and their stable immunosuppressant
      during Weeks 53 through 104.
