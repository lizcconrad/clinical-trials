      This project aims to contextualize delivery of mindfulness training to U.S. Army personnel,
      evaluate its effectiveness on measures of executive functions and psychological well-being,
      and determine best practices for its delivery.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: An individual's success in the U.S. Army relies on many factors including the
      integrity of executive functions (EFs). EFs comprise a complex, multi-faceted brain system
      necessary to pay attention, overcome habitual and automatic behaviors, regulate mood, and
      ensure that current behavior is in line with short and long-term goals.Yet, protracted
      periods of high uncertainty, high demands, and high stress can lead to decreases in the
      efficiency and availability of EFs. Given the high demands and psychological vulnerabilities
      that U.S. Army personnel may face, it is critical to provide them with training programs to
      protect against degradation of EFs (particularly attention and working memory) over
      high-stress, high-demand intervals. Prior research on mindfulness training (MT) in civilians
      and military servicemembers showed that MT can effectively protect against degradation in
      attention and working memory and benefit psychological well-being over high-demand intervals.

      Problem: While being successful, prior MT programs required a considerable amount of time
      dedicated to training (e.g., 24-hour training) and it is challenging to integrate these long
      programs into the busy schedule of the U.S. Army personnel. To accommodate the time
      constraints, the principal investigator together with a mindfulness expert developed a
      short-form mindfulness training program contextualized for the U.S. Army; the program
      consists of 8-hour training and is known as MBAT, Mindfulness-Based Attention Training.

      Project Goal: The present study aims to investigate the best practices for delivery of a
      short-form mindfulness training to U.S. Army Cohorts. Specifically, the present study will
      examine the best delivery structure for the MBAT by comparing MBAT course delivered in 2
      weeks vs. 4 weeks.

    <intervention_model>Factorial Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be assigned into three groups: (i) a 4-week MT group (MT4, n = 40) that will receive MBAT in 4, 2-hour sessions over 4 weeks; (ii) a 2-week MT group (MT2, n = 40) that will receive MBAT in 4, 2-hour sessions over 2 weeks; (iii) a no-training control group that will be tested before and after a no-training interval (NTC4, n = 40). After the end of the course sessions, participants from the training groups will still be assigned homework exercises until third testing session (T3). Hence, the MBAT program consists of delivery of the MBAT course, including homework mindfulness practice, and followed by an interval of homework mindfulness practice without course meetings.
The design relies on group randomization at the level of individual military cohort units. This is due to the military requirement that organic unit structure can be maintained during testing and course session scheduling.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to the long-term post-intervention (testing 3), which is an average of 7 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The SART is used to assess attentional performance and mind wandering (i.e., off-task thinking which is typically self-generated and compromises the performance of the task at hand). The task uses a continuous performance paradigm involving button presses to frequently presented non-targets (numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) but requires the participants to withhold their motor response to the infrequent target (number 3). Withholding responses only to infrequent targets encourages a pre-potent response and mind wandering. Real-time subjective experience of mind wandering during SART is assessed through experience-sampling probes randomly presented throughout the task.</description>

    <measure>Change in Working Memory Task with Affective Distraction (WMDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the pre-intervention baseline (testing 1) to the long-term post-intervention (testing 3), which is an average of 7 weeks from the baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>The WMDA is used to assess the ability to hold information in working memory while overcoming emotional reactivity and distraction. Specifically, participants are presented with a memory item that they need to memorize and hold in memory during a delay interval. During the delay, emotionally negative or neutral scene images are presented. The negative images are combat scenes from Iraq or Afghanistan and the neutral images are non-combat scenes.</description>

    <description>PANAS assesses positive and negative affect. It consists of a list of descriptors of positive (e.g., 'interested', 'enthusiastic') and negative (e.g., 'irritable', 'upset') affects. Items are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely), according to how participants feel. The Positive Affect scale reflects the extent to which a person feels enthusiastic, active, and alert; the Negative Affect scale reflects unpleasant mood states, such as anger, disgust, and fear.</description>
