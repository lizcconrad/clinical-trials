      This phase II clinical trial will enroll patients with newly-diagnosed locally-advanced
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma and adopt the Simon's two-stage optimum design. After 4 cycles of
      SIROX regimen, patients will proceed to curative resection.

      This phase II clinical trial will enroll patients with newly-diagnosed locally-advanced
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma and adopt the Simon's two-stage optimum design. After 4 cycles of
      SIROX regimen, patients will proceed to curative resection. The primary endpoint of this
      study is resection rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The first stage will enroll 18
      patients. We will go into the second stage if at least 2 patients in stage I become
      resectable after treatment. There will be at most 35 patients enrolled. Based on this trial,
      we anticipate that the SIROX regimen has comparable response rate and resection rate but
      lower toxicities comparing to FOLFIRINOX.
