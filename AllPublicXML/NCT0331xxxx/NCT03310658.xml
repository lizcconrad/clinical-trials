    <textblock>
      ZSX Medical completed enrollment in its First in Human Ease of Use study in May of 2017, in
      Monterrey Mexico. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ease of use of Zip-Stitch™,
      to generate first in human data, and to refine surgical technique of the device.

      Ten subjects were enrolled and received total laparoscopic hysterectomies, including vaginal
      cuff closure with the Zip-Stitch™ system during their otherwise standard care. Procedures
      took place over the course of one week. Subjects had in person follow-up appointments at 1
      and 6 weeks. Subjects are continuing follow-up through a one-year extension period which will
      end in May 2018.
