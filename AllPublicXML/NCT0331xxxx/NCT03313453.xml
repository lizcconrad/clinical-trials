      This study aimed to assess the impact of air cleanser on allergic rhinitis patients and
      indoor air quality. Air cleaners will be installed in the bedrooms and living rooms of the
      mite allergic rhinitis patients who aged 18-60 years.

      Main parameters:

      - Symptom medication score of allergic rhinitis

      Supportive parameters:

        -  Visual analog scale of allergic rhinitis

        -  Quality of life score of allergic rhinitis

        -  Indoor air quality measurement

        -  Indoor allergen level measurement

      The most important principle in the treatment of allergic diseases is to avoid or reduce
      exposure to the causative antigen. Causative agents that induce allergic diseases or
      exacerbate symptoms are classified into indoor and outdoor allergens. House dust mites and
      pet's hair are typical indoor antigens. Air pollution as well as allergens are important
      deterioration factors, and environmental management is essential for alleviating symptoms of
      allergic diseases. Therefore, we are about to evaluate the impact of the air cleaner to the
      allergic rhinitis patients.

      A total of 45 patients will be enrolled in the study and a real air cleaner and a mock-up air
      cleaner will be randomly installed at ratio of 1: 1 to measure rhinitis symptoms and the
      changes in indoor air quality after 6 weeks of operation.

Once prepared, active air-cleaner and mock device will be identical in appearance. The blinding of all those involved in the evaluation of the study treatment (e.g. physician/nurse as well as the subject) shall be maintained at all times.</masking_description>

    <description>The active comparator group is a group that uses machines that have the same functions as those on the market. In intervention group, two air-cleaners will be activated, one in the living room (covers 91 m2) and the other in the bedroom (covers 58 m2). The air cleaner will be operated continuously for 6 weeks. Inside the air cleaner, a device for measuring the quality of the indoor air is built in. It will be used to compare indoor air quality before and after air cleaner operation. In order to maintain the double-blind setting, a label for 'prohibition of opening' will be attached to the joint of the outer case, and a sticker to cover the air quality measurement display part built in the air cleaner itself will be attached.</description>

    <description>The Control group operates the air-cleaner with the same appearance as the experiment group. However, all the filters including HEPA filter will not be inserted in this group (mockup devices). Two mockup air-cleaners will be activated, one in the living room (covers 91 m2) and the other in the bedroom (covers 58 m2). The mockup devices will be operated continuously for 6 weeks. Same as active comparator group, a device for measuring the quality of the indoor air is built in the mockup air cleaner. It will be used to compare indoor air quality before and after air cleaner operation. In order to maintain the double-blind setting, a label for 'prohibition of opening' will be attached to the joint of the outer case, and a sticker to cover the air quality measurement display part built in the air cleaner itself will be attached.</description>
