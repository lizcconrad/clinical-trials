  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will adapt and pilot test an efficacious advance care planning
      interventions, SPIRIT (Sharing Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust), with
      patients with mild Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and their surrogates to promote open, honest
      discussions while such discussions about end-of-life care are possible.

      The study includes two phases: Phase I to adapt, pretest, and refine SPIRIT, and Phase II to
      pilot test the refined SPIRIT to formally evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy. The final products will be the modified SPIRIT intervention that
      improves AD patient and surrogate outcomes, and standardized intervention manuals, including
      the SPIRIT Interview Guide, fidelity assessment, and training materials.

      Patient and surrogate decision maker dyads will participate in a single SPIRIT session and
      will then have a follow up phone call 2-3 days later. One year after the SPIRIT session some
      surrogates will be contacted to provide additional feedback about the intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent class of dementing illness, is a leading cause
      of death and affects over 5 million individuals in the US. Like most dementing illnesses, AD
      cannot be effectively prevented and is incurable. Progressive memory loss and impairment of
      reasoning and judgment are its main symptoms. For this reason, people in the early stages of
      AD are encouraged to engage in advance care planning (ACP) while they are still competent to
      appoint a surrogate decision maker and meaningfully participate in ACP discussions with the
      surrogate.

      The most common type of ACP is completing a medical power of attorney or living will, which
      does not require the patient and/or the family to understand the complexity of the medical
      decision-making process faced by the surrogate as the patient progresses to advanced disease.
      The failure to engage in ACP before the window of opportunity closes (i.e., before loss of
      decision making capacity) has serious adverse consequences with the greatest impact on the
      surrogate. As a matter of course in AD, family members are left to make decisions regarding
      care transition, tube feeding, and other life-sustaining treatment without input from the
      patient and in the absence of a full understanding of the wishes, values and preferences of
      the patient.

      To make an impact on the state of ACP for patients with AD and their surrogates, the
      researchers will adapt and pilot test an efficacious ACP intervention, SPIRIT (Sharing
      Patient's Illness Representations to Increase Trust), with patients with mild AD and their
      surrogates to promote open, honest discussions while such discussions about end-of-life care
      are possible. SPIRIT is a brief, scalable patient- and family-centered ACP intervention based
      on the Representational Approach to Patient Education with a goal to promote cognitive and
      emotional preparation for end-of-life decision making for patients with a serious or
      life-threatening illness and their surrogates. SPIRIT focuses on having both the patient and
      the surrogate fully understand end-of-life decision making in anticipation of a loss of
      decision-making capacity.

      During Phase I of the study, a panel of seven experts will provide feedback on adapting
      SPIRIT to persons with AD and their surrogates. SPIRIT will also be adapted to a
      videoconference format so that patients and surrogates can receive the intervention in their
      home. To pretest the adapted SPIRIT intervention, the first 6 patient and surrogate dyads
      will be randomly assigned to SPIRIT-in person or to SPIRIT-remote. After completion of each
      session the interventionist will make field notes to document what did or did not go well,
      reasons for interruptions or difficulties, and contextual factors that cannot be captured in
      the audio-recording. During the post-intervention assessment each participant will complete
      the preparedness outcome questionnaires and will be asked about the overall experience with
      SPIRIT, any facets of the intervention that the participant found helpful or not helpful and
      the reasons (pacing, length, and modality), and suggestions for improvement. The researchers
      will alter or refine the intervention before pretesting a second set of 6 dyads.

      Phase II of the study is a randomized clinical trial with three groups: SPIRIT-in person,
      SPIRIT-remote, and usual care. The researchers will recruit 120 dyads of patients with mild
      AD and their surrogates. The groups will be stratified by race (white vs non-white). The
      primary outcomes are patient and surrogate self-reported preparedness for end-of-life
      decision making which will be measured at baseline and shortly after the intervention (by
      phone in the next 2-3 days). Additionally, the researchers will compare the completion rates
      of advance directives among the three groups and the impact of the three treatment conditions
      perceived by surrogates at 1-year post intervention.

    <intervention_model_description>During Phase I, 20 patient and surrogate dyads (40 participants in total) will participate in the first phase of the study which will refine the intervention to address the needs of this specific population. Preliminary effects of the intervention will also be examined. The dyads will be randomized to the SPIRIT-in person or SPIRIT-remote study arms.
In the randomized control trial portion of the study (Phase II), 120 dyads (240 participants in total) will be randomized to one of three different study arms: SPIRIT-in person, SPIRIT-remote study arms, or usual care.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, follow up phone call (2-3 days post-intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Dyad congruence will be assessed using the Goals-of-Care Tool which has been modified to include two scenarios relevant to the context of AD. There are three response options: &quot;The goals of care should focus on delaying my death no matter what, and thus I want to continue life-sustaining treatment&quot;, &quot;The goals of care should focus on my comfort and peace, and thus I do not want life-sustaining treatment&quot;, and &quot;I am not sure&quot;. Patients and surrogates complete this tool independently and their responses are then compared to determine dyad congruence (either congruent in both scenarios or incongruent). If both members of the dyad endorse &quot;I am not sure&quot;, they are considered incongruent.</description>

    <description>Patient decisional conflict will be measured using the 13-item Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), a validated measure in the context of end-of-life decision making. Participants indicate their level of agreement with statements about their plans for their future medical care by selecting (1) Strongly Agree, (2) Agree, (3) Neither Agree nor Disagree, (4) Disagree, or (5) Strongly Disagree. The total score ranges from 13 to 65 with higher scores indicating greater difficulty in weighing benefits and burdens of life-sustaining treatments and decision making.</description>

    <description>Surrogate decision-making confidence will be measured using the 5-item Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale. DMC assesses a surrogate's confidence in knowing the patient's wishes, ability to make treatment decisions even in a highly stressful situation, ability to seek information about risks and benefits of medical choices, ability to handle unwanted pressure from others, and ability to communicate with providers about the patient's wishes. Surrogates indicate how confident they are about making medical decisions, if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions, by their level of agreement with statements along a scale of (0) &quot;not confident at all&quot; to (4) &quot;Very confident&quot;. Total scores range from 0 - 20, with higher scores indicating greater confidence.</description>

    <description>At the time of the diagnosis of a dementing illness, an advanced practice nurse provides written information on advance directives to a patient and his/her family caregiver and reviews this information and encourages them to complete an advanced directive. This typically takes about 10 minutes. Patients and their family members may be referred to attorneys who can assist them in completing an advance directive. If completed, the presence of an advanced directive is documented in the electronic medical record and a copy of the advance directive is scanned to the electronic chart. Patients and families may be referred to a support group program organized by a social worker in which legal and financial issues are discussed in a group setting (by a lawyer).</description>
