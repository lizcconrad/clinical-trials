  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to assess the safety and, partially, the efficacy of dietary supplementation
      of a flavonoids-, DHA- and EPA-based natural supplement in non-ambulant DMD boys and in a
      cohort of LGMD and FSHD patients to compare its effect in MDs of different aetiology and to
      eventually highlight any differences in inflammatory involved pathways. To assess safety,
      patient's laboratory parameters were monitored and adverse events recorded, while efficacy
      was evaluated through performance scale questionnaire and strength measurement (6 minute
      walking test and Biodex System 4 Dynamometer parameter evaluation). This study was conceived
      as proof of principle for the safe use of flavonoids/omega3s-based compound as an adjuvant in
      the management of neuromuscular disorders; besides, its efficacy in alleviating symptoms
      linked to secondary effects of genetic mutation as inflammation, muscular pain and weakness
      was assessed.
