  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of pre-hypertension and hypertension in the elderly is very high. Apart from
      medication, physical exercise training is a potential strategy to reduce blood pressure,
      however, the ability to perform exercise can be limited in the elderly. Hence, alternative
      non-pharmacological strategies to reduce blood pressure are necessary. Two interventions that
      have been shown to positively influence blood pressure are respiratory muscle training (RMT)
      and intermittent hypoxia (IH). Whether a combination of RMT and IH yields even better effects
      is currently unknown. Therefore, in this study, the effect of a single session of RMT with
      and without IH on blood pressure and associated cardiovascular parameters will be
      investigated in elderly subjects with pre-hypertension.
