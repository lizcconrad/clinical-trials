  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and toxicities of hypofractionated
      radiotherapy with conventional fractionated radiotherapy in high risk breast cancer patients
      treated with mastectomy. It's hypothesized that the efficacy and toxicities are similar
      between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible breast cancer patients with mastectomy and axillary dissection are divided into two
      groups: conventional fractionated (CF) radiotherapy of 50 Gray (GY) in 25 fractions within 5
      weeks to ipsilateral chest wall and supraclavicular nodal region, and hypofractionated (HF)
      radiotherapy of 43.5 Gray (GY) in 15 fractions within 3 weeks to the same region. During and
      after radiotherapy , the patients are followed and the efficacy and toxicities of
      radiotherapy are evaluated.
