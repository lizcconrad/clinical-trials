    <textblock>
      This initial Phase I study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK)
      of single and multiple ascending doses of CORT118335, the effect of concomitant
      administration with food on exposure to CORT118335, and its pharmacological effect in healthy
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part, single-center study of single and multiple ascending doses of CORT118335 in
      healthy subjects.

      Part I of the study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of
      single-ascending doses (SAD) of CORT118335. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of
      up 7 cohorts (Cohorts A to G), each containing 8 subjects. Within each cohort, 6 subjects
      will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of CORT118335 and 2 subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive a single dose of matching placebo.

      Part 2 Cohort A, food-effect, will be an open-label 2-way crossover study in one cohort of 12
      subjects, randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of CORT118335 once after an
      overnight fast and once after a high-fat breakfast or the alternate sequence, over 2 study
      periods separated by a washout of at least 7 days/5 half-lives.

      Part 2 Cohort B, PD cohort, will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 3-way
      cross-over study and will serve as proof of pharmacological effect (GR modulation) for
      CORT118335. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo, and two dose
      levels of CORT118335 in one of three treatment sequences across 3 study periods separated by
      washouts of at least 7 days/5 half-lives. On each occasion, the ability of CORT118335 to
      ameliorate the pharmacological effects of a single dose of prednisone will be measured.

      Part 3 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of multiple oral
      ascending doses of CORT118335. Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into 1 of up to 4
      cohorts (Cohorts A to D), each containing 12 subjects. Within each cohort, 9 subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive CORT118335 and 3 subjects to receive matching placebo daily for
      14 days. There is an option (Sponsor decision) for the last cohort (Cohort D) to undergo
      prednisone challenge before and after treatment with CORT118335 or placebo to study the
      effects of CORT118335 on the response to prednisone challenge.
