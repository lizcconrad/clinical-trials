      This is a Phase II study of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) using a
      myeloablative preparative regimen (of either total body irradiation (TBI); or,
      fludarabine/busulfan for patients unable to receive further radiation). followed by a
      post-transplant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimen of post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy), tacrolimus (Tac), and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

                  (MRD) at the end of induction and consolidation therapy

          -  Very high risk pediatric patients with ALL: patients &lt;21 years are also considered
             high risk CR1 if they had M2 or M3 marrow at day 42 from the initiation of induction

             remission.

          -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia excluding refractory blast crisis: To be eligible in
             first chronic phase (CP1) patient must have failed or be intolerant to one or more

             vera or essential thrombocythemia, with disease risk of intermediate or high-risk
             according to DIPSS criteria. Blasts must be &lt;10% by bone marrow aspirate morphology.

          -  Myelodysplasia (MDS) IPSS INT-2 or High Risk (i.e. RAEB, RAEBt) or Refractory Anemia
             with severe pancytopenia, transfusion dependence, or high risk cytogenetics or
             molecular features. Blasts must be &lt; 10% by a representative bone marrow aspirate
             morphology.

          -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL), Marginal Zone
             B-Cell Lymphoma or Follicular Lymphoma are eligible if there was disease
             progression/relapse within 12 of achieving a partial or complete remission. Patients
             who had remissions lasting &gt; 12 months, are eligible after at least two prior
             therapies. Patients with bulky disease (nodal mass greater than 5 cm) should be
             considered for debulking chemotherapy before transplant.

          -  Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell Lymphoma, Prolymphocytic Leukemia are eligible
             after initial therapy in CR1+ or PR1+.

          -  Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, Burkitt's Lymphoma, and other high-grade NHL after initial
             therapy if stage III/IV in CR1/PR1 or after progression if stage I/II &lt; 1 year.

          -  Multiple Myeloma beyond PR2: Patients with chromosome 13 abnormalities, first response
             lasting less than 6 months, or β-2 microglobulin &gt; 3 mg/L, may be considered for this
             protocol after initial therapy.

          -  Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia

          -  Biphenotypic/Undifferentiated/Prolymphocytic Leukemias in first or subsequent CR.

          -  MRD positive leukemia (AML, ALL or accelerated/blast phase CML). Selected patients in
             morphologic CR, but with positive immunophenotypic (flow cytometry) or molecular
             evidence of MRD may be eligible if recent chemotherapy has not resulted in MRD
             negative status.

          -  Natural Killer Cell Malignancies

          -  Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes except for Fanconi Anemia or Dyskeratosis
             Congenita

          -  Other Leukemia Subtypes: A major effort in the field of hematology is to identify
             patients who are of high risk for treatment failure so that patients can be
             appropriately stratified to either more (or less) intensive therapy. This effort is
             continually ongoing and retrospective studies identify new disease features or
             characteristics that are associated with treatment outcomes. Therefore, if new
             features are identified after the writing of this protocol, patients can be enrolled
             with the approval of two members of the study committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy refractory large cell and high grade NHL (i.e., progressive disease after

          -  CML in blast crisis

          -  Large cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and Hodgkin disease that is progressing on
             salvage therapy.

          -  Evidence of progressive disease by imaging modalities or biopsy - persistent PET
             activity, though possibly related to lymphoma, is not an exclusion criterion in the
             absence of CT changes indicating progression.

          -  Active central nervous system malignancy

          -  if ≤ 18 years old, prior myeloablative transplant within the last 6 months. If &gt;18
             years old prior myeloablative allotransplant or autologous transplant

          -  active uncontrolled infection

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding. The agents used in this study include Pregnancy Category D:
             known to cause harm to a fetus. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test prior to starting therapy.
