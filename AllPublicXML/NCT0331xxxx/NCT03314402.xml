    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind phase 1 trial including 3 independent parts: single
      ascending dose(SAD) part,multiple ascending dose(MAD) part and postprandial pharmacokinetics
      part. SAD and MAD are dose-escalated tolerant study designed 8 cohorts and 5 cohorts in SAD
      and MAD respectively. The aims of the study as below:

        1. Evaluating the safety and tolerance of Jaktinib in healthy volunteers.

        2. Evaluating the fasting pharmacokinetic parameters of Jaktinib in healthy volunteers.

        3. Evaluating the postprandial pharmacokinetic parameters of jaktinib in healthy
           volunteers.

        4. Analysis the metabolites of Jaktinib
