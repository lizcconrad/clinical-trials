    <measure>Qualitative review of treatment related adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>A primary objective of this pilot study is to ensure safety of both treatments as well as combined. A qualitative review of treatment related adverse events will be performed and a determination about the degree of relatedness of each adverse event with the intervention using CTCAE criteria will be made.</description>

    <measure>Percent of participants who are compliant with follow-up (Feasibility Measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this pilot study is to ensure that the investigators are make follow-up assessments on a majority of participants. The percent of participants who are compliant with follow-up will be determined over the year following major burn injury. &gt;80% of enrolled participants at 6 weeks following MThBI.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>By group efficacy estimates over year following thermal burn injury.</measure>
    <time_frame>Over 1 year following MThBI (single reported slope difference value)</time_frame>
    <description>Estimates of efficacy will be obtained via repeated measures analysis of pain severity over the 1 year following injury using mixed effects models. Pain will be assessed using a 0-10 numeric rating scale with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating pain as severe as you can imagine. Higher scores represent worse outcome. These values (collected in identical fashion over 1 year following burn injury) will be entered into a linear mixed model, and overall effect estimates (beta coefficients) among groups will be determined.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Achieve target enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The subsequent study will be considered feasible if investigators are able to enroll 60 participants over 24 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gender-based Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>Examines existence of gender-based treatment response differences in pain severity measured by a 0-10 numeric rating scale where 0 is no pain and 10 is the most severe pain. Higher scores reflect greater pain (poor outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 general mental health component scores (MCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of mental health will be determined by the SF-12 mental component score. The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12 item participant completed questionnaire to measure general health. It includes a mental component score (MCS): ranging from 0 to 100 points. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good mental health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-12 general physical health component scores (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of physical health will be determined by the SF-12 physical component score. The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12 item participant completed questionnaire to measure general health. It includes a physical component score (PCS): ranging from 0 to 100 points. Low values represent a poor physical health and high values represent a good physical health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Interference Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks following burn injury</time_frame>
    <description>The degree to which pain interferes with important life function will be determined by the Brief Pain Inventory. This is a validated, self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain based on the average pain experienced and assesses impact of pain across 7 domains of life function (e.g., enjoyment of life, relationships, normal work). The severity scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). Higher scores reflect greater pain interference.</description>
