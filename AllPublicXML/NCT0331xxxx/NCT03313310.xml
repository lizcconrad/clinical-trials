  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work 2 Prevent will advance the science by adapting, tailoring, and pilot-testing a novel
      social and structural-level HIV intervention for YMSM and YTW of color ages16-24 aimed at
      increasing economic stability (i.e., employment) through youth empowerment and asset
      development, and decreasing HIV risk behaviors (i.e., sex work) associated with social and
      economic marginalization.

    <measure>Information Systems Success Model Score</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (within 1 hour of intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>The Information Systems Success Model will be used to assess for intervention acceptability and satisfaction. The 20-item scale yields a total score (20-100; higher values indicate better participant-assessed quality) and measures four sub-domains: information quality (6-30; higher values indicate better participant-assessed quality), system quality (6-30; higher values indicate better participant-assessed quality), perceived usefulness (5-25; higher values indicate higher levels of participant-perceived usefulness), and overall satisfaction (3-15; higher values indicate higher participant satisfaction). This scale has been adapted from Horvath et al. 2013.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Workshop completion</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (within 1 hour of intervention completion)</time_frame>
    <description>Workshop completion will be used to assess for intervention feasibility. Intervention completion will be defined as having attended at least 90% of all four workshop sessions and will be measured by tracking participant attendance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Job Seeking Self-Efficacy Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Job seeking self-efficacy is defined as one's perceived ability and confidence to perform job search and application activities. The 12-item Job Seeking Self-Efficacy scale by Barlow et al. 2002 yields a total score (12-120; higher values indicate higher self-efficacy).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Boundaryless Career Attitude Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Boundaryless career attitudes are defined as having a preference or orientation toward organizational, occupational, or job mobility. Boundaryless career attitudes have previously been found to be associated with positive career outcomes, including higher wages (Volmer &amp; Spurk 2011). The validated 6-item scale by Porter et al. 2016 yields a total score (6-30; higher values indicate greater boundaryless career attitudes) and measures two sub-domains: boundaryless mindset (3-15; higher values indicate greater boundaryless mindset) and organizational mobility preference (3-15; higher values indicate a greater preference for organizational mobility).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Protean Career Attitude Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Protean career attitudes are defined as having self-direction in the pursuit of success in one's work. Protean career attitudes have previously been found to be associated with positive career satisfaction and self-perceived success (Volmer &amp; Spurk 2011). The validated 7-item scale by Porter et al. 2016 yields a total score (7-35; higher values indicate greater protean career attitudes) and measures two sub-domains: self-directed attitudes (4-20; higher values indicate greater protean self-directed attitudes) and values-driven attitudes (3-15; higher values indicate greater protean values-driven attitudes).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported employment status</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Employment status will be assessed using 1 yes/no item: &quot;Are you currently employed?&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-reported sexual risk behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (at month 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Sexual risk behaviors will be measured using 6 yes/no items assessing for engagement in the following behaviors during the past 6 months (this refers to the 6 months prior to the baseline visit for the first assessment and 6 months prior to the 8 month visit for the second assessment):
condomless anal intercourse (CAI) with male partner of unknown status
anal intercourse with &gt;3 males
sex with male partner with a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)
CAI with HIV+ male partner
anal intercourse with condom failure
transactional sex work involvement</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in incidence of chlamydia</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Chlamydia infections will be assessed at baseline and 8 month follow up. Test results yield: positive, negative, or equivocal. Incidence will be defined as those with a &quot;positive&quot; finding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in incidence of gonorrhea</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Gonorrhea infections will be assessed at baseline and 8 month follow up. Test results yield: positive, negative, or equivocal. Incidence will be defined as those with a &quot;positive&quot; finding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of HIV infection</measure>
    <time_frame>post intervention (8 months)</time_frame>
    <description>HIV infection will be assessed at 8 month follow up. Test results yield: positive, negative, or equivocal. Incidence will be defined as those with a &quot;positive&quot; finding.</description>

    <description>Participants will meet 4 times for 4 workshops. Workshops will be in groups of 6-8. Every participant will complete each workshop sequentially with the group they are assigned to.
