  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      L-carnitine is an amino acid that is naturally produced in the liver and kidneys, it is
      involved in transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, it could be an
      important component in treating a fatty liver disease.

      The investigators conduct a study to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of L-Carnitine
      and Magnesium as a treatment for fatty liver.

      A phase 3, randomized, double blind placebo controlled study that evaluate the efficacy of
      L-Carnitine and Magnesium as a treatment for fatty liver, 60 eligible patients with a
      diagnosis of NAFDL will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the trial
      product &quot; SLIM WATER&quot; that contains L-CARNITINE and MAGNESIUM for a duration of 16 weeks, or
      placebo for the initial 8 weeks and continue another 8 weeks with the trial product &quot;SLIM
      WATER&quot;. `Follow up time is estimated to be 24 week based on monthly clinic visits and
      accordingly assessment of lipid profile, weight and insulin resistance.

      Fibrotest will be used at the beginning of the trial and at the end (week 16) comparing the
      fat content before and after the treatment.
