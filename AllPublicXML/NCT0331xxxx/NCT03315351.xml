    <textblock>
      Interventional, exploratory, prospective and monocentric study which aim to study the
      feasibility of brachytherapy using a PET-scan
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will proceed as follow:

        -  Initial check-up before the brachytherapy, including a clinical exam, collect of disease
           history and other informations that can be required for a good execution of the trial,
           and a usual patient care (chemotherapy with concomitant radiotherapy, biopsy, RMI,
           PET-scan and paraaortic lymphadenectomy).

        -  additional PET-scan exam at day 1 of the brachytherapy (with collect of informations on
           toxicity, clinical morphology data and biomorphological data of RMI and PET-scan, and
           dosimetric study of the brachytherapy)

        -  4 months after the brachytherapy, additional PET-scan monitoring metabolic volumes and
           standardized metabolic fixation parameters
