  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, 2-way crossover study to assess the
      effect of intensive UA lowering therapy with RDEA3170, febuxostat, and dapagliflozin on
      urinary excretion of UA, in asymptomatic hyperuricemic patients. Twenty-four asymptomatic
      hyperuricemic patients aged 18 to 65 years (inclusive) will be enrolled into this study at 2
      study centers.

      Before any study specific assessments are performed, potential patients must provide informed
      consent. Each patient will undergo the below mentioned visits:

        -  A Screening period of maximum 28 days;

        -  Two treatment periods during which patients will be resident in the Clinical Unit from
           Day -2 to Day 1 and from Day 6 to Day 8; and

        -  A Follow-up Visit within 14 to 28 days after the first administration of Investigational
           Medicinal Product (IMP) in Treatment Period 2.

      On Day -2 of Treatment period 1, patient will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment
      sequences (AB or BA). Each randomized patient will receive orally once daily fixed dose of
      the below mentioned 2 treatments for 7 consecutive days (1 treatment per treatment period).

        -  Treatment A: RDEA3170 + febuxostat + dapagliflozin

        -  Treatment B: RDEA3170 + febuxostat + placebo For each treatment period, baseline
           measurements will be performed. On Day 1, after all dosing and all assessments have been
           performed, patients will receive instruction to administer the IMP at home once daily in
           the morning from Day 2 to Day 6 and the IMP will be dispensed for home dosing. Patients
           will return to the Clinical Unit on Day 6 and will be residential in the Clinical Unit
           from Day 6 to Day 8.

      Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 will be separated by a washout period of 7 to 21
      days.

      Patients will return to the Clinical Unit for a Follow-up Visit, 14 to 28 days after Day 1 of
      Treatment Period 2.
