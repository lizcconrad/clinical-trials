  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis (AE) is a disease that has been increasing steadily in recent years in most
      countries, including Spain.Risk factors for the development of AE include age,
      hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension, the classic risk factors
      for the development of atherosclerosis. However, lipid-lowering therapy with statins and
      ezetimibe has not been shown to reduce the risk of long-term progression of AE by unknown
      mechanisms. All this suggests that subjects with HFhe have a high risk of developing AD,
      which has not been shown by the high coronary mortality in this population that precedes
      aortic calcification

      The study includes a single clinical visit with collection of clinical data, blood extraction
      and the performance of a transthoracic echocardiogram. This visit may be made on different
      days, but always within 30 days of signing the informed consent.
