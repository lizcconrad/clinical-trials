  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No previous study reported the treatment outcome of stage III nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
      patients. The investigators try to investigate the long-term treatment outcome of stage III
      NPC patients and do risk grouping by plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA assay for future
      therapy improvement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The stage III NPC patients were the majority group of the patient population of NPC. But most
      clinical trials focused on the treatment of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th
      edition stage IVA/IVB treatment for high risk of recurrence or metastasis. No previous study
      reported the treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients. The investigators tried to
      investigate the long-term treatment outcome of stage III NPC patients and do risk grouping by
      plasma EBV DNA assay for future therapy improvement.
