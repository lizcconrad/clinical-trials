  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal toxic events related to Immune Checkpoints Inhibitors therapy (Nivolumab,
      Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab and Ipilimumab) have been recently reported. These were
      immune-allergic acute interstitial nephritis.

      However, no systematic study has ever focused on renal adverse effects. The investigators
      study here the evolution of renal function and the occurrence of nephrological events in a
      large monocentric cohort of patients treated with Immune Checkpoints Inhibitors in the Centre
      Hospitalier Lyon Sud. Nephrological parameters based on Serum Creatinine (SCr), estimate
      Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and urinary sediment are monitored. The aim of the study is
      to determine the incidence of renal events due to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor treatment,
      particularly Acute Kidney Injury, (AKI) and identify the clinical presentation, histological
      description and risk factors.

    <description>Acute kidney Injury is defined by the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) recommendations by an increase in serum creatinine during follow-up of at least 1.5 times the baseline.
Follow-up : Nephrological parameters will be notice during whole treatment duration, until interruption for medical reason (tumoral progression, severe adverse event) or end of the study (stop of the collection and analysis of the results); In this case, a 6-month follow-up period for patients undergoing treatment at the time of the collection of data.</description>
