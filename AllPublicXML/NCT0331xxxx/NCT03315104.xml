  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza, or the flu, is an infectious respiratory disease that can range in severity from
      mild to severe to even death. This study aims to evaluate a treatment for people who are
      hospitalized with the flu. The study is looking to see if antibodies collected from people
      who have recovered from the seasonal flu or who have had the seasonal flu shot can be used
      safely as a study drug to treat hospitalized patients with severe flu infections. Also, this
      study will help to find the right dose for this study drug for treatment of severe flu in
      hospitalized patients. Overall, this study will evaluate if the hospitalized patients
      receiving standard of care along with the study drug get better more quickly than those
      treated with standard of care and placebo. The study drug that contains antibodies against
      the flu is called anti-influenza immune globulin intravenous (FLU-IGIV).
