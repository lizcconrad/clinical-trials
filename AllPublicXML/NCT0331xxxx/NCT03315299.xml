  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide expanded access to ASP2215 for a single subject with
      refractory FLT3-mutated AML without access to comparable or alternative therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This treatment protocol is being conducted in a single pediatric patient while phase 3
      ASP2215 studies are ongoing in adult subjects with FLT3-mutated AML.

      The subjects will enter the screening period up to 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment.

      The subject will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles.

      The subjects will complete visits on cycle 1 days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 days 1, 15, and day 1
      of each cycle thereafter until discontinued from the study for toxicity, disease progression,
      or lack of continued benefit in the judgement of the investigator.

      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of the
      investigation product (ASP2215), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy,
      whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow up.

          5. In the judgment of the investigator, there is no comparable or satisfactory
             alternative therapy to treat the subject's AML.

          6. Subject has not received any chemotherapy or investigational agent within at least 5
             half-lives after stopping that drug and before starting gilteritinib.

          7. Subject must meet the following criteria as indicated on clinical laboratory tests:

               -  Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x
                  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Serum total bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL, except for subjects with Gilbert's syndrome

               -  Serum potassium and serum magnesium &gt; institutional lower limit of normal (LLN).

          8. Subject is able to tolerate oral administration of study drug.

          9. Subject who has developed overall grades II-IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) must
             satisfy the following criteria:

               -  No requirement of &gt; 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone (or equivalent) daily dose within 1
                  week of randomization

               -  No escalation of immunosuppression in terms of increase of corticosteroids or
                  addition of new agent / modality in prior 2 weeks (note that increasing
                  calcineurin inhibitors or sirolimus to achieve therapeutic trough levels is
                  allowed).

         10. Female subject must either:

               -  Be of nonchildbearing potential:
