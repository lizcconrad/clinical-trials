  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, single centre, open-label, randomised, single dose, two-period, crossover
      study to evaluate the bioavailability of Infacort® versus Cortef® immediate release
      hydrocortisone tablets in dexamethasone-suppressed healthy adult male and female subjects in
      the fasted and fed states.

      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and 2) which will not be performed
      sequentially. In Part 1, 24 subjects will be dosed in a fasted condition and in Part 2, 24
      subjects will be dosed in a fed condition. Each part will comprise of a pre-study screen,
      followed by 2 treatment periods (1 and 2) and a post-study follow-up.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male or female subjects between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive (at
             screening).

          2. A BMI of 18-30 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          3. No clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology or urine
             examination values as defined by the investigator.

          4. A negative urinary drugs of abuse screen. A positive alcohol test may be repeated at
             the discretion of the Investigator.

          5. Negative HIV and Hepatitis B and C test results.

          6. No clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead ECG as defined by the investigator.

          7. No clinically significant deviation outside the normal ranges for blood pressure and
             heart rate measurements as defined by the investigator (please refer to appendix 1 for
             normal ranges).

          8. Subjects (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) and sexual partners
             must use 2 effective contraception methods during the trial and for 3 months after the
             last dose, for example:

               -  Condom + Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal contraceptive.

               -  Condom + Intrauterine device (IUD).

               -  Condom + Diaphragm with spermicide.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential (unless of non-childbearing potential or
             where abstaining from sexual intercourse is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject) with a negative pregnancy test at screening and on admission
             and willing to use an effective method of contraception from the first dose until 3
             months after the last dose of IMP, for example:

               -  Established use of oral / injected / implanted hormonal methods of contraception.

               -  Intra‐uterine device (IUD)or intrauterine system (IUS).

               -  Barrier methods: Condom + Occlusive cap (Diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with
                  spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository .

         10. Female subjects of non-childbearing potential with negative pregnancy test at
             screening. For the purposes of this study, this is defined as the subject being
             amenorrhoeic for at least 12 consecutive months or at least 4 months post-surgical
             sterilisation (including bilateral fallopian tube ligation or bilateral oophorectomy
             with or without hysterectomy). Menopausal status will be confirmed by demonstrating at
             screening that levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) fall within the respective
             pathology reference range. In the event a subject's menopause status has been clearly
             established (for example, the subject indicates she has been amenorrhoeic for 10
             years), but FSH levels are not consistent with a post-menopausal condition,
             determination of subject eligibility will be at Investigator's discretion following
             consultation with the Sponsor

         11. Subjects must be available to complete both periods of the study and the follow-up
             visit.

         12. Subjects must satisfy a medical examiner about their fitness to participate in the
             study.

         13. Subjects must be able to read and understand the informed consent form and must
             provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A clinically significant history of gastrointestinal disorder likely to influence drug
             absorption.

          2. Receipt of any medication other than acetaminophen within the 14 days prior to dosing
             (including topical steroids, vitamins, dietary supplements or herbal remedies).

          3. Evidence of renal, hepatic, central nervous system, respiratory, cardiovascular or
             metabolic dysfunction.

          4. Receipt of any vaccination within the previous one month.

          5. Presence of infections (systemic fungal and viral infections, acute bacterial
             infections).

          6. Current or previous history of tuberculosis.

          7. A clinically significant history of previous allergy/sensitivity to hydrocortisone
             and/or dexamethasone.

          8. Meeting any of the contraindications for Cortef® and/or dexamethasone, as detailed in
             the USPI and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), respectively.

          9. A clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.

         10. Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e. language problem, poor
             mental development or impaired cerebral function).

         11. Participation in a New Chemical Entity or marketed drug clinical study within the
             previous 3 months or, five half-lives of study drug, whichever is the longer period.
             (NB. the three-month washout period between trials is defined as the period of time
             elapsed between the last dose of the previous study and the first dose of the next
             study).

         12. Subjects who have consumed more than two units of alcohol per day within seven days
             prior to the first dose or have consumed any alcohol within the 48-hour period prior
             to the first dose.

         13. Donation or receipt of equal to or greater than 450 mL of blood within the previous
             three months.

         14. Subjects who smoke (or ex-smokers who have smoked within six months prior to first
             dose).This includes e-cigarette and shisha users.
