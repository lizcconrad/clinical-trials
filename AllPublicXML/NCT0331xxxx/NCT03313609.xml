  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Turkey is a developing country and its intensive care infrastructure is worse than developed
      countries. The staff is very busy at work. Intensive care has become a new science. We wanted
      to investigate burnout syndrome among physicians and other health care workers who are
      starting to work at a new intensive care medicine. Intensive care specialists in Turkey do
      not work in intensive care centers where they want. This may have a negative effect on
      physicians.

      Burnuot health practices are more common than the normal group. The data about Turkey are
      limited. In developing societies, there are often no protocols in intensive care. There are
      no teams again during intensive care. All work is done by physicians and other health
      workers. This may adversely affect health care workers. Intensive care science is new. The
      training first started in 2013. The newly graduated heavy-duty specialists can work where
      they do not want. The workload of the health workers working in the intensive care unit is
      high. We wanted to investigate burnout on healthcare workers in Turkey.
