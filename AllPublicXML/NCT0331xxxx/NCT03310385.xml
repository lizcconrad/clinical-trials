  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 2, multicentre, dose-finding, double-blind, randomized
      placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of GHX02,
      compared with placebo, for acute bronchitis. One-hundred and fifty patients will be included
      in this trial and randomly assigned to either a high-dose GHX02 group(1920mg/day),
      standard-dose GHX02 group(960mg/day), or control group(placebo) in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio.
      Patients will take one of the medications three times a day for 7 days, with 3 visiting
      days(screening, day0, day7). On the screening day, the Korean Standard Tool of Pattern
      Identification of Cough and Sputum, a diagnostic system that determines therapy in
      Traditional Korean Medicine, will be used to allocate patients into three groups of
      wind-heat, wind-cold or others.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in BSS(Bronchitis Severity Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day0, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>BSS comprises the sum of five major symptom scores for acute bronchitis: cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain during coughing, and rales on auscultation. Each symptom is scored on a 4-point-scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe), with a maximum total score of 20 points. The investigator assesses symptom scores on the basis of the patient's subjective symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Questionnaire of Clinical Symptoms of Cough and Sputum</measure>
    <time_frame>Day0, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire items are as follows: (1) cough -frequency, intensity, sensitivity; (2) sputum -frequency, volume, difficulty to cough-up, appearance, color; (3) activities of daily living; (4) night-time sleeping. Each item is scored on a 4-point-scale, with a total maximum score of 40 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Leicester Cough Questionnaire-acute(LCQ-acute)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day0, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 19 items divided into three parts, physical, psychological, and social, each scored from 1 to 7. The total score is the sum of the average scores(1-7 points) for each part. The higher the score, the better the quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in frequency of coughing fits</measure>
    <time_frame>Day0, Day1, Day2, Day3, Day4, Day5, Day6, Day7</time_frame>
    <description>participants will be classified into one of the following scales: 0 = 0 time/day, 1 = 1 time/day, 2 = 2-3 times/day, 3 = 4-5 times/day(sometimes), 4 = 6-10 times/day(frequent), 5 = over 15 times/day(consistently).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Integrative Medicine Outcome Scale(IMOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day7</time_frame>
    <description>It's a 5-point-scale for evaluating improvement after treatment (where, 1=complete recovery, 2=major improvement, 3=slight-to-moderate improvement, 4=no change, 5=deterioration), either by the patient or investigator (the investigator in this trial).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Integrative Medicine Patient Satisfaction Scale(IMPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day7</time_frame>
    <description>It's a 5-point-scale for evaluating patient satisfaction with the treatment (where, 1=very satisfied, 2=satisfied, 3=neutral, 4=dissatisfied, 5=very dissatisfied)</description>
