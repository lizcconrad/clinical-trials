  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a dietary intervention aimed at increasing unsaturated
      fatty acids (UFA) consumption is feasible and has the potential to improve cardiorespiratory
      fitness, metabolic flexibility and glucose tolerance in symptomatic obese heart failure with
      preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve obese HFpEF subjects with exercise intolerance (reduce cardiorespiratory fitness
      measured at maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test [CPX]) will be assigned to a single-arm
      open-label dietary intervention in which subjects are encouraged and financially supported to
      increase daily UFA consumption. The investigators will measure dietary compliance with a
      validated 24-hour dietary recall and with objective operator-independent biomarkers of UFA
      consumption.

      The investigators will also measure the effects of UFA supplementation on: metabolic
      flexibility, glucose tolerance and body composition. Participants will have the option to
      participate in overnight session in the whole indirect calorimeter room (WIC) at baseline and
      at the end of the study.

    <description>Dietary intervention aimed at increasing UFA consumption. The face-to-face intervention will be performed by a research nutritionist that reviews the dietary recall and provides a list of commonly available foods rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) (monounsaturated [MUFA] and polyunsaturated fatty acids [PUFA]), together with individual instructions on how to integrate the recommended foods in the daily dietary pattern based on the dietary recall, and also to emphasize that the recommended food should be consumed as listed, and not as part of processed food (i.e., guacamole for avocado, hazelnut chocolate for nuts, pesto for olive oil, fish sticks for fatty fish). Extra-virgin olive oil or canola oil or nuts will be considered first choice for daily consumption of UFA-rich food, but a list of daily food substitutes will be also provided .</description>

    <description>Investigators will provide participant with detailed information about the consumption of food rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) like extra-virgin olive oil, canola oil or mixed nuts, and they will provide specific recommendations based on the participant's diet. The investigators will follow up with a weekly phone call to assure that the dietary recommendations are clear and that the participants can integrate the suggestions into their daily diets.</description>
