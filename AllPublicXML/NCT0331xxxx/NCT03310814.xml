      This study compares the efficacy of a non-practitioner assisted direct-to-consumer (DTC)
      self-driven approach to nutrigenomics versus a personalized practitioner-led method. The
      secondary aims are to use this data combined with participant feedback to generate more
      effective nutrigenomics-based products.

      While nutrition is a widely accepted tool for the prevention of long-term health conditions,
      current approaches have not adequately reduced chronic disease morbidity. Nutrigenomics has
      great potential, however, it is complicated to implement. There is a need for products,
      derived from nutrigenomics, which are easily understood, accessible and utilized. The primary
      objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a non-practitioner assisted
      direct-to-consumer (DTC) self-driven approach to nutrigenomics versus a personalized
      practitioner-led method. The secondary aims are to use this data combined with participant
      feedback to generate more effective nutrigenomics-based products.

      Methods:

      This 4-month study used a mixed-methods design that included: 1) a phase 1 randomized control
      trial that examined the effectiveness of a multi-faceted, nutrition-based gene test
      (components assessed included the major nutrients, food tolerances, food taste and
      preferences, and vitamins) in changing health behaviours; followed by 2) qualitative
      investigation that explored participants' experiences. The study recruited 57 healthy males
      and females (35-55 years) randomized as a 2:1 ratio where 38 received the intervention
      (gene-test results plus personalized nutrition report) and 19 were assigned to the control
      group (gene-test results report emailed). Both groups received follow-up emails with
      nutrition-related tips and reminders. The primary outcomes of interest measures included
      changes in diet (nutrients, healthy eating index), self-efficacy, quality of life and
      anthropometrics (BMI, waist:hip) measured at baseline, post-intervention (3 and 6 weeks), and
      the final visit. After the study has been completed, participants in the control group will
      also receive their personalized nutrition report.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults, aged 35-55 years.

          2. Ability to understand sign an informed consent and to give a buccal DNA swab.

          3. Willing to improve their health.

          4. Medically stable. Subjects diagnosed with diet-related chronic disease were able to
             enroll in the study, provided that their condition was stabilized or well controlled
             for at least six months at the time of the baseline visit. Determination of stabilized
             medical condition was based on established clinical guidelines (e.g., Canadian
             Diabetes Association Clinical Guidelines and Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Guidelines).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently on a therapeutic or restrictive diet (e.g., Atkins).

          2. Diagnosis of 2 or more chronic diseases or unstable chronic disease as deemed by
             accepted clinical guidelines.

          3. Clinical diagnosis of any mental health condition.

          4. Current or former malignancy for which the participant has undergone resection,
             radiation therapy or chemotherapy within 5 years prior to baseline.

          5. Diagnosis of any medical condition or disease, which in the opinion of the Principal
             Investigator (PI), may have either put the participant at risk, or influenced the
             results of the study or the participant's ability to participate in the study.

          6. Diagnosis of any of the following medical conditions: HIV, COPD, severe/uncontrolled
             asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, chronic renal
             failure, colon or small intestine problem, liver or kidney disease.

          7. Currently enrolled or plan to be enrolled in another research study during the course
             of this investigation.

          8. Planned or recent (within the last 12 months) bariatric surgery.

          9. Current use of weight altering medication for the purpose of weight loss.
