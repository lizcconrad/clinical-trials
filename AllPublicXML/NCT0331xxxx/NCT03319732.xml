  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is a common complication in MS and occurs in up to 84% of patients. The main sign
      of spasticity is resistance to passive limb movement characterized by increased resistance to
      stretching, clonus, and exaggerated deep reflexes. Osmotica Pharmaceutical is currently
      developing arbaclofen extended-release tablets (AERT) for the treatment of spasticity in
      patients with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of oral AERT in patients with spasticity due to MS. Subjects from the double
      blind study (Study OS440-3004) may rollover into this open-label extension study, as well as
      de novo subjects. The maintenance dose will be the highest tolerated dose. Subjects may
      choose to taper study drug after Visit 3 if they experience adverse events and in direct
      consultation with the investigator site. Subjects should be encouraged to titrate back to the
      highest dose once adverse events subside or remain on the maximally tolerated AERT dose. Once
      the subject has reached the maintenance dose, they will remain on that dose for approximately
      1 year.

    <description>Patient Global impression of Change (PGIC) is a scale to evaluate the change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life using scores from 1-7 with 1 being no change and 7 being a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference.</description>

    <measure>Total Numeric-transformed modified Ashworth Scale score or the most affected limb (TNmAS-MAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>over 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The TNmAS is considered the primary clinical measure of muscle spasticity in subjects with neurological conditions. It is a useful 6-point rating scale to measure abnormality in tone or the resistance to passive movements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>over 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in MS and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5-unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. A score of 0 represents a normal neurological exam and 10 represents death due to MS.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects 18 to 65 years of age, inclusive.

          2. An established diagnosis per McDonald Criteria (Polman et al 2011) of MS (either
             relapsing-remitting [RR] or secondary-progressive [SP] course) that manifests a
             documented history of spasticity for at least 6 months prior to Baseline.

          3. Has participated in Study OS440-3004 or is a new US subject (ie, a de novo subject)
             who fulfills the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

          4. Is willing to continue on open-label treatment with AERT as described in this
             protocol.

          5. If receiving disease-modifying medications (eg, interferons approved for MS,
             glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, fingolimod, or mitoxantrone), there must be no change
             in dose for at least 3 months prior to Baseline, and the subject must be willing to
             maintain this treatment dose for the duration of the study. If receiving AMPYRAÂ®
             (dalfampridine, fampridine, 4 amino puridine), subject must be at a stable dose for at
             least 3 months prior to Baseline.

          6. Stable regimen for at least 1 month prior to Baseline for all medications and non
             pharmacological therapies that are intended to alleviate spasticity.

             a. De novo subjects being considered for enrollment and taking medications indicated
             for the treatment of spasticity (ie, baclofen, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids,
             carisoprodol, dantrolene, tizanidine, cyclobenzaprine, any neuroleptic, ropinoprole,
             tolperisone, and clonidine) must wash out from these medications for a minimum of 21
             days by Baseline in order to be eligible for study treatment. De novo subjects found
             not to meet this criterion will be withdrawn from the study and will be considered
             screen failures.

          7. Absence of infections, peripheral vascular disease, painful contractures, advanced
             arthritis, or other conditions that hinder evaluation of joint movement.

          8. Creatinine clearance, as calculated by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the
             Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) formula, of &gt;50 mL/minute.

          9. Use of a medically highly effective form of birth control (see Section 7.8 of the
             protocol) during the study and for 3 months thereafter for women of child-bearing
             potential (including female subjects).

         10. Willing to sign the informed consent form (ICF).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Any concomitant disease or disorder that has symptoms of spasticity or that may
             influence the subject's level of spasticity.

             2. Inability to rate their level of spasticity or distinguish it from other MS
             symptoms.

             3. Use of high dose oral or intravenous methylprednisolone, or equivalent, within 3
             months before Baseline.

             4. History of allergy to baclofen or any inactive components of the test formulation.

             5. Concomitant use of medications that would potentially interfere with the actions of
             the study medication or outcome variables (Appendix 5).

             6. Pregnancy, lactation, or planned pregnancy during the course of the study and for 3
             months after the final study visit.

             7. Recent history (within past 12 months) of any unstable psychiatric disease (or yes
             response to questions 1 or 2 on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C SSRS] at
             baseline), or current signs and symptoms of significant medical disorders such as
             severe, progressive, or uncontrolled pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             renal, genitourinary, hematological, endocrine, immunologic, or neurological disease.

             8. History of epilepsy. 9. Current significant cognitive deficit, severe or untreated
             anxiety, severe or untreated depression.

             10. Subjects with abnormal micturition that requires indwelling or intermittent
             catheterization or with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that result in a score &gt;26
             in the Baseline Urinary Symptom Profile - USPÂ© (USP) questionnaire (Appendix 6).
             Subjects who are proficient in self-catheterization may be included in the study at
             the investigator's discretion.

             11. Current malignancy or history of malignancy that has not been in remission for
             more than 5 years, except effectively treated basal cell skin carcinoma.

             the investigator at Baseline (at Visit 6 for rollover subjects).

             13. Any other significant disease, disorder, or significant laboratory finding,
             including clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or ongoing serious adverse
             events (SAEs) at Visit 6 (Final Visit) of Study OS440-3004, which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, puts the subject at risk because of participation, influences the
             result of the study, or affects the subject's ability to participate.

             14. Planned elective surgery or other procedures requiring general anesthesia during
             the course of the study.

             15. History of any illicit substance abuse (eg, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine) or
             prescription for long-acting opioids within the past 12 months (tramadol use will be
             allowed).

             16. Participation in another clinical research study (with the exception of Study
             OS440-3004) within 1 month of Baseline.
