  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head/neck
      squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) patients who are already initiating an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor (such as Nivolumab, Atezolizumab or Pembrolizumab) for disease treatment as per FDA
      approved guidelines. In these patients we will deliver a short-course radiation to a single
      systemic (non-CNS) site within 14 days of receiving the first dose of immune checkpoint
      inhibitors. This sequence allows radiation to release tumor antigens from immune inaccessible
      areas such as necrotic tumor or low perfusion to provide a robust anti-tumor immune response
      with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

      The primary objective is to assess six-month progression free survival (PFS) compared to
      historical control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with front-line or relapsed NSCLC or relapsed HNSCC who are intended to receive
      standard of care immune checkpoint inhibitors without a contraindication to Stereotactic Body
      Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to a single cancer deposit greater than 1 cm (metastasis or primary
      cancer) will be enrolled. Subjects will receive standard of care (SOC) immune checkpoint
      inhibitors and within 2 weeks of initiation, and will receive either:

        -  SBRT to target to achieve Biological Equivalent Dose (BED) &gt; 100 Gy OR

        -  30 Gy fractionated radiation therapy (RT) delivered as a 3 dimensional (3-D) dose.

      The lesion choice will be made by the treating radiation oncologist and will be directed to a
      single malignant focus (non-CNS) that measures ≥ 1 cm. Essentially, the goals of both
      techniques are the same but SBRT is reserved for lesions that are readily encompassed by a
      single field with large RT fractions in which dose-limiting organs are within safe limits.
