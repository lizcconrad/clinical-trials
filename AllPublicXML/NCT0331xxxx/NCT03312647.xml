      The investigators aim to study the prevalence of adverse reactions of anti-tuberculosis (TB)
      drugs in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and determine the risk factors of anti-TB
      drug-related toxicity in LTBI in Korean health care workers(HCWs).

      Further study details as provided by Hanyang University Hospital

      This study is prospective study of newly diagnosed LTBI in HCWs at Hanyang University
      Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea, between 2017 and 2018. This study
      aimed to identify the prevalence of adverse reactions of treatment regimen for LTBI. The
      diagnosis of LTBI was made on the basis of interferon-gamma releasing assay. Information on
      demographic characteristics, comorbidity and treatment outcomes was collated from
      questionnaires. Treatment regimen for LTBI was chosen by patients' preference among 3 months
      of INH(isoniazid) plus RFP(rifampin), 4 months of RFP and 9 months of INH. All PTB patients
      were observed 2 weeks after the initiation of medication, and monthly thereafter, and were
      asked about any drug side effects at these visits. Serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) was
      defined as any severe side effect that resulted in discontinuation or change (either
      temporally or permanently) of anti-TB medication, and/or directly resulted in
      hospitalization. Drug-induced hepatitis was defined as liver transaminases more than three
      times higher than the upper limit of normal in the presence of symptoms such as anorexia,
      nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, or transaminases more than five times the upper limit of
      normal without symptoms.

    <description>Identified subjects with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using whole-blood interferon-r release assays. All enrolled subjects were treated with one of the recommended regimens for LTBI treatment: 9 months of isoniazid, 4 months of rifampin and 3 months of isoniazid plus rifampin. Blood, urine sampling, and monitoring frequencies of adverse reactions of anti-TB drugs were performed.</description>
