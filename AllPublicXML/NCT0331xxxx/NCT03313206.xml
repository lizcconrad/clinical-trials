  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective will be to estimate the disease free survival (DFS) of patients with
      resectable head and neck mucosal melanomas treated by neo-adjuvant anti-PD1 followed by
      surgery, radiotherapy and maintenance immunotherapy in order to compare it to historical DFS
      results of this kind of patients treated by surgery and radiotherapy. Our primary end-point
      will be disease-free survival at 2 years

    <description>Neo-adjuvant therapy :
Anti-PD1 antibody will be used (pembrolizumab, Merck®) intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks. The patient will receive 4 injections maximum over 12 weeks. According to the investigator's opinion, the 4th injection might be cancelled in order to perform surgery from week 10 and not after week 13.
Tumor response will be assessed 2 weeks after the last injection both clinically and radiologically (by CT-scan and MRI).
Maintenance therapy by anti-PD1 antibody (pembrolizumab, Merck®) will be then used intravenously at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks for a maximum period of one year, starting one month after the end of radiotherapy.</description>

             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         12. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy.

         13. Patient affiliated to a social security system or beneficiary of the same

             events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          8. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 4 weeks or 5 half-life times (whatever the shorter) prior to study Day 1 or who
