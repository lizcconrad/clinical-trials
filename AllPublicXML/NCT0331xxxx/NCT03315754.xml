  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single-arm, open-label, 60-month follow-up phase IIb clinical trial.
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the absence of biopsy detectable Gleason
      grade 4 or 5 prostate cancer tumors anywhere in the prostate gland on 12-month,
      post-treatment biopsy following TOOKAD® Soluble-VTP. Men with Gleason score 7 (3+4) prostate
      cancer on one half of the prostate will receive TOOKAD® Soluble VTP under general anesthesia.
      Treatment will consist in hemiablation procedure designed to destroy the lobe of the prostate
      gland that contains the Gleason score 7 (3+4) cancer. Afterwards, patients will be followed
      for 5 years (60 months) with clinical evaluation, questionnaires on QOL, erectile and urinary
      functions, and PSA testing. In addition, treatment outcomes will be assessed based on
      prostate biopsy results at 3, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after the TOOKAD® Soluble
      treatment. All patients will undergo biopsy at 3 and 12 months. If the Month 3 biopsy is
      positive for any cancer, patients will be allowed a single re-treatment by TOOKAD® Soluble
      VTP to one or both lobes.

             subject (e.g., cardiac or respiratory disease precluding general anesthesia;
             anticoagulant treatment which cannot be temporarily withdrawn for the procedure).

         12. Any condition or history of active rectal inflammatory bowel disease or other factors

         13. Hormonal manipulation (excluding 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors) that alters androgen
             production within the previous 6 months;

         14. History of urethral stricture disease;

         15. History of acute urinary retention within 6 months of study entry;

         16. Condition requiring medication with potential photosensitizing effects (tetracyclines,
             quinolones, sulphonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycaemic agents, thiazide
             diuretics, griseofulvin, and amiodarone) if these treatments could not be stopped at
             least 10 days before and for 3 days after the VTP procedure or replaced by treatments
             without photosensitizing properties;

         17. Anticoagulant drugs (e.g., warfarin) that could not be withdrawn during the 10 days
             prior to the VTP procedure or antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin) that could not be
             withdrawn during the 10 days prior to the VTP procedure and 3 days after VTP;

         18. Renal and hepatic disorders with values of &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
             or blood disorders (upon clinician judgment);
