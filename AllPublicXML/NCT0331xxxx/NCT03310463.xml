  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is being conducted to look at the pharmacokinetics (PK; how the human
      body processes a substance), safety, and tolerability of a single dose of ETX2514 and
      sulbactam (ETX2514SUL) when concurrently administered by separate intravenous (IV) infusion
      in participants with various degrees of renal impairment (RI), in participants with end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD) who are on hemodialysis (HD), and in healthy matched control
      participants with normal renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, open-label, non-randomized study evaluates the PK, safety, and tolerability of
      a single concurrent IV infusion of ETX2514SUL in participants with various degrees of RI, in
      participants with ESRD who are on HD, and in healthy matched control participants with normal
      renal function.

      Participants will be enrolled into five cohorts, according to renal function status, and will
      receive an IV infusion of ETX2514SUL (single dose of up to 1000 milligrams [mg] ETX2514 and
      1000 mg sulbactam given by concurrent 3-hour IV infusion). Participants in Cohort 5 will
      receive the ETX2514SUL infusion both post-HD (Period 1) and pre-HD (Period 2).

          -  Pregnant (positive pregnancy test) or lactating women at Screening or Day -1. If serum
             human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test results are indeterminate, follow-up
             testing should be performed to determine eligibility.

          -  All female participants will not be pregnant and will have a negative pregnancy test
             at Screening and Day -1, with the following exception: females receiving dialysis with
             an indeterminate pregnancy test result or persistently low hCG resulting in a false
             positive pregnancy test may be included in the study at the discretion of the
             Investigator and notification of the Sponsor. Postmenopausal participants with a
             result outside the post-menopausal range or an indeterminate pregnancy test will
             undergo additional testing for FSH to confirm postmenopausal status prior to study
             enrollment.

          -  Any clinically significant (CS) concomitant disease or condition (including treatment
             for such conditions) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could either interfere
             with the study drug or pose an unacceptable risk to the participant

          -  Any other CS abnormalities in laboratory test results at Screening that would, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, increase the participant's risk of participation,
             jeopardize complete participation in the study, or compromise interpretation of study
             data

          -  Uncontrolled medical condition (treated or untreated) considered to be CS by the
             Investigator

          -  Treatment with another investigational drug or device study within 30 days (or 5
             half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration on Day 1

          -  Participant has taken probenecid within 30 days prior to study drug administration on
             Day 1

          -  Has experienced an illness that is considered by the Investigator to be CS within 2
             weeks of study drug administration on Day 1

          -  Has donated or lost a significant volume (&gt;450 mL) of blood within 56 days or plasma
             within 7 days prior to Day -1

          -  Participated in strenuous exercise from 48 hours prior to Day -1 or during the study
             through the final end of study assessment

          -  Exclusion criteria for ECG at Screening, Day -1, and Day 1 predose (a single repeat is
             allowed for eligibility determination, with Investigator discretion for RI and ESRD
             participants):

               -  Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (did not include ST segment changes
                  associated with repolarization)

               -  Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to atrioventricular block
                  [2nd degree or higher], Wolff Parkinson White syndrome [unless curative radio
                  ablation therapy])

               -  Sinus pauses &gt;3 seconds

               -  Any significant arrhythmia or conduction abnormality, which, in the opinion of
                  the Investigators and Medical Monitor (MM), interfered with the safety for the
                  individual participant

               -  Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (≥3 consecutive ventricular
                  ectopic beats)

          -  Any other reason that would render the participant unsuitable for study enrollment at
             the discretion of the Investigator

        Healthy Participants (Cohort 1)

        Healthy participants will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following
        criteria:

          -  The participant's systolic blood pressure was outside the range of 90 to 150
             millimeters per mercury (mmHg), diastolic blood pressure was outside the range of 40
             to 95 mmHg or heart rate was outside the range of 45 to 100 beats per minute at
             Screening.

          -  Positive test for drugs of abuse and/or positive alcohol test

          -  Positive test at Screening for any of the following: Hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

        Participants with RI (Cohorts 2-4)

        Participants with RI will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following
        criteria:

          -  Positive test for drugs of abuse and/or positive alcohol test if not accounted for by
             a prescription medication. Participants with a positive test based on a prescribed
             medication may be enrolled.

          -  Acute exacerbation of RI or unstable renal function, as determined by the
             Investigator, from Screening to Day 1

          -  Hemoglobin concentration &lt;9.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) at Screening

          -  Cohorts 2-4: Positive test at Screening for HBsAg or HIV

          -  Cohorts 2 and 3: Positive test at Screening for HCV. If a participant with severe RI
             (Cohort 4) has positive test results for HCV but liver function tests are otherwise
             not CS, the participant may be included at the Investigator's discretion (this
             provision does not apply to participants with mild or moderate RI [Cohorts 2 or 3]).

        Participants with ESRD Requiring HD (Cohort 5)

        Participants with ESRD will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following
        criteria:

          -  Positive test for drugs of abuse and/or positive alcohol test if not accounted for by
             a prescription medication. Participants with a positive test based on a prescribed
             medication may be enrolled.

          -  Hemoglobin concentration &lt;9.0 g/dL at Screening

          -  Positive test at Screening for HBsAg or HIV. If a participant with ESRD has positive
             test results for HCV but liver function tests are otherwise not clinically
             significant, the participant may be included at the Investigator's discretion.
