  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During any general anaesthetic which involves muscle relaxation artificial breathing is
      required. This is most commonly provided by pushing air under pressure (positive pressure
      ventilation) into the lungs via a tube in the airway (the tracheal tube). It has been
      observed for many years that with this form of breathing the distribution of gas within the
      lungs differs from that seen during 'natural' breathing: more of the gas goes to the upper
      parts of the lung than lower parts. This change in how the gas is distributed can lead to
      problems with how well oxygen is taken up by blood and carbon dioxide removed from the body.
      Previous work using mathematical modelling has found that the position of the tracheal tube
      might affect air distribution, but this has previously been difficult to study in 'real
      life', requiring the use of radioactive dyes and computerised tomography (CT). However a
      bedside test is now available which allows us to study these changes rapidly and
      non-invasively, using electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The EIT device is commercially
      available (PulmoVistaÂ®, Draeger UK) and is used in hospitals worldwide as a bedside monitor
      of lung ventilation.

      This study aims to investigate the effect of tracheal intubation on regional ventilation of
      the lungs by comparing measurements before and after the patient is anaesthetised and
      intubated. We aim to show whether altered patterns of ventilation are caused by patients
      simply being asleep and ventilated, or whether these changes are due to the use of a tracheal
      tube itself. The exact effect of tube position will also be studied by measuring ventilation
      as the tube is deliberately advanced until it enters one of the lungs. This will give us
      information about the ideal position for a tube within the trachea to promote optimal
      ventilation patterns within the lungs

    <description>General anaesthesia will then be induced, and when the participant is asleep a further set of measurements will be taken using the Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) belt whilst ventilation is maintained using the normal bag-mask ventilation technique used by anaesthetists in the first few minutes of the anaesthetic. Following this, the trachea will be intubated by the anaesthetist clinically responsible for the patient, and a further set of EIT measurements taken.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Willing and able to consent

          2. undergoing a surgical procedure for which the anaesthetic technique includes muscle
             relaxation, intubation and ventilation for clinical care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unwilling or unable to consent

          2. co-existant respiratory disease associated with known abnormalities of
             ventilation/perfusion matching. This includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
             asthma, or abnormalities of the chest wall or abdomen affecting ventilation e.g.
             morbid obesity

          3. Requirement for double-lumen tracheal tube for clinical care

          4. increased risk of regurgitation/aspiration e.g. pregnancy, symptomatic acid reflux,
             structural abnormalities of the gastro-intestinal tract (e.g. hiatus hernia)
