  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DTG 50 milligram (mg) tablet was approved for marketing in Russian Federation; however, DTG
      is not currently available for subjects at Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Centers
      as it is not available for order and supply via Federal program. This study is an open-label
      study which will include subjects, who complete taking DTG in studies ING112276, ING113086,
      ING114915, ING111762, and those subjects who end participation in study 200304 in which they
      received either DTG or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV). DTG will be supplied at a dose of 50 mg
      once daily to eligible subjects until the subject stops taking DTG or transitions to
      commercial supply of DTG when available at AIDS Centers via the Federal program. The
      objective of this study is to bridge the gap between the closure of ING112276, ING113086,
      ING114915, ING111762 or end of subject's participation in 200304 and the actual availability
      of commercial DTG at AIDS Centers via Federal program for human immunodeficiency
      (HIV)-1-infected adult subjects in Russian Federation. The study will also investigate
      long-term safety of DTG for subjects continuing DTG in Russian Federation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must complete an End of Study (EOS) visit for the originating protocol
             ING112276, ING113086, ING114915, ING111762, or be withdrawn from 200304 and attend
             withdrawal visit prior to transitioning to this study.

          -  Documented evidence of plasma HIV-1 RNA measurement &lt;50 c/mL at the EOS visit in
             ING112276, ING113086, ING114915, ING111762, 200304 (for subjects receiving DTG ) and
             &lt;400 c/mL for subjects prior receiving LPV/RTV in 200304.

          -  Based on medical assessment by the subject's Principal Investigator, the subject
             continues to derive clinical benefit from treatment with DTG as part of combination
             antiretroviral therapy (cART) and demonstrates stable virologic success. For subjects,
             currently receiving LPV/RTV and finishing their participation in 200304, possibility
             to derive clinical benefit from treatment with DTG is assessed by Principal
             Investigator following recommendation of Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC).

          -  Subjects must be capable of giving signed informed consent to participate in this
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects not currently enrolled in clinical study ING112276, ING113086, ING114915,
             ING111762, 200304 are not eligible for this study.

          -  Subjects for whom confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria were met in ING112276,
             ING113086, ING114915, ING111762, 200304 are not eligible.

          -  In addition to the above mentioned criteria, investigator/physician must confirm that
             the subject has no prohibited clinical condition (other medicines or other health
             conditions, such as hepatic or renal contra-indications). Further, all women of child
             bearing potential must be cautioned that DTG is not approved for use in pregnancy, and
             be advised that birth control measures should be in place while taking DTG. Subjects
             who were permanently discontinued from DTG in the previous study due to intolerance
             must not be included in this study.
