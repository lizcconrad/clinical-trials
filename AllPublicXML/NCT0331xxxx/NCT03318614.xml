  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 3-month study was conducted in flood victims from affected villages in the Tumpat district,
      Kelantan. Participants were given either probiotic, Bifidobacterium infantis M63 (M-63 group)
      or no probiotics (control group) for three months. At baseline and 3-month, participants were
      assessed for thewater, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) practices, abdominal symptoms, breath
      testing for hydrogen and methane to detect the presence of SIBO and also fecal samples for
      gut microbiota profiling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an observed rise in cases of acute gastroenteritis and post-infectious irritable
      bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) during the peak flood period. One major reason is poor sanitation,
      water and hygiene practice by flood victims during the flood because of poor access to clean
      water. The mechanism how poor hygiene causes non-specific abdominal complaints is unknown.
      The investigators speculated that small intestinal overgrowth (SIBO) is the fundamental basis
      for the increase in reported cases of acute gastroenteritis and abdominal complaints among
      flood victims. The investigators further speculated that administration of antibiotics or
      probiotics could reduce the abdominal symptoms after three months.

      Therefore, the intervention study was conducted for three months. Compliance of participants
      was checked by a diary given to participants in the M-63 group to document their daily intake
      of probiotics. This study will for the first time demonstrate the fundamental mechanism
      behind the poor WaSH practices and gastrointestinal disturbances after flood. Also this study
      would support a role for probiotic intervention to reduce abdominal complications when the
      next flood occurs.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>IBS-SSS contains five questions that determine severity of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distension, dissatisfaction with bowel habits and interference with quality of life (QOL) on a 100-point visual analogue scale. Since each question contributes to the score equally, therefore 500 is the maximum score, and higher the score, the severity is worse. For those participants with scores below 175, they have mild IBS, and in general, if scores are below 75, they are considered in remission. No units of measure are used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 measures four physical components (i.e. physical functioning, role limitations in physical health, bodily pain and general health perception) and four mental components (i.e. social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality or energy and mental well-being). Total physical component and total mental component were calculated as the sum of all items in the physical and mental components, respectively. Participants with a higher score in each domain of SF-36 have a better quality of life (QOL) in that domain. No units of measure are used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Malay-translated version of 14-item HADS contains four-point Likert responses Participants with higher scores had worse anxiety and depression. No units of measure are used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breath-testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to exhale end-expiratory breath samples into a collection bag at baseline. Then they were asked to drink 75 g of glucose in cold water. At intervals of 15 mins for the next 2 hours, breath samples were collected and symptoms recorded. Forty mL of exhaled breath were syringed into the machine (Quintron, Milwaukee, US), and levels of H2 and CH4 (in parts per million or ppm) were determined. For a positive test, the following criteria were applied: a rise in H2 value (≥ 20 ppm) or CH4 values (≥ 10 ppm) above fasting baseline value or a sustained rise in H2 or CH4 of 5 ppm over 3 consecutive breath samples. A rise in breath values as above and reproduction of symptoms were required to diagnose SIBO.</description>
