      This is a generic sample collection study for collecting blood, stool, rectal swabs, nasal
      washes, nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, nasal swabs, and urine
      from human sources. Subjects will be recruited from BioFire Diagnostics employees and from
      the general community. Subjects may be asked about recent or ongoing illness at the time of
      specimen collection and these symptoms will be recorded and attached to the sample. No other
      identifying information will be collected and the samples will be kept anonymous.The samples
      may be used internally or by external sites, such as the clinical study sites, for evaluating
      and determining performance characteristics of in vitro diagnostic devices.
