    <textblock>
      Pleural effusions (PE) are common conditions that signal either infection or cancer. The
      investigators aim to develop, validate, and prospectively assess the MAPED score, a clinical
      score that predicts malignancy at admission. This tool will assist clinicians all over the
      world to rapidly assess the probability of an effusion being malignant within 4 hours of
      admission.

      Background: Pleural effusions (PE) are common conditions that signal either
      pleural-disseminated infection or cancer. While these diagnoses bear tremendous importance
      for patients, they require invasive procurement of pleural tissues and/or cells and time.
      Simple and rapid diagnostic markers of pleural malignancy at admission that streamline
      diagnostic and treatment efforts remain unidentified.

      Objective: To develop, validate, and prospectively assess markers of malignancy of PE at
      admission.

      Methods: A prospective cohort of patients with PE from different etiologies will be recruited
      stating on 11.21.2013 and prospectively ending on 11.21.2023. Data will be collected within 4
      hours of admission including history, chest X-ray, and blood and pleural fluid (PF) cell
      counts and basic biochemistry. Pleural fluid and serum will be biobanked for future analyses.
      Patients will sign informed consent forms. Diagnosis will be confirmed using standard
      microbiology, cytology, histology, and imaging techniques. Patients undiagnosed within a
      month will be excluded. Variables will be entered into binary regression and
      receiver-operator analyses using malignancy as the target to develop the MAPED score, a
      clinical score that predicts malignancy at admission. MAPED will be retrospectively validated
      in separate published cohorts from the first therapeutic interventions in malignant effusion
      (TIME) 1-3 trials from Oxford UK. Data will be censored and analyzed three times, at 40-month
      intervals since study initiation.

    <description>Patients that will be diagnosed within a month from admission with any non-malignant cause of pleural effusion, including but not limited to effusions caused by common or tuberculous or fungal infection, heart failure, etc. Documentation of the etiology will be required for inclusion in this group, including but not limited to bacteriology, virology, PCR, radiology, heart echocardiogram or catheterization, as appropriate.</description>

    <description>Patients that will be diagnosed within a month from admission with any malignant cause of pleural effusion, including but not limited to effusions caused by lung, breast, colon, ovary, mesothelial, hematopoietic, prostate, or any other cancer. Diagnosis will be based on verification of the presence of malignant cells in the pleural fluid or tissues. Patients with cancer and an effusion without such documentation will be assigned to the benign group if an alternative diagnosis is made. In any other case, they will be excluded.</description>

      Pleural fluid will be centrifuged and cells will be separated from supernatants. The latter
