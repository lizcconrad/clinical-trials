  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to examine the effect of visual feedback on function, stability and
      quality of life in transtibial amputees. A total of 24 subjects who had unilateral
      transtibial amputations, used prosthesis with total surface bearing socket (TSB) for at least
      1 year and volunteered to participate in the study were included. Before and after Treatment
      subjects were evaluated with &quot;LASAR Posture&quot; for prosthetic weight bearing (PWB), &quot;Berg
      Balance Scale (BBS)&quot; and &quot;Timed Up&amp; Go Test (TUG)&quot; for balance and functional mobility,
      &quot;2-Minute-Walk-Test (2MWT)&quot; for physical performance, &quot;Satisfaction with the Prosthesis
      Questionnaire (SATPRO)&quot; for prosthetic pleasure and &quot;Nottingham Health Profile (NHP)&quot; for
      health- related quality of life. Participants were randomly divided into two equal groups as
      study and control groups. After the evaluations the same exercises; PWB exercises, balance
      exercises, anteroposterior and lateral weight shifting, obstacle course, walking on different
      grounds were applied to the the study group with visual feedback methods and control group.

    <description>minimal (Min WB) and maximal (Max WB) values were visually recorded on the amputated side for three consecutive minutes.
The average weight bearing on the amputated side (Ml) was calculated by dividing the sum of maximal and minimal weight bearing values by two.
The percentage of total body weight (TBW) borne through the amputated limb was then determined using the formula:
(Ml/TBW) x 100</description>
