    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the therapeutic role of rTMS on parkinson's patients with
      dysphagia. Thirty PD patients with dysphagia using UK bank criteria for PD will recruited
      from outpatient clinic in Assuit University. All patients were admitted at Neuropsychiatric
      Department, Assiut University Hospital/ Assiut, Egypt. Each patient fulfilled the inclusion
      criteria as spontaneous swallows should be identified clearly when patients cannot perform
      voluntary swallows using clinical examination test. The patients will be allocated randomly
      into two groups one of which will receive real sessions of high frequency rTMS (25 HZ), with
      intensity of 80% of resting motor threshold detected from the hand motor area, with total
      2000 pulses for each hemisphere for 10 consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days
      with repeated booster session every month during the period of follow up among three months.
      The other will receive sham sessions. All subjects will be followed up by selected clinical
      rating scales at different intervals pre session, post 10 sessions, and after one, two and
      three months.

      This study aims to assess the therapeutic role of repetitive transcranial magnetic (rTMS) on
      parkinson's patients with dysphagia. Thirty PD patients with dysphagia using UK bank criteria
      for PD will recruited from outpatient clinic in Assuit University. All patients were admitted
      at, Neuropsychiatric Department, Assiut University Hospital/ Assiut, Egypt. Each patient
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria as spontaneous swallows should be identified clearly when
      patients cannot perform voluntary swallows using clinical examination test. The patients will
      be allocated randomly into two groups using closed envelops one of which will receive real
      sessions of high frequency rTMS (25 HZ), with intensity of 80% of resting motor threshold
      detected from the hand motor area, with total 2000 pulses for each hemisphere for 10
      consecutive sessions totally over period of 10 days with repeated booster session every month
      during the period of follow up among three months. the other will receive sham sessions. All
      subjects after receiving the rTMS will be followed up by selected clinical rating scales at
      different intervals Pre session, post 10 sessions, after one, two and three months.
