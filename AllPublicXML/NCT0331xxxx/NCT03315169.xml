  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to compare internal wound packing to no packing in postoperative
      management following incision and drainage of perianal abscess. Participants will be
      randomised 1:1 to either the packing or non-packing arm.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Perianal abscess is common, affecting 18,000 patients annually in England. Management has
      remained largely unchanged for over 50 years, and comprises surgical incision and drainage
      followed by continued internal wound dressing (packing) until healed. Packing is thought to
      reduce the rate of recurrent abscess and perianal fistula; a known complication of perianal
      abscess. Perianal fistula frequently requires multiple operations to resolve. The evidence
      for postoperative packing is limited¹ and may expose patients to painful procedures with no
      clinical benefit, and at considerable increased cost².

      A multi-centre observational study of outcomes after drainage of perianal abscess (PPAC²)
      (n=141) found packing to be painful (2-3 fold increase in Visual Analogue Score pain scores
      during packing) and costly (estimated cost of £280 per patient; overall cost in the United
      Kingdom of £5 million annually). Fistula rate was 27%.

      This study is a randomised controlled trial designed to assess whether there are differences
      between non-packing and packing of the perianal abscess cavity in terms of the short term
      negative effects of packing (pain, quality of life, return to work) whilst assessing the
      impact on key clinical outcomes (wound healing, fistulae formation) and resource use/cost.

      All participants will be required to complete pain diaries following discharge from hospital.
      Clinical follow up to assess healing and other key clinical outcomes will take place at 4, 8
      (if not healed at 4 weeks) and 26 weeks. Further data will be collected from National Health
      Service Registries at 52 weeks in order to assess abscess recurrences and fistulae formation.

    <measure>Wound-related pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Mean score over first 10 post-operative days</time_frame>
    <description>Wound-related pain intensity (worst pain during previous 24 hours) measured using a single 100mm Visual Analogue Scale where 0 represents 'no pain' and 100 represents 'worst pain possible'. The pain Visual Analogue Scale is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line 100mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme, where 0 represents 'no pain' and 100 represents 'worst pain possible'. The mean score over the first 10 post-operative days will be used.</description>

    <description>Pain before, during and after dressing change measured using a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale where 0 represents 'no pain' and 100 represents 'worst pain possible'. The pain Visual Analogue Scale is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme. The mean score for each timepoint (before, during and after) over the first 10 post-operative days will be used.</description>

    <description>Health related quality of life measured using EuroQol EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaires. The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension now has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number expressing the level selected for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state.</description>

    <description>Chronic post-surgical pain measured using the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form. The Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form assesses the severity of pain and the impact on daily functions. Pain is assessed at its &quot;worst,&quot; &quot;least,&quot; &quot;average,&quot; and &quot;now&quot; (current pain), measured on a scale of 1-10 where 1 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 represents &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The four items will be represented singly but a composite of the four pain items (a mean score) will be presented as supplemental information. Pain interference (impact of pain on seven daily activities) will be scored as the mean of the seven interference items. These items are scored between 1 and 10, where 1 represents &quot;does not interfere&quot; and 10 represents &quot;completely interferes&quot;.</description>
