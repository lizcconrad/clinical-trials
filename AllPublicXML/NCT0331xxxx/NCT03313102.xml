  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Giant-cell arteritis (GCA) is the most frequent vasculitis after 50 years. Corticosteroid
      therapy is the reference treatment for GCA. This treatment is highly effective but must be
      maintained for 12 to 24 months to avoid relapses, which causes the onset of numerous adverse
      effects in this elderly population [1].

      Currently clinicians have no way to estimate this risk of relapse during the treatment of
      GCA.

      Invariant T lymphocytes associated with the mucous membrane (MAIT), whose role in
      vasculitides has recently been shown [2] and which produce IL-17 and IFN-γ [3], two key
      cytokines in the pathophysiology of GCA [4-6] could be implicated in the pathophysiology of
      GCA and could constitute a predictive marker of relapse.

      Our hypothesis is that blood MAIT are recruited in the artery wall in patients with GCA and
      that the number of circulating MAIT in the blood falls and then returns to normal if the
      corticoids are effective.

      Given that it will be necessary to include a large number of patients to show that the
      persistence of a low number of circulating MAIT in patients treated with corticoids is a
      predictor of relapse, we propose, as the first step, to carry out a pilot study to obtain
      preliminary data on these new markers.

      The study is classified as interventional because a lot of blood samples are taken

          -  Patients with national health insurance cover

          -  Age &gt; 50 years

          -  Patients with Horton disease at the diagnosis, before any treatment.

        Horton disease is defined by ACR criteria [7], the diagnosis is made in the presence of 3
        of the following 5 criteria:

          -  Age at the onset of the disease of 50 years or older

          -  Recent-onset localized headache

          -  Temporal artery tenderness or decreased temporal artery pulse

             mg/L)

          -  Positive TAB showing vasculitis with infiltration of mononuclear cells or
             granulomatous inflammation with or without giant cells.

        HEALTHY SUBJECTS Control subjects will be matched for age and sex with patients. They will
        be recruited in Dijon only. They will be healthy volunteers recruited among blood donors,
        voluntary hospital personnel (nurses, doctors and secretaries) and patients without an
        infectious or inflammatory diseasee, or cancere or auto-immune disease (CRP&lt;5mg/L)
        recruited in the departments of investigators at the CHU of Dijon Burgundy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults under guardianship

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women

          -  Patients who have been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressantsin the month
             preceding inclusion

          -  Patients treated with chemotherapy, immunosuppressants or biotherapy

          -  Contra-indication for corticosteroid therapy
