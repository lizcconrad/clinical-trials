  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to prove the effects of a individualized prehabilitation program
      (muscular strength and endurance) in patients in a waiting list for a transplant. The
      investigators want to see if patients that did a prehabilitation program have better results
      in the postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some characteristics of the fragile people, like as sarcopenia, are related with worse
      results after a transplant. Increasing the cardiorespiratory fitness with an exercise program
      during the preoperative period has shown improvements in patients after a surgery. It is
      produced a decreased in his functions, including a loss of muscle mass.

      Prehabilitation is a exercise program before a surgery. This program will improve the
      patient's starting functional status and therefore recovery.

      Physical activity is one of the most powerful predictors of mortality risk. Several studies
      say that a improved cardiorespiratory fitness by exercise before a surgery has a great impact
      in the patients after the intervention in short and long term.

    <description>The intervention will be an 6-week program of individualized physiotherapy strength and muscular endurance with aerobic training, led by physiotherapists in groups of 8-10 participants. Each program will be individualized based on the evaluations of muscular strength and endurance as well as determination of aerobic-anaerobic zone transition described in previous studies In sessions of one hour 3 times a week. Each session will consist of 30 minutes of exercises performed on land followed by 20 minutes of continuous running in treadmill.
In week 1 and 2 participants carry out 3 sets of 15 repetitions (reps) to become familiar with the exercises. From week 3 onwards participants will perform 4 sets of 10 reps. If the participant can do more than 12 reps, weight will be increased. All exercises are conducted supervised to ensure proper technique and adequate progression.</description>
