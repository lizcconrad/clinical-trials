  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction:The drug-eluting beads transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) is introduced
      to better improve efficacy and reduce the systemic toxicity in liver cancer patients on
      account of its higher intratumoral chemotherapeutic drug concentration and reduced drug
      infiltration into systemic circulation. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety
      and prognostic factors of DEB-TACE treatment in Chinese patients with liver cancer.

      Hypothesis:DEB-TACE illustrates a better treatment response, progression free survival (PFS),
      overall survival (OS) and less common adverse events (AEs) in liver cancer patients.

      Objective: to investigate the efficacy, safety and prognostic factors of DEB-TACE treatment
      in Chinese patients with liver cancer.
