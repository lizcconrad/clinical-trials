      A trial comparing outcomes of two pre-oxygenation techniques in obstetric patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-oxygenation is performed prior to general anesthesia to prevent hypoxia during airway
      management. It is typically performed using a standard tight-fitting face mask; however,
      recent advances in oxygenation have occurred through the use of trans-nasal oxygen delivery
      devices, such as OptiFlow. There is limited evidence of the use of OptiFlow in the pregnant
      patient, and as such, this study aims to show that OptiFlow is as effective at
      pre-oxygenation as a standard tight-fitting face-mask technique in the pregnant population.
