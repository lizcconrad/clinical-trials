    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The experimental group will be exposed to the DREAMS curriculum including the supplemental technology based application.It is composed of 10 modules: Introduction; Self Exploration; Healthy Relationships; Adolescent Sexuality; Attitudes and Adolescent Sexual Activity; Consequences of Sex - HIV/STI; Consequences of Sex - Pregnancy; Managing Pressure to Engage in Sexual Activity through the Lens of Social Media; Financial Literacy; Careers; Post secondary Education; Wrap up and Close Out.
The technology app will include curriculum support and additional resources.
Students will have access to the mobile app after the in school programming ends. The intent is for students to have access to portions of the app that deal with self developed goals and progress monitoring for goals, and resource material. This is similar to a student having continued access to a textbook/other class materials.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Non DREAMS</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group experience will include health curriculum already adopted by the school district. Continued services as usual. The control group schools, for the most part, lack any formal pregnancy prevention services. All schools claim that lessons developed by the teachers meet the Texas Essential Knowledge Standards (TEKS). No outside services are provided to students and school based services are limited. The services offered at the schools is predominately abstinence based. Students attending the schools would need to initiate any services that are available within the community. The control group will not have access to the DREAMS curriculum or the technology-based application to enhance the DREAMS curriculum. The technology-based application will be a closed, password protected, system during the research trial.</description>
