  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Do ultrasound-guided genicular nerve blocks with 0.5% bupivacaine provide improved knee
      analgesia for patients recovering from total knee replacement surgery compared to saline
      injection?

      Hypotheses:

      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of ultrasound-guided adductor canal block
      (ACB) and genicular nerve block will achieve lower opioid consumption and therefore lead to
      decreased systemic side effects and improved overall satisfaction compared to
      ultrasound-guided saline injection for patients undergoing minimally invasive elective total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants 40 to 85 years old who are presenting for minimally invasive total knee
             arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia and are candidates for peripheral nerve blocks.

          -  Minimally invasive is defined as custom modified instrumentation, a quadriceps sparing
             arthrotomy that does not extend beyond 1cm proximal to the patella and surgical
             techniques that focus on soft tissue protection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient refusal

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of 4 or higher

          -  Pre-existing neuropathy in the femoral or sciatic distribution

          -  Coagulopathy

          -  Infection at the site

          -  Chronic opioid use (greater than 3 months)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Medical conditions limiting physical therapy participation
