  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed co-registered transvaginal photoacoustic and ultrasound (US)
      imaging techniques that allow them to visualize ovarian tumor structure and functional
      changes simultaneously, which may potentially reveal early tumor angiogenesis development or
      residual tumors after systemic treatment that is not available by US alone. The ability to
      detect early angiogenesis changes, as well as tumor morphology changes using a non-invasive
      imaging modality will greatly enhance the care for patients. The investigators plan to
      explore these techniques in monitoring cervical cancer treatment response and conduct pilot
      feasibility studies.

    <description>A transvaginal imaging probe using ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging will be inserted into the vagina and will use different frequencies of lights to create images
This will occur before the first standard of care treatment, mid-treatment, end of treatment, and approximately 3 months after the end of treatment for a total of 4 imaging time points</description>
