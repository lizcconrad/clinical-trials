    <textblock>
      This study examines how to best assess and treat post-stroke neglect. This study will examine
      the preliminary effects of an innovative intervention (repetitive task-specific practice +
      transcranial direct current stimulation) for individuals with neglect. This study will also
      determine whether items from various neglect assessments can be combined to establish a more
      comprehensive neglect measure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is very common for stroke survivors to have difficulty attending to one side of their body
      or space (neglect). Stroke survivors with neglect not only demonstrate impairments in
      attention but they also experience motor impairment. These individuals also have an imbalance
      in excitation in the brain. This study will examine the preliminary effects of non-invasive
      brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation, tDCS) combined with arm
      rehabilitation training (repetitive task-specific practice, RTP) for individuals with neglect
      following stroke. The investigators will examine the effects of the intervention on brain
      excitability, upper extremity motor impairment, and attentional impairment. This study will
      also examine assessment of neglect. There are many clinical assessments designed to assess
      neglect; however, it is unknown whether items from some of the most commonly used assessments
      are able to effectively measure neglect or whether items from these assessments can be
      combined. Clinicians rely on clinical assessments to inform treatment and document patient
      progress. Therefore, it is important that investigators more closely examine these existing
      assessments.

    <masking_description>Participants will receive both conditions (active and sham transcranial direct current stimulation paired with arm rehabilitation training [repetitive task-specific practice]) in this cross-over design study. Individuals will be randomized to determine which condition they receive first and the participant and treatment therapist and assessor will be blinded to the order that the interventions are delivered. The PI will oversee randomization so that each patient is randomized and assigned a unique five digit code. When this code is entered on the tDCS device, the device will automatically assign the patient to receive either real or sham stimulation. Because the sham stimulation provides a ramp up/ramp down stimulation for 15 seconds at the start and end of the session the participant may perceive the sham stimulation as active stimulation.</masking_description>
