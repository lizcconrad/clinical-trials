      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of anti-CD137
      (utomilumab) that can be given in combination with CD8+T cells, IL-2 (aldesleukin), and
      cyclophosphamide in patients with ovarian cancer. The effect of this combination treatment
      will also be studied.

      This study is divided into 2 parts: leukapheresis and treatment. In the leukapheresis part,
      blood cells will be collected from you to be made into modified CD8+T cells and then they
      will be given back to you in the treatment part.

      Treatment Part 1, All cohorts have leukapheresis.

      Treatment Part 2, Cohort 1 Study Drug Administration:

      If found to be eligible to take part in this study, participants will receive
      cyclophosphamide by vein over about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before they receive the
      CD8+ T cells). If the doctor thinks it is needed, they will be given standard drugs to help
      decrease the risk of side effects. They may ask the study staff for information about how the
      drug is given and its risks.

      On Day 0, they will receive the CD8+T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes. They will stay
      in the hospital overnight after the dose to monitor their condition. Starting within 6 hours
      after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for 14 days, they will give
      aldesleukin as an injection into their skin around abdomen. They will be taught how to give
      themselves these injections. In order to reduce possible side effects they will take naproxen
      sodium twice daily beginning the day before their injections and continuing for the 14 days.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and CD8+T
      cells. Participants in this cohort will not receive utomilumab.

      Study Visits:

      On Day -2:

        -  They will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will
           include a pregnancy test if they can become pregnant. To take part in this study, they
           must not be pregnant.

      On Day 0:

        -  They will have an EKG to check their heart function.

        -  They will a have physical exam before the infusion.

      On Days 1, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 57, 64, 70, 77, 85, 113, and 141:

        -  They will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in their body.

        -  Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, they will have an MRI or CT scan
           to check the status of the disease.

      Treatment Part 2, Cohorts 2-3:

      Study Drug Administration:

      If found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will be assigned to a dose level of
      utomilumab based on when they join study. Up to 3 dose levels of utomilumab will be tested.
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will
      receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of utomilumab is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of cyclophosphamide, aldesleukin, and CD8+T
      cells.

      Because they are enrolled in Cohorts 2 and 3, they will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over
      about 30-60 minutes on Day -2 (2 days before you receive the CD8+T cells).

      On Day 0, they will receive the CD8+T cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes. They will stay
      in the hospital overnight after the dose to monitor your condition. Starting within 6 hours
      after the CD8+T cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for 14 days, they will give
      aldesleukin as an injection into their skin around their abdomen. They will be taught how to
      give themselves these injections.

      On Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 141, they will receive utomilumab by vein over about 90
      minutes. Study Visits

      On Day -2:

        -  They will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will
           include a pregnancy test if they can become pregnant. To take part in this study, they
           must not be pregnant.

      On Day 0:

        -  They will have an EKG to check their heart function.

        -  They will have a physical exam before the infusion.

      On Days 1, 7, 14, 22, 28, 35, 43, 49, 57, 64, 70, 77, 85, 113, and 141:

        -  They will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests, and
           tests on how long the T-cells survive in their body.

        -  Between Day 35 and 42 and again between Day 77 and 84, they will have an MRI or CT scan
           to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 3, blood (about 5½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, immune system tests,
      and tests on how long the T-cells survive in their body.

    <description>To evaluate the functional and numeric in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred central memory-type CTL with and without Utomilumab, duration of in vivo persistence defined as the time between T cell infusion and last time point at which the transferred T cell DNA signature is detectable in peripheral blood. Transferred antigen-specific T cells will be tracked by tetramer analysis as well as by TCR tracking (Immunoseq assay, Adaptive Biotech), both assays, have been established in lab as reliable measures of T cell persistence.</description>

    <description>BORR is defined as the total number of participants who's BOR is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), divided by the total number of participants. Radiographic imaging and clinical assessment of residual disease will be compared with pre-infusion baseline assessment according to modified RECIST 1.1 for response: complete response (CR) defined as total regression of all tumor, a partial response (PR) as 30% or greater decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions and progressive disease (PD) as 20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions (modified world health organization criteria or mWHO). Assessment at 6 and 12 weeks following T cell infusion and then every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week) until disease progression or intervening therapy. The overall response rate (OR) will be after 1 cycle (12) weeks.</description>

    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after the T cell infusion</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between T cell infusion date and the date of progression or death. A participant who dies without reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of death. For those who remain alive and have not progressed, PFS will be censored on the date of last tumor assessment. For participants who have PD prior to Week 12 and a subsequent assessment of SD, PR or CR, the date of PD following response (where available) will be used in the analysis of PFS; otherwise these participants will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. PFS is estimated for each arm using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.</description>

             undergo a cardiac evaluation which can include a stress test and/or echocardiography.
             Results of this evaluation will be considered before excluding patients on the basis
             of cardiovascular abnormalities). Subjects with evidence of stress-induced cardiac
             ischemia or ejection fraction less than 55% will be excluded.
