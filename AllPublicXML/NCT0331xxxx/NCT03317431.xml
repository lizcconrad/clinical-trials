  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dopamine(DA) is a common neurotransmitter that has been known to regulate behavior, movement,
      cardiovascular，endocrine and gastrointestinal functions, but also functions as an important
      molecule engaging in the immune systems to possess anti-inflammatory effects. However, its
      role in ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is still unclear. Herein, this study aimed to
      investigate the therapeutic efficacy of dopamine on ventilation-induced lung endothelial
      barrier dysfunction and explore the possible underlying molecular mechanisms.

    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is a critical intervention for patients with acute respiratory
      failure. However, lung overdistension induced by mechanical ventilation at high tidal volumes
      also causes pulmonary endothelial dysfunction. The injurious effect of mechanical stretch on
      pulmonary endothelium has been implicated in the development of ventilator-induced lung
      injury (VILI), which is characterized by pulmonary inflammation and particularly increased
      vascular permeability. In addition, the investigators and others have previously shown that
      mechanical stretch increases cultured lung endothelial monolayer permeability in vitro and
      promotes lung vascular permeability in mice Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the
      mechanical stretch-induced lung endothelial barrier dysfunction may provide a novel clinical
      therapeutic target against VILI.

      Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which can also be produced outside the central nervous
      system. Lung alveolar epithelial cells represent an important source of extraneuronal
      dopamine, which has a significant role in local organ physiology. Dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1)
      and D2 receptor (DRD2) are present in lung tissues. Activation of D2DR induces NaKATPase gene
      expression. Moreover, activation of DRD1 results in the trafficking of NaKATPase to the
      basolateral membrane of type II alveolar epithelial cells, thus increasing lung liquid
      clearance during acute lung injury. Although the lung-protective effects of DA and its
      implication in the pathology of ALI are emerging, the mechanisms are still largely unknown.

      In the present study, the investigators will analyze the influence of mechanical ventilation
      on dopamine receptors in the lung tissue of the participants, and explore whether DA could
      protect ventilation induced lung injury, which is helpful for prevention and treatment of
      ventilation induced lung injury.

    <description>ImageJ software were used to get the Integrated Optical Density(IOD) of the chemiluminescent signal from the membranes of dopamine receptor 1(DRD1). The normalization was carried out by DRD1 IOD/total β-actin IOD for sample loading correction. In determination of the expression level of DRD1 in different time points, the investigators had a bulk preparation of normal placental protein which was set as a control. Analyze the correlation between duration of mechanical ventilation and DRD1 expression. If p value is less than 0.05, then its change is statically significant.</description>
