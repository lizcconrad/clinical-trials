  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondylarthropathies (SpA) are among the most common chronic inflammatory rheumatisms in
      adults, responsible for a muscular loss or sarcopenia which can be very disabling, not much
      documented in the literature, and not yet studied in France. In addition, sarcopenia is
      associated with decreased physical activity and increased risk of falls and fractures. A
      better characterization of the determinants of this muscular loss will allow to better detect
      and take care of it.

      The aim is to conduct the first French study on the prevalence and severity of sarcopenia in
      patients with spondyloarthropathies and to study the variables that may be associated with
      it. Finally, we propose to evaluate obesity related to sarcopenia in these patients and
      compare them to cases matched for age and sex (from OFELY / STRAMBO cohorts, Lyon, FRANCE).

      This is a prospective interventional and monocentric study with minimal risks and
      constraints: patients will be included for one day for an evaluation of their sarcopenia by
      measuring their muscle strength, physical performance and body composition and recording of
      their socio-demographic and disease characteristics.
