  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand how the peripheral and central nervous
      system interact to produce the sensation of pain and motor patterns in patients with achilles
      tendinopathy (AT). These findings will motivate the development of future clinical studies
      that incorporate knowledge about pain processing and movement strategies in patients with
      tendinopathy. Participants with achilles tendinopathy will receive an anesthetic injection to
      the achilles tendon in order to examine how reduced pain, detected by the peripheral nervous
      system, alters task performance and perception of pain. We hypothesize that there are factors
      within the central nervous system that contribute to continued pain and disability in
      patients with chronic AT.

      Twenty five people with Achilles tendinopathy (AT) and 25 people without AT will participate
      in this single visit clinical study. Participants will rate their pain with pressure to the
      heel, leg and elbow, climb stairs and perform a novel task in a motion capture system, and
      complete questionnaires on how pain affects their daily life. All subjects will complete
      these measures twice, and for participants with AT they will complete this battery of tests
      before and after an anesthetic injection to the area of pain. This study has 2 aims:

      Specific Aim 1 compares measures of altered central processing in patients with chronic AT to
      adults without chronic pain; we hypothesize that patients with chronic AT will demonstrate
      signs of altered central processing, including central sensitization (lower pressure pain
      threshold), psychosocial factors (higher kinesiophobia), and/or altered motor control
      (increased ankle DF during stair ascent).

      Specific Aim 2 determines which indicators of altered central processing persist after a
      local anesthetic injection to the Achilles tendon in patients with chronic AT; we hypothesize
      chronic AT pain is perpetuated by altered central processing that persists in the absence of
      continued peripheral nociception.
