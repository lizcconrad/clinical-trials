  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no clear treatment for patients with limited cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma (KS).
      Radiation and injection of vinblastine both have side effects that may not be acceptable.
      Nivolumab has been used to treat more extensive KS when given intravenously. This is, to the
      investigators' knowledge, the first trial to see if nivolumab can be used as treatment in the
      form of an injection into KS lesion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV, or human herpesvirus-8) causes Kaposi
      sarcoma (KS). These virally associated diseases occur more frequently in HIV-infected
      individuals, but can also be found in HIV-uninfected population. Evolution of
      immunosuppressive mechanisms presumably plays a permissive role in the development,
      progression and recurrence of these virus-associated cancers and pre-cancers. Currently,
      available treatment options for these lesions are imperfect.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether intra-lesional injections of nivolumab can
      enhance specific T cell responses in vitro and enhance activity against these
      virus-associated lesions. Chronic viral infections generate &quot;exhausted&quot; CD8+ T cells with a
      diminished capacity to produce cytokines and to lyse infected cells. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
      implicated in the balance between immune eradication and immune escape. This study will
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and potential benefits of injecting nivolumab into KS in
      HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals every 2 weeks for total of 4 doses. The
      investigators believe this mode of treatment is feasible and tolerable by avoiding the
      systemic autoimmune adverse events caused by systemic injection of nivolumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed KS with active cutaneous disease and have less than 25
             lesions in total. They must not have symptomatic visceral KS or asymptomatic pulmonary
             KS.

        Cohort A (safety): treatment-experienced KS Cohort B: treatment-naïve KS

          -  For HIV-infected patients: CD4&gt;350 cells/mm3 and HIV-1 viral load &lt;75 copies/mL).

          -  Patients must have measurable cutaneous KS disease, defined as: 1 or more marker
             lesion that is bi-dimensionally measureable, and ≥0.5cm in shortest dimension. These
             lesions must not have received previous local radiation, surgical, or intra-lesional
             cytotoxic therapy that would prevent response assessment.

          -  Adequate organ function

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic KS-directed treatments or investigational modalities ≤ 5 half-lives or
             4 weeks, whichever is shorter, prior to starting study drug or who have not recovered
             from side effects of such therapy to grade 1 or less.

          -  Hypersensitivity to nivolumab or any of its excipients

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent

          -  Active systemic immunosuppressive therapy

          -  The use of prednisone or equivalent 10mg or greater a day that cannot be discontinued
             with more than 7 consecutive days of steroids within the prior 2 weeks.

          -  Prior organ allograft or allogeneic transplantation, if the transplanted tissue is
             still in place.
