  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a herpesvirus that causes two distinct clinical
      syndromes.Primary infection is manifested as varicella (chickenpox), whereas reactivation of
      latent VZV results in a localized eruption known as herpes zoster. More than 99.6% of people
      40 years of age orolder had evidence of previous VZV infection. This study plans to have
      30000 adults 40 years of age or older involoved in a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial of an investigational live attenuated varicella-zoster virus
      vaccine. The investigational vaccines are produced by Changchun Changsheng biotechnology co.
      LTD. The incidence of herpes zoster and the severity, and duration of the associated pain and
      discomfort were measured after the vaccination. And the safety of the varicella-zoster virus
      vaccine is also evaluated.
