    <measure>Test an independent group of epileptologist's ability to classify motor events between epileptic or non-epileptic using sEMG and audio.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>To test the null hypothesis that three independent epileptologists categorize, by majority vote, epileptic seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (identified utilizing vEEG review) correctly in no more than 70% of cases using sEMG and audio. We aim to test the null hypothesis that the epileptologists categorize epileptic seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures correctly in no more than 70% of cases. The observed rate of correct classification will be compared to the rate of 70% under the null hypothesis using a two-sided binomial exact test.</description>

    <description>Test the null hypothesis that the Brain Sentinel® Seizure Monitoring and Alerting System categorizes epileptic seizures and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (identified utilizing vEEG review) correctly in no more than 70% of cases. We aim to test the null hypothesis that the Brain Sentinel® Seizure Monitoring and Alerting System's software categorizes epileptic seizures and psychogenic Nonepileptic seizures correctly in no more than 70% of cases. The observed rate of correct classification will be compared to the rate of 70% under the null hypothesis using a two-sided binomial exact test.</description>
