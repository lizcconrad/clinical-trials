      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of ATI-50002 Topical Solution in patients with Alopecia Universalis and
      Alopecia Totalis. Concentrations of ATI-50002 in the blood and skin will be assessed after 28
      days of treatment with ATI-50002 Topical Solution.

          -  Have a clinical diagnosis of stable, clinically typical, AU or AT.

          -  Have a duration of the current episode of AU or AT for a minimum of 6 months and a
             maximum of seven years.

          -  Be willing and able to follow all study instructions and to attend all study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are nursing, pregnant, or planning to become pregnant for the duration of
             the study including 30 days after the last application of study medication.

          -  Patchy alopecia areata, diffuse alopecia areata or a history of an atypical pattern of
             Alopecia Areata (AA) (e.g., ophiasis, sisaihpo).

          -  Active skin disease on the scalp (such as psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis) or a
             history of skin disease on the scalp that in the opinion of the investigator would
             interfere with the study assessments of efficacy or safety.

          -  Active scalp trauma or other condition affecting the scalp that, in the investigator's
             opinion, may affect the course of AU or AT or interfere with the study conduct or
             evaluations.

          -  The presence of a permanent or difficult to remove hairpiece or wig that will, in the
             opinion of the investigator, interfere with study assessments if not removed at each
