      The failure to use isoniazid (INH) preventative therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected individuals in
      Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the single biggest implementation gaps between evidence
      and practice in today's response to the HIV epidemic. The proposed study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to improve IPT uptake across the country of
      Uganda. The overall objective of this study is to determine if a multi-component
      implementation intervention (SPIRIT) that targets District Health Officers (DHOs) can
      increase IPT initiation and completion among HIV-infected persons, and decrease tuberculosis
      (TB) incidence, as compared to country standard practices, in a cluster randomized trial in
      Uganda.

      [INTRODUCTION]

      The failure to use isoniazid (INH) preventative therapy (IPT) in HIV-infected individuals in
      Sub-Saharan Africa represents one of the single biggest implementation gaps between evidence
      and practice in today's response to the HIV epidemic. The proposed study will evaluate the
      effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to improve IPT uptake across the country of
      Uganda. The overall objective of this study is to determine if a multi-component
      implementation intervention (SPIRIT) that targets District Health Officers (DHOs) can
      increase IPT initiation and completion among HIV-infected persons, and decrease TB incidence,
      as compared to country standard practices, in a cluster randomized trial in Uganda.

      [OBJECTIVES]

      Aim 1: Determine if the SPIRIT intervention increases IPT initiation. The investigators will
      form 20-24 groups of 4-6 District Health Officers and randomize half to the SPIRIT
      intervention and half to control (country standard) in a cluster randomized trial. The
      primary outcome will be the proportion of HIV-infected adults initiating IPT within 12 months
      of being IPT-eligible in health facilities overseen by DHOs participating in the SPIRIT
      trial. In all DHO groups the primary outcome will be measured over two years. The
      investigators will use health information systems already in place to collect data about
      visits, IPT eligibility and IPT initiation. For secondary outcomes, the investigators will
      conduct pre-/post-intervention surveys and focus group discussions to assess changes in
      knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding IPT among the DHOs and front line health workers
      in intervention and control groups, to assess mechanisms through which the intervention
      achieves outcomes.

      Aim 2: Evaluate the effect of the SPIRIT intervention on IPT completion and TB incidence.
      Even if the intervention increases IPT initiation, quantifying actual use of IPT by patients
      and downstream effects on population health status (e.g. reduction in TB incidence) are
      important to assess impact and thereby enable policy makers to prioritize this intervention
      more widely. A subset of adult patients who received a prescription for IPT will be randomly
      sampled to measure adherence through hair levels of INH (direct measure of IPT completion)
      and TB incidence (population health measure). IPT completion and TB incidence will also be
      measured on the overall population of HIV-positive adults in care at health facilities
      overseen by the DHOs. Within the SPIRIT intervention arm, there are nested trials for single
      pill combination (SPC) of INH/B6/Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) vs. no-SPC for IPT
      and for variable prescription refill frequency (90-day vs. 30-day supply).

      Aim 3: Evaluate for indirect effects of the SPIRIT intervention on the prescribing of IPT to
      child (≤14 years of age) household contacts of active TB cases, and HIV-infected children (12
      months to 14 years of age). The investigators hypothesize that IPT prescribing for child (≤14
      years of age) household contacts of adults with active TB disease and for HIV-infected
      children (12 months to 14 years) will increase in SPIRIT intervention compared to control
      groups, as an indirect effect on DHO support for IPT implementation, IPT prescribing
      practices and patient perceptions of IPT.

      Aim 4: Evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of SPIRIT. Using effectiveness measures
      obtained in Aims 1 and 2, and standard time and motion and costing methods, the investigators
      will estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of SPIRIT vs. standard of care in our sampled
      population from Aim 2. Outcomes of interest will include program costs per: a) IPT initiation
      b) IPT completion and c) TB case averted.
