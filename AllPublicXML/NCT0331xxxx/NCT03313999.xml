      This protocol will utilize the lymphedema indentometer, or durometer (a novel, noninvasive
      piece of equipment that measures skin elasticity), to better characterize disease progression
      in patients with lymphedema. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center patients who undergo
      treatment of lymphedema will be candidates for this noninvasive test. This device and the
      data it generates will help understand the incidence of lymphedema at Beth Israel Deaconess
      Medical Center compared to national data and the outcomes of surgical treatment of
      lymphedema.

    <description>The subject will sit down. The machine will be placed over their extremity/affected region. They will then be told the machine will be activated. They may or may not feel the machine touch them. A small pressure will be applied to the skin surface for 4 seconds. The computer will record the skin elasticity as change in resistance to compression over time during these 4 seconds. The entire procedure will take about a minute or less, after which the standard of care visit with the physical therapist will continue.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data from this study's data repository may be accessed by investigators interested in using the repository for research purposes. To access the data, investigator(s) will need to obtain Institutional Review Board approval of their protocol and submit their protocol to Dhruv Singhal, MD for review. Dr. Singhal will review the request for feasibility, scientific validity, and proper regulatory approvals. Only once the investigator(s) have received written Institutional Review Board approval, written approval from Dr. Singhal, and, if necessary, completed a material transfer agreement will they be given access to data from the repository. Dr. Singhal is uniquely suited to review requests to use repository data as he is a pioneer in the study and treatment of lymphedema and familiar with all information contained in the database.</ipd_description>
