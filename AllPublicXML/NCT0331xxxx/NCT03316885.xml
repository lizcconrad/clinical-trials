      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the long-term (3 years) favorable visual
      acuity and adverse event outcomes for the Clareon® Intraocular Lens (IOL) compared to
      historical safety and performance endpoint (SPE) rates as reported in EN ISO 11979-7:2014.
      The secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the refractive outcomes obtained with up
      to 3 years follow-up in eyes implanted with the Clareon® IOL.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will attend a total of 12 study visits over a period of approximately 36 months: One
      preoperative screening visit, two operative visits, and nine post-implantation visits. Both
      eyes will be implanted, with the second eye implantation to occur 2-21 days after the first.
      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the final visit (990-1140 days post-implantation
      from the date of second eye surgery).

    <description>Visual acuity (VA) will be tested monocularly (each eye separately) under photopic (well-lit) conditions using the correction obtained from the manifest refraction and 100% contrast electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts at a distance of 4 meters (m) from the eye. VA will be measured in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), with 0.02 logMAR increment corresponding to a single letter on an ETDRS chart, and compared to the historical safety and performance endpoint (SPE) of 92.5% (EN ISO 11979-7:2014).</description>

    <description>VA will be tested monocularly under photopic conditions without visual correction using 100% contrast electronic ETDRS charts at a distance of 4 m from the eye. +0.25 D spherical power will be applied to correct for optical infinity. VA will be measured in logMAR, with 0.02 logMAR increment corresponding to a single letter on an ETDRS chart, A lower numeric value will represent better visual acuity.</description>
