  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of recurrence and chronic instability after an initial episode of anterior
      glenohumeral dislocation is high, the risk is higher the younger the patient is.

      Most patients with recurrences develop this instability during the first 2 years.

      Several studies have shown that an initial arthroscopic surgical treatment (Bankart
      intervention) decreased the risk of recurrence and therefore of chronic instability, but this
      attitude is not usual in France and none randomized study comparing intervention of
      arthroscopic Bankart and immobilization was published by a French team.

      The primary objective was to evaluate at 2 years the efficacy on the rate of recurrent
      instability of the first-line arthroscopic repair of prior capsulo-labral lesions compared to
      conservative treatment by immobilization for patients under 25 years having an initial
      episode of anterior glenohumeral dislocation

      Material and method : We conducted a randomized controlled, open-label, parallel-group study
      (conservative treatment group by immobilizing VS surgical treatment group) in patients aged
      18 to 25 with anterior glenohumeral primo luxation. Patients were clinically reassessed at 2
      years with functional scores (WOSI, DuplayWalch, DASH), mobility and instability recurrence.

      Hypothesis: reduction of the recurrence rate in the surgically treated group
