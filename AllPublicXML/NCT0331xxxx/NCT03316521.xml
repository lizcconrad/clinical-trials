      Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a Single Ascending
      Dose (SAD) and a Multiple Dose (MD) of the complement inhibitor AMY-101. A prospective,
      single-center, open-label, First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study in healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AMYNDAS is developing a novel peptidic complement inhibitor AMY-101, based on the
      third-generation compstatin analogue Cp40. AMY-101 is a selective inhibitor of complement
      activation in humans and in NHP. It binds to the complement component C3, the central
      &quot;functional hub&quot; that controls the upstream activation/amplification and downstream effector
      functions of complement. By binding to C3, AMY-101 inhibits the cleavage of native C3 to its
      active fragments C3a and C3b. As a consequence, the deposition of C3b, amplification via the
      alternative pathway and all downstream complement responses are prevented. AMY-101 is being
      developed to treat complement-mediated diseases, which are largely driven by aberrant C3
      activation.

      This first-in-human study of the C3-targeting complement inhibitor AMY-101 investigates the
      safety and PK/PD profile of AMY-101 in healthy male volunteers after Single Ascending Dose
      (SAD) and Multiple Doses (MD) using subcutaneous (SQ) or intravenous (IV) administration. The
      study is a prospective, single-center, open-label evaluation in healthy male volunteers.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a prospective, single-center, open-label FIH study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD after single and multiple doses of AMY-101 in healthy male volunteers. In the SAD part of the study, a single dose at ascending dose levels of AMY-101 will be administered to different cohorts, following a careful dose-escalation strategy. In the MD part of the study, multiple doses will be administered using different dosing intervals; the cohorts will include a minimum of four (4) subjects each. Additional subjects may be added in the cohorts if necessary.</intervention_model_description>

AMY-101 will be administered as a SQ or IV injection. Subjects in each cohort will be dosed sequentially, to allow for close safety monitoring. Between each cohort, safety data will be analyzed, evaluated and reviewed by the internal Safety Review Committee. Subsequent dose levels will be administered until either the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the study maximum dose (SMD) is reached based on specified dose escalation criteria.</description>

    <description>Depending on the results of the SAD, multiple doses of AMY-101 will be administered at the dose which has been identified as the dose which saturates target C3, for a duration that results to an exposure level equivalent to the maximum exposure achieved in the SAD. The dose and dosing interval will be determined based on the PK data obtained in the SAD part of the study. Each MD cohort will include at least four subjects and may be expanded with additional subjects if necessary. Between each cohort, safety data will be analyzed, evaluated and reviewed by the internal Safety Review Committee.</description>
