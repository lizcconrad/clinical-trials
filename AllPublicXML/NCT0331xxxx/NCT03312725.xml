  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flow disruption is a new endovascular approach for treatment of both ruptured and unruptured
      intracranial aneurysms, which involves placement of an endosaccular device (WEB) which
      modifies the blood flow at the level of the neck and induces intraaneurysmal thrombosis. The
      WEB was designed to treat wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. This observational study will
      collect data about the routine practice in one center of using the WEB in ruptured and
      unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The primary objective is to evaluate its efficacy by
      assessing the anatomic outcome during follow-up.
