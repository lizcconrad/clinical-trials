  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test two versions a weight loss program potentially suitable
      for implementation in Africa. A successful method would have widespread application in
      low-income countries, with the potential to improve world health.

      Specific Aim 1 is to conduct a 3-4 month pilot study randomizing participants to two versions
      of a weight loss program. The program will be implemented in a convenience sample of
      overweight and obese adults living in Guinea-Bissau and measure changes in body weight loss
      (primary outcome), adherence to program recommendations including recommended food patterns,
      blood pressure, eating behavior, physical activity and mood (secondary outcomes). The data
      will be used to refine the weight loss program and conduct power calculations for a future
      trial.

      Specific Aim 2 is to analyze associations between weight loss, participant demographics and
      program metrics, to explore reasons for differences in weight loss between participants.
      Factors to be tested include participant BMI, gender and age, as well as adherence to meal
      portion recommendations, use of sugar-sweetened beverages and provided foods, and physical
      activity.
