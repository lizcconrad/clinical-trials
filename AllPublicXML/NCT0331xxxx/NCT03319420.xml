  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye complaints occur in 5.5 to 33.7% of the population, and are ranked as the most
      frequent symptoms of patients visiting ophthalmologists. Dry eye syndrome is caused by the
      reduced production and/or improper quality of the tear film. One of the causes of reduced
      tear production is Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's is estimated to affect up to 4 million
      patients in the US alone. It affects mostly middle aged women (40-50 years of age) with a
      female to male prevalence ratio of 9:1.

      The current study seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LO2A ophthalmic solution in
      the symptomatic treatment of dry eye in patients with Sjögren's syndrome. This study will be
      conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP,and applicable regulatory requirements.

      This is a randomized, double-masked, comparative study versus Systane ultra UD, to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of LO2A eye drops for symptomatic improvement of dry eye in Patients
      with Sjögren's syndrome. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of
      two treatment groups, LO2A or Systane ultra UD, respectively.

      The study will consist of a screening period of up to two weeks and a 3-month double blind
      treatment period (topical application of eye drops four times daily)

      Up to 60 subjects are planned to be recruited to this study, randomized to one of two
      treatment arms using a 1:1 active (LO2A) to Systane ultra UD ratio.
