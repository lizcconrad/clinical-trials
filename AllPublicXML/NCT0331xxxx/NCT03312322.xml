  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation effectively improves outcomes in patients with chronic respiratory
      disease. There is a link between training intensity and physiological improvements following
      pulmonary rehabilitation. However, high intensity training is not sustainable for every
      patients.

      Therefore, actual strategies for pulmonary rehabilitation aimed at decreasing dyspnea to
      improve muscle work.

      Electrical muscle stimulation is widely used during rehabilitation to promote muscle function
      recovery. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation was recently used to relief dyspnea and
      improve pulmonary function in patients with chronic respiratory disease. Moreover, spinal
      anesthesia with fentanyl has been shown to be effective in improving exercise tolerance in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (inhibiting group III and IV muscle
      afferents). As transcutaneous electrical muscle stimulation stimulates the same receptors in
      the spinal cord dorsal horn as fentanyl, it is hypothesized that it could also improve
      exercise capacity.

      Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess wether transcutaneous electrical stimulation
      (high or low frequency) is effective in improving exercise capacity in patients with severe
      to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

    <description>4 self adhesive surface electrodes are positioned by pair at the L3-L4 level, laterally.
Stimulation is setted at rest, 10min before constant workload testing. During this period, intensity is increased every 3minutes to the maximum tolerated by the patient (pain threshold). Thereafter, intensity is not increased anymore during the test.
It is explained to the patient that he might or no experience the electrical stimulation sensation.
Current characteristics : 100Hertz, 100ms, bidirectional. Constant workload testing : 60-70rpm ; 75% Wpic ; up to exhaustion or rpm &lt; 60 during more than 10s.</description>
