  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility of targeting more frequent gown and glove use for
      specific high risk moments of care in specific nursing home residents in order to prevent
      Staphylococcus aureus (SA) acquisition and infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes are settings with a high rate of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) acquisition, which
      leads to infection, particularly for short stay residents. The current standard of care for
      preventing SA acquisition and SA infection in nursing homes is Standard Precautions (gowns
      and gloves for anticipated contact with blood, body fluids, skin breakdown or mucous
      membranes) for all residents.

      The investigators propose a feasibility study of a novel strategy, the addition of targeted
      gown and glove use, to prevent SA acquisition and SA infection in residents of nursing homes.
      Rather than wearing gowns and gloves for all care activities to prevent transmission, gown
      and glove use can be targeted to specific high risk &quot;moments&quot; of care for specific high risk
      residents. High risk &quot;moments&quot; for gown and glove use are care activities most likely to
      transmit SA based on prior research. Residents with chronic wounds and medical devices are:
      1) most likely to be colonized with SA; 2) most likely to acquire SA; 3) most likely to
      transmit SA to healthcare worker clothing and hands; and 4) most likely to develop a SA
      infection based on prior research and thus would be considered high risk residents.

      The investigators will perform a quasi-experimental (before-after) study of this
      intervention, targeted gown and glove use, at two community-based nursing homes to
      demonstrate its feasibility and evaluate its effect on SA acquisition and SA infection rates.
