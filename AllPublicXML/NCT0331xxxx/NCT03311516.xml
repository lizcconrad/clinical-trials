  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of insulin therapy when the bolus dose of
      insulin is calculated on the basis of protein and fat content in food intake, in addition to
      that of carbohydrates in T1D patients treated by insulin pump. The study is planned to
      recruit 150 patients with type1 diabetes already practicing functional insulin therapy based
      on carbohydrate counting in meals. We will therefore study the effect on continuous glucose
      measured by subcutaneous sensor, of meal bolus adjustments by comparing two groups of T1D
      patients:

        -  Groupe A takes into account the lipid and protein content in addition to the
           carbohydrate content

        -  Group B takes into account the carbohydrate content only At randomization, all patients
           receive dietary and adjustment of bolus doses instructions according to the
           randomization group. They have to apply these instructions for 3 months. At the end of 3
           months, the study groups will be under glucose monitoring during two weeks in the
           Outpatient Clinic but returns to the investigational site in hospital to download data
           from the continuous measurement of glucose. In addition, we propose a period of
           extension similar to that of the main period, namely 3 months of application of dietetic
           and adaptation of bolus doses instructions and 2 weeks of continuous measurement of
           glucose.

      During each 2 weeks period will be assessed specific glucose parameters in the post-prandial
      period over 4hours (glycemic sensor values in the glucose range between 70-140 mg / dl,
      glycemic sensor values in the glucose range between 140 -180 mg /dl and &gt; 180 mg /dl) after
      taking each meal during each Glucose Continuous Measurement week, average daily glucose per
      meal, average blood glucose over the 2 week period after each meal
