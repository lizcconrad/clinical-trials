  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the efficacy of a digital
      diabetes prevention program for improving weight, glucose control, and secondary risk factors
      among people with prediabetes compared to an enhanced standard care plus wait-list control.
      Exploratory assessments of implementation facilitators and barriers will also be completed to
      determine strategies for integrating external diabetes-prevention interventions within
      healthcare settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prediabetes is an increasingly prevalent condition, characterized by glucose levels that are
      above normal but below the threshold for diabetes. Previous studies have demonstrated that
      intensive lifestyle interventions targeting changes in diet, physical activity, sleep, and
      stress can reduce the risk of progressing from prediabetes to Type 2 diabetes. The Diabetes
      Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) currently recognizes both in-person and online programs
      that meet requirements to deliver approved curriculum, provide health coaching and group
      support, and equip participants with behavioral skills and self-monitoring tools to support
      behavior change. While non-randomized trial data demonstrate that an online digital program
      was successful for producing meaningful weight loss and improved glucose control, the goal of
      this randomized, controlled trial is to definitively evaluate the efficacy of the program for
      improving weight, glucose control and secondary risk factors compared to current standard
      care for prediabetes. In addition, few trials have examined the implementation factors that
      could speed the uptake of efficacious diabetes prevention interventions for delivery in
      regular clinical practice. Qualitative information on key organizational stakeholders (e.g.,
      physicians, office managers) will be gathered to provide information on perceptions of the
      online program characteristics, outcomes, and resources concurrently with strategies to
      promote adoption and implementation in health care settings.

    <description>This qualitative assessment will identify the overall implementation climate for a digital DPP. Key informant interviews will be used to elicit stakeholder perceptions, which will be coded for meaning and grouped into categories. The categories will then be integrated to determine possible implementation strategies for this type of program. As such, there is a single assessment that will result in multiple categories. We identified the a priori hypothetical categories, but may find additional categories and may not find perceptions that align with the current categories. This is a single section since these qualitative outcomes may be variable.
Physician, other health professional, and administrator perceptions of:
The value and practicality of integrating a new DPP within their facility
Barriers to DPP sustainability
Contextual readiness for a diabetes prevention initiative
Factors that would facilitate implementation
Indicators of successful implementation</description>
