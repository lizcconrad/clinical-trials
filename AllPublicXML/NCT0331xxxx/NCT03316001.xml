    <textblock>
      Mesenteric panniculitis is a benign inflammatory condition that involves the adipose tissue
      of the intestinal mesentery. Clinical manifestations are uncommon, non specific and atypical.
      Mesenteric panniculitis is thus most often an incidental finding during an investigation for
      other reason, mostly on computed tomography scans. The rate of malignancy in patients with
      mesenteric panniculitis, especially urogenital and gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas or
      lymphomas, has been reported to be as high, thus suggesting that there may be a relationship
      between mesenteric panniculitis and progression of an underlying malignancy or the risk of a
      future malignancy.

      The aim was:

      to estimate the prevalence of mesenteric panniculitis. to study relationship between
      mesenteric panniculitis and malignancy. to investigate the 5-year outcome of patients with
      mesenteric panniculitis for the development of malignancy.

    <description>mesenteric panniculitis is identified on the basis on the presence of three of the following 5 signs on CT scan:
higher attenuation of the fat of the root of the small bowel mesentery,
a pseudo mass smoothly displacing neighboring structures with a hyperdense pseudocapsule surrounding the mesenteric fat,
lymph nodes within the fatty pseudo mass and
a hypodense halo around the nodes and the blood vessels</description>
