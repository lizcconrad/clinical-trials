  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to measure serum levels of myristic acid in septic patients and to
      compare them with myristic acid serum levels in patients with Systemic Inflammatory Response
      Syndrome of non infective etiology in cohort of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
      Furthermore, other biomarkers of sepsis are evaluated in comparison with microbiological
      findings detected either by standard cultures or by molecular biological methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is an array of biomarkers potentially useful in diagnosis and prognosis in
      septic patients, either alone or in combination. Only a fraction of them is used in clinical
      practice. The reasons vary, low sensitivity or specificity is the main one, cost/benefit or
      difficult processing with the need of highly specialized laboratory to name the other.

      Recent pilot study from Swedish authors (A.M.Kauppi et al.) published in 2016 showed high
      correlation of myristic acid levels in blood in patients with sepsis and bacteraemia. There
      was no other publication on this molecule in relation to sepsis before Myristic acid is an
      organic acid of linear structure. Measurement of its level will be performed using gas
      chromatography linked with mass spectrometry.
