  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and efficacy of giving
      pembrolizumab before a cystectomy (a surgery to remove the bladder) to patients with
      urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.

      This is an investigational study. Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat many types of cancer, but not bladder cancer. It is considered investigational to use
      pembrolizumab to treat bladder cancer.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 3 weeks.

      If participant is found to be eligible to take part in this study, participant will receive
      pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2.

      About 4 weeks after the second dose of pembrolizumab, participant will have participant's
      scheduled cystectomy as part of participant's standard care. Participant will be given a
      separate consent explaining the risks and benefits of the surgery.

      Length of Study Participation:

      Participant may receive pembrolizumab up to 2 times before participant's cystectomy.
      Participant will no longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side effects occur,
      if participant is unable to follow study directions, or if participant's doctor decides it is
      in participant's best interest to stop treatment with pembrolizumab and proceed to surgery
      right away.

      Participation on the study will be over after follow-up (described below).

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Part of this
           blood sample will also be used to check certain hormone levels. Depending when
           participant's screening tests were performed, participant may not need to have this
           testing performed during Cycle 1.

        -  Within 72 hours before Cycle 1, if participant can become pregnant and depending on when
           participant's screening pregnancy test was performed, part of the above blood or urine
           sample may be used for a pregnancy test. If a urine pregnancy test is used and the
           results are positive or the doctor or the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1
           tablespoon) will be drawn to confirm the results.

      During the week before participant's cystectomy:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Part of this
           blood sample will also be used to check certain hormone levels.

      Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn and stored for future research studies after each
      cycle of treatment and 1 time after participant's surgery. Tissue from participant's
      cystectomy will also be collected and banked for future research studies.

      If participant stops receiving pembrolizumab sooner than expected and surgery cannot happen
      right away, participant will return to clinic within 30 days after participant's last dose of
      pembrolizumab and blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.
      Participant will then complete the follow-up visits below.

      Follow-Up:

      After the surgery, participant will be return to clinic for follow-up every 4 weeks up to 24
      weeks. At each visit:

        -  Participant will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. Part of this
           blood sample will also be used to check certain hormone levels.

        -  At participant's first follow-up visit, blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for
           future research.
