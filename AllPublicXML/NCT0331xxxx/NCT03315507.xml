  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PB1046-PT-CL-0005 is an open-label, dose-titration study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      and hemodynamic effects of individually dose-titrated PB1046 administered by weekly
      subcutaneous injection for 8 weeks in adult subjects with PAH who have a permanently
      implanted hemodynamic monitor in the distal pulmonary artery. The primary objectives of the
      study are to assess the overall safety, tolerability, and hemodynamic profile of a PB1046
      across an individually titrated dose range.

             Functional Class II or III by clinical diagnostic criteria assessed by the
             Investigator and have a permanently implanted pulmonary artery hemodynamic monitor
             (IHM);

             = 175 x (Creat / 88.4)-1.154 x (Age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if African
             American) (conventional units);

          -  Clinically significant liver dysfunction as measured by any one of the following: a.
             alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3.0 time ULN or; b. aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             &gt;3.0 time ULN or; c. serum bilirubin ≥ 1.6 mg/dL;
