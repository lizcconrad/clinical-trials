      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ASCT as consolidation in
      case of bcl-2 overexpression in non previously treated patients aged 60 years or less with
      low-intermediate risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who responded to ACVBP regimen. Our goal
      is to obtain a 15% increase of event-free survival at 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma according to the WHO classification (anti
             CD20 labeling)

          -  Aged 18 to 60 years

          -  Non previously treated

          -  With one and only one of the following adverse characteristics: ECOG performance
             status 2 or more, or Ann Arbor stage III or IV, or elevated LDH level

          -  Negative HIV, HBV and HCV serologies (except vaccination)

          -  With a minimum life expectancy of 3 months

          -  Having previously signed a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of treated or non-treated indolent lymphoma.

          -  T-cell lymphoma.

          -  Central nervous system or meningeal involvement by lymphoma.

          -  Any Contra-indication to any drug contained in the chemotherapy regimens.

          -  Poor renal function (creatinin level&gt;150µmol/l), poor hepatic function (total

             abnormalities are related to the lymphoma.

          -  Serious active disease (according to the investigator’s decision).

          -  Poor bone marrow reserve as defined by neutrophils &lt;1.5G/l or platelets&lt;100G/l, unless
             related to bone marrow infiltration.

          -  Any history of cancer during the last 5 years with the exception of non-melanoma skin
             tumors or stage 0 (in situ) cervical carcinoma.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days before planned first cycle of
             chemotherapy and during the study.
