      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose regimen of SB-715992 in combination with
      docetaxel in patients with solid tumors. SB-715992 and docetaxel were dosed by 1-hour
      intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (on the same day). A patient may continue to receive
      treatment as long as they are benefiting from the treatment. Blood samples will be taken at
      specific times to measure the amount of both drugs in your body at specific times after the
      drug is given. Blood samples will also be taken for lab tests such as complete blood counts
      and clinical chemistries. Physical exams will be performed before each treatment with
      SB-715992. During the treatment phase, the patients will undergo regular assessments for
      safety and clinical response.
