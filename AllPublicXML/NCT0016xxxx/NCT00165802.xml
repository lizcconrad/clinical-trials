  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of E7974 after
      bolus IV administration, on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle, to patients with advanced solid tumors
      that have progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists.

    <textblock>
      The MTD for the Day 1 21-Day schedule was defined at the 0.45 mg/m2 dose level. The study was
      terminated prior to full enrollment of the colorectal cancer (CRC) expansion cohort, due to a
      lack of demonstrated activity resulting in Principal Investigator (PI) loss interest to
      continue enrollment. Collection of all outstanding data is ongoing and database lock is
      estimated to be complete in June 2008.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: At this time, we are only enrolling patients for the MTD cohort that
        meet all study entry criteria, plus the CRC criterion (Inclusion Criterion #12).Patients
        who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible
        for entry into the study. Patients must:

          1. Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor that has
             progressed following effective therapy or for which no effective therapy exists
             (including surgery or radiation therapy).

          2. Be &gt;= 18 years of age.

          3. Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0, 1, or 2.

          4. Have a life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months.

          5. Have adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 mg/dL or
             creatinine clearance &gt;= 40 mL/minute.

          6. Have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count &gt;=
             1,500/µL, hemoglobin of &gt;= 9 g/dL (may be transfused), and platelet count (not
             transfused) &gt;= 100,000/µL.

          7. Have adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt;= 1.5 x ULN and alanine
             transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) &lt;= 3 times the upper limits of
             normal (ULN), unless related to liver involvement by tumor, in which case &lt;= 5.0 x
             ULN.

          8. Give written informed consent.

          9. Be willing and able to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study.

         10. Be willing to undergo blood draw and urine sampling for PK in Cycle 1.

         11. Can have either measurable or non-measurable disease.

         12. If a CRC patient is being treated at the MTD, they must have &lt;= 4 prior regimens in
             the metastatic setting.

        Exclusion Criteria:The presence of one or more of the following criteria will disqualify a
        patient from enrollment in the study:

          1. Patients who have received chemotherapy within 3 weeks of E7974 treatment start; (six
             weeks for nitrosoureas).

             Lesions that have been radiated cannot be included as sites of measurable disease
             unless clear tumor progression has been documented in these lesions since the end of
             radiation therapy.
