    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research study is to evaluate an automated, laser-based technique for
      measuring DNA damage caused by radiation during cancer treatment in immature red blood cells.

      Correlative studies: analysis of RT effect on genotoxicity by assessing cytogenetic changes
      (dicentrics), micronucleated lymphocytes (MN-lymph), and micronucleated reticulocytes
      (MN-RET) using peripheral blood of patients receiving radiation.

      i) document the kinetics by which radiation-induced MN-RET enter the peripheral blood stream.

      ii) benchmark the MN-RET endpoint against current gold-standard biodosimetry
      endpoints—dicentrics and MN-lymphocytes.

      iii) measure inter-individual variation in baseline and radiation-induced MN-RET frequencies.

      iv) in collaboration with several FCM-equipped laboratories, evaluate the transferability of
      the human MN-RET scoring assay.
