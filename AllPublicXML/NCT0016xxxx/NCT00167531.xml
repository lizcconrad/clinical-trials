  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being able to walk is a major determinant of whether a patient returns home after stroke or
      lives in residential care. For the family, the loss of the stroke sufferer from everyday life
      is a catastrophic event. For the community, the costs of being unable to walk after stroke
      are exorbitant, involving a lifetime of residential care. Therefore, an increase in the
      proportion of stroke patients who regain walking ability will be a significant advance.

      This trial will determine, in patients early after stroke who are unable to walk, whether
      training walking using a treadmill with partial weight support via an overhead harness will
      be more effective than current intervention in (i) establishing more independent walking,
      reducing the time taken to achieve independent walking, and improving the quality of
      independent walking, and (ii) improving walking capacity and participation 6 months later.

      Only half of the stroke patients unable to walk who are admitted to inpatient rehabilitation
      in Australia learn to walk again. Treadmill training with partial weight support is a
      relatively new intervention that is designed to train walking. However, a Cochrane Systematic
      Review (Moseley et al 2003) concludes that there is as yet no definitive answer about whether
      this intervention helps more non-ambulatory patients learn to walk compared to assisted
      overground walking.

      Participants will be 130 stroke patients who are unable to walk independently early after
      stroke. They will be recruited and randomly allocated to a control group or an experimental
      group.

      The control group will undertake routine assisted overground walking training while the
      experimental group will undertake treadmill walking with partial weight support via an
      overhead harness. Duration and frequency of intervention and the amount of assistance from
      therapists will be standardised across groups.
