          -  will reliably keep a daily record of symptoms;

          -  understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions, and give written informed

          -  if female and capable of bearing children - show a negative pregnancy test result at
             study entry and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of
             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

             season;

          -  suffer from any kind of immunodeficiency;

          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment

             immunological functions;

          -  have a history of inflammatory or degenerative neurological disease (e.g. Guillain
             Barr√©, multiple sclerosis);

          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within one month of study entry;

          -  have a history of any vaccine-related contraindicating event (e.g. anaphylaxis);

          -  have a rash or dermatological condition which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating;
