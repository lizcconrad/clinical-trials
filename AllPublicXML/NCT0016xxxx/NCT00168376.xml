      The study will involve a 3-week (15 session) randomized double-blind clinical trial of two
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) conditions in patients with treatment
      resistant depression. rTMS site selection will be localized from structural MRI scans.

      The patients will be randomized to one of two conditions

        1. rTMS targeted to the border of Brodmann area 46 and Brodmann area 9,

        2. rTMS targeted to premotor cortex (this condition will act as the non-dorsolateral
           prefrontal cortex targeted control).

      The outcome measure used is the MADRS (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). This is
      administered at baseline and on a fortnightly basis. At study end response criteria is
      defined as a 50% reduction in total MADRS score and remission defined as a MADRS score of
      less than or equal to 10.

      Other outcome measures administered fortnightly are: BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale),
      CORE (measure of melancholic symptoms), BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), CGI (Clinical Global
      Impression Scale), GAF (Global Assessment of Functioning Scale). A cognitive battery is also
      administered.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Moderate to severe depressive symptoms as indicated as MADRS &gt;20

        -  Failure to respond to a minimum of two antidepressant medications

        -  No increase or initiation of new antidepressant therapy in the four weeks prior to
           entering the trial Exclusion Criteria

        -  Have an unstable medical condition, neurological disorder or any history of seizure
           disorder or are currently pregnant or lactating

        -  Previous brain injury or surgery, any metal clips, plates or other metal items in the
           head, cardiac pacemaker

        -  In the opinion of the investigator, are a sufficient suicide risk to require immediate
           electroconvulsive therapy

        -  Have a current DSMIV diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence disorder, a diagnosis of
           a personality disorder or another axis 1 disorder
