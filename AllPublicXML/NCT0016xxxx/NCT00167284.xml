  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of managed care, increasing responsibility for the care of patients with
      diabetes is being placed on primary care physicians. Evidence exists that physicians are not
      meeting established practice guidelines, and outcomes in patients with diabetes are less than
      optimal. It is thus the objective of this study to institute a community-based diabetes
      education intervention for both physicians and patients to enhance adherence to guidelines
      and improve patient outcomes.

      We will conduct a chart review (submitted under a separate IRB: #000733) in primary care
      practices to determine health status and guideline adherence. Following the chart review,
      physician practices will be assigned to one of three groups: physician + patient education,
      physician education alone, and usual care. Following the intervention, a repeat chart review
      will be conducted. Pre and posttest comparisons will be conducted to examine changes
      primarily in glycemic control, quality of life, patient knowledge, and physician adherence to
      practice guidelines. Secondarily, we will examine changes in therapeutic intervention, body
      mass index, and barriers to diabetes care. We will also examine individual barriers to
      diabetes care and their influence on outcomes in this population. The last phase of the study
      will encompass a second follow-up visit in which we will examine behavioral factors related
      to clinical change and sustainability of the intervention.
