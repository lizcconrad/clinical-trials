    <textblock>
      Quadriceps retraining, especially the vastus medialis oblique muscle strengthening, plays an
      important role in clinical management of patellofemoral pain syndrome. Vastus medialis
      oblique muscle roles as a dynamic stabilizer during the functional knee movement. It can
      generate a medial pulling force to patella against the lateral pulled by vastus lateralis.
      Thus it improves the patellofemoral joint compression force, reduces the knee pain, increases
      functional abilities, and patients’ quality of life.

      Could vastus medialis oblique be isolation by way of specific exercise without or minimize
      the recruitment of vastus lateralis？ According to human anatomy, vastus medialis oblique
      muscle origin from hip adductor magnus tendon, thus if incorporate hip adduction with knee
      extension as a selective means of training needs more researches. However, literature search
      shows that there are only a lot of EMG studies, so we need further clinical research to prove
      the treatment effect of this kind of strategy.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the treatment effects of hip adduction combine
      knee extension exercise in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome. We use muscle
      morphology of quadriceps muscle, pain, and functional abilities as the main outcome measures.
      Besides, we will make further compare with traditional knee extension exercise. The first
      hypothesis of the study is that patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome will get
      improvement in muscle morphology of quadriceps muscle, pain, and functional abilities after
      hip adduction combine knee extension exercise training . The second hypothesis is that
      patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome who receive hip adduction combine knee extension
      exercise training will get more improvement in muscle morphology of quadriceps muscle, pain,
      and functional abilities than patients who receive traditional knee extension exercise
      training.

      90 patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome who less than 50 years old will be included in
      this study, and randomly distributed to hip adduction combine knee extension exercise group,
      knee extension exercise group, and control group. Following 8 weeks exercise training by an
      experimental physical therapist, ultrasound measurement of muscle thickness and
      cross-sectional area of vastus medialis oblique muscle, vastus lateralis muscle, and rectus
      femoris muscle component of quadriceps, 10cm-VAS patellofemoral joint pain evaluation,
      including VAS-U, VAS-W, and VAS-activity, and Lysholm scale scores will be measured. A
      two-way mixed ANOVA will be used to compare the mean differences between theses three groups.

      The study is aimed to provide an clinical evidence for evidence-based practice of
      rehabilitation in patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome.
