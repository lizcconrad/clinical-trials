  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether naltrexone is safe and useful in preventing
      alcohol relapse, as well as in decreasing craving for alcohol in people with a diagnosis of
      alcohol and cocaine dependence. Naltrexone is approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, the medication was not approved as
      yet at the dosage we will use in this study. The dosage we will use for the study (150 mg),
      is greater than the recommended dosage from the Physician's Desk Reference (50mg). Unlike
      other medicines (like Antabuse) useful in the treatment of alcohol dependence, naltrexone
      will not make you sick if you drink alcohol. Rather, people who are taking this medication
      have reported that it helps decrease the pleasure associated with drinking for them. This
      study is being conducted because the medication (Naltrexone) has not been well studied in
      people with both alcohol and cocaine dependence, so it is still investigational.

      We believe that if we can reduce alcohol consumption through naltrexone and psychotherapy,
      this may lead to reduced cocaine use. We are also conducting this study to test two different
      types of psychotherapy as a method for reducing cocaine and alcohol use. One type of
      psychotherapy is designed to help people learn to cope with situations that put them at high
      risk for relapse to cocaine and/or alcohol use. The other type of psychotherapy we will use
      focuses on strengthening motivation to recover from cocaine and/or alcohol use, and on
      developing techniques to handle possible barriers to recovery. We seek to enroll 300 patients
      in the study.
