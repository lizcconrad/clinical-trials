  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitor
      (donepezil hydrochloride) Aricept in patients with vascular dementia (VaD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular dementia is a significant cause of intellectual and functional impairment in young
      patients consequent to cerebrovascular disease. Post-mortem studies show that VaD patients
      have a cholinergic deficiency like in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholinesterase inhibitors are
      now standard treatment for mild to moderate AD. This study aims to determine if donepezil, a
      cholinesterase inhibitor, would benefit patients with VaD by decreasing their scores in the
      VaDAS-cog and improvement in their CIBIC rating over a period of 24-weeks treatment. Adverse
      events will also be monitored.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The subjects eligible for this study are men and women outpatients, age 40-60 years old,
        who fulfill the criteria for VAD according to the National Institute of Neurological
        Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la Recherche et l'Enseignement
        en Neurosciences International Workshop (NINCDS-AIREN). Subjects shall undergo extensive
        clinical examination by a stroke specialist and radiological examination (CT or MRI) to
        document presence of cerebrovascular disease. The clinical diagnosis has to be relevant to
        the imaging findings.

        Other Inclusion criteria:

        Subjects with clinically stable hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac disease for
        the last 3 months. Subjects with history of recent stroke, who have not been hospitalized
        for stroke in the previous 3 months. Subjects with depression controlled with medications.
        Subjects should have no hearing or visual impairment and live with a reliable caregiver.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Subjects should have no radiological evidence of other brain disorders (subdural hematoma,
        post-traumatic / post-surgery) have no depression or other psychiatric disorders,
        infectious disorders, neoplastic condition, and metabolic and toxic encephalopathies,
        dementia due to AD or prior diagnosis of AD, and major depression or other psychiatric
        disorders.

        Subjects with clinical evidence of pulmonary, hepatic, gastrointestinal, metabolic,
        endocrine or other life threatening diseases; pregnancy, history of alcohol or drug abuse,
        and sensitivity to cholinesterase inhibitors; use of investigational agents, cholinomimetic
        and anticholinergic agents.
