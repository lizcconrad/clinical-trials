  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether thalidomide can stop the progression of
      fibrosis in IPF.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of
      400 mg of thalidomide administered daily for one year in patients with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF) who have failed or are not candidates for treatment with corticosteroids
      and/or cytotoxic drugs.

      The study population will consist of patients with biopsy-proven moderate to severe IPF who
      have failed or are not candidates for standard therapy with corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic
      drugs.

      This is an unmasked Phase II, safety and efficacy trial of subjects with biopsy-proven IPF
      who have failed or are not candidates for standard therapy with corticosteroids and/or
      cytotoxic drugs. The study doctors are interested in studying the effects of the oral drug
      Thalomid(R) on IPF. Thalomid(R) (thalidomide) is an approved medication for Hansen's disease
      (leprosy). It is know to have anti-inflammatory effects and effects on fibrosis. It is hoped
      that Thalomid(R) may prevent progression of IPF.

      Thalidomide is investigational for this use, which means that it has not been approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of IPF.

      The age range for this study is 50-80 years, inclusive. There are 6 visits over the 12 month
      period. These visits include physical exams, pregnancy tests (if applicable), several symptom
      scales and questionnaires about your pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary function testing,
      x-rays,peripheral nerve testing, and blood tests including arterial blood gas measurements.
      You will be given the medication in capsule form every 28 days for a year. There is a set
      schedule for increasing the doses of the thalidomide every 2 weeks until it reaches the 400
      mg. dose that is being studies. A stool softener is also provided for each participant.

      All subjects must read, sign and follow a manual of precautions prepared by Celgene, the
      manufacturer of Thalomid(R), before enrolling in this study. This manual, containing the
      S.T.E.P.S.(R) precautions, will be given to all participants.

      This study is being conducted at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions located in Baltimore,
      Maryland.
