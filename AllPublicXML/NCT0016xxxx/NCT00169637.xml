      This is a randomized controlled, parallel group, open label versus &quot;no treatment&quot; trial which
      evaluate the efficacy of rhGH on weaning off parenteral nutrition in children with short
      bowel syndrome.The total follow-up is 14 months; 4 months for each group after randomization;
      At the end of the first four months: the treated group will be followed within 6 months, the
      untreated group will receive compassionately rhGH for 4 months and followed-up for 6 months
      after the end of the treatment period.
