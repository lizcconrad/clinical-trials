  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the superiority of inhibitory effects and safety of
      Menatetrenone (E0167) on recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted as a multicenter, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled,
      double-blind comparative clinical study. Patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind
      manner to receive 45 or 90 mg/day of oral vitamin K2 or an identical-appearing placebo. Study
      drug was administered orally three times daily after meals until recurrence.
