      To investigate the efficacy and safety of KES524 in patients with obesity (visceral fat
      obesity with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia), a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      comparative study is conducted. This study aims to examine superiority of KES524 to placebo
      by employing change and percent change in body weight (primary endpoints) and changes in
      proportion of subjects achieving ≧ 5% weight reduction, BMI, waist circumference, visceral
      fat area, subcutaneous fat area, V/S ratio by abdominal CT scan, HbA1c, TG and HDL-C
      (secondary endpoints).
