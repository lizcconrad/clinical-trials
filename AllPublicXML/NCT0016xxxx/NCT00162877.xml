    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori in known to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal
      disorders such as peptide ulcer. Eradication of this bacterium is important in the treatment
      of these diseases as well as in the reduction of the recurrence. The one-week triple therapy
      with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) is now considered to be the standard therapies in the
      treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection, providing more than 80% eradication rates with
      few adverse effects. PPIs are mainly metabolized by CYP2C19, which is known to exhibit
      polymorphisms in both its genotype and phenotype. Based on the PK/PD results of our study on
      PPI, recently, we have proposed that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers might be subject to
      advantageous conditions, especially after day-4, for the treatment of H. pylori infection
      when 20 mg rabeprazole was given twice daily. Our results also suggest a possibility to start
      the triple therapy on day-4 of rabeprazole treatment to ensure the optimal acid suppression
      effect for antibiotics to exert the bacteriocidal effect. To find the rationale and the
      optimal dosing regimen for the eradication of H. pylori infection using different proton pump
      inhibitors, volunteers of four groups would be included in this study. PPI (rabeprazole or
      esomeprazole) is given for 7 days. Antibiotics are given starting from day-1 or day-4 of PPI
      dosing. The eradication rate of H. pylori infection and the PK/PD of PPIs are also evaluated.
