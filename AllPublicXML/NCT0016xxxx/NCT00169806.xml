  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney stones are very common. They affect 3-5% of the population in the United States. Many
      people are hospitalized for the treatment of kidney stones and some may die. Better
      understanding of what causes kidney stones is useful in both the treatment and prevention of
      kidney stones. However, exactly what causes kidney stones is unknown.

      The most common type of kidney stones contains calcium, which sometimes is attached to a part
      of the kidney important in producing the final urine, called the papilla. The investigators
      have noticed that persons who form kidney stones seem to have more papilla with stones
      attached. They propose to study these areas of the papilla, called Randall's plaques (named
      after their discoverer), in patients undergoing surgery for kidney stones.

      In order to attempt to explain the pathogenesis of renal calculi, the investigators videotape
      and document the location and characteristics of each stone, papillae and calyces. One or
      more small papillary biopsies are taken for analysis to help determine the point of origin of
      the kidney stone and histological studies are undertaken to determine tissue differences
      amongst different types of stone formers. Approximately one month after surgery, metabolic
      studies are undertaken to further review potential causes of stone formation.
