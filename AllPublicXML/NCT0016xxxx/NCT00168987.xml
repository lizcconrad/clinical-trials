  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a frequent symptom of various malignant diseases and is frequently observed
      in patients with gastrointestinal tumors. Eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) has been introduced as
      specific and anticatabolic acting substrate in cancer patients. Only few randomized trials
      are available which investigated the effect of EPA in form of an EPA-enriched, protein- and
      energy-dense oral nutritional supplement mostly in patients with pancreatic carcinoma.

      Therefore, the effect of an EPA-rich oral nutritional supplement for two months on functional
      state and quality of life in patients with other gastroenterological tumors and weight loss
      is investigated in this randomized prospective trial.
