      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of GB virus C (GBV-C) on the natural
      history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in subjects co-infected with HIV and
      HCV. The other aspect of the study is to assess the effect of GBV-C on the severity of liver
      disease due to chronic hepatitis C in subjects co-infected with HIV and HCV. This will be
      done by determining the point prevalence of co-infection retrospectively then following that
      cohort prospectively. In addition, further individuals will be recruited in a prospective
      manner.

      Background and Research Plan:

      GBV-C and hepatitis G virus (HGV) are both RNA viruses from the Flaviviridae family.
      Molecular characterization of these viruses has shown them to be virtually identical to each
      other (1,2). GBV-C was first isolated in 1995 from an archival blood sample obtained in the
      1960s from a surgeon with acute non A-E hepatitis (3). GBV-C has a 29% amino acid sequence
      homology with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), another flavivirus (4). However, GBV-C in contrast to
      HCV, is not hepatotropic as the virus neither replicates primarily in hepatocytes nor causes
      acute or chronic hepatitis. Indeed, GBV-C does not cause any specific disease nor does it
      represent a substantial health risk in humans. Nevertheless, GBV-C infection is relatively
      common with a 2% prevalence rate in healthy blood donors, the majority of whom clear the
      virus and develop antibodies to the envelope glycoprotein E2.

      HIV infection has a particularly high rate of co-infection with GBV-C. Studies suggest that
      co-infection leads to a beneficial effect on the course of HIV (5,6,7) with co-infection
      associated with a significantly lower mortality rate among HIV-infected subjects compared to
      those not infected with GBV-C. The mechanism of the beneficial effect of GBV-C on the course
      of HIV infection is obscure.

      Among new cases of non-A, non-B hepatitis in the United States, 18 percent are positive for
      GBV-C, and 80% of these patients are also infected with HCV. Amongst patients with HCV,
      10-20% have GBV-C RNA in their serum (4). In another report 189 patients with chronic HCV
      infection were evaluated; 21 (11%) were positive for GBV-C RNA (8). The course of the HCV
      infection and the response to interferon-alfa were not affected by co-infection with GBV-C.
      Interferon-alfa led to a decrease in GBV-C RNA titers that was not sustained after the
      cessation of therapy. Similar findings were noted in another study in which liver biopsies
      were performed (9). Detailed histopathologic examination revealed no difference between the
      patients infected with HCV alone and the 15 percent who were co-infected with GBV-C. There
      have been no studies to date looking at the effect GBV-C, HCV and HIV have on each other.

      Our previous studies into HIV and GBV-C have suggested that co-infection is common. Active
      GBV-C infection is frequently observed in persons involved in high-risk sexual activity and
      with HIV infection. Homosexual intercourse appears to be a more effective means of
      transmission of GBV-C. GBV-C has the same epidemiology and transmission as HIV and underlines
      the intimate association between GBV-C and HIV (10).

      Methods/Experimental Design:

      Stored sera is available from people who have attended the Hepatitis and HIV clinics at the
      Alfred Hospital. Sera is available back to approximately 1990 and has been stored at minus
      20ÂºC and as such is suitable for GBV-C detection particularly RNA by PCR. Of the sera stored
      by the HIV clinic 203 patients are known to be co-infected with HCV who are currently still
      alive. Once ethics committee approval is obtained we propose to contact these groups of
      people and see if they would participate in this study. Once consent is obtained we plan to
      perform the following.

      A. Stored sera will be retrospectively examined for the point prevalence of infection with
      HCV, GBV-C and HIV. These individuals will then be followed up in a prospective manner
      assessing the progression of liver disease and other factors as outlined in Tables 1 to 4.

      B. New subjects attending the Alfred Hospital Hepatitis or HIV clinics will be recruited and
      followed prospectively also as outlined in Tables 1 to 4.

      C. An age and sex matched control group infected with HCV alone will be identified via the
      Alfred Hospital Hepatitis clinic. This clinic has a large cohort of well-characterized HCV
      infected subjects that extends back to 1989.

      The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study are as follows:

      Inclusion criteria

        1. Sera available and appropriate for testing. Including serial sera over a period of time.
           (retrospective analysis)

        2. HIV serology positive.

        3. Unequivocal HCV antibody positive or HCV RNA positive.

      Exclusion criteria

        1. Those without sera available.

        2. Those unwilling to give informed consent.

        3. Persons with Hepatitis B Virus infection, as defined by the presence of Hepatitis B
           surface antigen and/or Hepatitis B Virus DNA positive.

      Where possible information will also be obtained about these people by interview, examining
      the medical records or discussion with their General Practitioners. Subjects will also be
      encouraged to attend the hospital in person where a clinical exam can be performed. If
      insufficient sera is stored further blood will be drawn at this time and examined for HCV,
      HIV and GBV-C related parameters as outlined in the tables below. A study specific
      questionnaire will be generated in which subjects will be asked to complete a confidential
      questionnaire that contains information related to demographic and behavioral factors that
      may contribute to the acquisition of GBV-C, HCV or HIV infection or various combinations of
      the above. Demographic variables will include age, sex, country of birth, and occupation.
      Information relevant to HIV infection including the use of HAART and the presence or absence
      of AIDS defining syndromes will be obtained. The questionnaire will attempt to identify the
      approximate time of acquisition of both HCV and HIV. In addition, the extent of liver disease
      will be assessed, alcohol consumption will be quantified and information will be gathered on
      previous treatment with Interferon and Ribavirin.

      The main outcomes of this study will be liver related morbidity, such as chronic hepatitis,
      cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer and overall patient survival. The detailed information
      contained in the following tables will be obtained from interview, medical records and
      clinical examination:

      Table 1: GBV-C

        1. Testing sera for GBV-C RNA and E2 antibodies to GBV-C.

        2. Performing testing at one-year intervals if sera is available.

        1. CD4 count (buffy coat) in HIV positive.

        2. HIV viral load.

        3. Use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and other retroviral treatment
           and/or change in treatment.

           hepatocellular carcinoma.

        4. ALT and AST levels as well as AST/ALT ratio.

        5. Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) level.

        6. Liver histology at biopsy with assessment of inflammation grade, stage of fibrosis and
           severity of hepatic steatosis.

        7. Liver ultrasound results.

        8. Results of endoscopy, i.e. features of portal hypertension

        1. Has patient died?

        2. Date of death.

        3. Cause of death.

      Results will be statistically examined by univariate and multivariate analysis in terms of
      clinical outcomes with respect to chronic hepatitis C liver disease between GBV-C positive
      and negative groups in the HIV co-infected cohort compared with the HCV infected cohort
      alone. See following Table 5.
