  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if wide excision (surgical removal) alone is
      adequate treatment for small, grade 1 or 2 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients with DCIS are usually treated with the combination of breast-conserving surgery
           and radiation therapy or breast-conserving surgery alone. The purpose of this study is
           to evaluate whether localized low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, diagnosed with modern
           mammography and careful pathologic evaluation, could be treated with wide excision alone
           (omission of radiation therapy) and result in acceptably low local recurrence rates.

        -  Follow-up consists of physical examinations at least every 6 months by the surgeon or
           radiation oncologist. Mammograms of the affected breast will be obtained every 6 months
           for 5 years and then annually. Mammograms of the unaffected breast will be performed
           annually.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have high quality mammogram including magnification views of the area
             containing suspicious calcifications.

          -  A specimen radiograph is required. If the specimen radiograph does not assure removal
             of all suspicious microcalcifications, a post-operative mammogram showing removal of
             all suspicious calcifications is required.

          -  The clinical extent of DCIS must be less than or equal to 2.5 cm.

          -  Grade 1 or 2 DCIS; patients with lobular carcinoma-in-situ (LCIS) in addition to DCIS
             in the breast are eligible. Negative margins are not required on the LCIS.

          -  Patients must undergo a wide excision. A re-excision after the initial biopsy might be
             needed. Complete resection of the area of DCIS with a histologic margin of at least 1
             cm must be achieved.

          -  Patients must be enrolled on this protocol within 3 months of the last surgical
             procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with invasive carcinoma including microinvasive disease

          -  Carcinoma found in the sampled lymph nodes if axillary dissection is done

          -  Patients with nipple discharge

          -  Patients with adjuvant chemotherapy or Tamoxifen

          -  Patients with a history of prior malignancies other than squamous or basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Patients with a history of ipsilateral or contralateral breast carcinoma or DCIS or
             simultaneous bilateral DCIS.
