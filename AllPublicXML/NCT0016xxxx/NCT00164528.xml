  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children diagnosed through the FAS DPN clinic (who receive non-study services through the
      clinic/referrals) will receive baseline assessment. The baseline assessment for the child
      will include: medical issues (including medication), intellectual assessment, academic
      achievement, language, social functioning, executive functioning, neurological assessment,
      perceived self-confidence, and behavioral observation of parent-child interactions
      (videotaped and coded). For caregivers, baseline assessment will include: demographics,
      medical histories, educational history, current services, satisfaction with services,
      knowledge of FAS, stress, parenting competence, and family functioning.

      Functional analysis of challenging behaviors will be conducted. Intervention will be an
      individualized, multimodal, behavioral consultation. The consultation will include: FAS
      education, emotional/practical support, and teaching child management strategies specific to
      children with FAS/ARND, advocacy assistance, and school consultation. Specific procedure will
      be based on previous findings and experience. In particular, specialized “Behavior Support
      Plans” will be developed for each child with input from parents, teachers, and clinicians.

      Team consultations at the child’s home during weekly visits. Instruction will include
      information on FAS, behavioral strategies, and information for advocating with service
      systems.

      Evaluation Plan: Both interventions: Treatment and control groups will be compared using pre-
      and post-tests measures. Post-tests will be at the conclusion of the intervention and at a
      9-month follow-up (end of school year).
