  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomised control trial of patients who have a severe brain injury to determine if
      patients who receive a standardised sensory stimulation program emerge earlier from a
      vegetative state. The experimental group would receive, in addition to their normal
      occuaptional therapy, sensory stimulation which would involve the daily application of
      stimulation to all five senses using the Sensory Modalities Assessment and Rehabilitation
      Technique (SMART).

      A randomised control trial of patients who have a severe brain injury to determine if
      patients who receive a standardised sensory stimulation program emerge earlier from a
      vegetative state. The experimental group would receive, in addition to their normal
      occupational therapy, sensory stimulation which would involve the daily application of
      stimulation to all five senses using the Sensory Modalities Assessment and Rehabilitation
      Technique (SMART).

      The SMART is both an assessment and treatment too. Patients in both groups will have baseline
      assessments conducted using the SMART, with further assessments conducted every ten days for
      thrity days. The SMART is designed to provide quantitative data in the assessment of the
      patients cognitive function and potential awareness. It is a five point hierarchical scale
      from level 1 ( no response) to level 5 (discriminating).
