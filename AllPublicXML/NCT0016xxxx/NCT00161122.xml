  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PRIMAKid trial is a general practice based double-blind randomized placebo-controlled
      trial on the effectiveness and costs of combined influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in
      pre-school children with recurrent respiratory tract infections. A target number of 660
      children aged 18-72 months with a history of two or more general practitioner attended
      episodes of RTI, are included. Exclusion criteria are diseases accompanied by a high risk of
      recurrent RTI and conditions chronically treated with corticosteroids. Over a period of 7 to
      22 months follow-up, the number of febrile RTI-episodes as primary outcome is assessed, and
      as secondary outcomes the severity and length of febrile RTI-episodes, medical visits /
      interventions, health-related quality of life and productivity loss of parents.
