  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even with current standard ED treatments 20-25% of patients presenting to the ED with an
      acute asthma episode will still require hospitalization. For patients unresponsive to
      beta-agonists the admit rates will be higher. Of those well enough to be discharged from the
      ED nearly 30% will relapse within one month. More than 5,000 patients with asthma still die
      each year in the USA. For patients who do not respond to beta-agonists, there are relatively
      few treatment options for rapid improvement of symptoms and pulmonary function. Presumably,
      mucous secretion and plugging play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe asthma
      unresponsive to beta-agonists. The use of agents to promote clearance of intra-luminal
      secretions and mucous plugs may represent an important advance in the management of acutely
      ill asthmatics, both to hasten recovery and prevent deterioration in the acute care setting
      and to prevent relapse after discharge from the ED.

      OBJECTIVES

      2.1 Study Hypothesis: rhDNAse can be safely used in patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department with acute moderate-severe asthma who do not have adequate responses to
      beta-agonists

      Project Specific Aim: This is a pilot study to determine the safety of three different doses
      of pulmozyme® (2.5mg, 5.0mg and 7.5mg) in patients presenting to the ED with acute asthma. In
      addition to safety trends for improvement in pulmonary function and clinical outcomes will be
      monitored and data analyzed. Based on the safety profile and observable responses to
      treatment, this information may be used to develop larger trials to determine the efficacy
      and dosing strategy for treating acutely ill asthmatics with rhDNAse.
