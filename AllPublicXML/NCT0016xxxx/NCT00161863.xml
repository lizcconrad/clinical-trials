      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of five consecutive lots of FSME-IMMUN
      NEW in healthy volunteers. The main criterion for investigation is the fever rate after the
      first vaccination in three different age classes. The immunogenicity of 0.25 ml FSME-IMMUN
      NEW has been demonstrated in previous clinical studies in children; therefore, in the present
      study, immunogenicity was investigated in a subgroup only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female children and adolescents will be eligible for participation in this study
        if:

          -  they are aged 1 year (from the 1st birthday) to &lt; 16 years (to the last day before the
             16th birthday);

          -  they are clinically healthy, (i. e. the physician would have no reservations
             vaccinating with FSME-IMMUN NEW outside the scope of a clinical trial);

          -  their parents/legal guardians understand the nature of the study and agree to its
             provisions;

          -  written informed consent is available from both parents/legal guardians,

          -  for Germany/Austria: additional written informed consent is available for children
             older than 8 years

          -  they or their parents/legal guardians agree to keep a volunteer diary.

        For safety reasons, female volunteers who have reached sexual maturity at study start have
        to meet the following additional inclusion criteria:

        - negative pregnancy test at study entry;

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children and adolescents will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

          -  have a history of any TBE vaccination;

          -  have a history of TBE infection;

          -  have a history of allergic reactions to one of the components of the vaccine;

          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics) that can be expected to influence
             immunological functions;

          -  are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of
             the study);

          -  have received banked blood or immunoglobulins within one month of study entry;

          -  have a history of vaccination against yellow fever and/or Japanese B-encephalitis;

          -  suffer from hemorrhagic diathesis;

          -  are participating simultaneously in another clinical trial;

          -  if female: are pregnant or breastfeeding.

        Volunteers who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, but have a febrile illness (body
        temperature &gt; 38°C) at the scheduled time of vaccination, will not be vaccinated before
        their body temperature returns to normal.

        Volunteers who have received any other vaccination within 4 weeks prior to visit 1 will not
        be vaccinated until an interval of 4 weeks has passed. In this case visit 1 will take place
        separately.

        If volunteers have received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the intended TBE
        vaccination, the vaccination should be performed at a later time.

        Volunteers who have a positive TBE antibody value prior to the first vaccination will be
        excluded from the statistical analysis of the primary endpoint.
