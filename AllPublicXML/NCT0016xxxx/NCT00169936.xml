  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart transplantation is a great procedure for selected patients with end-stage heart
      failure, but graft rejection remains a major factor limiting long-term survival despite
      continued advancement in the scientific skill of immunosuppression. The only reliable method
      used today to detect rejection is doing repeated biopsy of the heart. This is expensive,
      invasive, inconvenient to the patient, and associated with a significant risk of serious
      complications, as a piece directly from the inner surface of the patients heart is needed.
      The magnetocardiograph (MCG) device is an invention that may provide new means to assess
      changes in the heart tissue, as it may detect small changes that happen in the heart cells
      when they are undergoing rejection.

      Heart transplantation is an advantageous procedure for selected patients with end-stage heart
      failure. Graft rejection remains a major factor limiting long-term survival despite continued
      advancement in the scientific skill of immunosuppression. Hyperacute rejection occurs rarely
      since screening of recipient for anti-donor antibodies was introduced. Focal or diffuse acute
      cellular rejection is diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). Coronary angiography (CA) is
      used to monitor for allograft arteriopathy, also described as chronic rejection. Repeated
      endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) remains the only surveillance method available. Endomyocardial
      biopsy is expensive, invasive, inconvenient to the patient, and associated with a significant
      incidence of serious complications. The MCG device is an invention that may provide a
      sensitive and objective means to assess alterations in the heart tissue. Because the acute
      inflammatory process of rejection deleteriously affects myocyte structure and function, we
      hypothesize that either or both the de- and re-polarization changes will occur in the cardiac
      cycle with subsequent changes in the cardiac magnetic fields and may give altered readings in
      the affected patient over time.
