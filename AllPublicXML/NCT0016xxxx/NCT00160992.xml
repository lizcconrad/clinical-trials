  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced stage melanoma who underwent vaccination with the Melan-A/MART-1
      peptide and who display detectable levels of Melan-A specific CD8+ T cells in peripheral
      blood are eligible for this trial. After collecting and freezing of these tumor specific T
      cells via apheresis, patients undergo a single cycle of immunosuppressive chemotherapy. 3
      days after, cells are reinfused and peptide vaccination continued. The aim of this
      immunotherapy protocol is to boost tumor specific T cells during the immune recovery period
      in order to reinforce the patients' immune response against the tumor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have previously been vaccinated with Melan-A/MART-1 peptide are eligible. Whole
      PBMC's containing Melan-A specific CD8+ lymphocytes are collected via lymphocytapheresis and
      freezed. Lymphodepleting chemotherapy consists of 2 days of Busulfan 2mg/kg at days -7,-6,
      followed by Fludarabine 30mg/m2 at days -5,-4,-3. At day 0, whole untreated PBMC's are
      reinfused to the patient and vaccination with Melan-A analog peptide is restarted and
      repeated every 4 weeks. Immunomonitoring with detailed FACS analysis using tetramers is
      performed at day 0,8,15,30, and then monthly. The aim is to boost Melan-A specific CD8 T
      cells in vivo during homeostatic proliferation after lymphodepletion and antigen driven
      proliferation due to peptide vaccination.
