    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess the feasibility (completion of full
      treatment) in both arms and to assess endoscopic complete response rate in both arms.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the toxicity profile of each arm using the
      National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) scale (V.3).
