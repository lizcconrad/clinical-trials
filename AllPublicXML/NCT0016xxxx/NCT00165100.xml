  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether this new method of taking pictures called
      Dynamic Area Telethermometry (DAT) might be a good way of looking at patients with cancer
      that is relatively close to the surface of the body.

      -  The DAT system resembles a video camera which picks up changes in body temperature which
           may reflect disease-related changes in blood flow to some areas, particularly those
           involved with tumors.

        -  Patients with known tumor sites amendable to DAT evaluation will be imaged at the time
           of staging and at later time points. Thermal profiles will be compared to those of
           normal adjacent tissues and correlated with the images of the tumors on conventional
           images.
