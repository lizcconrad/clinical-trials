  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children will receive comprehensive evaluations through the Children's Research Triangle
      (CRT) clinical program. The assessment for the child will be in accordance with the protocol
      developed by Astley and Clarren as performed by one of the clinic pediatricians and final
      diagnosis will be according to Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria. Children will be
      randomized into either a Treatment or Control group. The Treatment group will receive (in
      addition to standard referrals) neurocognitive habilitation and psychotherapy services as
      well as parent psychoeducation. The Control group will be referred for intervention through
      existing community and school-based agencies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurocognitive habilitation, based on the traumatic brain injury literature for teaching
      compensatory skills, will be the primary intervention. Interventions will be individually
      designed and delivered through individual therapy sessions. Audiotapes will augment the
      sessions to facilitate implementation of strategies in the home environment. Didactic therapy
      will be used to foster appropriate interactions and relationships between parent and child.
      Children will participate in 8-week group sessions that will include neurocognitive
      exercises, homework sessions, and possibly group psychotherapy. An educational specialist
      will provide school and legal advocacy services as well as observations of the child in the
      classroom that could lead to educational modifications.

      Parent Component: Family education programs and parent support groups using psychoeducational
      approaches will be the means of intervening with parent behaviors. Parents will be instructed
      on becoming advocates for their child. Groups of 8 to 12 parents will meet for one 2-hour
      session per week for 8 weeks. Each session will include:

        1. neurocognitive exercises (relaxation);

        2. specific topic discussions; and

        3. general support.

      During the last hour of the final two weeks of the program, parent and children will be
      combined to practice learned techniques. Children and parents will participate in monthly
      &quot;booster&quot; sessions.

      Evaluation Plan: Treatment and control groups will be compared using pre- and post-test
      measures. Post-tests will be at the conclusion of the intervention, as well as at 12, and
      24-month follow-ups. Process and outcome measures will be evaluated.
