  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of rhBMP-2/CPM administered to subjects presenting with closed distal
      radius fractures. The key safety variables comprising this assessment are: 1) incidence of
      delayed union; 2) median time to fracture union (assessed by the investigators); 3) incidence
      of local neurovascular events (those involving the region under study [RUS]); and 4) rate of
      fracture displacement. The primary objective will be met if these outcomes in the active and
      placebo treatment groups are at least comparable to those of the SOC control group.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults aged 50 to 80 years of age; alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

          -  Acute, closed distal radius fractures (within 4 cm of the tip of the radial styloid
             process), classified according to AO/ASIF as either A2 or A3 (extra-articular) or C1
             or C2 (intra-articular) fractures.

          -  Closed fracture reduction and definitive fracture fixation performed within 7 days
             after injury by means of external skeletal and/or percutaneous pin fixation. Note:
             fractures that are initially treated by closed reduction and casting, then converted
             to external or percutaneous pin fixation for definitive fracture fixation within 7
             days after injury are eligible for the study.

        Other inclusion applies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other fractures of the ipsilateral upper extremity (except for ulnar styloid
             fractures) or the contralateral upper extremity (except for previously healed
             fractures without residual functional deficit).

          -  Fracture fixation by other means (eg, plate and screw fixation).

          -  Planned treatment for the fracture includes any procedure to promote fracture healing
             (eg, open reduction internal fixation, bone grafting, non-invasive modalities such as
             ultrasound, electrical stimulation, etc). Note: After 12 weeks have elapsed since
             administration of the treatment assignment, unanticipated procedures to promote
             fracture healing are permitted as clinically indicated.

        Other exclusion applies.
