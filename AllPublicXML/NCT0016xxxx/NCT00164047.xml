  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nitrous oxide (N2O) in anaesthesia.

      Hypothesis In patients undergoing anaesthesia for major surgery, avoidance of N2O will reduce
      hospital length of stay when compared with otherwise identically managed surgical patients
      receiving N2O as a component of their anaesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are some compelling reasons to question the routine use of nitrous oxide (N2O), also
      known as &quot;laughing gas&quot;. Despite being the first anaesthetic drug introduced, and still
      widely used, there is sufficient doubt as to the risk-benefit profile.

      There is strong evidence that N2O is a major risk factor for postoperative nausea and
      vomiting. It is clear that (even) brief exposure to N2O impairs methionine synthetase, an
      enzyme required for DNA production, red and white blood cell formation. Tissue hypoxia may be
      more common. These adverse effects are enhanced in &quot;sick&quot; patients (ie. those at highest
      risk, increased hospital length of stay and healthcare expenditure), and will be more likely
      in longer surgery. The extent of wound infection and cardiac morbidity associated with N2O is
      not known.

      Large outcome trial data are lacking. When considering its widespread use in about 90% of all
      surgery around the world, small differences in outcome would have major implications for
      healthcare delivery. A large randomised controlled trial is necessary to answer this
      question.

      We have recruited 2000 patients from about 25 centres around the world (mostly Australasia),
      who are undergoing major surgery.
