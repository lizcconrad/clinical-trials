  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with schizophrenia are much more likely to be engaged in smoking and other addictive
      behaviors, possibly related to biochemical abnormalities in the reward center of the brain.
      The primary purpose of the present study is to investigate whether switching patients with
      schizophrenia to a new atypical antipsychotic, aripiprazole, a drug with a novel mechanism of
      action, will have an impact on smoking behavior.

      This is an 8 week open label trial being conducted in stable adult outpatients with
      schizophrenia who are smokers. The primary intervention is a switch in the subject's
      antipsychotic to aripiprazole, flexibly dosed between 15-30 mg/day. The outcome measures
      include a rating of smoking behavior using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and
      saliva cotinine obtained at baseline and endpoint. Secondary measures include weight, serum
      glucose and lipids, rating of symptom severity using the PANSS, and both ratings and
      instrumental measures of motor functioning. We anticipate enrolling up to 25 subjects to
      obtain the needed 15 completers at the week 8 endpoint.
