  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to evaluate the
      short-term safety of inhaled recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin (rAAT) in subjects with alpha
      1-antitrypsin deficiency. The subjects are randomized to receive placebo or one of 4 doses of
      rAAT. The 4 doses are tested in a consecutive manner from lowest to highest.

             metered dose inhaler [MDI]) or anticholinergic bronchodilator (eg, ipratropium
             bromide), treatment on a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to randomization

          -  If female of childbearing potential, negative urine pregnancy test within 3 days prior
             to randomization and agreement to employ adequate birth control measures
