  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the effect of a single oral dose of 250 mg SLV 317 on
      substance P-induced venodilation in the hand vein of healthy male volunteers as compared to
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, oral single dose cross-over study. 18
      healthy male volunteers will receive 250 mg SLV 317 or placebo in randomised order with a
      minimum wash-out period of one week between the two administrations.

      Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed up to 4.25 hours post-dose using the dorsal
      hand vein compliance technique. After obtaining venoconstriction via infusions of
      phenylephrine, substance P will be co-infused intermittently to induce venodilation.
      Substance P infusions will be separated by intervals of 45 minutes in order to prevent the
      well-known occurrence of tolerance.

      Venous blood sampling for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be performed up to 24 hours
      post-dose.

      Safety will be assessed by measuring ECG, pulse rate, blood pressure, haematology, blood
      chemistry, urinalysis, and by monitoring of adverse events.
