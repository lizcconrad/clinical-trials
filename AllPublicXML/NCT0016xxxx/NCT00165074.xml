  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether additional surfactant(Infasurf) doses at 7
      to 10 days of life time will improve lung function in premature infants, allowing a decrease
      in required oxygen concentration and ventilator settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary surfactant is required for normal lung function. Preliminary data from previous
      trials suggest that more than half of chronically ventilated premature infants, greater than
      1 week of age, have at least one episode of surfactant dysfunction, as measured in vitro,
      associated with a low surfactant protein B content. We propose to enroll premature infants
      less than 1250 gm birthweight, between days 5 and 21 of life who are intubated, mechanically
      ventilated, with a respiratory decompensation, defined as a severity score (mean airway
      pressure x FIO2) rising from a baseline of &lt; 1.8 to &gt; 3.5, sustained for &gt; 24 hours. Infants
      will receive two doses of Infasurf surfactant, 12-24 hours apart, at the standard dose of 3
      ml/kg. Primary outcome is the change in respiratory severity score at 72 hours post
      surfactant treatment compared to pre-treatment. Sample size is 31 infants, study duration is
      3 years, and recruitment of study patients will occur at the Hospital of the University of
      Pennsylvania, and Women and Children's Hospital of Buffalo.

          -  Intubated and mechanically ventilated, with respiratory decompensation, defined as the
