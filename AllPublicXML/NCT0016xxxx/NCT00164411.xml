  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether or not giving a tetanus/diphtheria vaccination
      (&quot;tetanus shot&quot;) before giving pneumococcal vaccine makes the pneumococcal vaccine more
      effective without causing too many side effects.

      The only vaccine licensed in the United States for protecting adults against pneumococcal
      disease (PPV23) protects against invasive disease in observational studies but has generally
      been poorly effective against pneumonia or all-cause mortality in randomized clinical trials.
      Another vaccine containing seven polysaccharide antigens conjugated to diphtheria toxoid
      (PCV7) is licensed for children and under investigation in adults.

      In this pilot study, we are comparing the safety and immunogenicity of three immunization
      schedules in adults:

        -  Td vaccine, 2-week interval, PCV7, 4-month interval, PPV23

        -  PCV7, 4-month interval, PPV23

        -  PPV23

      We aim to:

        -  compare the safety profiles of pneumococcal vaccines given on each of the three
           schedules

        -  compare serotype-specific ELISA antibody response to pneumococcal antigens given on each
           of the three schedules

        -  compare functional serotype-specific antibody responses to pneumococcal antigens given
           on each of the three schedules

        -  study the influence of diphtheria antibody levels at the time of pneumococcal conjugate
           vaccine administration on the magnitude of the immune response to pneumococcal antigens
