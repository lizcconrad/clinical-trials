  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with polyneuropathy suffer from pain which is difficult to treat. Escitalopram is
      a relatively new drug used in the treatment of depression. Escitalopram’s action mechanism on
      the brain suggests that escitalopram also may have an effect on neuropathic pain. This study
      will test the efficacy of escitalopram in patients with painful polyneuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tricyclic antidepressants appear to be the most efficacious treatment of painful
      polyneuropathy. However, these drugs are contraindicated in some patients and a substantial
      number of patients decline treatment due to side-effects. Therefore, effective drugs that are
      better tolerated are needed. Clinical and basic research has demonstrated that drugs with
      serotonergic action can alleviate neuropathic pain. Escitalopram increases serotonin
      concentration in the central nervous system, suggesting that it might be a potential
      alternative to current treatments of neuropathic pain. The aim of this study is to test if
      escitalopram would relieve painful polyneuropathy.

      Comparisons: Treatment with 20 mg escitalopram daily will be compared in a cross-over design
      with placebo. Each treatment period will last 6 weeks. During the last week of each treatment
      period, the dose will be tapered.
