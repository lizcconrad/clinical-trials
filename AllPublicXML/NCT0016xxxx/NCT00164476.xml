  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Project SHIELD (Strategies and health Interventions to Enhance Life with Disability) is a
      participatory action research project to test an intervention package combining a resource
      kit with peer mentoring in improving consumer education about primary preventive services
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adults with disabilities use primary preventive health care services (basic screenings,
      immunizations, and hevior health counseling) at rates below those recommended by the US
      Preventive Services Task Force and Healthy People 2010. This projects is to carry out a
      community-based campaign to increase preventive care knowledge and service use among adults
      with physical disabilities. Focus group methodology will be used to determine the specific
      preventive service priorities of the disability community so that targeted resource materials
      for consumers and physicians can be developed. Second, a randomized control group experiment
      will be implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the targeted resource materials,
      followed by dissemination of the Preventive Services Resource Kits.
