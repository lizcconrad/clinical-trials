    <textblock>
      Subretinal hemorrhage in the macula causes a significant loss of vision. This hemorrhage can
      be displaced by the use of a small volume of pure perfluorocarbon gas injected into the
      vitreous, which expands to a 40% gas bubble in the eye. When the patient gazes 40 to 60
      degree below the horizontal, the gas bubble covers the hemorrhage and gravity displaces it
      rapidly. This position of gaze is easier for the patient than the face down position
      traditionally recommended.A vector of gravity force tangential to the sclera brings about
      this displacement. The procedure can improve vision quickly, reduce unwanted degenerative
      changes in the macula because of the persistent macular hemorrhage and improves the chances
      of treating of the underlying cause for the subretinal hemorrhage by laser or other means.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol was designed to determine the optimum position of the gaze for pneumatic
      displacement of subretinal hemorrhage (SRH) in the macula. A geometrical analysis of the
      forces that act upon a SRH in the presence of an intraocular gas bubble was analyzed and it
      was concluded that the displacement was due to the effect of gravity on the SRH immersed in
      gas. This was followed by a prospective trial of positions of gaze and volumes of gas
      calculated to be optimum for displacement. The eyes of consecutive patients with SRH in the
      macula will had an intravitreal injection of pure perfluorocarbon gas sufficient to provide a
      40% bubble after expansion. The patients are instructed to gaze down 40째 or 60째 below the
      horizontal depending on the volume of gas for 20 minutes every hour. The SRH is displaced
      rapidly in the first week. Visual acuity usually improves but recovery can be limited by the
      presence of sub pigment epithelial hemorrhage, exudate or proliferation. A vector of the
      gravity force tangential to the sclera is the largest force acting to displace a subretinal
      hemorrhage within a gas bubble. 79% of the vertical gravity component is obtained at gaze 40째
      below the horizontal and requires volumes of intraocular gas not requiring prior removal of
      vitreous. Face down positioning in common practice has been an error and succeeds only if the
      patient has been non compliant.

    <intervention_name>Pneumatic displacement</intervention_name>
    <description>Pneumatic displacement of the subretinal hemorrhages is attempted with an intravitreous injection of 0.4 ml of pure C2F6 or 2 injections of 0.2 ml on subsequent days. The gas is withdrawn from a laboratory cylinder through a millipore filter and injected into the eye through a 30 gauge needle inserted 4.0 mm posterior to the limbus in the superior temporal quadrant. The tip of the needle is monitored in the vitreous by indirect ophthalmology prior to injecting the gas.Post injections the central retinal artery is examined whether is patent.The intraocular gas expands 3.3 times over the next 3 days to create a 40% bubble.The patient is asked to assume a gaze position 40째 below the horizontal for 20 minutes every hour while awake and to sleep on 2 pillows with his head turned to the right.</description>
