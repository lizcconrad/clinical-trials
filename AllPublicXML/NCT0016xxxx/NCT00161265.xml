      This study is being performed so that tumor and blood samples from patients who will receive
      breast cancer treatment prior to surgery can be collected and stored for future research.

      This protocol will provide a systematic approach to obtaining, cataloging, and distributing
      research tissue and blood from patients who will receive neoadjuvant systemic therapy for
      localized breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have a primary measurable invasive breast cancer with the primary
             tumor intact (T1, 2, 3, or 4, any N, M0 or M1). Recurrent disease in the breast is
             also eligible.

          2. The patient's clinical plan will include neoadjuvant systemic therapy (chemotherapy,
             hormonal therapy, biologic therapy), prior to surgery on the breast.

          3. The clinical plan for patients with recurrent or M1 disease must include breast
             surgery after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. This would include patients with non-bulky
             M1 disease who the treating physicians feel would benefit from local control of
             disease after neoadjuvant systemic therapy.

          4. Patients must have had mammography performed at the University of Michigan, OR outside
             film review prior to enrollment.

          5. All patients are required to sign an informed consent regarding the experimental
             purpose of the research biopsies and serum banking, in accordance with the University
             of Michigan Institutional Review Board standards.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Breast tumors that are not measurable by any of the modalities, including physical
             examination, mammography, or ultrasound.

          2. Tumors diagnosed by excisional biopsy, or incisional biopsy that does not leave
             measurable disease by physical examination, mammography, or ultrasound.

          3. Patients must not have received any prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation
             therapy for their current breast cancer. Patients who received tamoxifen or other
             agents for prevention of breast cancer may be included.

          4. Patients with another active systemic malignancy in the past year.
