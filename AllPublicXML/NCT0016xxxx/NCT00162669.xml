  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is the fifth most common malignant disorder,
      with an increasing incidence in Europe and the USA as a result of the high prevalence of
      hepatitis C. Most patients are not suitable for potentially curative treatment. There is no
      standard palliative treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as
      no drug has been demonstrated to be efficient in this disease in terms of survival. The use
      of anti-vascular agents might be a promising approach in view of the highly vascular nature
      of this tumor. The aim of this phase II trial is to evaluate the potential benefit of
      bevacizumab in terms of disease control rate, progression-free and overall survival in adult
      patients with advanced primary liver cancer. Bevacizumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor already
      successfully used in patients with colorectal and renal cancers.
