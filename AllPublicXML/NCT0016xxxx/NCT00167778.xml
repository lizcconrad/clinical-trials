  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The biomechanics of changing direction while walking has been largely neglected despite its
      relevancy to functional mobility. In addition, an increased risk of injury can be associated
      with turning due to a decrease in stability. The objective of this study is to understand the
      biomechanics of turning gait in sample populations of intact and trans-tibial amputees and
      the capacity of prosthetic components to facilitate transverse plane movement. The clinical
      impact of this investigation is the development of interventions that increase functional
      mobility, stability and safety while turning.

      The researchers propose to investigate three sets of hypotheses. The first set addresses the
      fundamental biomechanical mechanisms associated with walking along a circular trajectory, how
      intact subjects differ from amputees, and the effect of a rotation adaptor pylon. The second
      set of hypotheses addresses dynamic stability and the potential influence of prosthetic
      interventions. The third set of hypotheses addresses how the rotational properties of the
      prosthetic pylon can influence comfort and mobility during daily activities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most of what is known about how amputees walk and how the properties of prosthetic components
      affect their gait has been discovered through sagittal plane observations while amputees walk
      back and forth along a straight line. Abnormal limb loading, thought to be a principal factor
      in the occurrence of residual limb pain which in turn may cause instability and limit
      mobility, can certainly occur while walking in a straight line. However, the incidence of
      abnormal limb loading is likely amplified when performing more complex gait activities, such
      as turning or avoiding obstacles; activities that are so very common in everyday life.

      The specific aims of this investigation are to:

        1. discover the biomechanical strategies used and the stability of both intact individuals
           and trans-tibial amputees walking along a circular trajectory and

        2. explore the effects of a prosthetic intervention on turning biomechanics, stability,
           comfort, and mobility.

      We propose to investigate three sets of hypotheses:

      The first set of hypotheses addresses the fundamental biomechanical mechanisms associated
      with walking along a circular trajectory, how intact subjects differ from amputees, and the
      effect of a rotation adaptor pylon. We will conduct experiments to test three hypotheses
      related to achieving a change of heading, orientation, and balancing of centripetal forces
      necessary to walk along a circular trajectory.

      The second set of hypotheses seeks to identify whether trans-tibial amputees with a rigid
      pylon are more unstable during a turning task than non-amputees and whether or not the
      rotation adaptors enhance stability. We will conduct experiments to calculate an index of
      dynamic stability that measures the rate at which a person can respond to a perturbation and
      return to a stable gait pattern.

      The third set of hypotheses addresses how the rotational properties of the prosthetic pylon
      can influence comfort and mobility during daily activities. To measure comfort and mobility,
      we will solicit questionnaire responses and step count measures from amputees after a
      one-month period of wearing a rigid pylon and after a one-month period of wearing a
      transverse plane rotation adaptor (within-subject comparison). In addition to these field
      measurements, we will also compare the distance traveled during a six-minute walk. Patient
      opinions about their prosthesis and mobility measures over long periods of time can play a
      significant role in prosthesis evaluation.

      For veteran amputees who experience discomfort and increased risk for residual limb skin
      problems, it seems reasonable to suppose that these problems might occur when walking along a
      curved trajectory rather than just a straight line. The joint forces and moments of turning
      may differ significantly from those exhibited while walking in a straight line. The proposed
      research will create a new knowledge base with which to understand prosthetic intervention
      effectiveness. The immediate clinical impact for the trans-tibial amputee is the
      determination if transverse plane rotational adapter pylons can improve their comfort,
      mobility, and stability.

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment for this study was conducted at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System (Seattle VA hospital). Recruitment began on May 18, 2006. The study was closed to enrollment on April 24, 2008.
Data was not collected on the order in which participants received each study intervention.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The prostheses used in this study were built and aligned by a certified and licensed prosthetist prior to beginning starting the protocol. 12 individuals provided informed consent. 1 withdrew prior to starting for personal reasons. 1 withdrew due to unrelated back pain after being fit with both study prostheses and starting with the rigid pylon.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>This is a randomized cross-over study. Each participant wore both study prostheses: (1) a rigid pylon and (2) a transverse plane torsion adapter. The torsion adapter was initially set according to the manufacturer's recommendations based on body mass and activity level. After one week of acclimation, additional stiffness adjustments were made based on participant feedback. This process continued until the perceived stiffness was optimized. All participants were able to find a comfortable fit either on the first or second visit. Subjects were then randomized, provided with one of two study prostheses, and asked to wear it for 3 weeks. Data was then collected during lab visit 1, and following 1 more week, additional data was collected during lab visit 2. Subjects were then provided with the second study prosthesis and asked to wear it for 3 weeks. Data was then collected during lab visit 3, and following 1 more week, additional data was collected during lab visit 4.</description>

          <description>Maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents were used to estimate the local dynamic stability of the amputee’s sagittal plane hip, knee and ankle angles for their prosthetic limb with and without the torsion adapter while walking straight, while turning with the prosthesis on the inside of the turn, and while turning with the prosthesis on the outside of the turn. Maximum finite-time Lyapunov exponents measure the rate of kinematic separation of a gait cycle trajectory perturbed by naturally occurring disturbances and neuromuscular control errors. A positive exponent indicates divergence of a system, with increasing values indicating a les stable system.</description>
