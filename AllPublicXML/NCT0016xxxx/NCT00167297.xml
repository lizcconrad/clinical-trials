      The purpose of this small open-label trial is to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting
      cannabis dependent patients for treatment with Atomoxetine and MIT. The clinical data to date
      on Atomoxetine has been limited to children and adults with attention deficit disorder
      without co-morbid substance dependence. However, one study estimated that adults with
      attention deficit disorder have rates of drug abuse three to four times higher than controls
      (Mannuzza S 1998). The study also reported that cannabis and cocaine are most frequently
      abused in this population.

      This is a Phase 2 open-label study. We will recruit 10 cannabis dependent subjects and treat
      them with the combination of Atomoxetine and MIT to reduce their consumption of cannabis.
      Subjects will be 10 men and women with current DSM-IV diagnosis of cannabis dependence. All
      patients will receive Atomoxetine and four sessions of MIT. The study length for each patient
      will be one week for baseline screening and starting medication. This is followed by 8 weeks
      of medication and an end of study visit one week after completing medications.

      The PI will review all information collected regarding the subject's eligibility for the
      study. The subject will return approximately four days later, and if the PI finds the subject
      suitable for the study, the subject will begin taking study medication. This visit is
      referred to as visit 2. During visit 2, the PI will monitor the subject for concomitant
      medications and adverse events. The research technician will collect Vital Signs, Weight,
      BAL, the TLFB, a Urine Tox Screen and THC/CR ratio. Both visits 1 and 2 will be conducted
      within the first week of the study. Starting at visit 2, subjects will take one 25mg capsule
      of Atomoxetine orally for seven days. Beginning at visit 3, subjects will increase the dose
      to 40mg per day for 3 days, followed by 80mg (two 40mg capsules concurrently) for the other
      four days of the second week. Beginning with week 3, subjects will take two 40mg capsules
      (80mg total) every day of the week for 6 weeks.
