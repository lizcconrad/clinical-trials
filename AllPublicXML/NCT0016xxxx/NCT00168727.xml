  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a treatment regimen
      using Zevalin® plus Rituxan® for patients who have low grade Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) or
      relapsed Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and have been previously treated. This study will use an
      experimental scheduling regimen. No chemotherapy will be used in this study.

      The objective of this study is to determine overall response rate, event-free survival,
      time-to-progression, time-to-next-therapy, and freedom-from-relapse in patients with
      low-grade lymphoma in first or second relapse treated with Zevalin followed by 2 years of
      Rituxan maintenance therapy in a multicenter, community-based setting, as well as evaluate
      relative response rates in populations with and without prior rituximab therapy, in first
      versus second relapse, and with and without bulky (&gt; 5 cm in greatest diameter) disease.

      To meet the initial trial enrollment goal of 300 patients over two years, 42 total sites were
      activated. The study has subsequently closed to accrual. Currently 8 sites remain active to
      follow the 12 subjects enrolled in the past year.
