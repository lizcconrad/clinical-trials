  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to develop and test the efficacy of a community-based
      self-management intervention for reducing pain, depression, and improving self-efficacy and
      function in person with limb loss

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1.2 million Americans are living with the loss of a limb and the incidence is
      increasing due to increases in the prevalence of diabetes. Pain, emotional distress, reduced
      functional abilities are common conditions following limb loss and reduce quality of life.
      Self-management interventions have been found to be effective in reducing the secondary
      conditions associated with arthritis and diabetes. Self management uses the principles of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy including education, self monitoring, problem solving, and skill
      acquisition.

      The goal of the project is to develop and test the efficacy of a community based self
      management intervention for reducing pain, depression, and improving self efficacy and
      function in persons with limb loss using a randomized controlled design.

      50 groups of 8-10 persons will be randomized to either a control group or a treatment group.
