    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are: (1) to investigate the incidence and causes of falls of
      stroke patients residing in Taipei City and Taipei county after their discharge from the
      National Taiwan University Hospital, (2) to investigate the relationship between clinical
      manifestations of stroke patients before their hospital discharge and their incidence of
      falls after hospital discharge, and (3) to identify the risk factors for stroke patients who
      frequently fall after hospital discharge.

      Falls are one of the most common accidents among stroke patients. Stroke patients are more
      prone to falls than community-dwelling older adults because of their cumulative risk factors
      of falls such as cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction. Recent studies on falls in
      Taiwan have primarily focused on falls of community-dwelling older adults. Research focused
      on falls among stroke patients in Taiwan, however, is scarce. Studies reported by researchers
      in other countries have only investigated the incidence and causes of falls of patients
      staying in medical institutions up to three months post-stroke. Therefore, the incidence and
      immediate causes of falls remain unknown for post-hospital discharge stroke patients during
      their sub-acute and chronic stages. In addition, whether falls of stroke patients after
      hospital discharge could be predicted by their clinical manifestations during hospital stay
      also requires further investigation.
