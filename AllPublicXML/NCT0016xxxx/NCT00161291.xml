      The purpose of this study is to determine pathological response to a maximum of 18 weeks of
      neoadjuvant therapy using a combination of letrozole and Bevacizumab in post-menopausal women
      with pathologically confirmed invasive ductal cancer or invasive lobular cancer of the breast
      whose tumors are hormone positive.

      This is an open label, single arm, and Phase II study of the combination of Letrozole and
      Bevacizumab in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer. Patients meeting the eligibility
      criteria and who have signed the consent form will start Letrozole 2.5 mg by mouth a day and
      Bevacizumab 15 mg per Kg IV every 3 weeks for 18 weeks (24 weeks if still responding at week
      18 if approved by the PI). After neoadjuvant therapy, participants will undergo surgical
      treatment and will receive adjuvant therapy according to the treating physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma or invasive lobular carcinoma of
             the breast, T2-T4 / T4a-c / N0-2 / M0, with positive estrogen and/or progesterone
             receptors. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer will not be included (Stage IIIb).
             Patients previously treated patients with no measurable disease or patients with
             metastatic disease will be excluded.

          -  Written informed consent prior to study specific screening procedures, with the
             understanding that the patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time,
             without prejudice (see Appendix B - consent form).
