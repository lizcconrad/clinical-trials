  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify whether wines which are produced using the common
      potential food allergens such as proteins derived from fish, milk or egg are likely to
      contain sufficient food allergens to cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent international legislation requires labelling of wines made using potentially
      allergenic food proteins &quot;casein&quot;, egg white, isinglass ( fish derived), milk or evaporated
      milk where &quot;there is detectable residual processing aid&quot;. However it is not clear whether the
      final wine contains concentrations of residual added food proteins that can provoke allergic
      reactions.

      Comparison:This study is a double blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether adults
      known to be allergic to eggs, fish, milk and/or nuts exhibit allergic reactions following
      consumption of Australian commercial wines fined with food allergens.
