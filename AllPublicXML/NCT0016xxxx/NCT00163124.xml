  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a variety of treatment approaches used by the chiropractic profession. Some of
      these require forceful joint manipulation and some do not. This study is designed to compare
      outcomes of two such techniques that are common to chiropractic practice. The hypothesis is
      that there is no difference between forceful and non-forceful approaches to treatment.

      The comparison will permit a one month treatment period for both techniques and a three week
      follow-up. Patients will be assessed at baseline (intake), and at specified intervals and at
      three weeks following the termination of care.
