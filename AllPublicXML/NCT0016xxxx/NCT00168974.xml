  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder. The mutations result in a
      deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase causing accumulation of glycosphingolipids
      in the vascular endothelial cells and many other tissues. An early sign of the disease is
      painful small fibre neuropathy presenting in two forms: 1. a constant burning sensation in
      the hand and feet and 2. Fabry crises consisting of attacks of excruciating pain. Given the
      X-linked inheritance, male patients are severely affected. Recently attention has been drawn
      to female patients whether they also show signs of nerve involvement.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the small fibre neuropathy in female Fabry patients.
      Correlation with X-chromosome inactivation will be attempted. Recombinant human
      α-galactosidase A is now available for patients. A part of this study is evaluation the long
      term efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy in female patients with Fabry disease and
      neuropathy.

      Male family members with Fabry disease will be examined.
