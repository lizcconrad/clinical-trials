  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of taxotere, cisplatin and irinotecan (CPT-11) used in combination
      to treat metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer in an effort to see what effects (good and
      bad) the combination may have on the patients cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Taxotere, cisplatin and irinotecan will be administered to the patient once weekly for 2
           weeks followed by a one week rest period (1 cycle is 3 weeks).

        -  Patients will also receive corticosteroids, intravenous hydration and anti-emetic
           therapy prior to each treatment.

        -  A physical exam and bloodwork will be done each week of the treatment and every 2
           cycles, reassessment of the tumor by the same imaging method to determine the baseline
           size will be conducted.

        -  Patients will remain on the study unless disease progression or intolerable toxicity
           occur.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, incurable esophageal or gastric carcinoma (carcinoma =
             adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma)

          -  Measurable disease &gt; 1cm (longest diameter) by spiral CT scan or &gt; 2cm by other
             radiographic technique.

          -  Lesions must be measurable in at least one dimension.

          -  Bone lesions, ascites and effusions are not measurable.

          -  Irradiated lesions are not measurable yet lesions arising in previously irradiated
             fields are measurable.

          -  Age 18+ years.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks.

          -  Adequate bone marrow function.

          -  Adequate renal function: creatinine equal to or less than 1.5 mg/dl.

          -  SGOT less than 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal if alkaline phosphatase is
             within institutional upper limit of normal.

          -  Alkaline phosphatase less than 4.0 x upper limit of normal if SGOT is within
             institutional upper limit of normal.

          -  For patients with both SGOT and alkaline phosphatase elevations, SGOT must be less
             than 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal and alkaline phosphatase must be less
             2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal. For patients with liver metastases,
             however, SGOT may be &lt; 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal and alkaline
             phosphatase may be &lt; 5.0 x institutional upper limit of normal as long as the total
             bilirubin is within the institutional upper limit of normal.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior chemotherapy (except as part of pre- or post-operative therapy, completed &gt; 1
             year prior to start date of this protocol).

          -  Patients who have received prior pelvic radiation therapy are ineligible. Other prior
             radiation therapy, however, is permitted, provided at least 4 weeks have elapsed since
             completion of this therapy and the initiation of this protocol.

          -  No myocardial infarction in the past six months.

          -  No major surgery in the past three weeks.

          -  No uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness.

          -  No uncontrolled diarrhea.

          -  Patients with a peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 will be excluded.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test. Men and women of
             childbearing potential must use adequate contraception.

          -  No clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis.

          -  No other active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer or in-situ cervical
             carcinoma. A resected cancer (other than in-situ carcinoma) must have demonstrated no
             evidence of recurrence for at least 3 years.

          -  Patients with history of severe hypersensitivity to irinotecan, cisplatin, taxotere or
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80 must be excluded.
