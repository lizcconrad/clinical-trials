      The purpose of this study is to determine if a difference exists in the inflammatory response
      which occurs related to coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)surgery performed on
      cardiopulmonary bypass as compared to CABG surgery performed off bypass at the University of
      Pittsburgh Medical Center.

    <textblock>
      Acute inflammatory response occurring in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) patients has been
      clearly associated with deleterious clinical outcomes. Increasing understanding of the
      pathophysiology of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) following CPB has
      facilitated the development of strategies to attenuate the damaging effects of
      cytokine-induced inflammation. For any strategy to be tested, one needs to clearly define and
      understand the inflammatory response occurring with CPB. Although this has been extensively
      studied, there is wide variation in the reported time course and magnitude of this response.
      This variation is, in part, due to the heterogeneous nature of the patient population studied
      (variable severity of illnesses, ejection fractions, co-morbidities, etc.). Hence, in our
      study, we propose to study the inflammatory response occurring in patients undergoing
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) with and without the use of CPB in our institution, and
      to determine whether the severity of inflammatory response seen in CABG patients is
      associated with impairment of any specific clinical parameter in the immediate post-operative
      period (i.e., ventricular dysfunction, lung injury, bleeding, renal failure, etc).
