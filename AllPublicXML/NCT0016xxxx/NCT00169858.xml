  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B immunization has been offered to all grade 4 students (age 9-10) in the province
      of Quebec, using Engerix-B at a dose of 10 mkg. The peak incidence of hepatitis B occurs
      between age 15 and 35; the proportion of vaccinated children who will still be protected at
      this age is currently unknown. This study is designed to determine:

        -  persistence of immunity until age 25

        -  persistence of immunological memory as demonstrated by an anamnestic response following
           a booster dose

        -  the effect of a booster dose on immunogenicity at either 5, 10 or 15 years after the
           primary vaccination course (at age (15, 20 or 25).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three doses of Engerix-B vaccine (10 mkg) were administered according to 0, 1, 6 month
      schedule to 1126 9-10 year-old children.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the persistence of antibodies to Engerix-B
      in all subjects at age 25 and to compare the levels obtained in those given a booster
      injection at age 15 or 20 with those receiving no booster injection.

      Secondary objectives

        -  To determine the antibody levels obtained following primary vaccination and the
           proportion of children who seroconvert

        -  To determine the antibody levels of one third of subjects at age 15, 5 years after
           primary vaccination (Group A)

        -  To determine the effect on antibody levels of a booster injection at age 15 years given
           to one third of the subjects (Group A)

        -  To determine the antibody levels of subjects in groups A and B at age 20, 5 years after
           booster (Group A), 10 years after primary vaccination (Group B)

        -  To determine the effect on antibody levels of a booster injection at age 20 years given
           to one third of the subjects (Group B)

        -  To determine the effect on antibody levels of a booster injection at age 25 years given
           to one third of the subjects (Group C)

        -  To determine the antibody levels of subjects in Group A and Group B one year after their
           5 or 10 year booster

        -  To evaluate safety

          -  Previously completed the 1995 to 1996 Hepatitis B vaccination program vaccinations
             (Primary study) to the best of his/her knowledge and already enrolled and followed in
             the long term study

          -  Must be HBc negative

          -  Required standard interval between last dose of primary immunization and booster
             vaccination

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study

          -  Previously completed routine childhood vaccination to the best of his/her knowledge

          -  If the subject is female, and the potential of pregnancy exists, it must be asked
             prior to immunization by the study nurse. According to the protocol d'immunisation du
             Québec, Engerix-B is not contra-indicated during pregnancy. However, if a participant
             thinks she could be pregnant (sexually active and no oral contraception or intra
             uterine device), a pregnancy test will be carried out. In case of pregnancy, the
             booster vaccination will be performed after delivery.
