      The purpose of this study is to target lesions of the prostate in the bone and to biopsy
      these lesions using MRI to identify the areas.

      -  This study involves a one-time, MRI-guided bone marrow biopsy. Prior to this procedure,
           patients will need to have a bone scan performed within the last three months and a PSA
           blood test drawn within one month of registration to the study.

        -  Patients are also required to participate in the DFCI research study &quot;Collection of
           Specimens and Clinical Data for Patients with Prostate Cancer or at High Risk for
           Prostate Cancer&quot;.
