      The purpose of this study is to collect longitudinal data on outcomes of neuraxial or
      neurolytic procedures in patients with intractable cancer and chronic noncancer pain so that
      we may contribute to the growing evidence for or against these therapies and to provide data
      for ongoing quality improvement activities.

        This is a prospective case series analysis. Subjects over the age of 18 who are offered
        neuraxial (epidural or intrathecal) analgesia or neurolytic procedures (e.g. celiac,
        hypogastric, or sacral nerve plexus block) to treat intractable pain through the UW
        Interventional Pain Program.
