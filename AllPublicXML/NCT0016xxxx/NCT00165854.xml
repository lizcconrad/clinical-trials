    <textblock>
      Part 1: The primary purpose is to determine the recommended dose of E7070 in combination with
      capecitabine by dose adjustment. Part 2: The primary purpose is to determine the safety and
      efficacy of the combination in patients with metastatic CRC resistant to 5-fluorouracil and
      irinotecan.

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study

        Part 1 Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than two previous courses of documented myelosuppresive chemotherapy (epidermal
             growth factor targeted therapy does not constitute a course of chemotherapy)

          -  CNS metastases (a CT or MRI scan should be done if there is a clinical suspicion of
             CNS metastases)

          -  Major surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy (except palliative) within 4 weeks of
             treatment start

          -  Previous investigational cytotoxic treatment for malignant disease within 30 days
             before the start of the study

          -  Any treatment with non-oncological investigational drugs within 30 days before the
             start of the study

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding (all women of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy
             test before inclusion in the study; post-menopausal women must be amenorrhoeic for at
             least 12 months). Female patients must use adequate contraceptive protection.

          -  Fertile males not willing to use contraception or whose female partners are not using
             adequate contraceptive protection

          -  Uncontrolled infections

          -  Prior severe or unexpected reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy (which may be
             explained by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency or hypersensitivity to 5-FU)

          -  Malabsorption syndrome or other condition which may affect absorption of drug

          -  Concurrent or previous malignancy of a different tumour type within five years of
