  <brief_summary>

      A questionnaire composed of items addressing psychological, emotional and social aspects of
      GERD is developed for Chinese population. We plan to conduct a validation study on this novel
      disease-specific quality of life (QoL) instrument. This study aims to evaluate various
      indicators of validity and reliability, which include criterion validity, test-retest
      reliability, responsiveness, internal consistency reliability and discriminant validity.

      After initial pilot testing of face validity and content validity, two hundred GERD patients
      from the gastroenterology and ulcer clinics of cluster NTE hospitals will be invited to
      complete a revised 18-item version of GERD-QOL questionnaire. The data from GERD QOL will be
      evaluated using exploratory factor analysis to identify appropriate items and domains and the
      internal consistency of the domains will be determined and further refinement of
      questionnaire will follow.

      100 GERD patients will complete GERD-QOL, SF-36 health survey and the visual analog scale
      (VAS) questionnaire for criterion validation. 100 GERD patients with stable symptom profile
      will repeat GERD QOL two weeks after the first administration for evaluation of test-retest
      reliability.

      Another 26 patients who are receiving maintenance acid suppressive therapy and in remission
      of symptom will be recruited as controls for comparison with active reflux patients. The
      ability to distinguish active patients from controls in remission is known as discriminant
      validity.

        Inclusion Criteria:
