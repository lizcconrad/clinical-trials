      The present protocol is an attempt to prevent/treat mucositis in highly susceptible patients
      subjected to maximally tolerated doses of subsequently-myeloablative or myeloablative doses
      of chemoradiotherapy supported by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the
      Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation. Mucositis is a major problem in the management of
      transplant recipients which subjects the patients to the risk of sepsis, need for parenteral
      nutrition and need of narcotics. We are planning a 2 arm study, comparing 2 safe vitamin E
      based formulations with placebo.
