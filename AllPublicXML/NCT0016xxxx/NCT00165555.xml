      The purpose of this study it to determine the safety and maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of
      cisplatin administered in the operating room and put into the chest and abdomen for one hour.
      We are also looking at the effects of heating the chemotherapy to a temperature of 42 degrees
      celsius.

      -  Patients will undergo surgery with pleurectomy/decortication which entails the removal
           of the inner and outer skin of the lung, including the pleura overlying the pericardium
           and diaphragm. Resection of the pericardium and diaphragm are occasionally necessary to
           debulk the tumor. This surgery is part of standard care for pleural mesothelioma.

        -  After surgery, a one hour lavage with heated cisplatin will be administered to the
           hemithorax (and abdominal regions if the diaphragm is no longer present). The lung
           itself is not removed, only the diseased portion of the lung and surrounding areas with
           tumor.

        -  Immediately following the one-hour lavage, a six hour infusion of sodium thiosulfate
           will begin to help reduce the side effects of the cisplatin.

        -  Patients will remain hospitalized until they have recovered from surgery (usually 7-14
           days).

        -  Patients will return to the hospital three months after their surgery to have fluid
           drawn from their chest via an ultrasound guided thoracentesis. This is called a saline
           wash.

        -  Patients will be in the study actively for three months. This includes a 2-week and
           4-week post-operative follow-up in which blood work is performed. As well as a 3-month
           follow-up for the saline wash. Long-term follow-up includes computed tomography of the
           chest and abdomen every 6 months to assess recurrence.
