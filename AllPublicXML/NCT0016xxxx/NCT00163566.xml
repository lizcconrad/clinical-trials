  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether DHT-Gel, when applied daily to the skin, can
      relieve the symptoms of low testosterone in men aged 55-80. These symptoms include reduced
      muscle strength, increase fat mass, low libido, feeling blue or moody

      Background - In the context of hypogonadism, androgen supplementation is clearly beneficial,
      particularly in younger males. The benefits of therapy in men with milder degrees of
      hypogonadism, and elderly males with testosterone deficiency, are less clear-cut. Several
      options are available for androgen replacement in adult men. Oral testosterone, intramuscular
      injections, subcutaneous implants and transdermal therapy have all been used. Each mode of
      delivery has advantages and drawbacks. Several alkylated derivatives of T are available for
      oral or sublingual use, including methyl testosterone and fluoxymesterone. However, they are
      not recommended for use as replacement therapy because of their associated adverse effects.

      Study Design - This is a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group,
      randomized study of DHT-Gel versus placebo gel in male subjects ages 55-80 years inclusive
      with low serum testosterone and symptoms compatible with the clinical diagnosis of
      hypogonadism. Total enrollment for this study will be approximately 120 subjects (40 subjects
      for each treatment group). Subjects will be treated with 35 mg/day DHT, 70 mg/day DHT, or
      placebo gel for 6 months. All subjects will apply the gel once daily. Up to 9 months of study
      participation, including up to 2 months of screening and a 1-month follow-up period, will be
      required by the protocol.

      The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is change in body composition as determined by
      DEXA scan. Secondary endpoints in this study include change in sexual libido, and overall
      function and mood, and normalization of serum androgen levels. A subset of sites will perform
      strength assessments, which will include handgrip dynamometry, and upper and lower body
      strength tests.
