      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of selective COX-II inhibitor in
      patients with curative resection performed for locally advanced stomach cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) is a family of enzymes regulating the conversion of arachidonic acid to
      prostaglandins. COX-II is an inducible enzyme, which may be upregulated when there are
      stimuli such as inflammation or hypergastrinaemia. Despite radical surgery, patients with
      stomach cancer of advanced stages often have a poor prognosis. Reported survival in those
      with diseases of stage IIIa or above is less than 40%. Methods to improve patients outcome
      have been explored for decades with little success. In the light of current understanding on
      the relation between COX-II and stomach cancer, selective COX-II inhibitor may be used as a
      novel adjuvant therapy after gastrectomy to prevent recurrence of gastric carcinoma. The
      advantages of COX-II inhibitors are being relatively non-toxic with minimal side effect.
