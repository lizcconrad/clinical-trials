  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the balance strategy, as well as center of pressure
      (COP) trajectory and parameters between healthy adults and patients with hemiplegia in
      response to slow- and fast-speed waist- pulling perturbations in forward, left, right, and
      backward directions.

      The ability to quickly respond to external perturbations is an important capacity of stroke
      patients to maintain dynamic balance in activities of daily living. The purpose of this study
      was to compare the balance strategy, as well as center of pressure (COP) trajectory and
      parameters between healthy adults and patients with hemiplegia in response to slow- and
      fast-speed waist- pulling perturbations in forward, left, right, and backward directions.
