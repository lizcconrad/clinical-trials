  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FENOC is a prospective, open-label, randomized, cross-over, multi-center study to investigate
      and compare the hemostatic effect and cost-efficacy of two different by-passing agents in the
      treatment of joint hemorrhages in subjects with severe hemophilia A and inhibitors. The study
      is designed as a clinical equivalency trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of inhibitors among people with severe hemophilia A has been documented as
      approximately 20-30% in several prospective studies. In such patients acute hemorrhages
      frequently occur and profoundly jeopardize health, with subsequent development of
      arthropathy. A common way of treating such bleeding episodes is to use bypassing agents.
      Among these agents the prothrombin complex concentrate FEIBA has been widely used for many
      years. More recently, recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven) has been added to the therapeutic
      options. While both products have been found effective in treating hemorrhages, the number of
      injections given for a bleeding episode has ranged widely, and it is so far unknown whether
      one of the products might have a better effect in certain patients.
