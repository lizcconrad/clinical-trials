  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Below-Study is a randomized, prospective mono-centre trial on the efficacy and safety the
      adjunctive use of a GP IIb/IIIa antagonist for prevention of early reocclusion in arterial
      below-the knee interventions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PTA below the knee is limited due to subacute reocclusions and uncertain long-term results.
      This study is designed as a feasibility trial, which compares the two new treatment
      modalities: drug eluting stents and GP IIb/IIIa blockade.

      Patients with current ulcers (Rutherford 5, or 6) are randomly assigned to one of the
      treatment groups: [1] ReoPro + Sirolimus coated stent, [2] ReoPro + bare Stent, [3] ReoPro +
      PTA, [4] PTA without ReoPro. Angiographic control will be at 2 and 6 months with block wise
      randomisation to the treatment groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of peripheral artery disease with below the knee artery
             occlusion, or stenosis which mandates PTA or stent administration as first treatment
             modality. The history of peripheral artery occlusion has to at least 6 weeks, and the
             target vessel occlusion has to be no longer than 5 centimeters in length
             (corresponding to a maximum of 2 stents per treated lesion). The number of treated
             lesions per vessel in this study is limited to three. Only the major lesion will be
             allocated to one of the study groups, the other lesions will be treated by
             conventional PTA. A documentation of distal outflow (no occlusion until 3 cm above the
             upper joint ankle) is mandatory

          -  Severe stage of PAD with ulceration(s) corresponding to Rutherford stage 5 or 6.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute limb ischemia

          -  Subacute ischemia with requires thrombolysis as first treatment modality

          -  Active bleeding or known bleeding diathesis

          -  Known severe hepatic or renal disorder (liver cirrhosis, stage B, C or serum
             creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg%)

          -  Hyperthyreosis

          -  Diabetes mellitus treated with metformin

          -  Known heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT, type 2)

             neurological deficit, or other CNS abnormality (e.g., intracranial neoplasm,
             arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm), or history of aneurysm repair

          -  Gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding of clinical significance within the
             previous 6 weeks

          -  Puncture of a non compressible vessel within past 24 hours

          -  Administration of oral anticoagulants within the previous 7 days unless prothrombin
             time is &lt; 1.2 times control (or international normalized ratio [INR] &lt;1.4), or ongoing
             treatment with oral anticoagulants

          -  History of bleeding diathesis of platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3

          -  Co-existent condition associated with a limited life expectancy (e.g., advanced
             cancer, end-stage congestive heart failure)

          -  Women of child-bearing potential with a positive pregnancy test
