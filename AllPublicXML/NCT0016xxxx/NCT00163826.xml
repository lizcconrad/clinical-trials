  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Alfred Hospital receives approximately 40% of the major trauma patients in Victoria, all
      of whom are at risk for spinal injuries. The potential for spinal injuries necessitates the
      undertaking of appropriate spinal investigations, and a delay in the completion of these
      investigations exposes the patient to the risk of a missed diagnosis of spinal instability
      and of complications of immobility; the potential spinal patient is required to wear a neck
      collar and be nursed lying flat whilst awaiting the completion and the appropriate
      documentation of spinal X-ray investigations.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the issues causing a delay in the process of the
      completion of the appropriate spinal investigations and the documentation of the results.

      The outcome of the proposed research will be the development of a clinical management
      protocol to expedite the process, with the aim of optimising patient care and reducing
      complications.
