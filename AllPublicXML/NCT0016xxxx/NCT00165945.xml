  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators wish to use images obtained from standard of care cardiac
      MRI's performed at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta and transfer the images to a different
      computer in order to analyze them with a new computer. The investigators are hoping to better
      their understanding and management of complex congenital heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients enrolled in this study will be receiving standard of care cardiac MRI as
      prescribed by their physician. These MRI DICOM images will be transferred to a SGI Fuel
      workstation, where they will be manipulated using the newly developed 4-D Visualization
      software. No additional scanner time or new imaging sequences are required as presently
      prescribed sequences and produced data can be analyzed. The workstation is designed to
      include acceleration hardware for volume rendering, and was developed for advanced cardiac
      MRI viewing.
