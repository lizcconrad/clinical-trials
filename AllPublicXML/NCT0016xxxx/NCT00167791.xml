  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of patients who have a high risk of kidney rejection before kidney
      transplant. The hypothesis is that treatment with a medication called rituximab will make it
      possible for them to receive a kidney transplant from a donor who previously did not present
      a good match.
