    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Adverse Event (AE) During the Duration of the Study CDP870-033 (up to 84 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 84 months from Study Entry (Week 0) to the Study End (Week 364) and the Safety Follow-up (Week 374)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the Duration of This Study CDP870-033 (up to 84 Months)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 84 months from Study Entry (Week 0) to the Study End (Week 364) and the Safety Follow-up (Week 374)</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose which results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization, results in persistent/significant disability/incapacity, is an infection that requires parenteral antibiotics, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an important medical event.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Remission (HBI ≤ 4) at Study Completion Visit or (Early) Withdrawal Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Completion Visit (Week 364) / (Early) Withdrawal Visit</time_frame>
    <description>HBI remission is defined as total HBI score of 4 points or less. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (8 items, score 1 per item) lower scores indicating better well being. The first three parameters are scored for the previous day.</description>

    <time_frame>From Week 0 of study CDP870-031 [NCT00152490] or CDP870-032 [NCT00152425] to Study Completion Visit (Week 364) of this study (up to 90 months) or (Early) Withdrawal Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as decrease in total Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score of 3 or more points. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (8 items, score 1 per item) lower scores indicating better well-being. The first three parameters are scored for the previous day.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Concentration of Certolizumab Pegol at Study Completion Visit or (Early) Withdrawal Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Study Completion Visit (Week 364) / (Early) Withdrawal Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for determination of Certolizumab Pegol were taken prior to Certolizumab Pegol administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects With Positive Anti-CZP Anti-body Status at Any Time From Week 0 of the Feeder Study CDP870-031 or CDP870-032 to the Study Completion Visit in CDP870-033</measure>
    <time_frame>From Week 0 of study CDP870-031 [NCT00152490] or CDP870-032 [NCT00152425] to Study Completion Visit (Week 364) of CDP870-033 (up to 90 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are counted as antibody positive to Certolizumab Pegol if they have at least one positive result from Week 0 in one of the previous studies CDP870-031 [NCT00152490] or CDP870-032 [NCT00152425] to the Last Visit in this study. A positive result is defined as Anti-CZP antibody levels &gt; 2.4 units/mL.</description>
