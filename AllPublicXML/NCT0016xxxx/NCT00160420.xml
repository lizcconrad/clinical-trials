    <textblock>
      Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, is a progressive,
      estrogen-dependent disease that occurs in menstruating women of reproductive age. Although
      all major endometriosis therapies are effective for the treatment of pain, no single
      treatment is superior to others in terms of efficacy. The major drawbacks of the current
      medical therapies are severe side effects such as hot flushes and osteoporosis. The objective
      of this study is to determine the long-term safety of asoprisnil 5 mg daily for 12 months in
      women with endometriosis, after an initial 12 weeks in study M01-398. The safety will be
      based on assessments of the endometrium, lipid profiles, adverse events, and changes from
      baseline laboratory values and vital signs.
