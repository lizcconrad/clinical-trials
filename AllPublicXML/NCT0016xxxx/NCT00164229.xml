  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive evaluation (geneticist, psychologist, social worker, education specialist,
      others as indicated) to determine individual needs and treatment plan. Referrals for specific
      services (e.g., OT, counseling, medications, etc) will be to clinicians within the families'
      own communities. All families will receive evaluation, parent education/advocacy, and
      learning readiness program. Only the intervention group will receive the math intervention.

      Learning Readiness Program: This program will include: case management to secure needed
      services, medication consultation (psychiatrist), educational consultation/ liaison,
      Behavioral Regulation Training (BRT). BRT will include teaching parents about: 1) recognizing
      their child's arousal level (to avoid negative episodes), 2) recognizing their own arousal
      and how it contributes to a situation, 3) principles of social reinforcement (e.g., praise,
      ignore, etc), 4) &quot;accidental teaching&quot; (i.e., teaching when a situation/opportunity arises),
      5) resource/support source identification, 6) to communicate choices rather than
      authoritative commands, and 6) reduction of repetitive prompts (nagging). The child will be
      taught: 1) the technique of Escape/No Escape for undesirable tasks, 2) arousal awareness, and
      3) verbalization of situations and actions (e.g., I don't like it when mom yells at me for
      running in the house, so I won't run in the house).

      Targeted Area of Intervention: MATH - 6 weeks of individualized math tutoring. Content of the
      tutoring will be tailored to age levels (either 3-6 yr olds or 6-9 yr olds). The High/Scope
      curriculum will be used (modified so that it can be individualized). In addition, visual
      materials and visual aids will be developed to address deficits in the visual-spatial skills
      of children with FAS/ARND. For teachers, a manual will be prepared to assist them in working
      with children who have FAS/ARND. The educational specialist will review the manual and
      techniques with each teacher involved with the child.

      Parent component: Individual and small group sessions to include: FAS education, information
      on education system procedures, instruction for communicating with professionals, and support
      for advocating for their child. A caregiver manual will be prepared.

      Evaluation Plan: Treatment and control groups will be compared using pre- and post-tests
      measures. Post-tests will be at the conclusion of the intervention and at a 6-month
      follow-up. Process (e.g., parent satisfaction, compliance, etc) and outcome (e.g., math
      skill, behavior, family functioning, etc) measures will be evaluated.
