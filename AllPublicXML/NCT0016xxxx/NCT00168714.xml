      The primary objectives of the study were to prospectively record and analyze birth defects
      and spontaneous fetal losses in women with multiple sclerosis (MS) exposed to Avonex within
      approximately 1 week of conception or during the first trimester of pregnancy, where the
      outcome of the pregnancy was unknown prospectively and to prospectively record and analyze
      pregnancy outcomes in an exploratory fashion of women with MS who stopped therapy, but who
      may have been exposed to Avonex with approximately 1 week of conception or during the first
      trimester of pregnancy.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been exposed to AVONEX within approximately 1 week of conception or during the
             first trimester of pregnancy.

          -  Provide sufficient information to determine that the pregnancy is prospectively
             registered (i.e., the outcome of pregnancy must be unknown prospectively).

          -  Provide verbal consent to participate in the Registry.

          -  Verbally provide contact information for herself, her HCP, and the infant's HCP (if
             applicable).

        NOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
