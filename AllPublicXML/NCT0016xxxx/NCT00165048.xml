  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of selective COX-II inhibitor in
      patients with regionally disseminated stomach cancer treated by palliative resection (so
      called R1 or R2 gastrectomy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) is a family of enzymes regulating the conversion of arachidonic acid to
      prostaglandins. COX-II is an inducible enzyme, which expresses excessively when there are
      stimuli such as inflammation or hypergastrinaemia. Up to 40% of patients with stomach cancer
      are found to have disseminated disease during surgical exploration. While palliative
      resection could offer a marginal benefit in the survival of these patients, almost all
      patients will die of progression of disease within a short time span. Palliative chemotherapy
      has been used in the past. However, there is no evidence that the chemotherapy can confer any
      survival advantages, and the side-effects and toxicity of the treatment may indeed compromise
      the quality of life of these patients. With a better understanding of the relation between
      COX-II and stomach cancer, it may be possible to suppress the progression of the residual
      cancer cells after the palliative resection by giving the patients selective COX-II
      inhibitors.
