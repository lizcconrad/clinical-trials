  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare disorder curable only through allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A mismatched family member is an option when no
      human leukocyte antigen (HLA-immune system type) matched related or matched unrelated donor
      is available.

      This study will evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for patients with WAS who undergo
      haploidentical transplantation using a parental donor. To reduce the risk of
      transplant-related toxicities, participants will receive a reduced intensity chemotherapy and
      antibody regimen (conditioning treatment). Participants will then receive an infusion of
      donor stem cells depleted of certain white blood cells called T- and B-lymphocytes. The stem
      cell depletion processing will be done through the use of the investigational CliniMACS
      device. A certain number of T-lymphocytes will be added back to the processed stem cell graft
      prior to infusion into the recipient.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of haploidentical
      transplantation in WAS patients using this specified conditioning regimen and engineered
      graft. Safety will be defined in terms of engraftment (meaning how well the graft grows and
      functions after infusion) and regimen-related toxicity within the first 100 days after
      transplant.

      Secondary Objectives in this trial include the following:

        -  To estimate the survival of study recipients at one year after infusion of the T- and
           B-lymphocyte depleted stem cell graft.

        -  To assess if the study treatment enables the recipient to generate normal donor-derived
           B-cell numbers and endogenous IgM, IgG, and IgA production, resulting in a
           reduction/elimination of the need for intravenous immunoglobulin infusions.

        -  To determine if the study treatment results in the ability of the research participant
           to generate normal donor-derived T cell response and natural killer (NK) cell numbers
           and function.

        -  To describe the incidence of Epstein-Barr virus-lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-LPD) in
           these transplant recipients.
