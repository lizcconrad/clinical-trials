      A randomized controlled multi-component fall prevention study for older adults. The study
      integrates fall prevention into an existing community-based public health program for older
      adults. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of a fall prevention intervention among 552
      seniors attending Preventive Health Care for the Aging (PHCA) clinics in two counties: urban
      San Diego county and rural Humboldt county. The intervention includes four elements:
      education about fall risk factors, referrals to community exercise programs to increase
      strength and balance, medication review, and home modification to reduce home hazards. The
      goal of the intervention is to reduce incidence of falls requiring hospitalization by 10%.
      Results of the study, which are expected to be completed by October 2004, will help guide
      future efforts to develop multifaceted fall prevention programs.
