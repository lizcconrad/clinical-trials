      The purpose of this study is to determine how long it takes couples of normal fertility to
      get pregnant once they begin to try, and whether instruction in fertility awareness can
      decrease time to pregnancy in these couples.

    <textblock>
      Research has established that there are relatively few days of the menstrual cycle that have
      a substantial probability of pregnancy from coitus, and that there are prospective biomarkers
      that allow a woman or couple to identify these &quot;fertile&quot; days. However, it remains unclear
      how this knowledge may improve a couple's chances of conceiving.

      All couples participating in this study must have a history of previous pregnancy together
      and no history suggesting subfertility. Participants in this study will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups. One group will receive instruction about identifying the days when a
      woman is mostly likely to get pregnant from intercourse, using the Creighton Model
      FertilityCare System, and the other group will receive instructions about the menstrual
      cycle, fertility, and preparing for pregnancy. Randomization is stratified by age.

      All participants will keep a daily fertility chart and use a computerized device called the
      Fertility Monitor with urine dipsticks to monitor hormones of the menstrual cycle.

      The primary outcome is time to pregnancy.
