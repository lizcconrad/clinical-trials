  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gold standard for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is the open
      pyeloplasty. As a minimally invasive alternative, many centers are currently offering
      laparoscopic pyeloplasty (LP) as primary therapy for UPJOs. Recent data has shown that
      laparoscopic pyeloplasty has comparable success rates to open pyeloplasties and produces
      durable results. The researchers are compiling a registry and database to review outcomes of
      laparoscopic pyeloplasty patients.
