    <time_frame>From first dose of CZP to the end of the open-label study (approximately 6.8 years)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or trial subject that is administered a drug or biologic (medicinal product) or that is using a medical device. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with that treatment or usage. First dose of CZP was at Baseline of the preceding double-blind study NCT00160602 for subjects randomized to CZP, or at Entry Visit (Week 0) of this study for subjects randomized to Placebo.</description>

    <description>A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is as infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardise the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With at Least One Serious Adverse Event (SAE) From First Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) Dose up to Approximately 6.8 Years</title>
        <description>A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life-threatening
Requires in patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is as infection that requires treatment parenteral antibiotics
Other important medical events which based on medical or scientific judgement may jeopardise the patients, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above
First dose of CZP was at Baseline of the preceding double-blind study NCT00160602 for subjects randomized to CZP, or at Entry Visit (Week 0) of this study for subjects randomized to Placebo.</description>
