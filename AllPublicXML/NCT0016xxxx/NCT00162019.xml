    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether IMMUNATE S/D is effective and safe in the
      treatment of hemophilia A patients. The study consists of 3 parts: Part 1 is a
      pharmacokinetic comparison of IMMUNATE S/D and its predecessor IMMUNATE. Part 2 is an
      evaluation of efficacy and safety of IMMUNATE S/D. Part 3 is a pharmacokinetic study of
      IMMUNATE S/D.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Plasma factor VIII level as follows: for Parts 1 &amp; 3: Subjects with severe hemophilia A
        (plasma baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 1% measured at time of screening) for Part 2:
        Subjects with severe (plasma baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 1% measured at time of
        screening) or moderately severe hemophilia A (plasma baseline factor VIII level &lt;= 2%
        measured at time of screening)

          -  Males &gt;= 12 but &lt;= 65 years of age

          -  &gt;= 35 kg body weight

          -  Previously treated with factor VIII concentrate(s) for a minimum of 150 exposure days
             (as documented in the subject's medical history)

          -  Evidence of a protective titer to HAV and HBV at the time of screening

          -  Immunocompetent as defined by a CD4+ lymphocyte count &gt;400/mm3 and an absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1500

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented history of inhibitor to factor VIII with a titer &gt;= 0.8 BU

          -  Current evidence of inhibitor to factor VIII with a titer &gt;= 0.8 BU, measured at the
             time of screening

          -  symptomatic AIDS Note: HIV-seropositive subjects with an absolute CD4+ lymphocyte
             count &gt; 400/mm3 are eligible to participate. HIV-seropositive subjects receiving
             highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) regimens are eligible for enrollment if
             they are not excluded by the above criteria

             study entry

          -  The subject is currently receiving, or is scheduled to receive during the course of
             the study, an immunomodulating drug other than anti-retroviral chemotherapy (e.g.,
             a-interferon, steroids at a dose greater than 10 mg/day)

          -  The subject is identified by the investigator as being unable or unwilling to perform
             study procedures
