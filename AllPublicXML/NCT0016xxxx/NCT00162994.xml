  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if young children have more benefit of the
      combination of adenotomy and tympanostomy than plain tympanostomy in prevention of recurrent
      otitis media.

    <textblock>
      Recurrent otitis media is the most common bacterial disease in young children. Many risk
      factors are known, but benefit of operations are conflicting in children under two years of
      age.

      In this randomized prospective controlled trial, the effect of tympanostomy tubes is compared
      to the effect of the combination of adenotomy and tympanostomy tubes in preventing recurrent
      otitis media. A control group with no active treatment is also included. The speed of
      recovery is studied by recording the daily symptoms and number of days of effusion comparing
      the differences between the groups. Life quality issues are recorded preoperatively and at
      about four and twelve months after the operation and are compared between the groups and to
      healthy children of the same age.
