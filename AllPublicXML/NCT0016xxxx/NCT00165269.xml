  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study it to evaluate the effectiveness of radiation therapy limited to
      above the diaphragm in patients with pathological stage IA-IIA Hodgkin's disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Eligble patients will receive a course of radiation therapy directed to above the
           diaphragm only.

        -  Patients would have bloodwork and chest x-rays performed 4 times per year for the first
           two years, 3 times per year for the third year, and 2 times per year for the fourth and
           fifth years. After five years, yearly check-ups are performed.

        -  In addition to the above follow-up, patients will receive, once or twice a year for the
           first 5 years, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan and/or gallium scan.
