    <measure>Change From Baseline in Annual Growth Rate Standard Deviation Score (SDS) for Chronological Age (CA) at Month 36 in Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Change in annual growth rate (AGR) standard deviation score (SDS) for chronological age (CA) derived by subtracting AGR SDS CA at baseline from each time point (Yx) value. AGR at Yx= (height Yx-height Y[x-1])/([date of Yx-date of Y{x-1}]/365.25). AGR as SDS calculated using Sempe reference means and standard deviations (SD) for growth rate. AGR SDS CA (for both baseline and Yx)= (AGR-reference mean for growth rate CA)/reference SD for growth rate CA. CA calculated as integer (Date of height measurement-Date of birth)/365.25*12. SDS indicates how similar participant was to reference population.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 12, Month 24, Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Change in AGR at Yx was derived by subtracting AGR at baseline from Yx value. Annual growth rate was calculated each year and rescaled to 1 year if the interval between Yx and Y[x-1] was not 365 days, as long as a participant remained in the study. AGR at Yx was calculated using the previous height measurements (Y[x-1]) and height recorded at Yx (AGR Yx = [height Yx-height Y{x-1}] / ([date of Yx - date of Y{x-1}] /365.25).</description>

        <description>Change in annual growth rate (AGR) standard deviation score (SDS) for chronological age (CA) derived by subtracting AGR SDS CA at baseline from each time point (Yx) value.
