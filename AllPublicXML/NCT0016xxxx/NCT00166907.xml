  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this research are delineated as the following: Aim 1: To investigate the
      neuromuscular and biomechanical mechanisms of the emerging processes of proactive and
      reactive balance control during sitting and standing in patients with stroke at different
      stages of the recovery course. Aim 2: To determine the relationships between brain lesion
      sites and the recovery patterns of reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms in
      patients with stroke. Aim 3: To determine the relationships between the impairments in
      reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as well as fall
      incidence in patients following stroke. Aim 4: To investigate the efficacy of different
      training regimens in improving reactive and proactive balance control strategies and in
      preventing falls in stroke patients with different brain lesion sites. Principally, three
      hypotheses are to be tested: Hypothesis 1:The emerging processes and recovery patternes of
      proactive and reactive balance control may be different among stroke patients with different
      brain lesion locations. Hypothesis 2:There are positive correlations between the level of
      impairments in reactive and proactive balance control mechanisms and functional outcome as
      well as fall incidence in patients following stroke. Hypothesis 3:Training regimens that
      could best facilitate the emergence or improvement in reactive and proactive balance control
      strategies are different.

      Stroke is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in the world. Falls are one of the
      primary complications after stroke. The incidence of falls ranges from 25% to 75% among
      stroke patients residing in different settings, with greater incidence of falls occurring
      after discharge home. Postural instability has been suggested as one of the main causes
      leading to falls in this population. The recovery of the ability to maintain balance during
      activities of daily living, therefore, is essential for functional independence and safety of
      these patients. In the following paragraphs, the knowledge gaps taht we are proposing to
      bridge in this study and the revelant literature that leads us to identify these gaps are
      discussed.
