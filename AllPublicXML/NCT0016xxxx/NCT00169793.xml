      Test the hypothesis that the new bariatric surgical procedures (BSP) increase stone risk, and
      will result in an increased incidence and prevalence of stone disease; the purpose is to
      determine if BSP patients require special management for stone prevention. This study does
      not include the bariatric surgery but enrolls subjects who are already scheduled for surgery
      with an affiliated surgeon. The study procedure is to collect 24 hour urines pre-and post
      surgically to evaluate the risk of kidney stone procedure after surgery.

      Surgical therapy for the morbidly obese began when the jejunocolic anastomosis procedure was
      performed in 1956 but was modified to a jejunoileal technique years later after intolerable
      metabolic complications ensued.1, 2 In 1969, Payne recommended that the end to side
      jejunal-ileal bypass (JIB) procedure which preserved 37cm of jejunum and 10cm of ileum should
      replace the jejunocolic bypass.2 In 1970, Scott modified JIB by increasing the length of
      intestine used and by fashioning an end-to-end anastomosis between the jejunum and ileum3;
      this modified procedure soon became the preferred procedure for weight reduction. This foray
      into bariatric surgery was quickly embraced and JIB was widely adopted. However, in the mid
      to late 1970's, about 10 years after the first JIB was performed, concern developed regarding
      the long-term adverse effects of anemia, vitamin deficiencies, nephrolithiasis and ultimately
      even renal and liver failure.4-14 It was not until a number of patients had end organ failure
      that the full impact of the complications of JIB were recognized. Much of the complications
      stem from the malabsorptive component that results from JIB. As fat is malabsorbed,
      fat-soluble vitamins and calcium are saponified. Subsequently, nutrients are lost and an
      increased oxalate load is delivered to the large intestine as the calcium that would normally
      bind oxalate is lost with the malabsorbed fat. In addition, bile salts normally reabsorbed in
      the ileum are delivered to the colon, increasing the permeability of the colonic mucosa to
      oxalate. These factors result in increased uptake of oxalate in the large intestine. Oxalate,
      which cannot be metabolized by humans, is rapidly cleared by the kidney resulting in
      &quot;intestinal&quot; hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis4-6, 12, 15 and
      nephrotoxicity.7, 10, 11, 13, 16 The probability of a severe renal complication after JIB was
      calculated to be about 21% at 5 years and increased to 37% at 15 years; there is also a 28.7%
      risk of nephrolithiasis at 15 years.13 It was not until 1980 that the Food and Drug
      Administration placed a moratorium on JIB for obesity surgery. Prior to that approximately
      25,000 such procedures had been performed in the United States. A large number of these
      patients had the JIB reversed or succumbed to its complications.10 Those patients with the
      JIB intact remain at risk for complications such as cirrhosis, arthritis, urolithiasis,
      oxalate nephropathy, and bypass enteritis—of which only the latter three respond when the JIB
      is reversed.10 The lessons learned from this previous experience with bariatric surgical
      procedures must not be repeated. Although the cardiopulmonary risks of obesity are
      significant, the catastrophic long-term consequences that were unrecognized initially with
      JIB should not be forgotten. Many patients not only necessitated treatment for kidney stones
      but some have lost renal function requiring dialysis and transplantation from oxalate
      nephropathy.10, 11, 13 Currently, the Roux-en-Y bariatric procedure (REY) is the most widely
      utilized procedure for the surgical treatment of obesity. REY results in rapid weight loss17
      compared to restrictive procedures16, 17, 18-20 but the long-term effects of the
      malabsorptive component of this operation on the risk of nephrolithiasis and renal loss is
      currently unknown. With REY, fat malabsorption is one of the primary mechanisms by which
      weight loss is accomplished and, therefore, intestinal hyperoxaluria, as occurs with JIB, is
      theoretically possible. Although the long-term metabolic consequences of REY have yet to be
      studied, some recent data from LithoLink is concerning. LithoLink Corporation, located in
      Chicago IL, is a clinical laboratory/disease management company that provides testing for
      kidney stone patients. Physicians from all across the United States refer stone patients to
      the LithoLink laboratory for evaluation. Patients collect 24-hour urine samples at home and
      then send them via overnight air express to LithoLink for analysis. As part of the disease
      management service, a medical history pertinent to kidney stones is obtained from each
      patient via phone interview. Since 1998, patients have specifically been asked if they have
      had weight reduction surgery and whether the surgery was JIB or bariatric, and the answers
      are coded into the database. The LithoLink database is the largest kidney stone database
      linking laboratory and clinical data in this country, and perhaps the world. As part of an
      IRB approved research protocol, LithoLink sought to ask the question whether modern bariatric
      procedures were associated with an increase in urine oxalate excretion. They found normal
      non-stone forming controls have a mean urinary oxalate excretion of 34.3mg/day while calcium
      oxalate stone formers from the same laboratory have a mean urinary oxalate excretion of
      37.3mg/day. In contrast, the bariatric population, which includes both gastric banding
      (restrictive only) and REY (restrictive and malabsorptive) patients, was found to have a mean
      urinary oxalate excretion of 78.4mg/day (p&lt;0.001 compared to both normal controls and stone
      formers). Figure 1 shows the comparison of urine oxalate excretion of bariatric surgery
      patients to that of routine stone formers. Note the significant right shift to higher oxalate
      excretion in the bariatric surgery patients (open triangles). Most laboratories consider a
      urinary oxalate excretion of &gt;45mg/day to represent hyperoxaluria and primary hyperoxaluria
      (a rare inborn error of metabolism resulting in marked endogenous production of oxalate) is
      suspected when the level of urinary oxalate exceeds 100mg/day6. Given these definitions, the
      urine oxalate excretion in patients having undergone bariatric surgery is striking. Nearly
      3/4 of the bariatric surgery cohort had urine oxalate levels above 45mg/day and about 1/4 had
      urinary oxalate levels in excess of 100mg/day. Calcium oxalate supersaturation (Figure 2),
      the chemical driving force for crystallization, is also dramatically elevated in bariatric
      surgery patients compared to routine stone formers (12.5 vs. 7.3, p&lt;0.001), highlighting the
      extreme risk for stone formation and oxalate nephropathy in these patients. Finally, the data
      was analyzed to see if there was an increase in the number of bariatric surgery patients
      being referred for kidney stone evaluation. Since the number of new patients referred to
      Litholink each year is increasing, the data is presented as the number of new bariatric
      surgery patients per one thousand new stone patients per year. As can be seen in Figure 3,
      there is a significant upward trend of bariatric surgery patients with kidney stones (r2=
      0.86 for the linear regression, p=0.01). This rise in bariatric surgery patients with kidney
      stones parallels, but lags by several years, the rise in the number of bariatric surgeries in
      the United States (Figure 3). Although bariatric procedures such as REY are performed with
      the assumption that the resultant physiologic perturbations should be less severe than with
      JIB, our preliminary data suggests that these contemporary bariatric surgical procedures
      result in urinary oxalate levels comparable to that reported after JIB with the now
      well-known long-term adverse sequela vis-à-vis nephrolithiasis and oxalate nephropathy.

      Because Clarian, as well as many other medical institutions, is undertaking a large endeavor
      to become a center of excellence in bariatric surgical treatment, the risk of stone formation
      and renal disease in these patients should be carefully examined. It is hoped that early
      recognition of adverse metabolic alterations will allow the patient and physician to rapidly
      treat and even prevent some complications. Loss of renal function, as with the previous
      experience with JIB, is much too late a phase in the consequences of hyperoxaluria for the
      identification of such problems associated with bariatric surgery. Patients can also be
      adequately counseled if they have a prior history of stone disease regarding the relative
      risks of the various bariatric surgical procedures. As obesity is currently an important
      national health issue, the examination of the surgical treatment for obesity and the
      consequences of these procedures is timely. Scrutiny of the risks of bariatric surgery will
      benefit both patient and surgeon in identify and preventing renal complications that may
      arise.
