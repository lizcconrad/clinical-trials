  <brief_summary>

      The specific aims are as follows:

        1. To investigate the degree of impairment, such as range, proprioception, sensation, and
           electromyography (EMG) pattern of healthy, older subjects.

        2. To investigate the relationship of these impairment measurements, the functional outcome
           and disability in patients with cervical spondylosis.

        3. To develop an exercise program with an emphasis on proprioception, stability and
           coordination for patients with neck-shoulder complaints to decrease the impairment and
           increase the functions of patients.
