  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine gene expression profiles by DNA microarray in
      patients who are responders and non-responders to interferon and ribavirin treatment for
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). Genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis and mediators of the
      Th-1 lymphocyte response will be looked for. It is hoped that genetic targets for future more
      effective and less toxic treatments will be identified.

      Background and Research Plan:

      Chronic HCV infection often follows a progressive course over many years, and can ultimately
      result in cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation or hepatocellular carcinoma. The
      decision to treat patients with chronic hepatitis C infection is based upon several factors
      including the natural history and stage of the disease and the efficacy and adverse effects
      related to therapy. As a general rule patients who are considered for treatment should have
      histologic and virologic evidence of chronic infection (i.e., HCV RNA detectable in serum)
      and an elevated serum ALT (1). Combination treatment with Interferon and Ribavirin is
      currently the best available treatment for chronic HCV infection. However, response to
      therapy is suboptimal and there are several side effects.

      Side effects seen during therapy of patients with Interferon and Ribavirin include flu-like
      symptoms mostly due to interferon, cytopenias and haemolysis induced by Ribavirin.
      Psychiatric changes due to interferon, occur in up to 50% and thyroid abnormalities requiring
      therapy occur in about 1 to 5% treated with interferon. Autoimmune disease and retinal
      haemorrhages have also been reported. In addition, combination therapy is associated with
      significant risks in patients with renal dysfunction, cardiac disease and haemolytic anaemias
      as treatment may be associated with anaemia. Patients who are depressed or suicidal should
      also be excluded (2).

      To this point little DNA microarray work done has been done with HCV. However, what work has
      been done is interesting and shows promise. In studies comparing Hepatitis B (HBV) with
      Hepatitis C, HBV infection was found to express genes predominantly involved in inflammation.
      In contrast, with HCV infection anti-inflammatory genes were found to be expressed (3). In
      another study HCV associated cirrhosis has been shown to be characterized by proinflammatory,
      pro-fibrotic and proapoptotic gene expression profiles (4).

      The progression of HCV infection by gene expression analysis of liver biopsies in acutely
      infected chimpanzees that develop persistent infection, transient viral clearance, or
      sustained clearance has been examined. Transient and sustained viral clearance were uniquely
      associated with induction of IFN-gamma-induced genes and other genes involved in antigen
      processing and presentation and the adaptive immune response. The study revealed genome-wide
      transcriptional changes that reflect the establishment, spread, and control of infection, and
      they reveal potentially unique antiviral programs associated with clearance of HCV infection
      (5).

      In-vitro studies in the human cell line Huh7 has shown that on exposure of the cells to
      Interferon 50 genes were up-regulated by at least twofold in control clones, whereas
      induction of 9 of the 50 genes was significantly reduced in those Huh7 clones expressing
      NS5A. Interferon-alpha activity has been found to be inhibited by the HCV protein NS5A. The
      strongest effect of NS5A on Interferon response was observed on the OAS-p69 gene with reduced
      expression. In addition, Huh7 cells expressing NS5A showed an up-regulation of interleukin-8
      a proinflammatory cytokine. As a result this study postulated a mechanism for NS5A mediated
      interferon resistance (6).

      In a recent study microarray gene profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
      hepatitis C patients treated with Interferon-alpha was performed. 88 genes directly relating
      to functions of immune cells were up-regulated, including genes involved in antigen
      processing and presentation, T-cell activation, lymphocyte trafficking, and effector
      functions, suggesting that Interferon-alpha up-regulates multiple genes involving different
      aspects of immune responses to enhance immunity against hepatitis C virus (7).

      Currently, treatment for HCV still has a significant non-responder rate and is associated
      with side effects which limits many individuals from receiving treatment. Already molecular
      profiling by DNA microarrays has identified potential genetic targets which may have a role
      in the pathogenesis of HCV-associated hepatitis and more importantly possible targets which
      have a role in response to Interferon treatment. The work proposed here hopes to build on
      this body of knowledge and may lead to improved treatment modalities for HCV.

      Methods/Experimental Design:

      Approval from the Alfred Hospital Ethics Committee will be obtained and subjects will be
      recruited via the Alfred Hospital's Hepatitis Clinics. Informed consent for the study will be
      obtained after its purpose is explained verbally and via a plain English statement. Informed
      consent will also include consent for liver biopsies. Initially, a pilot study will be
      undertaken in which only one subject will be recruited to both the experimental and control
      arm of the study. Once the results from this pilot study have been analysed the study will be
      expanded to encompass a greater number of individuals.

      Liver biopsies will be performed on the following groups.

        1. HCV positive patients prior to commencement and at the end of treatment with either
           standard or pegylated Interferon plus Ribavirin. This group will be subdivided into
           responders and non-responders to treatment. Core liver biopsies under ultra-sound
           guidance are already routinely performed on this group prior to the commencement of
           treatment. For the purpose of this study non-responders to combination therapy are those
           individuals who remain HCV-RNA positive at the end of treatment.

        2. Control population consisting of patients undergoing laparotomy for diseases not
           involving the liver. These biopsies would be obtained at the time of surgery.

      Enough liver tissue (approximately 1-2 mg) will be obtained to isolate messenger RNA (mRNA)
      by oligo dT chromatography. Once isolated the mRNA will be reverse transcribed to
      complementary DNA (cDNA). This cDNA will then be labeled with a fluorescent reporter
      molecule. Hybridization of the labeled liver cDNA will then occur with the DNA microarray. It
      is envisaged that the microarray will be commercially obtained and consist of human cDNA.
      There is enough DNA on the microarray that two lots of labeled liver cDNA with different
      fluorescent markers (i.e. red and green) can be hybridized to the array at the same time
      without any interference. The following hybridizations would then be set up.

      Reporter molecule 1: HCV +ve group. cDNA Reporter molecule 2: HCV -ve group. cDNA

      Hybridization 1 Responder to Rx. Before Rx Control cDNA

      Hybridization 2 Responder to Rx. After Rx Control cDNA

      Hybridization 3 Non responder to Rx. Before Rx Control cDNA

      Hybridization 4 Non responder to Rx. After Rx Control cDNA

      Rx = treatment.

      The hybridized array will then be scanned and commercially available software packages will
      be used to help in the interpretation of the results (8). Genes or groups of genes of
      particular interest include:

        1. Pro-inflammatory response genes

             -  Th-1 cytokines such as Gamma Interferon (IFN), Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Tumour
                Necrosis Factor-beta (TNF-ÃŸ). Th1 cytokines promote production of opsonizing
                antibodies (e.g., IgG1) and induction of cellular cytotoxicity and macrophage
                activation. Th1 responses are prominent in the defence against pathogens which
                replicate intracellularly.

             -  Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) and TNF receptor family of molecules which are
                strongly pro-inflammatory and involved in immune regulation.

             -  Interleukin-12 (IL-12) which is a key cytokine that protects the host from viral
                and microbial infection. It links the innate and acquired arms of the immune
                system.

             -  Interleukin-18 (IL-18) which has been shown to act as a chemoattractant.

        2. Genes involved in a pro-fibrotic response.

             -  Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) which causes fibroblast proliferation.

             -  Procollagen I and II.

             -  Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and PDGF beta receptor over-expression have
                been linked to development of fibrotic disease as well as cancer and
                atherosclerosis.

             -  Matrix metalloproteinases play a pivotal role in angiogenesis and have a role in
                tumorigenesis.

             -  Fibroblast Growth Factor.

             -  Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) which is known for its angiogenic
                properties.

             -  Connective tissue growth factor which stimulates collagen production.

      In addition, novel genes previously unidentified, with differential expression will be looked
      for and will be characterized.
