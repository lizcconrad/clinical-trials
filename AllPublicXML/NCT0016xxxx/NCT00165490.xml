  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) the combination of three
      chemotherapy drugs (cetuximab, cisplatin, and irinotecan) have on esophageal cancer when
      given with radiation therapy.

      -  Patients participating in this study must have a tumor biopsy taken to confirm the type
           of tumor.

        -  Outpatient therapy with cetuximab alone will be given intravenously on week 0.

        -  During week 1-8 outpatient radiation therapy will be started and continued once per day
           for 28 treatments or 5 1/2 weeks.

        -  Outpatient chemotherapy (cisplatin, irinotecan and cetuximab) is given once per week on
           weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5. Cetuximab alone will be given on weeks 3, 6, 7, and 8.

        -  A repeat CT scan and PET scan will be performed to restage the tumor on week 8. This is
           to confirm that the cancer has remained localized.

        -  Inpatient surgery is scheduled 4 to 8 weeks after completion of chemotherapy and
           radiation therapy.

        -  Cetuximab will be restarted within 4 weeks after surgery and continue weekly for 6
           months.

        -  During chemotherapy and radiation therapy, physical exams and vital signs will be
           performed before each chemotherapy treatment. Routine blood tests will also be
           performed.

        -  Between chemotherapy-radiation therapy and surgery a CAT scan of chest, abdomen and
           pelvis along with a PET scan will be performed.

        -  After surgery a CAT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed every 3 months
           for 2 years then every 6 months for 3 years. An EGD (upper endoscopy) with biopsy will
           be done every 6 months for 2 years and then yearly for 3 years. Physical exam, vital
           signs and routine blood tests will be done every 2 weeks for 6 months, then every 3
           months for 1.5 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
