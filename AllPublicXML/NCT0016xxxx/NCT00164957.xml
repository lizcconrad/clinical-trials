  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Tube feeding had been found to be a cause of aspiration pneumonia. Continuous pump feeding at
      slower rates as compared to bolus feeding may be less associated with aspiration pneumonia.

      Methods:

      Randomized controlled trial

      Subjects:

      Patients expected to remain on tube feeding for 4 or more weeks

      Outcomes:

      1) pneumonia, 2) mortality
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects are randomized into 2 groups by random numbers generated by a computer
      programme: intermittent bolus feeding versus continuous feeding via a delivery pump.

      Baseline Assessment:

      Clinical details including background medical diagnoses, indications for enteral feeding,
      functional status and baseline CXR findings are recorded.

      Tube Feeding Regime:

      The choice of feeding formula and feeding volume will be guided by 2 dietitians collaborating
      in this study. Giving sets for continuous pump feeding are changed everyday.

      Pump feeding is defined at delivery rate &lt;60ml/hr. In order to avoid interfering with
      rehabilitative activities, pump feeding can be discontinued for no more than eight hours
      during the day. Bolus feeding is defined as no more than 400ml/hr, 4 to 5 times per day.

      All subjects are reviewed to monitor complications arising from enteral feeding. Free pump
      feeding sets will be provided for an extra 2 weeks for pump feeding group subjects discharged
      before the end of the trial. All subjects discharged prior to the end of trial will be
      contacted regularly by a research assistant until completion or outcome is reached.

      Outcome Pneumonia is diagnosed in the presence of 2 major clinical signs: increased sputum
      production and pneumonic changes in the CXR (according to radiologist report), or in the
      presence of one major sign and 2 of the following minor clinical signs: raised or depressed
      white cell count, hypoxia at room air (PaO2 &lt;92%) and body temperature greater than 38%. When
      the criteria for pneumonia are fulfilled, the trial will be terminated.

      All the subjects are followed up for four weeks or until outcome is reached (i.e. pneumonia).
      Mode of tube feeding on discharge will be decided by the attending physicians, patients and
      family members.
