  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to assess the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of efavirenz
      (EFV) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected subjects on stable
      antiretroviral regimens containing EFV, and having selected degrees of hepatic impairment or
      normal hepatic function.

The duration of efavirenz administration was 2 days and participants were admitted to the clinical facility for this period. Mild hepatic impairment (grade A) is defined as a Child-Pugh (CP) total score of 5-6. The CP classification assesses 5 hepatic parameters (total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites and encephalopathy) on a scale of 1 (mild or none) to 3 (most severe). Total score range is 5 (mild) to 15 (severe).</description>

          <description>Participants were administered a dose of 600 mg once daily (capsules or tablets) of efavirenz, either in the morning (at approximately 9:00 AM) or before bed time (at approximately 9:00 PM), on an empty stomach. The duration of efavirenz administration was 2 days and participants were admitted to the clinical facility for this period. Mild hepatic impairment (grade A) is defined as a Child-Pugh (CP) total score of 5-6. The CP classification assesses 5 hepatic parameters (total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites and encephalopathy) on a scale of 1 (mild or none) to 3 (most severe). Total score range is 5 (mild) to 15 (severe).</description>

The CP classification assesses 5 hepatic parameters (total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites and encephalopathy) on a scale of 1 (mild or none) to 3 (most severe). Total score range is 5 (mild) to 15 (severe).</description>

The following urinalysis MA definitions specify the criteria for MAs in the data presented. The presence of white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine was graded on a scale: 0 = no cells present (negative); trace =a small number of cells present; then 1+, 2+, 3+ and 4+, denoting increasingly “positive” urine results (ie, WBCs/RBCs present in the urine). The MA for both WBCs and RBCs was &gt;= 2+ (or, if pre-treatment value &gt;=2+, then &gt;= 4+).</description>

Mild hepatic impairment (grade A) is defined as a Child-Pugh (CP) total score of 5-6.

            <title>EFV600mg Participants With Mild Hepatic Impairment</title>
            <description>Participants were administered a dose of 600 mg once daily (capsules or tablets) of efavirenz, either in the morning (at approximately 9:00 AM) or before bed time (at approximately 9:00 PM), on an empty stomach. The duration of efavirenz administration was 2 days and participants were admitted to the clinical facility for this period. Mild hepatic impairment (grade A) is defined as a Child-Pugh (CP) total score of 5-6. The CP classification assesses 5 hepatic parameters (total serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time, ascites and encephalopathy) on a scale of 1 (mild or none) to 3 (most severe). Total score range is 5 (mild) to 15 (severe).</description>

The duration of efavirenz administration was 2 days and participants were admitted to the clinical facility for this period. Participants who were on an off-label reduced dose of efavirenz (eg, 400 mg) continued on the reduced dose. Severe hepatic impairment (grade C) is defined as a CP total score of 10-15.</description>
