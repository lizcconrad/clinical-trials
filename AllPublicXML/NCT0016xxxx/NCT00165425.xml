      The main purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to put into practice a
      cardiac screening program for survivors of Hodgkin's disease. In this study, we would also
      like to screen for cardiac risk factors that can be modified either through life-style
      changes or medications, to uncover significant abnormal heart findings in which treatments
      may be needed, and to see if there is a link between cardiac health and quality of life.

      -  On the day of the patient's scheduled follow-up visit with their oncologist, additional
           blood work will be obtained and the patient will fill out questionnaires concerning
           their general health and assessing quality of life.

        -  A separate cardiology visit with a preventative cardiologist will be performed. At this
           visit, the patient will undergo a Stress Echocardiogram.

        -  A Stress Echocardiogram is made up of three parts: Resting echo study, stress test and
           repeat echo while the heart is still beating fast.

        -  A resting echo provides the baseline examination and demonstrates the size and function
           of various chambers of the heart.

        -  The stress test involves exercise using a treadmill or a stationary bike. In patients
           who are unable to complete a high level of exercise due to physical limitations, stress
           to the heart is provided by a pharmaceutical or chemical stimulation to the heart.
           Exercise is started at a slower, warm-up speed and then increased every 3 minutes.
           Exercise is abruptly stopped once the patient exceeds 85% of the target rate. EKG
           recordings are made every minute of exercise and then again after exercise is stopped.
           Blood pressure is recorded at three minute intervals during exercise and then again at
           rest.

        -  Immediately after exercise is stopped, the patient will undergo a repeat echocardiogram.

        -  If no cardiac abnormalities are detected, the screening tests will be repeated every 3
           years, if the patient is less than 10 years out from their initial treatment. If the
           patient is more than 10 years from initial treatment, then the tests will be repeated at
           approximately 18 months from the initial screening and once more at the end of the third
           year.
