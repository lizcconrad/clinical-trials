      A prospective randomized study to compare the adjunctive use of high dose omeprazole infusion
      against scheduled second endoscopy in prevention of peptic ulcer rebleeding after therapeutic
      endoscopy.

      We have previously performed a prospective randomized controlled trial on the effect of
      scheduled second endoscopy upon peptic ulcer rebleeding. We found that the rate of recurrent
      bleeding was significantly reduced from 13.8% to 5% with a scheduled second endoscopy and
      appropriate therapy performed within 24 hours after initial hemostasis.

      When we look at the studies in the literature employing proton pump inhibitors (PPI) infusion
      after primary endoscopic therapy, we found that there was also a significant reduction in the
      rate of rebleeding, the number of operation performed and the transfusion requirement.

      Controversy exists regarding the optimal strategy to minimize recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding
      after successful endoscopic hemostasis. A recent cost-effective analysis on various
      strategies showed that selective scheduled second endoscopy strategy was probably the most
      effective and least expensive to prevent recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding.

      We conduct a randomized trial on the cost-effectiveness of using omeprazole infusion vs
      scheduled second endoscopy on the management of bleeding peptic ulcers.
