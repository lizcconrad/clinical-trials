  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the optimum injection rate for E7337 (Iomeron 350) in dynamic CT in patients who
      have hepatic lesions.The primary endpoint for efficacy is the contrast enhancement effect in
      the early arterial phase, and the primary safety endpoints are warming sensation and vascular
      pain.

        Inclusion Criteira:

          -  Patients scheduled for a dynamic CT scan of the liver who have at least one hepatic
             lesion that has been confirmed by diagnostic imaging (ultrasonography, etc.) between 1
             and 35 days before the start of the study treatment.

          -  Patients who are 20 years or older at the time of obtaining informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Items that may affect the safety evaluation of E7337

               1. Patients who have undergone or are scheduled to undergo an examination using
                  another contrast agent between 7 days before administration of E7337 and the time
                  of follow-up examinations on Day 8 after administration.

               2. Patients for whom follow-ups seem to be difficult to conduct until the time of
                  examination on Day 8 (i.e. when it may fail to evaluate delayed adverse drug
                  reactions).

               3. Patients who have undergone or are scheduled to undergo surgical treatment or a
                  therapy such as percutaneous ethanol injection therapy, percutaneous microwave
                  coagulation therapy, radiofrequency ablation, or transcatheter arterial
                  embolization, etc., from the time diagnostic imaging such as abdominal
                  ultrasonography is performed up until follow-up examinations are conducted on Day
                  8 after administration.

               4. Patients who continuously need to take analgesics between the morning of
                  administration of E7337 and the completion of CT examinations.

               5. Patients who are currently participating in another clinical study.

               6. Patients who participated in another clinical study within 3 months prior to
                  providing informed consent for this study.

               7. Patients weighing less than 55 kg (body weight at the time of obtaining informed
                  consent).

          -  General concerns relating to the safety of the subject.

               1. Patients in the acute stage with clinically unstable symptoms, or in a
                  life-threatening condition (when it is expected that emergency treatment is
                  required between the time of registration and the end of the follow-up period, or
                  when the patient is not expected to survive for 3 months following administration
                  of E7337, etc.)

               2. Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to iodine or iodinated contrast
                  agents.

                  described in Appendix 5, shock, cyanosis, peripheral circulatory insufficiency,
                  ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or complete atrioventricular
                  block)

               5. Patients with serious hepatopathy (symptoms of liver failure [fulminant
                  hepatitis] such as a disturbance of consciousness corresponding to grade 3 in the
                  Criteria for Grading Adverse Drug Reactions of Medicinal Products in Appendix 5).

               6. Patients with moderate or serious nephropathy (acute or chronic renal failure,
                  hydronephrosis, nephrotic syndrome, or uremia with serum creatinine levels of 2.0
                  mg/dL or above, corresponding to grade 2 or above in the Criteria for Grading
                  Adverse Drug Reactions of Medicinal Products in Appendix 5).

               7. Patients with bronchial asthma

               8. Patients with acute pancreatitis

               9. Patients with macroglobulinemia
