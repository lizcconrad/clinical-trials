  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) is important for the immune system and may interact with
      different childhood vaccinations. We have hypothesized that the improved survival after VAS
      may depend on vitamin A amplifying the non-specific immune modulation induced by
      vaccinations.

      In the present study we used information collected in connection with a national vitamin A
      campaign in Guinea-Bissau during which different doses of VAS was provided together with
      missing doses of DTP, OPV, and measles vaccines. We aimed to study the potential interactions
      between VAS and vaccine type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) acts as an adjuvant to vaccines, and VAS has been shown to
      enhance both cellular and humoral immune responses in animals and in humans. Routine
      childhood vaccinations have recently been shown to have important non-targeted effects on
      mortality, i.e. effects that cannot be explained merely by the prevention of the targeted
      disease. We have hypothesized that the improved survival after VAS may depend not only on the
      prevention of vitamin A deficiency, but also on vitamin A amplifying the non-specific immune
      modulation induced by routine vaccinations.

      In the present study we used information collected in connection with a national vitamin A
      campaign in Guinea-Bissau during which different doses of VAS was provided together with
      missing doses of DTP, OPV, and measles vaccines. We aimed to study the potential interactions
      between VAS and vaccine type.
