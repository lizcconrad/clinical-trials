  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good or bad, that thalidomide and
      temodar have on patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Patients will receive thalidomide orally once daily continuously unless they experience
           significant side effects. Temodar is given orally once a day for one week, followed by a
           one week break period. This one week on/one week off schedule will continue for the
           duration of treatment unless there are significant side effects.

        -  After eight weeks (2 cycles) a CT scan will be performed to see how the treatment has
           affected the patient's tumor. Patients will continue taking the study drug unless there
           is evidence of tumor growth.

        -  Regular blood tests will be done weekly during the first two months to make sure that
           the treatment is not resulting in serious side effects. If there are no side effects
           during the first two months, the blood tests may decrease in frequency to every two
           weeks.

        -  Immediately after the patient has completed the study they will be evaluated by physical
           exam, blood work, and a CT scan. The follow-up will consist of clinic visits and phone
           calls every 3 months.
