      The RAP Program is conducting a research study of the antipsychotic medication Aripiprazole.
      This drug has been approved for treating symptoms associated with schizophrenia and is
      associated with fewer side effects. This study will explore how well Aripiprazole treats
      symptoms of early-onset psychotic disorders as well as symptoms that may indicate risk for
      such disorders, including unusual thoughts, suspiciousness, perceptual abnormalities, social
      isolation, and sudden changes in functioning.

      During the 12-week study, eligible patients are seen 7-9 times by research raters and
      psychiatrists. These visits include side effect monitoring, scheduled medication increases,
      and ratings designed to measure subtle improvement of symptoms. Monthly blood and urine
      samples are collected for safety and substance abuse monitoring, and neuropsychological
      testing is conducted at the first and last appointments. Participants are compensated for
      their participation and receive medication and study-related visits at no cost during the
      trial. Depending on their level of response to the medication, participants may also be
      eligible for a 3-month extension phase.
