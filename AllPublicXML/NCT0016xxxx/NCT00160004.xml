  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by
      amongst others asymmetric muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency and spasticity. The
      disease is usually fatal within 2-3 years and until now there is no cure. ALS patients are
      usually supported by a multidisciplinary team. One of the members of this team is the
      physical therapist. The aim of physical therapy might be to enhance or to preserve
      cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength. Some authors suggest, however, that a moderate to
      high intensive exercise programme might lead to overuse weakness (an undesired fast
      progression of muscle weakness). The primary objective of this study is therefore to
      investigate whether regular moderate to high intensity exercise program in ALS can maintain
      or optimize cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength. A secondary objective is to
      investigate whether such a programme leads to overuse weakness and if there is a positive
      influence on patient's disability, fatigue and quality of life.
