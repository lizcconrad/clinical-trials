  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral T cell lymphoma and advanced cutaneous T cell lymphomas are aggressive and
      refractory diseases that are generally treated with chemotherapy. Despite current treatment
      modalities, only a subset of patients will be cured by the treatment. In this study, four
      chemotherapeutic agents (L-asparaginase, Methotrexate, Doxil, and Prednisone) will be
      administered in a combination regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory Peripheral
      and/or advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Each one of these individual drugs have been shown
      to have activity to lymphomas. The objective of the study is to determine if the combination
      of these chemotherapy agents results in higher response and cure rates in this patient
      population. This will be a single institutional study which will included 32 patients in the
      Peripheral T cell lymphoma group and 32 patients in the Cutaneous T cell lymphoma group.
