  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endothelium plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and regulation of
      blood flow. Nitric oxide (NO) is the most important known endothelium-derived vasodilating
      factor. Prospective studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia impairs endothelial function
      in different vascular beds. Lowering total cholesterol and particularly LDL-cholesterol with
      statins leads to an improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the forearm
      vasculature. There is strong evidence to suggest that the benefit is not merely related to
      the decrease in cholesterol-levels. A recent study in the forearm vasculature demonstrated
      that short-term lipid-lowering therapy improves endothelial function and NO availability
      already after 3 days of lipid lowering therapy. Whether endothelial function in the renal
      vasculature of hypercholesterolemic patients is similarly influenced has not yet been
      addressed adequately. In the present study we investigate whether lipid lowering therapy with
      rosuvastatin alters renal endothelial function, as assessed by systemic infusion of the NO
      synthase inhibitor L-NMMA, after 3 and 42 days of therapy.
