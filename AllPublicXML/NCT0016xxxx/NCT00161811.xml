        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects will be eligible for participation in this study if they:

          -  are &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years old on the day of screening (for Stratum A only);

          -  are &gt; 60 years old on the day of screening (for Stratum B only);

          -  are clinically healthy (in a physical condition such that the physician would have no
             reservations vaccinating with an influenza vaccine outside the scope of a clinical
             study);

          -  will reliably keep a daily record of symptoms;

          -  understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions, and give written informed
             consent;

          -  if female and capable of bearing children - have a negative pregnancy test (urine)
             result at study entry and agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the
             duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from participation in this study if they:

          -  have received any influenza vaccine for the 2003/2004 season and/or for the 2004/2005
             season;

          -  suffer from any kind of immunodeficiency;

          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids, chemotherapeutics) that can be expected to influence
             the normal immunologic functions;

          -  have a history of inflammatory or degenerative neurological disease (e.g. Guillain
             Barré, multiple sclerosis);

          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 30 days of study entry;

          -  have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of study entry;

          -  have a history of any vaccine-related contraindicating event (e.g. anaphylaxis or
             other known contraindications);

          -  have a rash or dermatological condition which may interfere with injection site
             reaction rating;

          -  have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse;

          -  are unable to lead an independent life either physically or mentally;

          -  were administered an investigational drug within six weeks prior to study entry;

          -  are concurrently participating in a clinical study including the administration of an
             investigational product;

          -  if female, are pregnant or lactating.
