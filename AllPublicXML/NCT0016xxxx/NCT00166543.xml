  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out how safe TAS-108 is and how well TAS-108 works on
      recurrent or recurrent inoperable breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of TAS-108 administered
      in postmenopausal patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent inoperable or
      progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who have previously responded to one or two standard
      endocrine therapies, with or without one prior chemotherapy.
