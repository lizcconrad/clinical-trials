    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the short - term effects of clozapine on alcohol use
      in persons with schizophrenia and an alcohol use disorder. The hypothesis is that clozapine
      will have greater efficacy in reducing alcohol use than other antipsychotic medications.
