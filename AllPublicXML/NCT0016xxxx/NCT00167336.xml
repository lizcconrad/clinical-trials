  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop and refine an observational assessment tool called the Personal
      Computer Keyboard Style (PeCKS). When completed this assessment tool will provide researchers
      and clinicians with a valid and reliable method to describe computer keyboarding postures and
      kinematics.

      The proposed study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will be devoted to developing and
      refining an instrument, the Pre-PeCKS, into a valid and reliable data gathering observational
      tool. In Phase II the Pre-PeCKS will be used to develop a predictive model that can
      discriminate between those with and without MSD-UE. The model developed will be used to
      select the construction and weighting of the subscales of the final instrument, the PeCKS.

      Phase I - PeCKS psychometrics - reliability and validity Specific Aim 1: To evaluate inter-
      and intra-rater reliability and the concurrent criterion-related validity of the Pre-PeCKS.

      H.1.1 The Pre-PeCKS will demonstrate acceptable reliability for the following tests:

      H.1.1a. Intra-rater reliability (stability within one rater) H.1.1b. Inter-rater reliability
      (stability across raters) H.1.1c. Test of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) (stability
      across items)

      H.1.2 The Pre-PeCKS will demonstrate good concurrent criterion-related validity - Parameters
      selected by raters using the Pre-PeCKS will significantly correlate with biomechanical
      measures (VICON™ motion recording and analysis system and force plate):

      H.1.2.a. Angles and displacements identified by raters using the Pre-PeCKS will correlate
      with angles and displacements measured by the VICON™ motion recording and analysis system;
      H.1.2.b. Number of times spent performing actions as specified by raters using the Pre-PeCKS
      will correlate with number of times measured by a VICON™ motion recording and analysis
      system; H.1.2.c. Level of forceful keying as specified by raters using the Pre-PeCKS will
      correlate with levels of forceful keying measured with a force plate under the keyboard.

      Phase II - PeCKS psychometrics - diagnostic tool development

      Specific Aim 2: To use information gathered using the Pre-PeCKS to develop a diagnostic
      instrument that can identify those with and without MSD-UE. The major hypothesis related to
      Specific Aim 2 is:

      H.2.1. Using information gathered with the Pre-PeCKS and knowing the disease outcome of the
      subjects, predictive models can be developed that discriminate between those who do and do
      not have MSD-UE.

      This three-year study will be divided into two phases. Phase I will be devoted to developing
      and refining an instrument, the Pre-PeCKS, into a valid and reliable data gathering
      observational tool. In Phase II the Pre-PeCKS will be used to develop a predictive model that
      can discriminate between those with and without MSD-UE. The model developed will be used to
      select the construction and weighting of the subscales of the final instrument, the PeCKS.
      The specific aim of Phase I is to evaluate the inter- and intra- rater reliability and the
      concurrent criterion-related validity of the Pre-PeCKS; the specific aim of Phase II is to
      use information gathered using the Pre-PeCKS to develop a diagnostic instrument that can
      identify those with and without MSD-UE. In Phase I, 50 subjects will be digitally recorded
      while typing while at the same time the kinematics of their hands will be recorded using a
      VICON™ motion analysis system and a keyboard force plate. The video of the typing performance
      will be rated by independent raters using the Pre-PeCKS and reliability statistics will be
      calculated. Concurrent validity will be obtained by comparing the results of the VICON™ with
      the results of the Pre-PeCKS. In Phase II, 20 typists with MSD-UE and 20 typists without
      MSD-UE will be rated using the Pre-PeCKS. Variables from the Pre-PeCKS along with other
      variables of interest will be used to build models that can discriminate between those with
      and without MSD-UE. The best model will be used to assign weights to Pre-PeCKS parameters and
      to develop how subscores will be combined to best identify those with MSD-UE. This
      information will be integrated into the final tool, the PeCKS. The PeCKS can then be used to
      identify an individual who have keyboarding styles that have been associated with MSD-UE.
