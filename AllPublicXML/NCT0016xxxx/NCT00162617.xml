      To examine the effect of two different transfusion regimens on rehabilitation after hip
      fracture surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of liberal vs restrictive transfusion regimens after hip fracture surgery is
      unresolved. Liberal transfusion regimens (transfusion trigger hgb. 6.25 mmol/l) leads to an
      increased use of blood products but may impact positively on rehabilitation outcome, a
      restrictive transfusion trigger (hbg. 5.0 mmol/l) saves blood products but may also impair
      postoperative rehabilitation and outcome. the study randomizes 120 elderly patients with hip
      fractures to either a restrictive or a liberal perioperative transfusion therapy and measures
      postoperative rehabilitation outcomes within a well defined multimodal rehabilitation
      regimen.
