  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with severe heart failure need immediate appropriate care. New and better drugs are
      constantly being developed. As these drugs are approved for adult use, they are used
      off-label for children. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages clinical studies of
      drugs in children to further extend appropriate use of new medicines.

      This study involves nesiritide, which was approved as a congestive heart failure treatment in
      adults in August 2001. The investigators' use of this drug in a pediatric population with
      severe heart failure has been encouraging. The investigators now wish to formally determine
      the pharmacokinetic and safety of Nesiritide in children.

      The investigators will enroll 30 patients who are in the cardiac intensive care unit with
      severe heart failure. The data collected will include weights, vital signs, laboratory
      results, and echocardiography results. A research lab test called B-type natriuretic peptide
      (BNP) will be done several times during this study. If the patient still has an intravenous
      (IV) catheter, the blood sample will be taken from the IV. If the patient does not have an
      IV, the sample will be taken from a fingerstick.

      The duration of the study will be the first 2 days of the patient's stay in the cardiac
      intensive care unit and thru discharge to evaluate the endpoint safety of Nesiritide.
      Additional information will also be collected if patient gets re-admitted within 30 days of
      discharge.

    <textblock>
      Nesiritide (human recombinant B-type natriuretic peptide) has been recently approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration for the intravenous treatment of patients with decompensated
      congestive heart failure. Nesiritide has been studied in a broad range of patients, including
      the elderly, women, and African Americans, and patients with a history of various
      cardiovascular conditions including hypertension, diabetes, post myocardial infarction,
      atrial fibrillation/flutter, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, left ventricular diastolic
      dysfunction, and acute coronary syndrome. However, clinical experience in the pediatric
      population has been limited.

      Nesiritide is a human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) produced by recombinant technology
      having the same amino acid sequence as the naturally occurring human BNP. BNP is
      predominantly secreted by the cardiac ventricles in response to increased cardiac volume and
      pressure overload. Its pharmacologic effects include hemodynamic, neurohormonal, and renal.
      In adult studies, hemodynamic effects are characterized by balanced venous and arterial
      dilation, resulting in decreased preload and afterload demonstrated by a reduction of
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and systemic vascular
      resistance while neurohormonal effects of nesiritide favorably inhibit the
      renin-angiotension-aldosterone system, leading to decreased plasma aldosterone and
      norepinephrine levels. The renal effects most often seen with nesiritide use is increased
      urine output and lower diuretic utilization.

      There are currently no published articles discussing the use, including pharmacokinetics, of
      nesiritide in children. However, there are several centers that are currently using the drug
      - Columbus, Missouri; San Diego, California; Charleston, South Carolina; Loma Linda,
      California. Our experience in the infant after cardiac surgery and the older child with heart
      failure is encouraging. In children receiving nesiritide therapy, we noted significant
      clinical improvement with no appreciable side effects. Based on our initial experience,
      further prospective studies need to be performed in order to determine the pharmacokinetics
      and safety of using this therapy in the pediatric cohort.
