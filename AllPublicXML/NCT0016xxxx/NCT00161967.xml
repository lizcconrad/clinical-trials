  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the seropersistence of TBE antibodies in children and
      adolescents aged 1 to 15 years at the time of their first vaccination, 24 months and 34
      months after completion of primary immunization with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml (3 vaccinations
      during the predecessor study 209), as well as the immune response to a booster vaccination
      with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml or FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml administered 36 months after the third
      vaccination (in Study 209).

      Protocol amendment of October 2006: The study has been prolonged for children and adolescents
      who still showed highly positive TBE virus antibody concentrations at approximately 3 years
      after the third vaccination and therefore did not receive a booster vaccination at this time
      point. Further follow-up of TBE antibody persistence is now included for these subjects at 46
      and 58 months after the third vaccination (in Study 209), as well as a booster vaccination
      offered at either 48 or 60 months after the third vaccination (in Study 209), depending on
      individual TBE antibody levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participated in Baxter study 209 and:

          -  They and/or their parents / legal guardians understand the nature of the study and
             agree to its provisions

          -  Written informed consent is available from the parents / legal guardians according to
             national law

          -  Written informed assent is available from the child/adolescent according to age and
             capacity of understanding

          -  They received the third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml during the course of
             Baxter study 209

          -  Blood was drawn after their third vaccination during the course of Baxter study 209

          -  They showed an ELISA concentration &gt; 126 VIE U/ml and / or a NT titer &gt;=10 after the
             third vaccination in Baxter study 209

          -  They or their parents / legal guardians agree to keep a Subject Diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Received any TBE vaccination since their third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml

          -  Have a history of infection with or vaccination against other flaviviruses (Dengue
             fever, yellow fever and / or Japanese B-encephalitis virus) since their third
             vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml

          -  Are known to be HIV positive (a special HIV test is not required for the purpose of
             the study) since their third vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.25 ml

          -  Received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 30 days of the first and second
             blood draw (as applicable)

          -  Have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt; 4 liters wine / week
             or equivalent level of other alcoholic beverages)

          -  Have participated in another Baxter vaccine study within the last six months (with the
             exception of follow-up studies)

        Subjects will not be eligible for booster vaccination if they:

          -  Do not meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria

          -  Are not clinically healthy, (i.e. the physician would have reservations vaccinating
             with a TBE vaccine outside the scope of a clinical trial)

          -  Suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease) or are undergoing a form of treatment
             (e.g. systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence immunological
             functions

          -  Have shown an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since their
             third vaccination in Baxter study 209

          -  Have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of the booster vaccination if female of
             childbearing potential - are pregnant or breastfeeding before the booster vaccination
             (positive pregnancy test result at the medical examination before the booster
             vaccination)

          -  Are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including administration of
             an investigational product within six weeks prior to the booster vaccination until the
             end of the study

        Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, but have a febrile illness (body
        temperature &gt;=38.0Â°C, measured orally) at the scheduled time of vaccination will not be
        vaccinated until their body temperature returns to normal.

        Subjects who received any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the booster vaccination will
        not be vaccinated until an interval of four weeks has passed.

        If subjects received antipyretics within 4 hours prior to the intended TBE vaccination, the
        vaccination should be performed at a later time.

        Females of childbearing potential will only be vaccinated if they agree to employ adequate
        birth control measures from 4 weeks before the booster vaccination until the end of the
        study.
