  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is now the most commonly diagnosed tumor among men in the United States. Most
      patients have tumors that are confined to the prostate gland at diagnosis and are suitable
      for treatment with surgery or radiotherapy (RT) that is aimed at curing the disease.
      Nevertheless, despite recent improvements in these treatments, a large number of men continue
      to die of prostate cancer. These patients often have spread of tumor to other areas of the
      body, and are treated with hormones that produce initial tumor shrinkage. However, over time
      the tumor learns to grow despite continued hormonal treatment. Effective therapy for patients
      with hormone-resistant prostate cancer is lacking and patients often deteriorate quickly and
      die. Thus, there is a need for better treatment that cures prostate cancer at an early stage,
      and a better understanding of the biology of prostate cancer specifically with respect to
      factors that determine the effectiveness of RT, the spread of tumor and the development of
      hormone-resistant disease.

      Low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) are known to exist in many human tumors, and studies have
      shown that hypoxic tumors are less likely to be cured by RT. In addition, hypoxia may lead to
      lower cure rates following surgery, spread of cancer to other areas of the body, and changes
      in the genetic characteristics of the cancer cells that cause them to behave more
      aggressively.

      The importance of hypoxia in prostate cancer has not previously been evaluated. The aims of
      this study are to determine how often hypoxia occurs in early prostate cancer and whether
      hypoxia influences the success of RT, tumor spread beyond the prostate to bones and other
      organs and the development of hormone-resistant disease. Patients will have tumor oxygen
      levels measured using a special fine-needle electrode system prior to beginning treatment
      with either RT or the combination of hormones plus RT. The measurements will be made through
      the rectum using ultrasound to position and guide the electrode. A biopsy of the tumor will
      be obtained at the site of the measurements, and this will be used to determine how oxygen
      influences changes in the genetic character of prostate cancer cells. A total of 195 patients
      will be evaluated in this way over 3 years.

      This study will provide unique information about the behavior of prostate cancer, which may
      help explain why currently available treatments including surgery, RT and hormones fail to
      cure patients. Assuming that this study shows hypoxia to be important in prostate cancer,
      future work will focus on new anti-hypoxia treatments to be used in combination with surgery
      or RT with the aim of overcoming this obstacle and improving cure rates.
