      The purpose of this clinical study is to learn if there are any changes in how blood gets to
      your heart muscle and if your heart size changed after your heart attack.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To better understand the interactions between the abnormalities in blood supply from the small vessels of the heart to the heart muscle after a heart attack and the changes in heart size 6 months after the heart attack.</measure>

    <measure>To estimate the frequency of residual ischemia as assessed by stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients undergoing primary PCI for AMI.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To estimate the 6-month cardiac event rates (composite of death, another heart attack, hospitalization for heart failure, and irregular heart beats requiring treatment).</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the relationship between changes (from baseline) in LV systolic volume index and LVEF, as measured by gated SPECT imaging 6 months following reperfusion, and the presence and severity of residual ischemia.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To measure the performance of angiographic parameters of success of reperfusion therapy (TIMI frame count and TIMI myocardial perfusion grade) in predicting the presence of residual ischemia.</measure>
