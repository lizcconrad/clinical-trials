  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two regimen of chemotherapy used as first treatment
      for patients with larynx or hypopharynx tumors that would be treated with total laryngectomy.
      The standard treatment is a combination of 2 drugs (Cisplatin and 5FU). The aim of the study
      is to evaluate the potential benefit of the addition of a third drug (Docetaxel) in the
      chemotherapy regimen. Patients will receive 3 cycles of chemotherapy. Responders to the
      induction treatment are treated with radiation with a purpose of larynx preservation. Non
      responders patients will be treated with total laryngectomy.

      The purpose of the study is to compare two regimen of induction chemotherapy for patients
      with T3 and T4 larynx or hypopharynx carcinoma that would be treated with total laryngectomy.
      The aim of the study is to compare the standard regimen (Cisplatin + 5FU) versus the TPF
      regimen (Taxotere + Cisplatin + 5FU). Responders to the induction treatment are treated with
      radiation with a purpose of larynx preservation. Non responders patients will be treated with
      total laryngectomy followed by postoperative radiation.
