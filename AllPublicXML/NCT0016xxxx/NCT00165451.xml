  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a combination of four oral drugs (thalidomide, cyclophosphamide,
      etoposide and celecoxib) to treat patients with relapsed or progressive cancer. These drugs
      are expected to target the blood vessels that supply the tumors with what they need to grow.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Thalidomide will be given orally every evening and the daily dose will escalate until
           the patient reaches a dose on which they are comfortable and will given continuously for
           one year.

        -  Celecoxib will be given orally twice a day and escalated as tolerated for one year.

        -  Etoposide will be given orally once a day for 21 consecutive days. This medication will
           alternate with oral cyclophosphamide and will continue for one year.

        -  Cyclophosphamide will be given orally once a day for 21 consecutive days and as stated
           above will alternate with etoposide for one year.

        -  During the treatment, blood tests will be performed every three weeks except during the
           first 3 week cycle in which testing is performed every 2 weeks. Appropriate imaging
           studies will be performed every 9 weeks.

        -  The duration of treatment is one year unless the side effects are too harmful or the
           tumor grows. Treatment may be continued past one year if the drugs are well tolerated
           and disease progression has not occured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with relapsed or progressive poor prognosis tumors for which no curative
             therapy exists.

          -  Histologic confirmation of disease at diagnosis or relapse.

          -  Brain stem glioma patients who have progressed after radiation therapy do not require
             histologic confirmation. Duration of symptoms at the time of diagnosis must be less
             than 3 months and should consist of cranial nerve deficits and/or ataxia and/or long
             tract signs.

          -  Prior radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy are permitted.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status &gt;50. For infants, the Lansky play scale &gt;50% can be
             substituted.

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 2 months.

          -  No active uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, renal, or psychiatric disease defined as â‰¥
