  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the district areas of Norway patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST-elevation,
      are treated with thrombolysis. An increasing part of them receives thrombolysis before
      arrival to the local hospital.Usually these patients have been sent to an invasive center if
      thrombolysis fails or the patient gets ischemic symptoms during the stay.

      This study will compare this strategy against immediate transportation to an invasive center
      after the patient has received thrombolysis.
