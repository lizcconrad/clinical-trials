  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintenance treatment with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is the most widely recommended
      modality of treatment for long-term management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Yet
      in clinical practice treatment is commonly given in short courses on as required basis during
      symptom flare up, particularly for patients with mild to moderate GERD.

      On-demand therapy also has the potential advantage that patient does not need to take regular
      medications, thereby improving the quality of life. However, whether on-demand PPI therapy
      achieves similar efficacy of symptom control is uncertain.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and quality of life of on-demand and
      maintenance PPI regimens in long-term management of non-erosive GERD patients. The
      investigators hypothesize that on-demand PPI treatment is as effective as maintenance PPI.
