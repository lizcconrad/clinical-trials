  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of colon cleansing has a major impact on efficiency and cost of colonoscopy. A
      hand-out was made to instruct and motivate patients to adequately clean the bowel before
      colonoscopy.

      The aim of the study is to compare adequacy of bowel cleansing in hospitalized patients
      receiving the hand-out or not on the day before colonoscopy.
