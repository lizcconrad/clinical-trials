      The aim is to investigate the hypothesis that IL7-receptor polymorphisms contribute to the
      differential immune recovery of CD4 + T cells following HAART

      AIM: To examine the association between the four haplotypes of IL-7Rα gene and a cohort of
      HIV infected patients who have commenced HAART with varying CD4+ T lymphocyte responses.

      METHODS: IL-7Rα gene SNPs and haplotypes will be measured by constructing DNA pools, and PCR
      amplification and DNA sequencing. IL-7Rα expression will be examined using constitutive
      expression of IL-7Rα, IL-7Rα gene expression, and inducible expression of IL7Rα.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women at least 18 years of age

          -  First antiretroviral regimen composed of HAART as defined by at least three
             antiretrovirals

          -  Controlled viremia for a period of at least 12 months following commencement of HAART.
             Controlled viremia is defined as HIV viral load of ≤ 500 copies/mL on bDNA testing
             (versions 2 and 3) and &lt;400 copies/ml measured by RT-PCR assay by 6 months treatment.

          -  CD4 cell count &lt;500 at commencement of HAART

          -  Measurement of CD4+ cell count on at least 3 time points, in the 12 months post
             commencement of HAART.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclude patients treated for HIV seroconversion illness

          -  Exclude patients on immunomodulatory therapy such as IL-2, hydroxyurea or prednisolone
             or who have received an HIV therapeutic vaccine
