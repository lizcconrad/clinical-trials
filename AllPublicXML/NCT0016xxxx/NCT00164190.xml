    <textblock>
      Background:

      In Canada, most patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) present to hospitals without
      cardiac catheterization facilities. Thrombolytic therapy remains the standard-of-care in
      these centres. However, thrombolytic therapy achieves normal coronary flow and myocardial
      perfusion in less than 50% of patients, and is associated with reocclusion, reinfarction, and
      recurrent ischemia. Primary angioplasty results in more complete reperfusion and lower rates
      of reocclusion, reinfarction and recurrent ischemia, but is not available in most centres.
      Although patients can be transferred for primary angioplasty, long transport times are
      associated with worse outcomes. An alternative strategy, described as facilitated
      angioplasty, involves administration of thrombolytic therapy at the community hospital
      followed by immediate transport for angioplasty. This approach achieves the benefits of
      primary angioplasty without delaying treatment. A well-conducted, prospective, randomized
      trial is needed to compare this strategy of facilitated angioplasty with standard
      thrombolytic therapy.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of routine transfer of patients with AMI to
      an angioplasty centre immediately after thrombolysis for coronary angiography and
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

      Hypothesis:

      A strategy of routine transfer of patients with AMI to an angioplasty centre immediately
      after thrombolysis for coronary angiography and percutaneous intervention is associated with
      a significantly lower incidence of the composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia,
      heart failure, and shock at 30 days compared with the conventional strategy of thrombolysis
      with transfer reserved for failed reperfusion and/or development of shock.

      Research Plan:

      Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and high-risk characteristics presenting to
      community hospitals without cardiac catheterization facilities will receive thrombolysis with
      tenecteplase and heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) and will then be
      randomized to one of two strategies: facilitated PCI or standard treatment (thrombolysis with
      provisional rescue PCI). In the facilitated PCI group, patients will be transferred
      immediately to an angioplasty centre for urgent cardiac catheterization, and PCI if
      appropriate. In the standard treatment group, patients will only undergo urgent angiography
      for evidence of failed reperfusion and/or development of cardiogenic shock. The primary
      endpoint will be the composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, heart failure, and
      shock at 30 days.

      treatment group, patients will only undergo urgent angiography for evidence of failed
      reperfusion and/or development of cardiogenic shock.
