      This research is meant to evaluate the effectiveness of two different prevention programs for
      post-acute management of rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Park Nicollet Clinic and the Institute for Clinical Systems Integration (ICSI) have developed
      evidence-based care guidelines and intervention strategies including degenerative joint
      disease. Included in these guidelines are risk factors for increased limitations, obesity and
      physical activity.

      The aims of this research are to modify well-established weight management techniques and
      physical activity promotion interventions according to ICSI recommendations, implement the
      interventions in a diverse patient population, demonstrate the short and long term impact of
      the interventions.

      The approach will be an individual randomized controlled trial of 400 patients, 200 each in a
      coach-supported intervention, 200 in a self-directed intervention.
