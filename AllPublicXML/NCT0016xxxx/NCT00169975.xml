  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A magnetocardiograph (MCG) is a device capable of recording of magnetic fields arising from
      the electrical activity of the heart with traces similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG). This
      system was developed as a noninvasive, non-contact diagnostics of obstructive coronary artery
      disease (CAD), and especially of lack of oxygen in the heart as in a heart attack. The
      overall objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of this MCG device for the
      detection and diagnosis of lack of oxygen of the heart in patients with chest pain.

    <textblock>
      Coronary Artery Disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. The non invasive
      detection of Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS's) remains a clinical challenge. Electrocardiogram
      (ECG) may only diagnose myocardial infarction in 50 % of the cases. Magnetocardiography is a
      new and noninvasive method capable of measuring and mapping the magnetic field that is
      generated during the cardiac cycle. The electric current is affected by ischemic damage,
      which in turn alters the magnetic field. The magnetic field is not affected by body tissues,
      unlike the surface current measurements in ECG.

      Comparisons: The diagnostic accuracy of the CMI-Magnetocardiograph will be compared to that
      of the ECG in diagnosing High Risk Unstable Angina.

    <description>MCG and ECG recordings sequentially at the four pre-defined bed positions and watches the real-time magnetocardiogram traces on the computer screen. At each position, nine sensors record MCG data, thus forming a 3 x 3 point grid square with point-to-point separation of 40 mm. The number of cardiac cycles recorded at each position should be adequate for signal averaging. Recording time per position is typically 90 seconds. At the end of 4 sequential recordings, raw, unfiltered MCG data are stored.</description>
