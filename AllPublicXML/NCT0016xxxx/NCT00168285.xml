  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a highly disabling group of conditions including
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute and chronic interstitial pneumonias, connective
      tissue diseases and sarcoidosis. People with ILD frequently experience breathlessness on
      exertion, which limits their ability to undertake daily activities. People with ILD report
      very poor quality of life due to low levels of physical functioning and vitality, and high
      levels of breathlessness and fatigue. There are few treatments for ILD and those that are
      available have limited impact on quality of life.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of Pulmonary Rehabilitation, which consists of
      specialised exercise training for people with lung disease, on exercise capacity and quality
      of life in people with ILD. We hypothesis that exercise training will result in reduced
      dyspnoea, improved exercise tolerance and enhanced quality of life.

      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a highly disabling group of conditions including
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute and chronic interstitial pneumonias, connective
      tissue diseases and sarcoidosis. People with ILD frequently experience breathlessness on
      exertion, which limits their ability to undertake daily activities and reduces health-related
      quality of life.Available treatments for ILD have proved largely ineffective, offering no
      improvement in survival and demonstrating only limited impact on quality of life.

      Aims of the Research

        1. Evaluate the effects of Pulmonary Rehabilitation on exercise capacity and quality of
           life in patients with ILD

        2. Determine the physiological response to Pulmonary Rehabilitation in patients with ILD

        3. Determine the relationship between the aetiology and severity of ILD and the effects of
           Pulmonary Rehabilitation.

      Comparisons: 8 weeks exercise training compared to control group (maximal exercise capacity,
      functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea, quality of life).
