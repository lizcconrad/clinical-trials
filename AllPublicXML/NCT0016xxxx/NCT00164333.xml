      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of TAP, a behavioral intervention, in
      improving sexual safety and treatment adherence among gay and bisexual men infected with HIV.
      It is hypothesized that those who are in the intervention group will report reductions in
      unprotected sex with HIV-negative and unknown-status partners; and will show stricter
      adherence to their treatment regimens, compared to the individuals in the standard-of-care,
      control group.
