      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the proposed cognitive-behavioural
      intervention is effective for DSH patients in the age group 15-35 years. In addition, we will
      examine which elements derived from the theoretical model can explain the efficacy of the
      intervention.

      1. The development of treatment interventions for non-fatal deliberate self-harm (DSH)
           among young people has received little attention in scientific literature and in mental
           health care. This is surprising, considering the relatively high rates of
           hospital-referred DSH among adolescents reported in epidemiological studies (Arensman et
           al., 1995; Hawton et al., 1997; Hawton et al., 1998; Schmidtke et al., 1996). On the
           basis of a four-year monitoring study (1989-1992) in the area of Leiden, the average
           rate of DSH among females aged 15-24 was 179 per 100,000 and for males in this age group
           the average rate was 91 per 100,000 (Arensman et al., 1995). General population surveys
           among adolescents show a self-reported life-time prevalence of 2 to 5 percent (Kienhorst
           et al., 1990; De Wilde et al., 2000). Reports from other European countries indicate an
           increase of DSH in adolescents and young adults (15-30 years), in particular in young
           males (Hawton et al., 1997; Schmidtke et al., 1996).

           DSH is operationalized as dysfunctional behaviour associated with a heterogeneity of
           psychological or psychiatric disorders e.g., affective disorders, anxiety disorders,
           substance abuse, and eating disorders (Arensman &amp; Kerkhof, 1996; Arensman, 1997; Ellis
           et al., 1996; Engstroem et al., 1996; Kienhorst et al., 1993). However, a common finding
           is that depressive symptoms (observer- or self-rated) and major depression appear to be
           highly prevalent among young DSH patients (Burgess et al., 1998; Goldston et al., 1998;
           Harrington et al., 1994). In these studies, co-morbidity with other types of
           psychopathology also appeared to be relatively high.

           The risk of repeated DSH is highest in the first year following an episode of DSH. The
           repetition rates among young DSH patients vary from 10% (Goldacre &amp; Hawton, 1985) to 27%
           (Arensman, 1997) in hospital referred DSH patients. Among DSH patients, prevention of
           the first subsequent repeated episode of DSH is important in order to prevent a pattern
           of chronic repetition.

           Research findings with regard to risk factors associated with repeated DSH are fairly
           consistent. Among young DSH patients, those with an increased risk for repeated DSH are
           characterised by suicidal ideation, depression (Harrington et al., 2000; Hawton et al.,
           1999), hopelessness (Brent, 1987; Hawton et al., 1999), impulsivity (Kashden et al.,
           1993), disturbance of autobiographical memory (Evans et al., 1992), problems with peers
           or other relationships, frequent or chronic stress and problem-solving deficits (De
           Wilde et al., 2000; Hawton et al., in press; Rudd et al., 1998).

           Despite the fact that many studies report these correlates, the available treatment
           studies, which merely comprise evaluations of general treatment interventions, often
           without a randomised controlled design, have not incorporated knowledge about risk
           factors (Hawton et al., 1998). In addition, existing explanatory and treatment models do
           not address the heterogeneity of the group of DSH patients. This is surprising,
           considering the variety of characteristics and problems of DSH patients. So far, most
           models focus on single psychiatric problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders.

           The aim of this study is to present and test a therapeutic approach for DSH that goes
           beyond single psychiatric diagnoses and that addresses the heterogeneity of DSH
           patients. It will combine elements from cognitive-behavioural therapy, problem-solving
           interventions and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), since these approaches fit in
           with the needs of different DSH patients. Patients in which depressive thoughts and
           beliefs predominate may especially profit from the elements from cognitive therapy,
           while patients who primarily experience problems in regulating their emotions may
           especially profit from the elements from DBT. Patients in whom skills deficits
           predominate may especially profit from the elements from problem solving interventions.
           In addition to this combined treatment approach, attention will be given to specific
           developmental issues that play a role among adolescent DSH patients. Furthermore,
           knowledge of risk factors for (repetition of) DSH will be incorporated in the treatment.

           The model of the aetiology and maintenance of DSH on which the treatment protocol is
           based addresses interactions between cognitive, affective, behavioural and interpersonal
           aspects of DSH. As in other stress-process models, the relationship between
           vulnerability factors (negative family experiences and biological characteristics),
           triggering factors, and DSH is mediated by moderating variables (interpersonal
           problems/lack of social support and individual characteristics: cognitive distortions,
           affective dysregulation and skills deficits) and mediating variables (negative
           appraisal, inadequate coping and psychological reactions such as impulsivity). In
           accordance with Van Praag (1996), we assume that if a person with a marginally
           functioning serotonergic-system experiences a stressful event he or she is not able to
           cope with, the production of the stress-hormone cortisol increases, which decreases the
           level of serotonin. Reduced serotonin activity in the prefrontal cortex as examined by
           neuroimaging techniques, may be involved in the destabilisation of the regulation of
           fear, aggression (Van Praag, 1996) and impulsivity (Mann, 1999), since this area of the
           brain mediates behavioural inhibition. Increased impulsivity may therefore increase the
           risk of DSH (Van Heeringen, 2001). We assume that in some patients impulsivity and
           carelessness will be the primary features associated with DSH. In particular, if
           impulsivity and feelings of hopelessness co-occur, the risk of DSH appears to be high.
           The recognition of the association between hopelessness and DSH, described here, is in
           line with the cognitive approach of Williams (2002) stating that over time, among people
           who perceive they cannot change the stressful situation they are in, despair gradually
           gains the upper hand and they will show more marked symptoms of depression and
           hopelessness in particular.The approach as outlined by us, will have advantages compared
           to approaches based on single psychiatric problems, since it combines the main
           biological, cognitive, affective, behavioural and interpersonal aspects of DSH.

        2. The wide range of problems faced by young people who harm themselves calls for a variety
           of different treatment strategies, varying from intensive care for those at very high
           risk of suicide, to brief interventions for the group of patients in whom DSH appears to
           have been a transient response to temporary difficulties and who have few other problems
           (Harrington, 2001). One of the most important obstacles to treating DSH patients that
           may play a role in almost every treatment is compliance (Heard, 2000 in: Hawton and Van
           Heeringen). Another obstacle in treating DSH patients is the limited availability of
           research data on effectiveness of therapy for DSH, especially of randomised controlled
           trials. In the section that follows the most common treatment approaches for DSH will be
           discussed. Attention will be given to what is known about the effectiveness in terms of
           reduction of repeated episodes of DSH. Cognitive therapy for DSH patients generally
           focuses on their tendency to evaluate events and the presence and the future in such a
           way that this results in the feeling of being entrapped (because of difficulties in
           coping) and hopelessness (because they have great difficulty in generating positive
           future events) (Heard, 2000 in: Hawton and van Heeringen). Cognitive and cognitive
           behavioural therapies directed at cognitive restructuring seem to be promising in
           successfully treating patients who harm themselves deliberately (Hawton et al.,
           1998).Given that problem-solving deficits appear to be related to increased risk of
           self-harm (Orbach et al., 1990), the most commonly used technique for older adolescents
           is brief problem oriented counselling, which is a form of cognitive therapy. While
           problem-solving therapy seems to be promising to improve depression, hopelessness and
           problem-solving skills (Towsend et al., 2001), it is still unclear whether
           problem-solving therapy can help not only address current problems but also longstanding
           deficiencies in problem-solving skills. Current research focuses almost exclusively on
           solving real or hypothetical problems in relationships with other people, yet one of the
           major issues for suicidal patients is how they can solve the problem of how to gain
           control over their feelings. Linehan (1993a, 1993b) developed an intensive treatment
           programme for patients with borderline personality disorder, called Dialectical
           Behaviour Therapy (DBT). This treatment method focuses on teaching skills that will help
           people to regulate their emotions and that stress the acceptance of pain and crisis. In
           a review by Heard (2000 in: Hawton and van Heeringen), in general, a decrease in
           repeated DSH was found among patients in DBT treatment. Group therapy seems to be
           promising as a treatment for adolescents who repeatedly harm themselves. However, larger
           studies are required to assess more accurately the efficacy of this intervention (Wood,
           Trainor, Rothwell, Moore, Harrington, 2001). No consensus on how to treat DSH medically
           has been reached yet. As for the psychological treatments, most studies on the efficacy
           on psychopharmacological treatments are too small to detect significant effects. So far,
           it appears that the most promising treatments are high doses of Serotonin Specific
           Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), and, in selected cases atypical neuroleptics. SSRIs are
           probably the first line medical treatment (Kavoussi et al., 1994). Tricyclics do not
           seem to be effective for child and adolescent depressions and are toxic in overdose
           (Harrington, 2001). In conclusion, it can be said that there still remains considerable
           uncertainty about which type of psychosocial and medical treatments of DSH patients is
           most effective, inclusion of insufficient numbers of patients in trials being the main
           limiting factor. However, cognitive-behavioural therapies and problem-solving therapies
           and DBT seem to be promising. The present study will incorporate elements from
           cognitive-behavioural therapy, problem-solving interventions and DBT.

        3. Study design. The subjects will be randomly allocated to the cognitive-behavioural
           intervention (experimental group) and routine aftercare (control group), stratified with
           respect to repetition of DSH and gender.The study subjects are patients aged 15-35 who
           are referred to the Leiden University Medical Center, to MCH Westeinde (The Hague), or
           to local centers mental healthcare in Leiden (Rivierduinen)and The Hague (Parnassia
           PMC), following an act of DSH. DSH patients will be included if they recently have been
           engaged in an act of DSH including overdoses of medication, ingestion of chemical
           substances and self-inflicted injuries according to the definition which is used in the
           WHO/Euro Multicentre Study on parasuicide: &quot;An act with non-fatal outcome in which an
           individual deliberately initiates a non-habitual behaviour, that without intervention
           from others will cause self-harm, or deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the
           prescribed or generally recognised dosage, and which is aimed at realising changes that
           the person desires via the actual or expected physical consequences&quot; (Platt et al.,
           1992). DSH patients with severe psychiatric disorders requiring intensive long-term
           psychiatric treatment will be excluded.
