  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an oral sucrose solution can comfort premature infants
      during their necessary eye exams. The investigators believe that the use of this solution
      prior to the eye exams will lead to a decrease in pain as measured by a rise in heart rate
      and a fall in oxygen saturation. In addition this will lead to a decrease in events in the 12
      hours following examination. Events include episodes when the infants temporarily stop
      breathing, have a drop in their heart rates, or have a drop in their oxygen levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All premature infants admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit requiring serial
             dilated examinations to assess for retinopathy of prematurity will be candidates for
             this study. This includes all infants with a birthweight of less than 1500 g and
             infants between 1500 g and 2000 g who require supplemental oxygen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any infant who is unable to safely suckle 0.5 cc of fluid will be excluded from the
             study. This includes infants that are being maintained on ventilators and those with
             serious gastrointestinal complications that may be exacerbated by an oral fluid bolus.

          -  Any infant being maintained on narcotics for any reason will not be eligible for the
             study.

          -  All infants with major congenital anomalies will be excluded.
