  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to give seniors different doses of a new pneumococcal vaccine
      called PCV7 to evaluate the safety of the vaccine and compare the immune response to find out
      which amount gives the best immune response. The PCV7 vaccine is currently licensed by the
      FDA for use in infants and toddlers only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to assess the safety, post-vaccination
      antibody response, and memory response to a subsequent polysaccharide challenge of varying
      doses of PCV7 compared with the standard dose of PPV23 in immunocompetent adults 70-79 years
      of age who were previously vaccinated with PPV23 at age 65 years or above and at least 5
      years previously. The study will be conducted among a total of 220 persons recruited from GHC
      and the Seattle VAMC. Participants will be randomized into one of 5 study groups with 44
      participants per group. The antigen content of PCV7 will be varied by administration of
      different volumes of the licensed pediatric formulation of that vaccine. Four groups will
      receive one of four volumes (0.1 mL, 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, 2.0 mL) of the licensed pediatric
      formulation of PCV7 followed 12 months later by administration of a challenge 0.1 mL dose of
      PPV23 to assess the induction of immunologic memory. The comparison group will receive the
      standard 0.5 mL dose of PPV23 following 12 months later by administration of a 0.1 mL dose of
      PPV23.
