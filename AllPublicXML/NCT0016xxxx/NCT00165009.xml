      To compare the efficacy of a novel endoscopic clipping device(Resolution Clip™) and
      conventional epinephrine injection and heater probe thermocoagulation in control of peptic
      ulcer bleeding and prevention of recurrent bleeding
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mortality of peptic ulcer bleeding remains high despite advances in endoscopy and medical
      therapy. Endoscopic therapy effectively controls peptic ulcer bleeding and substantially
      reduces recurrent bleeding. However, the best endoscopic therapy is still unclear. The
      current standard of therapy is injection with diluted epinephrine and heater probe (3.2mm)
      thermo-coagulation. However, it may be associated with complications such as precipitation of
      myocardial ischemia or heater probe perforation.

      Endoscopic clipping is an emerging modality of endoscopic treatment, it mimics the use of
      surgical ligature on bleeding artery. Endo-clipping has the theoretical advantage over
      injection and heater probe in that the tissue reaction or damage will be much milder.

      Resolution Clip™ is a newly developed endo-clipping device. It is superior to older
      generations of endo-clips in that it allows repeated closures and re-opening of clip so as to
      facilitate accurate deployment onto bleeding artery to ensure its optimal placement for
      hemostasis.

      Consecutive patients with endoscopically confirmed bleeding peptic ulcer will be invited to
      participate in this double-blind, randomised trial, which compares the efficacy of Resolution
      clip and conventional dual endoscopic therapy. Patients will be compared for 30-day treatment
      failure rate.

    <description>linical rebleeding is defined by fresh hematemesis, fresh melena or hematochezia and signs of hypovolemic shock (systolic blood pressure of &lt;90mmHg and pulse rate &gt;110 per minute) and a drop in hemoglobin of &gt; 2 g/dl per 24 hours despite adequate transfusion.
Rebleeding will be confirmed by an immediate endoscopy showing fresh blood in stomach or active bleeding from a previously seen ulcer. A clinical rebleeding will be independently reviewed by an adjudication panel.</description>
