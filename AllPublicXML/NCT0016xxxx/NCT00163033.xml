  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Estetrol is a natural compound that is produced by the fetus during fetal life and circulates
      in the unborn child and the mother. It is an estrogenic compound. In this study the safety
      and tolerability of 28 days of the oral administration of estetrol in healthy postmenopausal
      women are investigated. In addition, the pharmacokinetics and some pharmacodynamic parameters
      are studied. The lowest dose of 2 mg estetrol is directly compared with 2 mg estradiol.

      This is a partly randomized open-label study in healthy postmenopausal women. Groups are
      treated in the following sequence: first a 2 mg estetrol group together with a 2 mg estradiol
      group. When the dose of 2 mg estetrol is safe and the tolerability is good, a next higher
      dose group of estetrol will start, possibly followed by two next higher dose groups if the
      previous dose group is safe and the tolerability is good.

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of estetrol
      during multiple dosing for 28 days. Furthermore steady state pharmacokinetics and some
      pharmacodynamic parameters of estetrol will be investigated. In addition, the
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of the 2 mg estetrol group will be compared with
      those of the 2 mg estradiol group.

      In each group 5 postmenopausal women will be included with &gt; 50 hot flushes per week and 5
      postmenopausal women with &lt; 10 hot flushes per week. These criteria are set to get a more
      homologous composition in each group.
