      -  Patients will receive tamoxifen orally once daily to be taken at home for 1 year. They
           will be asked to complete a daily drug log to keep track of the pills taken or missed.

        -  Patients will also be asked to give a blood/DNA sample which will be stored for possible
           further testing for the presence of cancer related genes that are known nor or
           discovered in the future.

        -  Patients will also receive a mammogram that will be reviewed by study officials.

        -  Side effects will be monitored every 2 months for one year, between visits to the
           clinic.

        -  A follow-up visit will be conducted at the 6 month mark and includes a physical exam,
           blood work, health and wellness surveys)

        -  A follow-up visit will be performed at the 1 year mark and includes a mammogram,
           gynecological exam, physical exam, blood work, health and wellness surveys.

        -  Patients active participation will be for 1 year. However, tamoxifen has been shown to
           be effective after a 5-year course in other women at increased risk for breast cancer,
           the patient may decide to stay on tamoxifen for 4 additional years.
