      The purpose of the study is to explore to what extent continuing the antidepressant
      medication citalopram (Celexa), after depression has responded to treatment, helps prevent
      the return of depressive symptoms in patients with recent traumatic brain injury (TBI).

      While antidepressants are effective in treating major depression following TBI, there is a
      lack of certainty as to how long antidepressants must be continued following improvement of
      symptoms. Many studies published in the last decade strongly show that antidepressants
      prevent relapse in patients with major depression in the absence of traumatic brain injury
      (TBI). However, is it unknown as to whether this is the case following TBI. The aim of this
      study is to determine whether being on an antidepressant for a year reduces the risk of
      relapse of depression.

      Patients diagnosed with major depression following mild TBI will be treated for ten weeks
      with the antidepressant drug citalopram. Those who respond, meaning that the symptoms of
      depression have lessened significantly, will be randomly assigned to either continue taking
      the citalopram for one year or to take a placebo for one year. Every four weeks, for an
      additional forty weeks, patients will be assessed for relapse of depression. This study will
      have a double-blind design, meaning that neither patient nor clinician know whether
      citalopram or placebo is being administered.

      The primary outcome of interest will be a comparison of the percentage of patients who have a
      recurrence of major depression while continued on citalopram compared with those who were
      switched to placebo after the acute phase. Recurrence will be defined as meeting Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major
      depression and a Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) score of &gt; 16. Or meeting DSM-IV criteria
      for major depression and having a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity score of &gt;= 4 and
      a CGI illness score of &gt;= 3. The HAM-D and CGI will be administered every four weeks for
      forty weeks.
