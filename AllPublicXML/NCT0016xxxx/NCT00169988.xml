    <textblock>
      The Recognition and Prevention (RAP) Program is conducting a research study comparing an
      antidepressant, sertraline, alone versus in combination with a second-generation
      antipsychotic, risperidone, to evaluate their ability to reduce unusual thoughts,
      suspiciousness and other unusual experiences, to improve reasoning ability, memory, attention
      and social skills in adolescents.

      Eligible patients are enrolled in a 16-week trial consisting of symptom and side effects
      ratings (10 visits), monthly blood and urine tests, and neuropsychological testing at the
      first and last visits. At the initial appointment, all patients are assigned to sertraline
      and are randomly assigned to an adjunctive risperidone or placebo group. The treating
      physician is also blind to the medication assignment, which allows both the doctor and the
      patient to assess side effects and symptom improvement, unbiased by expectation. All patients
      receive an active medication.
