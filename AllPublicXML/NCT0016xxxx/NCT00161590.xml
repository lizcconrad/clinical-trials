      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of alemtuzumab (Campath) when
           administered in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
           prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy (C-CHOP) in patients with T-cell, null-cell and NK-cell
           lymphomas.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate response rate, overall survival, and disease-free survival in patients with
           T-cell, null-cell, and NK-cell lymphomas treated with Campath + CHOP chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the incidence of cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in patients with these
           lymphomas treated with the Campath + CHOP combination.

        -  To determine features which might be predictive of resistance to treatment or predictive
           of relapse, including the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of non-B-cell, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (including
             T-cell, null-cell, or NK-cell lymphoma, but excluding lymphoblastic lymphoma)

          -  Stage II, III, or IV disease requiring chemotherapy

          -  At least one site of measurable disease, 1.5 cm in diameter or greater

          -  Age &gt; or = 18 years

          -  Absolute granulocyte count of at least 1500 cells/mm3, unless neutropenia is due to
             marrow infiltration by the tumor

          -  Platelet count of at least 100,000 cells/mm3 unless thrombocytopenia is due to marrow
             infiltration by tumor

          -  Creatinine less than 2 x upper limits of normal (ULN)

          -  Total bilirubin less than 2 x ULN (dose reduced vincristine and adriamycin required
             for bilirubin &gt; 1.2 mg/dL)

          -  Echocardiogram (Echo) or multiple gate acquisition scan (MUGA) documenting a normal
             ejection fraction prior to chemotherapy

          -  Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) involvement

          -  Known HIV disease

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Any factor which might limit the patient's ability to provide informed consent

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months

          -  Patients who are unwilling to agree to use an effective means of birth control while
             on treatment
