        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  male or female outpatient greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

          -  suffering presently from neuralgia, which has been present for at least 3 months since
             healing of acute herpes zoster skin rash.

          -  PHN pain at entry into the study must meet the following criteria: a VAS of at least
             40 mm at visit 2 (to assess pain intensity during the past week) and with an average
             daily score of at least 4 on the PIS during the baseline period as evaluated on a
             minimum of 4 days.

          -  an estimated creatinine clearance of at least 50 ml/min.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  receiving professional psychological support (such as cognitive behavioral therapy)
             currently or within 2 weeks prior to visit 1 specifically for coping with PHN.

          -  previous neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy for PHN, at any time in the subject's
             history or treatment with TENS (transelectroneuro stimulation) currently or within the
             past 2 weeks.

          -  known co-existent source of pain or painful peripheral neuropathy.

          -  known significant neurological disorder other than the study disease or a condition
             which can mimic stroke with distal neurological deficit (amyotrophy, radiculopathy,
             history of TIAs, multiple sclerosis, or any amputations).

          -  conditions known to be associated with immunosuppressive states.

          -  clinically significant major depression defined as a Beck Depression Inventory Score &gt;
             21 at selection including those with a history of Bipolar Disorder.
