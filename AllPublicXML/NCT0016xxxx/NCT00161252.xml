  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The widespread availability of screening coupled with high risks of over diagnosis, over
      treatment, and a rising risk of dying from competing causes of deaths pose a major challenge
      for prostate cancer patients and our health care system. Data on outcomes and identification
      of patients who are likely to benefit from therapies are urgently needed to empower patients
      and health professionals and to allocate limited health resources wisely. The long-term goal
      of this population-based study is to improve prostate cancer care for elderly patients. In
      2004, approximately thirty percent of the 230,110 new prostate cancer cases diagnosed will be
      in men over age 75. Elderly men have a high risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer, but
      a relatively low risk of dying of this disease, and are often excluded from cancer trials.
      While the value of primary androgen deprivation for localized prostate cancer remains
      questionable, this treatment is widely used among elderly patients. Currently, there is
      insufficient outcomes data to guide treatment choices for elderly patients.The following are
      the key background considerations that provide the rationale for this proposed project:·
      Prostate cancer is prevalent among elderly men. · Over diagnosis and competing causes of
      death are important issues for elderly men with prostate cancer.· Androgen deprivation
      therapy (ADT) is being increasingly used as primary therapy among elderly patients with
      localized disease· There are insufficient outcomes data to support the use of primary
      androgen deprivation for non metastatic prostate cancer· Preliminary dataThe study population
      in this sub-project is a sub-sample of the large study (IRB # 5177 ) and the research methods
      are identical in both studies.

        To compare overall and prostate cancer specific survival among elderly patients receiving
        primary androgen deprivation therapy and conservative management for non-metastatic
        prostate cancer diagnosed in 1992-1999

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Diagnosed at age 75 or older.

          -  Diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer in 1992-1999.

          -  Enrolled in Medicare for the 12 months before diagnosis for an adequate assessment of
             baseline comorbidity.

          -  Enrolled in Medicare Part A and Part B through death or the end of the study period to
             have an adequate claim history of cancer treatment over the follow-up period.

          -  Alive for at least 6 months after cancer diagnosis. This criterion will remove men who
             are diagnosed at death or who are dying and have severe comorbidities, and are
             therefore poor candidates for 'aggressive' cancer interventions.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Enrolled in Medicare managed care plans during the study period since no Medicare
             claims are available during the period of enrollment.

          -  Have other types of cancer. This criterion will ensure that all cancer therapies
             identified from the Medicare claims are for prostate cancer exclusively.
