      The purpose of this study is to determine if a decision to switch to a subsequent
      antiretroviral regimen based upon the CD4 cell count rather than the standard switching
      strategy based on viral load could ensure the same immunological and clinical outcome and
      preserve future treatment options in AIDS patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implementation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has led to a substantial
      decrease in HIV-related mortality and morbidity. Current guidelines emphasize maximal and
      durable viral load suppression. However, while the goal of therapy is the restoration of
      immunity, treatment failure is usually defined as the inability to maintain undetectable
      viral load, without regard to immune function. This situation often leads to a rapid sequence
      of therapeutic switches, thus narrowing therapeutic options over time. A monitoring strategy
      driven primarily by the patient's immune restoration would most likely be as effective in
      preventing disease progression, would lead to fewer changes in HAART regimens and would be
      considerably simpler and cost effective.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two switching strategies:

        -  VL-S, the standard viral load (VL) based monitoring strategy, where switching is
           performed when VL is confirmed (within one month) above 400 copies per mL.

        -  CD4-S, the alternative CD4 based monitoring strategy where switching is performed when a
           confirmed (within one month) relative decline in CD4 count of more than 30% from peak
           values is observed within 200 cells from baseline.

      The initial HAART regimen will be a NNRTI+NRTI containing regimen and the second line regimen
      will be a PI containing regimen, subsequent regimens will be chosen individually based on
      tolerance, previous drugs used, resistance profile, and drugs available. Patients will be
      followed until the end of the study (maximum of 5 years for the first enrollee, three years
      for the last enrollee).

        Eligibility Criteria:

        Patients fulfilling the following criteria are eligible:

             are required for documentation of HIV infection.

          -  Antiretroviral drug na√Øve with the exception of short course of antiretrovirals
