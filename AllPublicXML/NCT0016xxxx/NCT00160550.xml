  <brief_title>Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Levetiracetam in Patients Suffering From Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy With Primary Generalized Tonic-clonic Seizures</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Double-blind, Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Adjunctive Treatment With 3000 mg/Day (Pediatric Target Dose of 60 mg/kg/Day) Oral Levetiracetam (LEV) (166, 250, and 500mg Tablets), in Adult and Pediatric Subjects (4-65 Years) Suffering From Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy With Primary Generalized Tonic-clonic (PGTC) Seizures.</official_title>

    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of adjunctive treatment with
      LEV (3,000 mg/day or a target dose of 60 mg/kg/day in children) compared to placebo in
      reducing PGTC seizures in subjects (4 - 65 years) suffering from idiopathic generalized
      epilepsy uncontrolled despite treatment with one or two concomitant AEDs.
