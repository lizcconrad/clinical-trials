  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of
      risperidone monotherapy in the treatment of ambulatory bipolar disorder with comorbid
      lifetime panic disorder or generalized anxiety disorder and current at least moderately
      severe anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, 8-week trial of
      risperidone monotherapy in outpatient subjects with a lifetime bipolar I, II, or NOS
      disorder, a lifetime panic or generalized anxiety disorder, and current at least moderately
      severe anxiety symptoms. Approximately 90 subjects will be enrolled to obtain 60 subjects who
      complete the 8-week trial. Subjects will be randomized to risperidone or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio. No concomitant psychotropic medication will be allowed except for prn lorazepam during
      the first two weeks for the management of affective and anxiety symptoms, and prn zolpidem
      and zaleplon throughout the study for the management of insomnia. Throughout the study,
      psychiatric scales will be used to assess psychiatric symptoms and the presence of
      treatment-emergent adverse events will be monitored and recorded.
