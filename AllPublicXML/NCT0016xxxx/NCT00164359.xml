  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is the current first-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria in
      Malawi. Significant resistance of the P. falciparum malaria parasite to this drug has led to
      an imminent need for the government of Malawi to identify a new first-line therapy for
      uncomplicated malaria and to implement that new therapy as policy. This protocol is the
      second of two protocols whose combined purpose is to provide efficacy and side effect data on
      four antimalarial drug combinations that are candidates for the next first-line therapy for
      uncomplicated malaria in Malawi. This protocol aims to assess the acceptability and
      tolerability of amodiaquine in Malawi. It is a double-blind study comparing amodiaquine plus
      artesunate (AQ-Art, one of the candidate combination therapies) to chlorproguanil/dapsone
      plus artesunate (CD-Art, another of the candidate combination therapies) in persons 5 years
      and older, to see if there is a higher incidence of abdominal pain and/or refusal to take the
      therapy in the AQ-Art group. Amodiaquine was removed from the Malawian national drug registry
      in 1995 because of a perceived association with abdominal pain. Although no studies were
      conducted to substantiate this, consensus among clinicians was that patients were refusing
      amodiaquine with increasing frequency, citing abdominal pain as the reason, so the drug was
      removed from the registry. Results from this study, along with the efficacy data from the
      sister protocol in children under five years of age, will help guide the National Malaria
      Control Program of Malawi in selecting their next first-line antimalarial therapy.
