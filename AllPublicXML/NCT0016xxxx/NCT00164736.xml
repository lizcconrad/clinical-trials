      This is a comparative clinical trial among HIV-infected women and their infants to determine:

        1. the benefit of nutritional supplementation given to women during breastfeeding

        2. the benefit and safety of antiretroviral (ARV) medications given either to infants or to
           their mothers to prevent HIV transmission during breastfeeding

        3. the feasibility of exclusive breastfeeding followed by early, rapid breastfeeding
           cessation

      This study addresses the complex issues of HIV related maternal morbidity, mortality, and
      postnatal HIV transmission during breastfeeding and weaning in resource-poor countries.
      Objectives include assessment of mortality and morbidity among HIV-infected women; evaluation
      of interventions to reduce HIV transmission to infants exposed by breast milk; and assessment
      of early weaning as a risk-reduction strategy for infants of HIV-infected mothers.

      The study will evaluate the following:

        1. The efficacy of a high-density caloric/micronutrient nutritional supplement given to
           HIV-infected women who breastfeed in preventing maternal depletion (weight loss and
           micronutrient status).

        2. The safety and efficacy of maternal or infant antiretroviral regimens, taken for up to 6
           months during breastfeeding, in reducing infant HIV infection rates at 48 weeks.

        3. The feasibility of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months followed by rapid weaning.

      Additional study objectives are to evaluate the feasibility of delivering these interventions
      in resource poor settings and to identify maternal, infant, and virologic factors associated
      with HIV transmission during breastfeeding.
