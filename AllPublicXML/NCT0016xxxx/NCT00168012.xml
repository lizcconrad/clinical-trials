  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effect of IVIG-F10 on the prevention of
      serious bacterial infections in patients with primary immunodeficiency.

      As secondary endpoints the rate of overall infections, the tolerability and safety of
      IVIG-F10 are studied.
