      The purpose of this trial is to determine the effects (good and bad) temozolomide has on
      patients with low-grade glioma. It will also determine whether temozolomide is effective in
      preventing or delaying future tumor growth.

      -  Treatment with temozolomide is based upon an 11-week cycle (7 weeks on the drug and 4
           weeks off). Patients will receive temozolomide once daily for 49 days, then have 28 days
           without taking temozolomide.

        -  Every two to four weeks a physical and neurological examination and blood work will be
           performed. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the patient's brain will be done
           approximately every three months (before each cycle of treatment).

        -  Treatment may continue for a maximum of a year and a half based on 6 eleven-week cycles.
           The actual duration of therapy will depend upon the response to treatment and the
           development of side effects or toxicity.
