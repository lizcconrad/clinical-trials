  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety, and population
      pharmacokinetics and determinants of drug responses to buspirone in children with autism
      using a randomized, double blind, cross over study in children ages 2 to 6 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined as qualitative impairment in social
      interaction and communication and restrictive stereotype patterns of behavior, interests and
      activities. Pharmacological agents are being increasingly used off label in very young
      autistic children, and there is virtually no data regarding the pharmacokinetics, safety or
      efficacy of these agents in young children.

      The approach in this study differs from pharmacotherapy studies of autism carried out thus
      far in several ways:

        -  the rationale underlying our approach is based upon an attempt to alter synaptic
           plasticity during postnatal development, focusing on very young children

        -  are integrating our drug trial with a PG study evaluating whether buspirone response is
           related to expression of genes involved in serotoninergic neurotransmission

        -  will assess these variables together with in vivo assessment of serotonin synthesis
           capacity with PET.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover study where children will be
      stratified by age into two groups. Treatment will last for 12 weeks with dosing twice a day.
      Parent ratings, cognitive tests and blood sampling will occur throughout the study period.
