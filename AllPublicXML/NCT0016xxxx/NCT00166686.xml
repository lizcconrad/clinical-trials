  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of the study are to determine the efficacy of clonidine in the treatment of
      children with neurocognitive sequelae following the therapy of long term malignancies. In
      addition, the study hopes to determine the long-term effect of clonidine on children's
      academic and psychosocial function.

    <textblock>
      The long term prognosis for many children diagnosed with brain tumors and other malignancies
      has improved dramatically over the last decades and is expected to continue to rise as a
      result of improved treatment. The increased survival in pediatric oncology, however, has been
      associated with an increased recognition of neurobehavioral sequelae of cancer and its
      treatment. Current understanding of the incidence, pathogenesis, and natural history of these
      neurobehavioral abnormalities is limited and considerable individual variation in the
      presence and severity of these complications has been noted. Central nervous system (CNS)
      abnormalities associated with childhood cancer and its treatment have been demonstrated on at
      least three levels which may be interrelated: neurobehavioral abnormalities, brain imaging
      abnormalities, and neurotransmitter abnormalities.

      Patients will be randomized to either clonidine or placebo. Study medication will be
      administered in a double blind fashion beginning with a four-week dose titration period
      followed by a four-week maintenance period. Total duration of dosing is 18 weeks. Patients
      who derive a benefit from clonidine administration may continue for an additional 30 weeks of
      therapy. PK samples will be collected at weeks 9 and 18.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a prior diagnosis of a pediatric malignancy (brain tumors, solid tumors,
             leukemia/lymphoma) who are in remission, and are &gt; 3 years from initial diagnosis.
             Patients must have completed therapy a minimum of 6 months prior to study entry.

          -  Patients must have English as their primary language

          -  Patients must be &gt;3 and less than or equal to 16 at the time of study enrollment

          -  Patients must fulfill the operational criteria for neurocognitive deficit and have an
             IQ &gt; 50.

          -  Patients must be currently enrolled in a school or a learning environment where an
             adult familiar with the child's academic performance can provide ratings of that
             performance over the time of the trial.

          -  Patients must have wbc, hemoglobin and platelet parameters which fall within the norms
             for the patient's age.

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic function (bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5
             mg/dl and SGPT &lt; 5x normal) and renal function (normal Cr for age/GFR greater than or
             equal to 70 ml/min/1.73m2)

          -  Patients must be able to swallow gel caps.

          -  Signed informed consent must be obtained according to institutional guidelines. When
             appropriate the patient will be included in all discussion in order to obtain verbal
             assent.

          -  Protocol and informed consent must be approved by the local IRB prior to any patient
             registration and reapproved every 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have evidence of a significant neurological abnormality prior to their
             cancer diagnosis that would affect neuro-behavioral development (such as genetic:
             Fragile X, Downs syndrome, or acquired disorders: closed head injury)

          -  Patients with a prior (pre-cancer) diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity
             disorder or major depression

          -  Patients who have a medical condition which would preclude the use of clonidine
             (medicated for hypertension, cardiac conduction disturbances, cerebrovascular disease,
             or chronic renal failure)

          -  Patients must not have received psychotropic medication (SSRIs, methylphenidate),
             anxiolytics, or hypnotics within 2 weeks of study entry.

          -  Patients who are receiving concurrent scheduled barbiturates or sedating drugs.

          -  Currently (within 6 months) known to abuse drugs or to be dependent on any drug
             including alcohol or with a positive urine drug screen.

          -  Women of childbearing age must not be pregnant or lactating. This group is excluded
             because of teratogenic potential of this agent demonstrated in rat and rabbit models.
