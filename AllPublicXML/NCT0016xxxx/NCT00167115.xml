      The hypotheses to be tested are 1) the use of alcohol in the form of wine with the evening
      meal will lower plasma glucose during the night and result in lower fasting plasma glucose
      the next morning; 2) the chronic use of alcohol in moderation in the form of wine will have
      beneficial effects on plasma lipids in type 2 diabetic subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of alcohol in moderation has been associated with reduced mortality rates, reduced
      risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced risk for type 2 diabetes. However, the effects of
      alcohol in persons with type 2 diabetes have not yet been defined. Moreover, the possibility
      of alcohol induced hypoglycemia remains a safety concern. Finally, little is known about the
      effects of alcohol on plasma lipids in people with diabetes. To address these issues, two
      substudies are proposed. The first substudy will examine the acute effects of alcohol in the
      form of wine at supper on postprandial and nocturnal glucose levels. The second substudy will
      examine the effects of alcohol in the form of wine consumed regularly for one month on plasma
      lipids.

      To test these hypotheses, 20 type 2 diabetics will be studied. In substudy 1, subjects will
      be admitted to the Clinical Research Center for a two day inpatient stay. Blood samples for
      plasma glucose and serum insulin will be obtained every two hours from 5:00 pm to 7:00 am. On
      one day, subjects will recieve 8 ounces of wine with dinner. On the other day, subjects will
      recieve 8 ounces of fruit juice with dinner. The primary endpoint of substudy 1 will be
      fasting plasma glucose. In substudy 2, subjects will be asked to consume 4-8 ounces of wine
      in the evening for one month and to abstain from wine and alcohol containing beverages for
      one month. Fasting blood samples will be obtained after the month of wine consumption and
      after the month of abstention from alcohol for measurement of fasting lipids. The primary
      endpoint of substudy 2 will be fasting HDL cholesterol.
