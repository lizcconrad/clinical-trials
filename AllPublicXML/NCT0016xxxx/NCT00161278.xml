  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are at least 18 years of age and have a type of cancer known as advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer may be eligible for this study if they meet all of the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.

      Background: The standard treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell cancer is
      chemotherapy. The two drug combination, carboplatin (Paraplatin) and paclitaxel (Taxol), is
      commonly used as the first treatment. Unfortunately, standard treatment with chemotherapy
      only shrinks the cancer in about 30% of patients that receive it. There is no way to predict
      who will or won't benefit from this treatment. The researchers at the University of Michigan
      would like to determine if the genes of the lung cancers in patients enrolled in this study
      will help predict whether or not the tumors shrink when exposed to standard chemotherapy. The
      goal is to find a set of lung cancer genes that will predict successful treatment with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      The actual treatment, carboplatin and paclitaxel, involved in this study is not experimental.
      The experimental aspect of this study is the identification of predictors of response to
      treatment. To do this, it would require a sample of your cancer. If your initial surgery or
      biopsy was done at the University of Michigan, we may already have an adequate sample of your
      cancer that could be used for this research. In that case, we are asking for your permission
      to use this sample for this study. However, if you meet all eligibility criteria and agree to
      participate in this research study and an adequate sample is not available, you will need to
      undergo another biopsy procedure for us to obtain a sample of your cancer. Obtaining a tumor
      sample is the most crucial part of this research study.

      Prior to the start of treatment, subjects will have a complete history and physical
      examination and blood tests to evaluate their overall health. The doctor will also obtain a
      tissue sample (biopsy) of the tumor taken from the subject's body to evaluate the genes that
      are expressed within the tumor. Doctors from the University of Michigan will do an analysis
      on the tissue to understand the genetic nature of each subject's tumor. If the subject's
      initial surgery or biopsy was done at the University of Michigan, we may already have an
      adequate sample of their cancer that could be used for this research. In that case, we would
      be asking for their permission to use this sample for this study. However, if subjects agree
      to participate in this research study and an adequate sample is not available, they will need
      to undergo another biopsy procedure for us to obtain a sample of your cancer.

      A biopsy of a subject's tumor can be obtained from various sites of their body using a number
      of different methods. We will select a location that will be the easiest and safest place to
      biopsy, and that will provide an adequate sample of tumor tissue. Biopsy sites will generally
      be superficial (for example, lymph nodes, skin nodules, chest wall tumors). The usual method
      of biopsy will be the placement of a large needle into the tumor to obtain a &quot;core&quot; of
      tissue. In some situations, we may ask to have a superficial tumor removed in whole or part
      by a minor surgical procedure. If neither of these methods can be done safely, we may place a
      thin needle into the tumor and aspirate (suck out) some tumor cells for study. All procedures
      will be done with local anesthesia (that is, injection of medication directly into the biopsy
      site to numb the area prior to biopsy) and appropriate care to avoid excessive bleeding or
      subsequent infection. The doctors will explain the specific biopsy location and technique
      that fits each subject's situation to them in detail prior to the procedure. They can decide
      not to go through with the biopsy and withdraw from this research trial at any time.

      Subjects will then be given carboplatin and paclitaxel intravenously (through a vein) over 2
      hours. This will be repeated every three weeks for a total of six to eighteen weeks. Three
      weeks is considered a &quot;cycle&quot; and each subject will receive 1 to 6 cycles depending on how
      their tumor responds and how the treatment is tolerated. Treatment will be stopped if the
      tumor gets worse or if a subject develops unacceptable side-effects.

      Physical examinations, blood tests, and x-rays and/or scans will be done routinely during the
      therapy so the doctor can check the subject's body and your tumor response to treatment.
      Blood samples, consisting of 2-3 teaspoonfuls (10-15 cc) each, will be obtained twice every
      three weeks during the study to evaluate the effect of the treatment on their blood counts,
      blood electrolytes, liver and kidney function.
