  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is any difference between two ways of
      controlling blood sugar with insulin. In patients admitted to the intensive care unit, blood
      sugar levels often rise due to the stress of illness or surgery. Studies have shown that
      patients do better if their blood sugar is kept normal. In order to maintain normal blood
      sugar levels, the investigators often give insulin (a substance made by the body), and they
      decide how much to give based on how high the blood sugar is. This study will compare two
      different ways of deciding how much insulin to give and compare how well each method keeps
      the blood sugar in a normal range. Both ways of controlling blood sugar are
      institutionally-approved protocols and part of routine care.

      Improved outcomes have been demonstrated with tight control of blood glucose in critically
      ill patients. A number of look-up algorithms based on hourly glucose measurements and
      titrated intravenous insulin have been developed for the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite
      the numerous published algorithms, no study has investigated which algorithm results in
      optimal glycemic control in critically ill patients. The purpose of this trial is to compare
      two institutionally approved intravenous insulin administration algorithms and describe
      subsequent glycemic control. We hypothesize that the protocol that allows for variable
      insulin administration for a given blood glucose (multiple algorithms) will be associated
      with more optimal glycemic control. Optimal glycemic control will be defined by time spent
      within a predetermined blood glucose range. In addition, the number of hypoglycemic episodes
      and mean and maximum blood glucose concentrations will also be measured. This trial will
      determine which insulin infusion algorithm is most effective in terms of glycemic control,
      and allow for standardization of glucose management in accordance with best practice.
