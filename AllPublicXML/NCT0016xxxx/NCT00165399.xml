      The purpose of this study is to see if the combination of chemotherapy drugs and drugs to
      suppress testosterone (hormone therapy) is effective in controlling early prostate cancer.

      This study will attempt to:

        -  stop or slow the growth of disease

        -  gain information about prostate cancer

        -  evaluate the effectiveness and side effects of the study drug
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      -  Patients will receive two medications; docetaxel and estramustine. Estramustine will be
           taken orally three times daily for 5 days starting on day one. Docetaxel will be given
           intravenously on day 2. These two drugs will be repeated every 3 weeks for a total of 4
           cycles (12 weeks).

        -  Patients will also take dexamethasone for three days at the beginning of each cycle to
           help decrease the risk of side effects.

        -  Patients will also take coumadin every day for three months while on the chemotherapy to
           reduce the risk of blood clots.

        -  After 12 weeks the chemotherapy phase will be completed and patient will start on the
           hormone therapy part of the treatment. Three weeks after the last chemotherapy
           treatment, patients will start Casodex orally once daily.

        -  After taking Casodex for 1 week, patients will then start on Zoladex (an injection in
           the abdomen) every 3 months for a total of 5 injections.

        -  During study treatment various blood tests will be performed to watch the disease. Study
           treatment will stop after a total of 18 months (3 months chemotherapy and 15 months
           hormone therapy). A physical exam and blood tests will be performed every 3 months for 2
           years, every 4 months for the third year, and then every 6 months after that.
