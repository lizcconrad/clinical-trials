  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a heritable psychiatric disorder with
      onset in childhood. Twin and adoption studies indicate that additive genetic factors explain
      up to 80% of the variance underlying susceptibility. The siblings of children with ADHD have
      a three- to fivefold increased risk of having ADHD compared to the siblings of healthy
      control subjects, and the risk is even greater for monozygotic twins with 50-80% concordance
      compared with up to 33% in dizygotic twins). As full siblings share on average 50% of their
      genes, even the unaffected siblings of children with ADHD would be expected to share some of
      the genes involved in the disorder. The neuroanatomical substrate of ADHD is becoming
      increasingly better defined by a growing body of evidence from imaging studies. Evidence from
      neuroimaging studies suggests that this disorder is associated with reductions in brain
      volume up to 5% in these children. In this protocol we collected MRI-scans from boys with
      ADHD and their unaffected siblings, as well as control subjects. In addition, cheekswabs were
      later collected for DNA analysis.
