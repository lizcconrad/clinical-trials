      The purpose of this study is to assess the protective effect of Valsartan on chronic
      cardiotoxicity induced by CHOP.

    <textblock>
      Doxorubicin has been one of the most important key drugs in treatment for malignancies.
      However, its use is limited by dose-dependent cumulative cardiotoxicity. This multi-centers
      trial was designed to investigate the preventive effect of Valsartan, the angiotensin II type
      1 receptor blocker (ARB) on chronic cardiotoxicity due to doxorubicin based chemotherapy.
      Patients with untreated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who are scheduled to receive at least 6
      courses of the standard CHOP (-R) will be randomized by the minimization methods to the
      treatment group with Valsartan (80mg once daily by oral during entire 6 courses of CHOP) or
      control group. Cardiac function will be evaluated in detail before and after 3 and 6 courses
      of CHOP (-R).
