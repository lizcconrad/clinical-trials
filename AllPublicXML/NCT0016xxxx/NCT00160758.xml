      This purpose of this study is to measure the strength of tissue allografts that have been in
      the body various lengths of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allograft bone is the primary source of graft material for large skeletal defects resulting
      from trauma, disease, oncological resection, or reconstruction of failed total joint
      arthroplasties. The physical characteristics of such grafts after various intervals of
      remodeling and incorporation in vivo have never been studied.

      The purpose of this study is to obtain tissue from allografts retrieved at autopsy, at
      amputation for oncological complications and from patients undergoing revision procedures for
      failed allograft transplantation. We will evaluate the mechanical properties,
      histomorphometric indices and presence of microfractures.

      Our hypotheses are:

        -  histomorphometric parameters of porosity and microfracture density will predict
           allograft strength,

        -  microfracture density will be correlated with time in vivo and allograft strength,

        -  the rate of host-allograft nonunion and fracture will correlate with radiation therapy
           and chemotherapy.

      The retrieved tissue will be processed using standard undecalcified histology and
      quantitatively assessed for degree of incorporation, allograft porosity, and microfracture
      density. The biomechanical characteristics of the bulk allograft and allograft-host junction
      will be quantified and compared to allograft bone prior to transplantation.
