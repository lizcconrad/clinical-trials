      The purpose is to encourage Provider participants to evaluate high risk HIV transmission
      behaviors and offer prevention messages to their HIV+ patients which will, in turn, reduce
      rates of unprotected anal and/or vaginal sex with partners of known HIV sero-negativity or
      unknown HIV serostatus. It is hypothesized that patients of providers participating in the
      HIP intervention will report higher reduction in sexual risk practices, when compared to the
      patients of the providers who were randomized into the control condition.
