      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new antipsychotics, quetiapine (300-500mg/day)
           and risperidone (3-4mg/day) compared to each other and to fluphenazine (10-15mg/day), a
           high potency typical antipsychotic in patients who meet the DSM IV criteria for
           schizophrenia.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of quetiapine (1200mg/day) in patients who have not
           responded to conventional and newer antipsychotics.

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine (300-500mg/day), and risperidone (3-5mg/day)
           compared to each other and fluphenazine (10-15mg/day) in the treatment of hostility and
           aggression in treatment-resistant schizophrenic patients.

        4. To evaluate the effectiveness of quetiapine (300-500mg/day) and risperidone (3-5mg/day)
           compared to each other and fluphenazine (10-15mg/day) on rates of discharge, quality of
           life, and independent living skills.

        5. To assess prolactin levels and to evaluate any relationship with sexual dysfunction and
           menstrual irregularities.

        6. To evaluate the possible differential impact of treatment conditions on cognitive
           functioning including measures of attention, motor speed, problem solving, verbal and
           visual memory, and verbal processing speed.

        7. To measure changes in weight and health consequences associated with weight changes.

      This is a three arm multi-center randomized double-blind study. After open label treatment
      with each individual being optimized with routine antipsychotic treatment for 4-6 weeks to
      prospectively establish lack of response to conventional antipsychotic therapy, approximately
      180 patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing clinically significant psychotic
      symptoms will be recruited (minimum 150 enrolled) in the double-blind period of the study.
      All participants will sign consent forms before participating in this research study. If
      participants choose to enroll in the high dose quetiapine arm (period IIIb), they will sign
      an additional consent form before entering period IIIb.
