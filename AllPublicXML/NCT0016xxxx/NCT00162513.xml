      Donors with CM will be solicited from a waiting list of patients awaiting BMT from the
      waiting list of MUD searches.

      Maximally matched donor will be searched for each eligible CML patient with a goal in mind to
      find other patients with CML that share both class I and class II determinants. Sharing of
      one class I II will be considered eligible for participation in the study. Peripheral blood
      and PBMC from the donors will be isolated, washed and irradiated.

      The cells will be injected into the consenting patients intracutaneously at 2 weeks intervals
      for a total of 6 injections.
