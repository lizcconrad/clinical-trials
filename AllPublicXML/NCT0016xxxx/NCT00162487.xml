  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have indicated that albuterol administered either intravenously or by
      inhalation can significantly reduce plasma potassium concentration in patients suffering from
      chronic renal failure.In conjunction with the decrease in potassium concentration a modest
      rise in glucose concentration is usually noted. These metabolic effects are characterized by
      rapid onset occurring as early as 3-5 minutes following salbutamol administration and lasting
      for at least 1 hour.

      The role played by ß2AR polymorphisms in determining the bronchial and vascular response to
      ß2AR agonist drugs, have been confirmed by several studies.

      The purpose of the present study is to examine possible causal relationships between
      genetically based alteration in the structure of ß2AR and the metabolic effects of inhaled
      albuterol.
