      The purposes of this study are to investigate the reliability and validity of the modified
      Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (mPASS) and its applications in early detection
      of fall-prone patients.

      The intraclass correlation coefficient will be used to examine the intra-rater reliability,
      inter-rater reliability, and the Cronbachâ€™s alpha will be used to examine the internal
      consistency of the 16 items of mPASS.

      Due to the impaired balance function, patients with stroke show high incidence of falls.
      Impaired postural stability has been shown as one of the primary risk factors of falls in
      these patients. Research has shown that patients who have moderate level of mobility and
      stability are more likely to fall than those who have very good or very poor mobility and
      stability. Therefore, there is an urgent need for physical therapists, who are used to play
      an important role in improving balance function of patients with stroke, to be able to early
      detect stroke patients who are at high risk of falls, and to implement fall prevention
      training and education on these patients. However, to date, there is not any clinical
      assessment scale that can be used for early detection of fall-prone stroke patients.
