  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A given as treatment and pre-treatment has reduced the severity of symptoms after
      infusion with endotoxin in several animal models. We intend to examine the effect of vitamin
      A as pre-treatment on the response to endotoxin in humans. We furthermore wish to examine the
      long-term effects of vitamin A on the response to endotoxin. We hypothesise that vitamin A
      decreases endotoxin levels and TNF-alfa responses.

      Vitamin A given as treatment and pre-treatment has reduced the severity of symptoms after
      infusion with endotoxin in several animal models. We intend to examine the effect of vitamin
      A as pre-treatment on the response to endotoxin in humans. As studies in children in
      low-income countries have indicated that vitamin A has long-term effects on the immune
      system, we furthermore wish to examine the long-term effects of vitamin A on the response to
      endotoxin. This will be done in an established model using infusion with endotoxin to male
      human volunteers. We hypothesise that vitamin A decreases endotoxin levels and TNF-alfa
      responses. Furthermore, we hypothesise that it reduces oxidative stress and injury.
