        Inclusion Criteria:

        Only subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in

          -  Male patients

          -  Age ≥ 45 years

          -  Suspected presence of prostate inflammatory foci, defined according to the following
             criteria:

          -  PSA ≥ 2.6 ng/mL and age ≥ 50 and &lt; 60 years (or ≥ 45 years if the patient has known
             family predisposition to carcinoma of the prostate) or,

          -  PSA ≥ 4.1 ng/mL and age ≥ 60 and &lt; 75 years, and

          -  normal digito-rectal examination (DRE) (see section 5.2), and normal urine test with
             dipstick and/or microscopy carried out within 5 days of the baseline visit

          -  Patients willing and able to provide their written informed consent and to comply with
             study procedures.

               -  Patients with LUTS/BPH on watchful waiting or already under treatment with
                  alpha-blockers or 5-ARI (5-alpha reductase inhibitors) for at least 6 months will
                  also be considered eligible to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in this
        study:

          -  Diagnosis of NIH class I-III prostatitis or clinical evidence of active acute urinary
             infection and/or known or suspected active bacterial infection at other sites;

          -  Diagnosis of prostate carcinoma (or PIN or ASAPS) or prior radical prostatectomy or
             radiotherapy or other treatments for prostate cancer;

          -  PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL;

          -  PSA values (including high values) stable over time;

          -  Start of a pharmacological therapy with 5-ARI in subjects with LUTS/BPH;

          -  Permanent catheter;

          -  Prior treatment (within 4 weeks) with levofloxacin for genital-urinary infections;

          -  Known or suspected allergy to levofloxacin, including the excipients contained in the
             pharmacological preparation and/or confirmed tendency to photosensitivity reactions
             after fluoroquinolone therapy;

          -  Concomitant treatment with drugs not allowed in the study

          -  Reluctance to undergo prostate biopsy and/or risk of non-compliance;

          -  History or current evidence of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 12 months;

          -  History of any conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, may confound the
             study results or create additional risks for the patient.

          -  Participation in any study of investigational or marketed drugs within 30 days before
             the baseline visit or during the study.
