      Phase I study:

      To investigate primary objective (maximal tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity) and
      secondary objectives (pharmacokinetics, safety, estimation of a recommended dose, and
      anti-tumor effect by evaluable case) of E7070 in patients with gastric cancer who are
      extensive or intermediate metabolizer type (EM/IM) to CYP2C9 and CYP2C9 by intravenously
      administering once every 3 weeks.

      Phase IIa study:

      To investigate primary objective (response rate for efficacy assessment) and secondary
      objectives (frequency and severity of adverse drug reactions, and pharmacokinetics) of E7070
      in patient with gastric cancer who are EM/IM type by intravenously administering once every 3
      weeks.
