      Comparing the efficacy and safety of a gel formulation containing a combination of
      clindamycin phosphate (equivalent to 1% clindamycin) and benzoyl peroxide (5%) once daily

      Title: A Multi-Centre, Single-Blind, Parallel Group, Clinical Evaluation of the Efficacy and
      Safety of Duac® Gel (a Gel Containing Clindamycin Phosphate [Equivalent to 1% Clindamycin]
      and 5% Benzoyl Peroxide) And Differin® Gel (a Gel Containing 0.1% Adapalene) in the Topical
      Treatment of Mild to Moderate Acne Vulgaris

      Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of a gel formulation containing a combination
      of clindamycin phosphate (equivalent to 1% clindamycin) and benzoyl peroxide (5%) once daily
      with a gel containing 0.1% adapalene once daily in the treatment of acne vulgaris of mild to
      moderate severity.

      Study methodology: Randomised, comparator-controlled, single-blind trial. The Investigators/
      Assessors will be blinded to the treatment received.

      Study population: Male and female patients, aged 12-39, with mild to moderate acne vulgaris.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with mild to moderate acne vulgaris of the face with at least 15 inflammatory
             lesions and/or non-inflammatory lesions, but no more than three nodulocystic lesions
             and an acne grade of greater than 2.0 and less than 7.0 (The Leeds Revised Acne
             Grading System7).

          2. Patients of either sex aged between 12 and 39 years, inclusive.

          3. Patients who are willing and able to provide written informed consent, after being
             informed of all the pertinent aspects of the trial. In the case of patients aged under
             16 years of age, parental or guardian consent must be obtained in addition to patient
             assent.

          4. Patients agreeing not to use sun-beds or undergo any UV light treatment for 4 weeks
             prior to entering the study and to minimise the amount of exposure to direct sunlight
             for the duration of the study.

          5. Patients agreeing to minimise their alcohol consumption throughout the study, with a
             limit of 14 units per week.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female patients who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or sexually active and not using
             reliable contraception and/or not prepared to do so for the duration of the trial (a
             negative pregnancy test must be confirmed at Visit 1 and at the end of the study, for
             all females if menarche has occurred).

          2. Patients using anti-androgen containing contraceptives.

          3. Patients who, during the past month, have received oral or topical steroids, oral or
             topical antibiotics, or acne treatment of any type, including natural or artificial UV
             therapy.

          4. Patients who have a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to
             clindamycin phosphate, benzoyl peroxide, adapalene or any components of the study
             medications.

          5. Patients using, or having used in the past month, any significant concomitant
             medication which might affect their acne, as judged by the Investigator.

          6. Patients with severe systemic diseases (e.g., severely impaired renal or liver
             function, severe cardiovascular, neurological disease, or any other diseases that may
             interfere with the evaluation of the study medications). This also applies to patients
             with psoriasis, acne rosacea, allergic rashes, bacterial, viral or fungal infections
             of the facial skin, or other diseases of the facial skin.

          7. Patients with a history of regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis, or a history of
             antibiotic-associated colitis.

          8. Patients who have a history of photosensitivity.

          9. Patients who are unreliable or unlikely to be available for the duration of the
             follow-up.

         10. Patients who have participated in a clinical trial involving a drug within 30 days of
             recruitment into the study (or are likely to do so at any time during their
             participation).

         11. Patients who are either an immediate family member, or a colleague, of study
             personnel.

         12. Patients who already have a member of their household entered onto this trial.
