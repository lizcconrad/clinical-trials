  <brief_title>Effect of Inhaled Ciclesonide Versus Fluticasone Propionate in Patients With Mild to Moderate Asthma (18 to 65 y) (BY9010/M1-129)</brief_title>
  <official_title>Comparison of Inhaled Ciclesonide (160 mcg b.i.d. or 320 mcg b.i.d.) and Fluticasone Propionate (250 mcg b.i.d. or 500 mcg b.i.d.) in Pretreated Patients With Mild to Moderate Asthma</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of ciclesonide versus fluticasone
      propionate versus placebo on airway hyperresponsiveness and on the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis). Treatment medication will be administered as
      follows: ciclesonide or fluticasone propionate will be inhaled twice daily, using one of the
      two dose levels. The study duration consists of a baseline period (4 to 6 weeks), five
      treatment periods (9 days each), and a washout period between treatments (4 to 12 weeks). The
      study will provide further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.
