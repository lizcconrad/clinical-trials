      The overall purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      indisulam in combination with irinotecan as a treatment for patients with metastatic
      colorectalcancer previously treated with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX).

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Ambulant male or female patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have been

             at least four weeks prior to study entry and any acute toxicities must have resolved

          -  At least one uni-dimensionally measurable lesion according to RECIST criteria (the
             following do not qualify as measurable lesions: bone, leptomeningeal disease, ascites,
             pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are
             not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions)

          -  Aged greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer

          -  Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70%

          -  Written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion criteria:

        Patients with the following characteristics will not be included in the study:

             targeted and anti-angiogenic therapy is permitted.

          -  Untreated brain metastases (patients who have been treated for CNS metastases must be
             asymptomatic and radiologically stable for 4 weeks prior to entry). Patients must not
             have clinical symptoms from brain metastases and must not be taking corticosteroids

                  a different tumor type within five years of starting the study except for
                  adequately treated non- melanoma skin cancer or cervical intraepithelial
                  neoplasia

          -  Uncontrolled infections

          -  Clinically significant cardiac impairment or unstable ischemic heart disease including
