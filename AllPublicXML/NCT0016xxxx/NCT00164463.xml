    <textblock>
      This substudy of TBTC Studies 27 and 28 compares 1) the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin
      alone versus moxifloxacin administered with rifampin in healthy volunteers and 2) the
      pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin among patients with tuberculosis being treated with
      multidrug therapy (isoniazid or ethambutol, rifampin, and pyrazinamide) to those of healthy
      volunteers receiving moxifloxacin plus rifampin. It also evaluates the association between
      polymorphisms of MDR1 genotype (P-glycoprotein) and rifampin pharmacokinetic parameters, the
      effect of polymorphisms of MDR1 genotype and/or rifampin pharmacokinetics on isoniazid
      pharmacokinetic parameters adjusted for N-acetyltransferase genotype (NAT2), and determines
      by multivariate regression analyses the associations between moxifloxacin or rifampin
      pharmacokinetic parameters and markers of tuberculosis disease severity including the
      covariates of two-month culture positivity, cavitary lung disease, Body Mass Index, weight,
      duration of study treatment prior to PK, co-morbidities and C-reactive protein. Healthy
      volunteers and TB patients receive frequent scheduled blood draws during a 24 hour period
      after ingesting a dose of TB drugs.
