  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate several aspects of chronic use of acid
      suppressing medication: dependence on maintenance therapy, the possibilities for on-demand
      use, and predictors (patient characteristics) for daily need, for on-demand use and for
      termination of chronic use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2-5% of the general population is chronic user of acid suppressing medication (proton pump
      inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists), mostly because of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      (GORD). Prescription data from health insurances show that the number of chronic users
      increases every year, which has large economic consequences.

      There are indications however that on-demand and intermittent therapy can be as effective as
      daily use. No evidence exists regarding patients who are likely to benefit from intermittent,
      on-demand therapy or even termination.

      In this study several aspects of chronic use of acid suppressive therapy are investigated in
      family practice patients.

      Chronic users are transferred to pantoprazole 20 mg for 4 weeks. Patients with adequate
      relief of symptoms are randomized in two groups for a period of 13 weeks.

      group 1: daily pantoprazole 20 mg, placebo on-demand (indicative for placebo-dependency)
      group 2: daily placebo, pantoprazole 20 mg on-demand (indicative for pharmacological
      dependency) Patients visit the research nurse at the beginning of the study and at week 4, 5,
      10 and 17.

      In this study we are looking for patient characteristics indicative for the dependency on
      acid suppressive drugs and for possibilities to reduce the dose of these drugs.

      Furthermore, aspects described in &quot;secondary outcomes&quot; will be addressed.
