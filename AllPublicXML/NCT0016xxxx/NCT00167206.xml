  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether thymic shielding during total body
      irradiation can be given and whether it will reduce the risk of infections in Fanconi Anemia
      patients undergoing alternate donor (not a matched sibling) stem cell transplants.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will be given the same treatment regimen of total body irradiation (TBI),
      Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), followed by an alternate
      donor stem cell transplant. Since this treatment regimen has been given before, without
      thymic shielding, we will compare the outcomes of these patients with the historical data
      from subjects who did not receive thymic shielding.

    <intervention_name>Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant</intervention_name>
    <description>Bone marrow failure may be treated by giving patients stem cells that come from someone else. This is called a stem-cell transplant. As part of the transplant process, patients receive high doses of chemotherapy and/or radiation to treat their underlying disease. As one of its effects, this treatment also kills the healthy stem cells that are already in the marrow. The transplant provides new stem cells for the patient from a healthy donor; that replace the bone marrow and allow the blood counts to recover.</description>
