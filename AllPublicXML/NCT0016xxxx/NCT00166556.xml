  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter open-label single arm trial in which recipients of liver
      allograft will receive uniform immunosuppressive induction and maintenance regimens.
      Participants with end stage liver disease who meets the entry criteria will be consented and
      enrolled.

      Participants receive Campath-1H and maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus therapy.
      After one year of tacrolimus therapy, an assessment of the immunologic status including blood
      gene expression and geno-race studies will be performed which will include studies on the
      liver graft biopsy. At this time, patients will be selected to undergo immunosuppressive
      withdrawal. This will be made on an individual basis with definitive inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.

      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of immunosuppressive
      regimens comprising Campath-1H induction followed by maintenance immunosuppressive therapy
      with tacrolimus on allograft survival. However, secondary objectives will be to assess
      withdrawing tacrolimus after Campath-1H induction in an immune depletion and subsequent
      immune reconstitution. This study will evaluate whether a combination of anti-rejection
      medications (Campath-1H and tacrolimus) can prevent rejection and allow the body to develop
      tolerance to the transplanted liver.
