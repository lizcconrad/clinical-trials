      The purpose of this study is to determine if the known differences in genes influence drug
      metabolizing enzymes and receptors that are involved in risperidone drug action. The study
      will determine if differences in these genes will change the concentration of risperidone in
      the blood over time in children in relation to side effects and clinical response to
      risperidone.

      To the knowledge of the investigators there are no studies documenting the pharmacokinetics
      and pharmacogenetics of risperidone in children with PDD. Currently the PPRU network is
      conducting a PK study whose aim is to establish a new enantio-selective micro-assay
      methodology and to generate preliminary population PK data of risperidone and its metabolites
      in PDD. This study focuses on pharmacogenetic evaluation of PDD patients having little or no
      effect, those that are unusually sensitive and those experiencing drug toxicity/adverse
      events at standard risperidone dosages.

      In this study two 5 ml blood samples will be drawn at a regulary scheduled PK visit.
      Alternatively pooled waste blood samples or a buccal swab can be obtained.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients between the ages of 4 and 21 years.

          -  Patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder, Pervasive Developmental
             Disorder (PDD), or Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)
             and about to initiate clinical treatment or currently clinically treated with
             risperidone.

          -  Patients about to initiate clinical treatment or currently clinically treated with
             risperidone, or currently on risperidone as a participant in one of the multi-site
             Research Unit for Pediatric Psychopharmacology (RUPP) protocols.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children taking psychotropic or other medication that will significantly interact with
             target CYP 450 isoenzyme activity, such to the discretion of the principal
             investigator (PI).

          -  Patients with known renal or hepatic dysfunction (e.g. serum creatinine, and
             transaminases or bilirubin exceeding age specific upper range limits) are not
             eligible.

          -  Failure of the parent/legal guardian to give informed consent.
