  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is benefit from providing cognitive
      rehabilitation in the group setting. Several standardized tools will be used to measure
      progress when a participant enters the group, leaves the group and at a one year follow-up.

      This research study will look at the outcome benefits of providing cognitive rehabilitation,
      utilizing the group process. Criteria for selecting the appropriate participants, group
      format and structure, as well as use of standardized assessments. The assessments used: Three
      Step Calendar Approach, (Sohlberg and Mateer) Satisfaction With Life scale (SWLS), Community
      Integration Questionnaire (CIQ), Independent Living Scale, and the Vocational Independence
      Scale. The group setting provides an atmosphere to work on building communication skills
      through peer feedback and to develop psychological coping strategies. Techniques such as the
      problem solving format and a calendar system. Analysis and outcomes of 17 past group
      participants were analyzed supporting cognitive rehabilitation in the group setting.

      Of the 20 participants, 3 chose not to be included.
