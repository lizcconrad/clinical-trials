  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of &quot;A-PROTEIN&quot;
      levels in patients with brain tumors. A-PROTEIN levels will be analyzed both pre and post
      treatment. Levels in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be analyzed and correlated
      with the underlying diagnosis and outcome.

      -  Patients will be identified at the time of presentation to their neurologist,
           neurosurgeon or oncologist.

        -  Blood or cerebrospinal fluid will be collected for this study only when they are being
           collected for other reasons before and after each surgery. Samples will also be
           collected after any event such as significant change in symptoms or radiographic
           progression.

        -  Once the patients condition has been stabilized, samples will be take at regular
           intervals of &gt;= 1 month. The duration of this study is 24 months.

    <description>Serum samples were collected when patients were due for clinically indicated phlebotomy. Serum A-PROTEIN levels were determined using a competitive labeled antibody assay and patients were classified into 3 groups: negative &lt;7pM, equivocal 7-9.9 pM and positive &gt;/= 10 pM; Clinical status at the same time of the sample collection was established by MRI scans and patients grouped as either resected/decreased versus stable/increased. The relationship between clinical status and A-PROTEIN level was assessed using general estimating equations. Association was defined as a statistically significant p-value from the regression model.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with possible malignant or benign lesions of the central nervous system
             will be included.

          -  There are no restrictions with respect to treatment protocols or prior therapy.

          -  Patients will be identified after presentation to the neurosurgical, neurological or
             oncologic services at participating centers. Any patient with evidence of a central
             nervous system tumor will be eligible. Individuals without evidence of CNS tumors are
             also eligible, in order to provide blinded controls.

          -  A signed informed consent will be requested and required for participation.

          -  There is no age, sex, or ethnic origin restrictions in this protocol. Patients who
             choose not to participate in the study will continue to have their regular care as
             defined by their treating team. Patients who speak foreign languages are eligible as
             long a translator can be found to ensure proper consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria: There are no exclusion criteria for this study.
