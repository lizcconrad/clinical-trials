      -  Subjects who received DTPw-HBV/Hib in the primary vaccination without HBV at birth will
           be randomised (1:3 ratio) to receive either: Plain PRP at 10 months of age followed by
           DTPw-HBV at 15-18 months of age or DTPw-HBV/Hib at 15-18 months of age.

        -  Subjects who received DTPw-HBV + Hib in the primary vaccination without HBV at birth
           will receive DTPw-HBV + Hib as a booster.

        -  Subjects who received DTPw-HBV/Hib in the primary vaccination with HBV at birth will
           receive DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccine as a booster.
