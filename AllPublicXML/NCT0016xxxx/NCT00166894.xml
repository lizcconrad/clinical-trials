      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the level of TREM-1 in different kinds of pleural
      effusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a member of the
      immunoglobulin superfamily, and its expression is upregulated on phagocytic cells in the
      presence of bacteria or fungi. Several experiments by Bouchon and colleagues showed that
      TREM-1 mediates the acute inflammatory response to microbial products. Human tissues infected
      with bacteria are infiltrated with neutrophils and macrophages that express high levels of
      TREM-1. Conversely, TREM-1 is only weakly expressed in samples from patients with
      noninfectious inflammatory disorders. In addition, TREM-1 is shed from the membrane of
      activated phagocytes and can be found in a soluble form in body fluids. The presence of a
      soluble form of TREM-1 in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mechanically
      ventilated patients has been shown to be a good indicator of infectious pneumonia.
