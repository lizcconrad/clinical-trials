      autologous stem cell transplantation in poor risk diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

      This is a multicentric, open-label, randomized clinical study, evaluating the efficacy and
      the safety of Rituximab After ASCT in patients aged 18 to 59 years with previously untreated
      High-Risk (aa-IPI 2 or 3 ) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma .

      The duration of the treatment period is approximately 25 weeks and patients are followed
      until Death.

      From 10/99 to 05/03, 476 patients were enrolled. 235 patients were assigned to receive ACE
      and 241 to ACVBP. Among the 331 patients, in Complete response (CR+CRu) after induction, who
      received HDC, 269 were randomized (R2) after hematological recovery to receive either
      rituximab (n=139) or nothing (n=130).

      The final analysis was performed in June 2005.
