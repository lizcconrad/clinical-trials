        Inclusion Criteria:

        ICU patients are eligible for enrolment if they meet all of the following:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  In ICU for &lt; 48 hours prior to enrolment

          -  Receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (through an endotracheal tube or
             tracheostomy, but NOT a facemask) with an anticipated need for &gt; 48 hours of
             mechanical ventilation

          -  Receiving a continuous infusion of any one of:

               -  morphine &gt; 2 mg/hour,

               -  fentanyl &gt; 20 mcg/hour, or

               -  pethidine &gt; 20 mg/hour

          -  Either a single GRV &gt; 150 mls (whilst receiving EN via a NG tube) or nasogastric
             drainage &gt; 500 mls over 12 hours (whether receiving EN or not)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be ineligible for enrolment if they meet any of the following:

          -  Previous or recent surgery which has altered the anatomy of the upper gastrointestinal
             tract (eg. oesophagectomy, gastrectomy, any gastric anastomosis surgery, gastroplasty,
             pyloroplasty, pancreaticoduodenectomy [Whippleâ€™s procedure])

          -  Known gastric malignancy

          -  Known oesophageal varices

          -  Current admission for peptic ulceration

          -  Current mechanical bowel obstruction

          -  Current gastrostomy, jejunostomy, or surgically-placed enteral tube in situ

          -  Contraindication to the use of the nose and mouth for enteral tube insertion (eg.
             recent facial trauma or surgery)

          -  Receiving nutritional support prior to ICU admission

          -  Severe coagulopathy (defined by platelet count &lt; 20 and/or international normalized
             ratio [INR] &gt; 4.0)
