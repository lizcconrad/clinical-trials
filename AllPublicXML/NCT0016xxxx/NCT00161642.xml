  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose
      of CMD-193. Preliminary information about how a person's body processes CMD-193 and how
      CMD-193 affects tumors will also be collected.

             therapy, or for which no standard effective treatment is available

          -  Tumor expression of Lewis Y antigen ( &gt; or = 20% tumor cells positive for Lewis Y by
             immunohistochemistry assay)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic or clinically active CNS metastases. Subjects who have had prior treatment
             with radiotherapy or surgical resection for CNS metastases will be permitted if CNS
             metastases have remained stable and have not required any treatment for at least 3
             months prior to the first dose of CMD-193.
