      The purpose of this study is to determine wether a complementary therapy consisting of a
      combined medication of selenium, milk thistle, goldenrod and bromelain and a consultation
      concerning nutrition and physical activity can reduce side effects of a chemotherapy in
      breast cancer patients.

      patients were randomized to receive: (a) individual nutrition consultation with
      recommendations for physical activity before or on the first day of chemotherapy together
      with daily oral medication consisting of selenium (sodium-selenit 100 microg/d), milk thistle
      (silibin 280 mg/d), goldenrod (solidago 1,680g/d) and pineapple enzyme (bromelaine 3.000
      F.I.P. units/d) during the first three cycles till 3-5 weeks later, (b) individual nutrition
      consultation with recommendations for physical activity only and (c) a leaflet “5-a-day” for
      the control group.

      Primary endpoint was the difference of the global health status from the EORTC QLQ-C30 before
      and 3-5 weeks after the third cycle of chemotherapy. Secondary endpoints were the other
      subscales of the EORTC QLQ C3o and BR 23 and anxiety and depression from the HADS-D.
