  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspergillus is a fungus found in soil, on farms and on construction sites. In those whose
      immune system is impaired it causes severe infection. The people who are particularly at
      high-risk of infection with Aspergillus (which is called Invasive Aspergillosis)are those
      with acute leukaemia who are having chemotherapy and those post bone marrow transplantation.
      Currently 15% of those at high-risk develop Invasive Aspergillosis and 60-90% of those with
      Invasive Aspergillosis die.

      The main reason for this high death rate is that our current diagnostic tests are not good at
      detecting infection or often only detect the infection at advanced stages when treatment is
      ineffective. Because of the limitations of current diagnostic tests the current practice is
      to give empiric antifungal therapy (EAFT) early to treat suspected Invasive Aspergillosis.
      However studies have demonstrated that this therapy has only resulted in a minor reduction in
      the mortality rates and it also causes significant drug toxicity. It is a suboptimal
      treatment modality.

      New tests have recently been developed to diagnose Invasive Aspergillosis. These tests are
      for the detection of an Aspergillus protein in blood and for the detection of Aspergillus DNA
      in blood. Available data suggests that these new tests make an early diagnosis and seem to be
      able to monitor responses to treatment. However no study has been reported to date which
      demonstrates that the use of these tests can impact on important patient outcomes. This trial
      is being performed to determine whether the use of the new diagnostic tests to guide
      antifungal therapy will help improve treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis, reduce drug
      toxicity and reduce the death rate in the high-risk patients as compared with the current
      standard method of diagnosis and treatment with EAFT.

    <description>The standard-diagnostic strategy was designed to be consistent with the 2002 guidelines for antimicrobial use in neutropenic patients with cancer. When an invasive fungal infection was suspected (e.g. persistent fevers) cultures of blood, urine, sputum (if available) and faeces (if clinically indicated), and HRCT scans of chest were performed. Bronchoscopy and biopsies were performed according to institutional protocols. Empiric antifungal therapy was recommended whilst undergoing these investigations and was continued, de-escalated to prophylaxis, or changed to treatment of invasive aspergillosis or other IFD according to test results.</description>
