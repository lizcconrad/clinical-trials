  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the analgesic potential of an neural blockade (Fascia iliaca compartment) with
      local anaesthetics in patients with hip fracture immediately after arrival in the emergency
      department.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture patients have severe pain in the acute phase. Traditional analgesic treatment
      have consisted of intramuscular morphine with its associated side effects. The trial
      evaluates the Fascia iliaca compartment compared to regular opioid pain therapy in hip
      fracture patinets immediately after arrival at the emergency department.
