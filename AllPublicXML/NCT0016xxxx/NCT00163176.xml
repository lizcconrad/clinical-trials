  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumor cell proliferation and repopulation contribute to resistance to radiotherapy in head
      and neck cancer. Up to now, this characteristic is mostly assessed using biopsies acquired
      during inspection under general anaesthesia before treatment.

      18F-FLT-PET (positron emission tomography) is a non-invasive imaging method showing areas of
      active proliferation. The aim of this study is to assess the value of the functional
      information gained by 18F-FLT-PET for radiotherapy planning and early tumor response
      assessment.

      Prior to radiotherapy, a planning CT-scan and a 18F-FLT-PET scan are acquired. After
      approximately two weeks of radiotherapy a further PET scan is obtained.
