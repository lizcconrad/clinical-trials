    <textblock>
      To determine the prevalence of colorectal neoplasms in first degree relatives of those
      affected with sporadic colorectal cancer using colonoscopy as a screening tool. The
      prevalence will be compared to that of a defined matched cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is a second commonest tumor in Hong Kong and the second commonest cause of
      cancer related death. About 1 in 23 males will develop colorectal cancer in his life time.
      The disease tends to cluster in families. This may be a combination of factors including
      shared genes, shared environment or chance. Known familial syndromes occur in only about 5%
      of cases. The majority is not well understood and labelled sporadic colorectal cancer. The
      screening strategy in families of subjects with colorectal cancer has not been defined.
      Colonoscopy is among the most sensitive and specific screening tool for colorectal neoplasm.
      The current study determines the prevalence of adenomas among first degree relatives of
      patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. To quantify risk in this cohort, a case control
      analysis is used. The prevalence of the cohort is compared to that of a control population.
      The control group consists of relatives of patients with normal colonoscopic findings during
      the same study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  First degree relatives (age &gt;40 and &lt;70) of individuals affected with sporadic
             colorectal cancer (those not associated with inflammatory bowel disease, familial
             adenomatous polyposis or HNPCC syndrome).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A family history compatible with that of Hereditary Non-polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC)
             based on the Amsterdam criteria [Table 5].

          -  Known Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) syndrome

          -  Patients and relatives with known inflammatory bowel disease

          -  Relatives that have received colonoscopy examinations in the past 5 years [details of
             colonoscopic examinations will be sought and information on colonic neoplasms
             recorded]. Those who have had barium enema examinations are eligible for trial
             inclusion as barium examinations often have low sensitivity and specificity for
             adenomas (around 70% respectively)

          -  Severe cardio-pulmonary or other medical co-morbidities that preclude safe
             colonoscopic examination
