    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the involvement of small airways in asthma, as
      determined by bronchial challenges, CT-scanning, and cellular markers of inflammation.
      Ciclesonide will be inhaled at one dose level once daily. The study duration consists of a
      baseline period (2 to 3 weeks) and a treatment period (5 to 6 weeks). The study will provide
      further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.
