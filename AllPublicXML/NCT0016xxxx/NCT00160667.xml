          -  Pain present for at least 6 months after healing of the acute herpes zoster skin rash.

          -  Pain intensity score assessed on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale with a score
             of at least 4 at the screening visit and with an average weekly score of at least 4 on
             an 11-point numerical pain rating scale during baseline period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject getting any kind of psychological support to help cope with pain such as

          -  Subject who had undergone or who is scheduled for neurolytic or neurosurgical therapy
             for post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) or who receives trans-electrical neural stimulation
             (TENS.

          -  Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) or
             permitted opioid analgesics (&quot;strong&quot; opioids are forbidden) that started less than 30

             stable during the study.

          -  Intake of more than two pain treatments at trial entry (screening visit) including
             Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
