      Using a touch screen computer, the researchers are screening emergency department patients
      for intimate partner violence and mental health issues. The researchers are looking to see if
      those who participate in a computer screen and are given referral lists as well as having the
      computer printout placed on the physician clipboard, will increase physician awareness and
      recognition as well as patient use of resources compared to usual care.
