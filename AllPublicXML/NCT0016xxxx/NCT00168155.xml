      When colon or rectal cancer has spread to the liver, the cancer in the liver can sometimes be
      removed surgically. However, the cancer has a chance or reoccurring in the liver or elsewhere
      in the body. This study will determine if giving chemotherapy treatment before the surgery
      can reduce the chances that the cancer will come back.
