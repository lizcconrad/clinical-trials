  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance and to monitor the safety of the
      bone substitute Macroporous Biphasic Calcium Phosphate-Fibrin Sealant Vapor Heated
      Solvent/Detergent Treated 4 IU/ML Thrombin (MBCP-FS) in Sinus Lift Procedures . This study
      will be conducted in two parts: part A evaluates safety and performance of MBCP-FS in bone
      regeneration i.e. the amount of new bone that is formed and its suitability for dental
      implant placement. Part B is designed to evaluate long-term safety and performance of the
      product, i.e. whether the newly-formed bone is suitable to retain implants.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject prior to participation in the study

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Partially or totally edentulous with an atrophic posterior maxilla requiring
             unilateral or bilateral sinus lift before dental implant placement

          -  In case of bilateral sinus lifts, both sides are operated on the same day.

          -  Subjects with remaining minimal maxillary bone height between 2 mm and 5 mm at the
             site with minimal height in the area where implants are planned, and a remaining
             maxillary bone thickness &gt;= 5 mm in the area where implants are planned

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or coeval major surgical intervention in the targeted area, or major surgical
             intervention in the targeted area planned within the next 18 months (like Caldwell
             Luc) (minor interventions like surgical tooth extraction or root tip resections are
             allowed)

          -  Surgical tooth extraction in the targeted area less than three months before the SLP

          -  Maxillary and sinus disorders including: acute sinusitis, chronic sinus pathology,
             retained root tips, polyps, tumors, and cysts in antral cavity or odontogenic cysts,
             alveolar scar ablation

          -  Major occlusal disturbance, like severe bruxism

          -  Uncontrolled* periodontal disease

          -  An inadequate interarch distance requiring an oppositional graft

          -  Immune system disorders, immunodeficiency or immunosuppression

          -  Known coagulation disorder

          -  Uncontrolled* diabetes mellitus

          -  Severe hyperparathyroidism

          -  Receiving long-term anti-inflammatory treatment with NSAIDs or corticosteroids

          -  Chemotherapy current or in the last three months

          -  Having undergone maxillary radiation therapy

          -  Known hypersensitivity to aprotinin or to other components of the investigational
             product

          -  Abuse of alcohol or drugs or tobacco consumption of more than 5 cigarettes per day at
             study start

          -  Non-compliant for future dental hygiene

          -  Severely compromised physical and psychological health, that in the investigators
             opinion will affect patient compliance

          -  Any contra-indications to the use of MBCP, which are defined as osteomyelitis,
             degenerative bone disease or necrosis of the recipient site

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical trial and having received another
             investigational drug or device within the last 30 days

          -  Pregnant or lactating, or intending to become pregnant during the study period

               -  Uncontrolled = not treated or not stabilized after treatment
