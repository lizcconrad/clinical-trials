  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is the current first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria
      in Malawi. The malaria parasite P. falciparum has developed resistance to this drug so that
      the drug is much less effective than in previous years. This study was developed and
      conducted in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Programme of Malawi to assess
      the efficacy of four antimalarial drug combinations to provide evidence to assist the
      Malawian Ministry of Health in identifying and implementing as policy the next first-line
      antimalarial for uncomplicated malaria in Malawi. In an open, randomized trial in children
      under five years of age, four drug combinations, all of which are licensed in Malawi, are
      being assessed: amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ-SP), amodiaquine plus
      artesunate (AQ-Art), chlorproguanil-dapsone plus artesunate (CD-Art) and
      lumefantrine-artemether (LA). SP is also included as a fifth arm of the study for current
      data on its efficacy. Data on side effects of the drugs will also be collected. The results
      of this study will provide some of the information necessary to guide the Malawi National
      Malaria Control Program in selecting its next first antimalarial treatment for uncomplicated
      malaria. The study adheres to the World Health Organization's 2003 standardized protocol for
      assessing antimalarial drug efficacy.
