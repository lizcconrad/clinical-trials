    <textblock>
      To investigate a new incidence and preventive effect of menatetrenone on vertebral fracture
      in patients with osteoporosis who were randomly assigned to either treatment arm receiving
      daily dose of calcium supplement as a monotherapy (calcium monotherapy group) or
      menatetrenone plus calcium supplement as a combination therapy (menatetrenone combo therapy
      group) for 36 months, followed by a 12-month follow-up observation to examine the preventive
      effect on the fracture risk.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inpatient or outpatient is not asked. If using any anti-osteoporotic agent other than
        calcium preparations (i.e., contraindicated for concomitant use stipulated in the protocol
        of this post-marketing study), such agent must be discontinued. Even after the
        discontinuation, calcium dosing is permitted with a condition that the subsequent use is
        started after a 8-week elapse from the discontinuation.

          -  Patients with primary osteoporosis (diagnosed according to &quot;Diagnostic Criteria for
             Primary Osteoporosis issued by the Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Research
             (1995).&quot;

          -  Post-menopausal patients aged 50 years or older.

          -  Patients who agree to participate in a 4-year follow-up observation.

          -  Patients who provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteira:

          -  Patients on warfarin potassium (WarfarinÂ®) therapy.

          -  Patients with hypercalcemia.

          -  Patietns with renal calculus.

          -  Patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to calcium or menatetrenone
             preparations.

          -  Patients with severe complication in the hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, cardio- and
             cerebrovascular system.

          -  Patients who underwent bilateral ovariectomy.

          -  Patients with radiotherapy in the pelvis or para-aortic area.

          -  Patients with the following X-ray findings;

               1. Patients showing osteophytes connecting with adjacent vertebral osteophytes

               2. Patients showing hyperostosis of ligament around the vertebral body

               3. Patients showing inter-body fusion

               4. Patients who experienced surgical intervention(s) in the spine

               5. Patients with scoliosis which disturbs a diagnosing of vertebral fracture

          -  Patients who have been treated with anti-osteoporotic agents, other than calcium
             preparation, within 8 months prior to the study treatment (but not applied to the
             following; if discontinued, non-treated, or shifted to calcium monotherapy for 8 weeks
             or longer before starting the study treatment).

          -  Patients who experienced bisphosphonates in the past.

          -  Patients who are likely to show insufficient absorption of liposoluble agents such as
             biliary atresia, impaired bile secretion, etc.

          -  Other patients who are judged to be ineligible for study entry by the investigator or
             investigator.
