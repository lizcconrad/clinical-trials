      This study aims to increase physical activity among overweight African-American women with
      mobility limitations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular, sustainable physical activity can have a dramatic effect on reducing obesity and
      other secondary conditions and increasing quality of life. People with mobility limitations
      have a higher level of physical inactivity resulting from numerous personal and environmental
      barriers to physical activity participation. This project will evaluate the feasibility of
      increasing physical activity among overweight individuals with mobility limitations through
      physician-referrals to a personalized exercise programme at the Chicago-based National Center
      on Physical Activity and Disability (NCPAD).
