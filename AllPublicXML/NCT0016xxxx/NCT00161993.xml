      The purpose of this study is to determine the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Immune
      Globulin Intravenous (Human), 10% TVR (Triple Virally Reduced) Solution in subjects with
      primary immunodeficiency (PID) manifesting as hypo- or agammaglobulinemia. Subjects are
      treated every 21 days and receive a total of 12 infusions: for the first 3 infusions subjects
      receive GAMMAGARD S/D to ensure a steady-state and to acquire data with a licensed product;
      for the remaining 9 infusions subjects receive IGIV, 10% TVR Solution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be eligible for study entry if they:

          -  are at least 18 years old

          -  have a form of primary immunodeficiency (PID) as described by Rosen et al, 1999 16
             manifesting as agammaglobulinemia (X-linked) or hypogamma-globulinemia (common
             variable immunodeficiency), requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy

          -  have had regular treatment for at least three months with either intravenous
             immunoglobulin preparations or immunoglobulin preparations for intramuscular use given
             subcutaneously

          -  have serum IgG levels greater than or equal to 5 g/L as determined by the local
             laboratory at screening

          -  if female of childbearing potential, agree to employ adequate birth control measures
             during the study

          -  have given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not be eligible for study entry if they:

          -  had severe adverse reactions to treatment with immunoglobulin preparations during the
             last three treatments before inclusion into the study

          -  suffer from documented selective IgA deficiency with antibodies against IgA

          -  have an acute infection that requires intravenous antibiotic treatment (Last treatment
             day should be seven days before study entry.)

          -  are known to be infected with HIV, HCV, or HBV

          -  are at high risk of contracting blood-borne viral infections through parenteral drug
             abuse or life style

          -  suffer from congestive heart failure and receive on-demand treatment with furosemide

          -  show renal dysfunction defined as serum creatinine greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL
             at baseline visit

          -  received another investigational drug in the three weeks preceding study entry

          -  in case of females, are pregnant or nursing mothers
