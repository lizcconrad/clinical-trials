      A double-blind, randomized, clinical trial of 30 subjects will be carried out to develop
      procedures for testing the effectiveness of curcumin on slowing Alzheimer's disease (AD)
      progression. Curcumin is a polyphenolic molecule extracted from turmeric and is widely and
      safely used as a yellow food coloring. Because of its strong anti-inflammatory activity,
      curcumin was tested in animal models of AD, where it significantly reduced levels of brain
      amyloid, oxidized proteins, and isoprostanes, and prevented cognitive deficits. AD patients
      will receive placebo, 1 g, or 4 g of curcumin daily for six months. All patients will also
      receive 120 mg ginkgo leaf extract daily. At 0, 1, 3, and 6 months of the study, a cognitive
      test will be performed, and blood samples will be analyzed for levels of isoprostane, amyloid
      beta protein, metals, and cholesterol. Curcumin and its metabolites will be measured in blood
      at 1 month. The primary objective for this first human study of curcumin in AD is to examine
      safety and procedures for a possible larger trial testing curcumin against AD. The secondary
      objective is to determine whether curcumin affects biochemical measures, and, if so, which
      dose is most effective. The tertiary objective is to determine whether curcumin slows
      cognitive decline in AD. This study may lead to inexpensive treatment that delays progression
      of AD.
