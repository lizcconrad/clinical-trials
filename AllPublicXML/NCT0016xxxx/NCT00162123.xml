    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the continued use of ipilimumab in patients who had
      reinduction at the time of disease progression or to continue maintenance treatment. In
      addition, this study will continue to follow patients who have taken ipilimumab, but who are
      not eligible for maintenance or reinduction therapy.

    <measure>Number of Participants With On-study Adverse Events (AEs), AEs Leading to Discontinuation, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Drug-related AEs, Immune-related AEs (irAEs), and Death as Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuously from first dose to 70 days after last dose of study drug. For deaths, Day 1 of enrollment to 70 days after last dose of study drug.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Drug-related is defined as having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. An IrAE is an AE characterized by a potential association with inflammation and considered by the investigator to be drug related. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug in parent study to death or date of last censoring.</time_frame>
    <description>OS was computed for all patients who entered this study and is defined as the time between the first dose of study therapy and death. If a patient has not died, OS was censored at the time of last contact.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Surviving at 1, 1.5, and 2 Years</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug in parent study to up to 2 years after reinduction</time_frame>
    <description>Survival rate was defined as the time from first dose of study drug to 1, 1.5, and 2 years.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With On-study Immune-related Adverse Events (irAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study drug during reinduction to the earliest of 70 days after last dose or day before second reinduction first dose date</time_frame>
    <description>irAEs were defined as adverse events characterized by a potential association with inflammation and considered by the investigator as drug related. These prespecified terms were grouped into the following organ-specific subcategories: gastrointestinal, hepatic, skin, endocrine, neurologic, and other (includes blood, eye, immune system, investigations, infections, renal, and respiratory systems). Patients may have 1 or more events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of first reinduction in current study to date of progression or death, whichever occurred first.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time between the date of the baseline tumor assessment in this study and the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <description>Participants who initially received ipilimumab, 0.3 mg/kg, in a parent study received ipilimumab, 10 mg/kg in the current study. Ipilimumab was administered as an individual open-label dose every 3 weeks for the first 10 weeks of reinduction for a total of 4 separate doses unless the patient experienced disease progression or withdrew consent. Participants had to wait 3 weeks from the last dose of ipilimumab in a parent study to the first dose of ipilimumab in the current study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With On-study Adverse Events (AEs), AEs Leading to Discontinuation, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Drug-related AEs, Immune-related AEs (irAEs), and Death as Outcome</title>
        <description>An AE is any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. An SAE is a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Drug-related is defined as having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. An IrAE is an AE characterized by a potential association with inflammation and considered by the investigator to be drug related. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death.</description>

Ipilimumab was administered as an individual open-label dose every 3 weeks for the first 10 weeks of reinduction for a total of 4 separate doses unless the patient experienced disease progression or withdrew consent. Participants had to wait 3 weeks from the last dose of ipilimumab in a parent study to the first dose of ipilimumab in the current study.</description>

          <description>irAEs were defined as adverse events characterized by a potential association with inflammation and considered by the investigator as drug related. These prespecified terms were grouped into the following organ-specific subcategories: gastrointestinal, hepatic, skin, endocrine, neurologic, and other (includes blood, eye, immune system, investigations, infections, renal, and respiratory systems). Patients may have 1 or more events.</description>
