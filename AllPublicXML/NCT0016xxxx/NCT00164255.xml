      This study is an investigation to compare the efficacy of two different intermittent
      sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) treatment regimens and intermittent sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine
      (SP) + artesunate (SP/AS) treatment of HIV negative and positive mothers in clearing
      placental parasitemia at delivery. If intermittent protective SP/AS treatment is equally
      efficacious and safe as intermittent protective SP, such a regimen could be adapted for
      programmatic use as a potentially more durable alternative to SP monotherapy in areas of
      increasing SP resistance.
