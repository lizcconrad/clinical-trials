      The purpose of this study is to see if a medication called prazosin is useful in the
      treatment of agitation and aggression in persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other
      types of dementia in late life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the occurrence of disruptive agitation behaviors likely are influenced by
      environmental/ interpersonal factors, it is also likely that behaviorally relevant
      neurobiologic abnormalities lower the threshold for the expression of such behavior in
      Alzheimer's disease. Because of the success prazosin has had in the treatment of
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, it is thought that it could be used similarly with disruptive
      agitation. Originally designed to evaluate Alzheimer's disease patients in nursing homes, the
      study now includes outpatients. It is a 9-week placebo-controlled trial.

    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) at Last Observation</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC) is a 7 point scale, where 1 indicates &quot;markedly improved,&quot; 4 indicates &quot;no change,&quot; and 7 indicates &quot;markedly worse.&quot;</description>

    <measure>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score Over the Course of Study Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 (change from Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a 12-item scale that assesses the frequency and severity of behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia. Each Neuropsychiatric Inventory item ranges from 0 to 12. Therefore the Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score has a minimum total value of 0 and maximum 144, where 144 indicates higher levels of behavioral symptoms.
A change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score that is a negative number (that is, an Neuropsychiatric Inventory score decrease), indicates behavioral improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Total Score Over the Course of Study Participation</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 (change from Baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is an 18-item scale that rates psychiatric symptoms. Each item ranges from 1 to 7. Therefore, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale total score ranges from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 126, where 126 indicates higher levels of behavioral symptoms.
A change Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score that is a negative number (that is, a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score decrease), indicates behavioral improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No age limit

          -  probable/possible Alzheimer's disease diagnosis

          -  disruptive agitated behaviors (e.g., irritability, aggression, uncooperativeness,
             pacing)

          -  no hypotension

          -  no concurrent use of alpha-1-blockers

          -  no delirium, schizophrenia, mania, psychotic symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiovascular: unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction, second or third degree
             atrioventricular (AV) block, preexisting hypotension (systolic blood pressure less
             than 110) or orthostatic hypotension

          -  Other medical exclusions: chronic renal or hepatic failure, or any unstable medical
             condition

          -  Exclusionary medications: current treatment with prazosin, other alpha-1-blockers

          -  Current enrollment in a separate investigational drug trial

          -  Psychoactive medications: subjects may be psychoactive medication-free or be partial
             responders (by subjective assessment of referring health care professional) to one
             psychoactive medication from any of the following classes: antipsychotics,
             anticonvulsants, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or buspirone.
             Partial response is defined as some improvement in agitated behavior but persistence
             of agitated behaviors severe enough to cause patient distress and/or difficulty with
             caregiving. Although not formally rated, this improvement is equivalent to a Clinical
             Global Impression of Change (CGIC) rating of no more than minimal improvement
             (improvement is noticed by not enough to improve patient function or caregiver's
             practical management of the patient).

          -  Psychiatric/behavioral: lifetime schizophrenia; current delirium, mania, depression,
             or uncontrolled persistent distressing psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions),
             substance abuse, panic disorder, or any behavior which poses an immediate danger to
             patient or others or which results in the patient being too uncooperative to meet the
             requirements of study participation.

        <title>Change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score Over the Course of Study Participation</title>
        <description>The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a 12-item scale that assesses the frequency and severity of behavioral symptoms in patients with dementia. Each Neuropsychiatric Inventory item ranges from 0 to 12. Therefore the Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score has a minimum total value of 0 and maximum 144, where 144 indicates higher levels of behavioral symptoms.
A change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score that is a negative number (that is, an Neuropsychiatric Inventory score decrease), indicates behavioral improvement.</description>

        <population>Participants with at least one follow-up behavioral assessment visit were included in this analysis.
The mean group change was calculated by calculating the mean of each participant's follow-up measures, subtracting this mean from the baseline value, and then from these values, calculating group means and standard deviations.</population>
