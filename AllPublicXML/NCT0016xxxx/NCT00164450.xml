  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to adults, children appear to require higher weight-based doses of rifapentine to
      acheive comparable drug levels. TBTC Study 26, a study of the effectiveness and tolerability
      of weekly rifapentine/isoniazid for three months versus daily isoniazid for nine months for
      the treatment of latent tuberculosis infection, has been amended to include children ages
      2-11 based on an initial single-dose study and pharmacokinetic modeling. Study 26PK evaluates
      the adequacy of the doses chosen for young children enrolled in Study 26 with a single blood
      draw, 24 hours after the third or subsequent weekly Study 26 dose of rifapentine and
      isoniazid. An adult control is enrolled for each child enrolled.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of rifapentine have been studied in adults, adolescents (ages 12-15
      years), and patients with hepatic dysfunction and HIV infection. However, there are no
      published data on the efficacy, safety or pharmacokinetics of rifapentine in children. This
      lack of data has precluded till now enrollment of children less than 12 years old in TBTC
      Study 26, a study of the effectiveness and tolerability of weekly rifapentine/isoniazid for
      three months versus daily isoniazid for nine months for the treatment of latent tuberculosis
      infection, a phase 3 treatment trial that will enroll 8000 persons with latent tuberculosis
      infection. A recently completed initial evaluation of rifapentine pharmacokinetics among
      children receiving a single dose of rifapentine demonstrated significantly lower exposures of
      rifapentine among children compared to adults, when children were given weight-based doses
      chosen to be comparable to a 600 mg oral dose in adults. This reduced exposure suggested that
      children require higher weight-based doses than adults and a model was constructed to
      estimate rifapentine doses in children that would result in exposures similar to the 900 mg
      dose used for adults in Study 26. Study 26 has been amended to include children ages 2-11
      based on the initial single-dose study and pharmacokinetic modeling. The purpose of Study
      26PK is to evaluate the adequacy of the doses chosen for young children who enrolled in Study
      26.

      Briefly, this study aims to:

        -  determine whether rifapentine exposure is equivalent in young children receiving
           weight-based dosing to adults receiving 900 mg.

        -  correlate rifapentine exposure with toxicity in young children

        -  validate accuracy of weight-based dosing in children

        -  determine rifapentine bioavailability in children

        -  determine association in adults between polymorphisms of MDR1 genotype and rifapentine
           exposure

        -  correlate isoniazid concentrations in adults with acetylator status

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrolled in TBTC Study 26 randomized to treatment with once weekly isoniazid and
             rifapentine:

               -  Child between the ages of 2 to less than 12 years for whom informed consent by a
                  guardian and of assent (if applicable) have been obtained.

               -  Adult greater than age 18 for whom informed consent has been obtained.

          2. Willingness to undergo a blood phlebotomy 24 hours following dosing of isoniazid and
             rifapentine after receiving at least three once-weekly doses of rifapentine plus
             isoniazid.

        If as a result of a contact investigation, both a parent and child are enrolled in Study
        26, both may be co-enrolled into the pharmacokinetic substudy with the adult serving as the
        control for the child. Preference will be given to a biologic parent of the same gender. If
        no eligible biologic parent is available for study, the next adult of the same gender and
        at the same TBTC site, who is substudy eligible, will serve as the adult control.
