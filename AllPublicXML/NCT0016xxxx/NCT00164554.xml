      Children will receive comprehensive evaluations through the UOHSC ABC program The assessment
      for the child will include: medical issues (including medication), dysmorphic examination,
      intellectual assessment, academic achievement, language, and motor skills. This program will
      provide appropriate non-study services and referrals. Eligible families will be randomly
      assigned to treatment group or control group. Treatment group will receive Parent Child
      Interaction Therapy (PCIT). The Control group will receive standard referrals and services
      through the ABC program and the parent education/advocacy component of the project.

      PCIT has been adapted by the applicant for group administration. The intervention will
      consist of 90-minute sessions of PCIT once a week for 14 weeks. During PCIT sessions parents
      and children will participate in activities that promote interactions. A behavior specialist
      who will be observing through a two-way mirror assists parents in development of appropriate
      behaviors and interaction techniques. Parents will be prompted by use of in-ear devices
      (i.e., bug in the ear). This intervention has been shown to be effective in other
      populations. For each family, individualized goals for parent-child interactions will be set
      and reviewed each session. Homework assignments also will be given.

      Parent Component: Three 90-minute sessions conducted in a group format. Topics will include:
      FAS/ARND education, impact of FAS/ARND on families, specific development of a child with
      FAS/ARND, and FAS/ARND social skills and deficits.

      Evaluation Plan: Treatment and control groups will be compared using pre- and post-tests
      measures. Post-tests will be at the conclusion of the intervention and at a 6, 12, and
      18-month follow-ups. Process (e.g., parent satisfaction, compliance, etc) and outcome (e.g.,
      behavior, family functioning, etc) measures will be evaluated.
