  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) is a common clinical problem worldwide. In Hong Kong, it has
      been estimated that about 20% of patients with chest pain are misdiagnosed to have coronary
      heart disease. Despite its benign nature, this condition causes anxiety, impairs quality of
      life and consumes a substantial amount of healthcare resources. While acid reflux and
      motility disorder in the esophagus are often attributed as the cause of NCCP, visceral
      hyperalgesia of esophagus is now recognized to play a central role in the pathogenesis of
      this condition. This research project aims to evaluate the role of visceral hyperalgesia in
      Chinese patients with NCCP. NCCP patients will be evaluated for the prevalence of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal motility disorder by endoscopy, manometry and
      pH study. The visceral sensory and pain thresholds of these patients will be compared with
      asymptomatic controls.
