  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The response to salbutamol varies greatly among individuals. Data from previous studies
      indicate that some of the variability is accounted for by genetic polymorphisms in the gene
      encoding for the adrenoceptor subtype β2. The current study was designed to evaluate
      variability in the response to salbutamol among recently diagnosed patients who have not been
      treated by β2 agonists or corticosteroids.

      Lung function tests will be performed prior to and following a single dose administration of
      salbutamol through inhalation. Additional pharmacodynamic indices will be monitored including
      pulse and blood pressure. Three samples of plasma will be drawn for the evaluation of
      salbutamol plasma concentration.
