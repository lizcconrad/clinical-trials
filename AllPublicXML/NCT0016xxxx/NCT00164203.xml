  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and mood disorders are among the most prevalent mental health problems in childhood.
      They have severe long-term morbidity, and associated academic and social impairment.

      Building on the investigators' experience with outcome evaluation in clinically anxious or
      depressed children, they propose to evaluate within the school system a cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) intervention for children in grades 3 to 6 with elevated symptoms of anxiety or
      depression on standardized questionnaires.

      The participant's outcomes will be compared with those of similar children randomly assigned
      to an activity control group.

      Hypothesis 1a): Children in the intervention condition will show greater symptom reduction
      relative to children in the control condition (primary outcome: anxiety symptoms).

      Hypothesis 1b): Children in the intervention condition will show fewer symptoms during
      follow-up relative to children in the control condition.

      Hypothesis 2: Children with anxious or depressive symptoms treated in the school setting
      using CBT have a lower risk of developing internalizing disorders within 1 year of treatment
      than children in a control condition.

      Hypothesis 3: Self-esteem, anxiety and depression-related impairment, and academic
      functioning will improve more in intervention participants than in controls.

      Hypothesis 4: School characteristics, child age, and attitudes of participating personnel are
      predictive of treatment response.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with t-score elevations &gt; 60 on either the total score or at least 4
             subscales of either instrument will be considered eligible for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children will be excluded if they already meet criteria for disorders on the Anxiety
             Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS), are unable to complete the inventories due to
             intellectual impairment or weak English skills (limiting the benefits of cognitive
             behavioral therapy), or if they are already engaged in ongoing psychiatric or
             psychological treatment that could confound study intervention effects.

          -  Children with elevated 'externalizing' scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)
             (t-score &gt; 60) will also be excluded, as they are often difficult to manage in CBT
             groups, and may obtain more benefit from other interventions.
