  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of 3 asoprisnil doses
      (0.5 mg, 1.5 mg, and 5.0 mg) for 12 weeks in women with endometriosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, is a progressive,
      estrogen-dependent disease that occurs in menstruating women of reproductive age. Although
      all major endometriosis therapies are effective for the treatment of pain, no single
      treatment is superior to others in terms of efficacy. The major drawbacks of the current
      medical therapies are severe side effects such as hot flushes and osteoporosis. The objective
      of this study is to determine if a dose-response relationship exists between asoprisnil and
      endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea or to establish the lowest effective
      dose of asoprisnil in the treatment of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea associated with
      endometriosis. Women with surgically confirmed endometriosis will be administered asoprisnil
      0.5, 1.5, and 5 mg tablets or a placebo once daily for 3 months and efficacy will be assessed
      by improvement in pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, bleeding, analgesic use, global
      efficacy, and quality of life questionnaires. Safety will be based on assessments of the
      endometrium, lipid profiles, adverse events, and changes from baseline laboratory values and
      vital signs.
