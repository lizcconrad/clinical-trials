  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We previously compared the effect on mortality of the half dose and the full dose currently
      recommended by WHO. Unexpectedly, the low dose was clearly better for girls, but not for
      boys. The girls' response might have depended on the last vaccine received before the OPV and
      VAS campaign. We believe that these findings call for confirmation. In connection with a new
      campaign, we will examine whether half the dose or the full dose has a more beneficial effect
      on mortality and morbidity in girls, and furthermore address the potential effect
      modification by the last vaccine received before the supplementation.

    <textblock>
      In Guinea-Bissau, a combined OPV and VAS campaign took place in November 2002. Given the
      uncertainty about the best dose of VAS, we examined whether the half dose compared with the
      full dose currently recommended by WHO gave an equally good protection against childhood
      morbidity and mortality. Mortality after supplementation was lower, though not significantly
      so, for children who had received the half dose. However, there was a highly significant
      inversion of the effect for boys and girls; while the low dose was clearly better for girls,
      the full dose might have been slightly better for boys. The girls' responses to the high
      versus the low dose of vitamin A might have depended on the last vaccine received before the
      OPV and VAS campaign.

      We believe that these findings call for confirmation. In connection with the OPV and VAS
      campaign in November 2004 in Guinea-Bissau, we intend to examined whether half the dose of
      the dose currently recommended by WHO as compared to the full dose has a more beneficial
      effect on mortality and morbidity in girls, and furthermore address the potential effect
      modification by the last vaccine received before the supplementation.
