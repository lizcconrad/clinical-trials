  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to elucidate the role Endothelium-Derived Hyperpolarizing Factor
      (EDHF) plays in dilating blood vessels and whether it differs between healthy people and
      those with high cholesterol. A second purpose of the study is to determine the identity of
      EDHF.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vascular endothelium synthesizes at least four potent vasodilator substances: nitric
      oxide (NO), prostacyclin, carbon monoxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor
      (EDHF) that contribute to vasodilator tone, and to inhibition of platelet activation and
      inflammation. EDHF release is stimulated by receptor-dependent agonists such as acetylcholine
      and bradykinin (BK), and leads to hyperpolarization of the underlying smooth muscle cells
      presumably by opening Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Indirect pharmacological evidence suggests
      that EDHF is a cytochrome P450-derived arachidonic acid metabolite, presumably an epoxide.
      Although the pivotal role of NO to conduit vessel dilation in response to acute increases in
      shear stress is well known, its' contribution to dilation with sustained increases in flow
      are minimal, and may be due to EDHF release.

    <description>Simultaneous forearm blood flow (FBF) measurements were obtained in both arms using a dual-channel venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmograph at rest and after administration of tetraethylammonium (TEA). Flow measurements were recorded for approximately 7 seconds, every 15 seconds up to eight times and a mean FBF value was computed.

        <description>Simultaneous forearm blood flow (FBF) measurements were obtained in both arms using a dual-channel venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmograph at rest and after administration of tetraethylammonium (TEA).

          <title>Forearm Blood Flow (FBF) After Sodium Nitroprusside Administration</title>
          <description>Simultaneous forearm blood flow (FBF) measurements were obtained in both arms using a dual-channel venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmograph after administration of sodium nitroprusside. Flow measurements were recorded for approximately 7 seconds, every 15 seconds up to eight times and a mean FBF value was computed.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Findings are limited to the forearm microcirculations, thus other vascular beds including conductance arteries warrant further investigation. Nevertheless, it is known that the contribution of EDHF is less in conductance vessels than in microvessels.</limitations_and_caveats>
