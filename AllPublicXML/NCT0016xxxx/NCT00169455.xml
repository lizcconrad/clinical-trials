  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotavirus (RV) is the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis (GE) requiring
      hospitalization of infants and young children in developed and developing countries and can
      be a frequent cause of death in children less than 5 years of age. GSK Biologicals has
      developed a vaccine against human rotavirus gastroenteritis. In this study, the
      immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of the HRV vaccine will be evaluated when stored or
      reconstituted in circumstances different from the recommendations: i.e. when not
      reconstituted with a buffer or when stored for 7 days at 37°C before reconstitution. In
      addition, the effect of feeding will be explored for HRV vaccine reconstituted without
      buffer.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  A male or female between, and including, 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) of age at the
             time of the first vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine(s) within 30 days preceding the first dose of study vaccine or placebo,
             or planned use during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs prior to the first vaccine dose, since birth. (For
             corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to
             0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.)

          -  Planned administration of a vaccine (except routine paediatric vaccines) not foreseen
             by the study protocol. (If exceptionally OPV is given, this should be administered at
             least 14 days apart from the HRV vaccine or placebo dose.)

          -  Any clinically significant history of chronic gastrointestinal disease including any
             uncorrected congenital malformation of the GI tract or other serious medical condition
             as determined by the investigator.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition based on
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing is required).

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness.

          -  Gastroenteritis within 7 days preceding the study vaccine administration (warrants
             deferral of the vaccination).

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or blood products since birth or planned
             administration during the study period. Oral intake of immunoglobulins via e.g.
             breastfeeding is allowed.

          -  Previous confirmed occurrence of RV gastroenteritis.
