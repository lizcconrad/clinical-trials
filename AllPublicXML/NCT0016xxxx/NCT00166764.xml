  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychiatric patients under the mental impaired influences, their living function were
      disabled, and their social lives were handicapped consequently. Idea psychiatric treatment is
      to control the psychiatric symptoms in a better way, to develop efficient psychiatric
      adjustment, to manage living stress into a lower level, to gradually develop the meaning and
      value of the patientsâ€™ lives, and to obtain the satisfaction and happiness in life for them.
      In order to investigate the satisfaction for psychiatric patients under the current treatment
      and to evaluate their psychiatric health, it is necessary to measure the mental health status
      for the psychiatric patients, and to ensure the ideological status of psychiatric treatment.
      If there is a mental health measurement for the psychiatric patients, we may precisely
      identify the mental health levels of the patients and their mental disturbances degrees.
      Accordingly, we may develop efficient procedure to manage the mental health for the
      psychiatric patients, and to achieve the goal for the idea psychiatric treatment.

      In this study, we established the mental health assessment data sheet according to the
      clinical experiences. It includes mental health index data sheet, mental-and-physical stress
      response data sheet, mental sustentation data sheet, and supplemented with a general living
      satisfaction assessment data sheet. We will evaluate the reliability and validity of this
      study to ensure the usability of these data sheet in clinics. We will also recruit the
      continuous treated and mentally stabilized patients as subjects. After obtaining their
      written informed consents, we will go through these mental health assessments to discover the
      mental health status of these psychiatric patients, and use it as a reference to develop idea
      psychiatric treatment. We will use ICC test for the repeated measurement validity, Pearson r
      correlation coefficient within our data analyses to evaluate the validity of the same
      measurement, and independent t-test to assess the differences between the patient group and
      the society group (from previously established data files). This study result may evaluate
      the possible deficits existing in the traditional psychiatric treatment and may be used as a
      reference for the development of idea psychiatric medicine.
