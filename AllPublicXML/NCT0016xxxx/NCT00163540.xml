    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of a third
      vaccination with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml given approximately 12 months after the second vaccination
      in Study 225. In Study 225, two vaccinations were given using a rapid immunization schedule
      12 ± 2 days apart.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects who:

          -  received 2 vaccinations with FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml during Study 225

          -  understand the nature of the study, agree to its provisions and provide written
             informed consent

          -  are clinically healthy (i.e. the physician would have no reservation vaccinating with
             FSME-IMMUN 0.5 ml outside the scope of the clinical trial)

          -  have a negative pregnancy test result at the first medical examination (if female and
             capable of bearing children)

          -  agree to employ adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study (if
             female and capable of bearing children)

          -  agree to keep a Subject Diary

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who:

          -  have already been administered a third TBE vaccination elsewhere since receiving two
             vaccinations in Study 225

          -  have a history of infection with, or vaccination against, other flaviviruses since
             participation in Study 225 (e.g. yellow fever, dengue fever, japanese B encephalitis)

          -  have had an allergic reaction to one of the components of the vaccine since
             participation in Study 225

          -  suffer from a disease (e.g. autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency) or are undergoing a
             form of treatment (e.g., systemic corticosteroids) that can be expected to influence
             immunological functions

          -  have a known or suspected problem with drug or alcohol abuse (&gt;4 liters wine/week or
             equivalent doses of other alcoholic beverages)

          -  have donated blood or plasma within 30 days of study entry

          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 30 days of study entry

          -  are known to be HIV positive (an HIV test is not required specifically for this study)

          -  are simultaneously participating in another clinical trial including administration of
             an investigational product

          -  have participated in any other clinical study within 6 weeks prior to study start

          -  have participated in another Baxter vaccine study in the past 6 months (with the
             exception of follow-up studies)

          -  For female subjects: pregnancy or lactation
