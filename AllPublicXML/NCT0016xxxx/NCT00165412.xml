  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of breast MRI in detecting breast
      malignancies in survivors of Hodgkin's disease is more successful than the traditional
      mammogram.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The screening breast MRI and mammography will be performed 6 months or longer after the
           last mammogram. For pre-menopausal women, the screening will be performed during the
           second week of the menstrual cycle to reduce cycle-related breast changes. As much as
           possible, the breast MRI and mammogram are to be performed on the same day.

        -  On the day of the breast imaging studies, the patient will also be asked to fill out a
           baseline breast health questionnaire, which includes questions on time since radiation
           therapy, prior screening history, history of prior benign breast biopsies, menopausal
           status, prior hormonal therapy use, etc.

        -  In patients with suspicious findings or findings highly suggestive of malignancy, the
           abnormal findings will be reviewed with the patient and recommendations will be made for
           a biopsy.
