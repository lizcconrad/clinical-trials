  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency of allelic variants in TPMT in the
      Hispanic population and to compare the frequency in the Hispanic population with the
      Caucasian Population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relatively few studies have been performed evaluating the variant allele frequencies in
      Spanish populations. To date, no studies evaluating the TPMT variant allele frequency in the
      Hispanic population have been reported. Hispanics are a growing part of the patient
      population treated in the United States. Characterization of the proportion of patients with
      variant genotypes in this population is important since Hispanic children represent a
      significant proportion of children being treated with thiopurines.

      A single 3 cc heparinized blood sample will be obtained for TPMT genotyping. The sample will
      be obtained either simultaneously with a clinical sample, at the time of an otherwise
      medically indicated intravenous catheter placement or scavenged from excess blood remaining
      following clinical laboratory testing.
