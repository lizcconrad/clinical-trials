  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators wish to address the effects of different doses of
      vitamin A supplementation in low and normal birth weight infants.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Vitamin A supplementation administered at birth together with BCG vaccination is
           associated with a 30% reduction in infant mortality and morbidity during the first year
           of life in both normal and low birth weight infants.

        -  A lower dose of vitamin A may be even more beneficial than a high dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A deficiency is common in low-income countries. Vitamin A supplementation to children
      above 6 months of age reduces all-cause mortality by 23% to 30%. Studies on vitamin A
      supplementation in infants younger than 6 months of age have reported inconsistent effects on
      mortality. Studies providing supplementation between 1 and 5 months of age have found no
      effect or even a negative effect. However, the only two studies of supplementation at birth,
      both conducted in Asia, showed substantial significant reductions in infant all-cause
      mortality.

      The beneficial effect of neonatal vitamin A supplementation may be a result of correcting the
      congenital vitamin A deficiency resulting from maternal vitamin A deficiency. On the other
      hand, it has been speculated that the beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation given at
      birth may in part be explained by a synergistic effect of vitamin A supplementation and BCG
      vaccination given at the time of birth.

      The protective effect on mortality of vitamin A supplementation given at birth needs to be
      confirmed in an African population. Furthermore, none of the two previous studies have
      reported data on the vaccination status of the included infants.

      In the proposed studies, the effect on mortality and morbidity of giving vitamin A
      supplementation simultaneously with BCG vaccination at birth to both normal and low birth
      weight infants will be investigated in an African population. Furthermore, the effects of
      vitamin A supplementation will be evaluated with respect to effect on growth, the response to
      BCG vaccination, infant vitamin A status and infant cytokine profile, malaria, measles,
      rotavirus infection and RSV infection. The mechanisms behind the effects of vitamin A will be
      evaluated. The potential interactions between vitamin A, sex and vaccines will be taken into
      account in all analyses.

      This will be done in two studies of newborn children. Study A includes 6,000 normal birth
      weight infants (&gt; 2500 g) randomized to 50,000 or 25,000 IU vitamin A or placebo given
      simultaneously with BCG vaccine. Study B includes 1,600 low birth weight infants (&lt; 2500 g)
      randomized to vitamin A or placebo and early BCG or late BCG in a two-by-two factorial
      design. The studies take place in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa. The study area consists of five
      districts in the capital of Guinea-Bissau. The Bandim Health Project has been working in the
      study area for almost 25 years, and a demographic surveillance system has been established
      and has functioned for many years.
