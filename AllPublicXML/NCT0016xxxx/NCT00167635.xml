      The purpose of this study is 1) to determine whether a comprehensive self-management
      intervention is effective in a sample that includes men and women with irritable bowel
      syndrome, and 2) to determine whether the comprehensive self-management intervention is as
      effective when delivered over the telephone as compared to a face-to-face approach.

      Randomization and Intervention Phase. Upon completing the baseline assessment phase,
      participants will be randomized to one of 3 treatment groups. A customized computer program
      will be used to do the randomization in an adaptive manner that ensures the 3 groups remain
      fairly balanced with respect to possible important predictors of outcomes: age, sex,
      predominant stool pattern (alternating, constipation-predominant or diarrhea-predominant),
      and severity of IBS symptoms and psychological symptoms at baseline. When each new
      participant is randomized, the program will adjust the probabilities of assignment to the
      three groups so that there is a higher probability of assignment to the group that results in
      the best balance.

      Intervention Groups. Face-to-Face Individualized Comprehensive Self-Management (CSM-FF)
      Group. Participants in the individualized CSM-FF group will be scheduled for 9 weekly
      sessions with the nurse therapist followed by post-intervention follow-up assessment.

      Telephone Individualized Comprehensive Self-Management (CSM-TEL) Group. Participants in the
      individualized CSM-TEL group will initially have 2 face-to-face meetings with the nurse
      therapist, 6 sessions over the phone and the final session face-to-face at 9 weeks.

      Usual Care Control Group (UC). Following randomization the participants in the control group
      will no receive any contacts during the comparable 9-week intervention in the treatment
      groups.

      Follow-up Phase. Participants in all 3 groups will be reassessed at 3-mo, 6-mo, and 12-mo
      post randomization. At this time the participants will complete questionnaires, a 4 week
      diary and collect 4 urines.
