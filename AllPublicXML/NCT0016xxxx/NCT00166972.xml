  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our study established a model combine the in silico biology and empirical methods to identify
      clinically useful biomarker from information of microarray gene expression profiles in public
      domain. Through this method, we found trophinin as a novel prognostic marker for early stage
      lung cancer, which provide insight towards the process of cancer metastasis and the potential
      target for treatment.

      This study was to combine the in silico biology and empirical methods to identify clinically
      useful biomarker of lung cancer from microarray gene expression profiles in public database.

      Using the expression profile of a known metastasis suppressor, CRMP-1, as a template to
      search for and compare transcriptome expressions in publicly accessible microarray datasets,
      trophinin (TRO) was identified as the best correlated gene. The expression pattern of
      trophinin in a lung cancer cell lines of invasion model was investigated using quantitative
      RT-PCR. The role of trophinin in cancer metastasis was investigated by measuring the change
      of invasion activity in trophinin gene-transfected cell lines. The relationship of trophinin
      and the clinicopathological characteristics of lung cancer were further examined by
      immunohistochemical staining.
