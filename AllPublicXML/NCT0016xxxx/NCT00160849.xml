      1. Objectives Primary

             -  To investigate the possibility of maintaining virological suppression of HIV in
                infected patients, switching them to LPV/r as the only antiretroviral agent

             -  To assess the immunological response in patients who switched to LPV/r as single
                agent, based on the observation of changes in the serum levels of CD4+ cells.

           Secondary

             -  To investigate the rate of clinical and laboratorial adverse events in the two
                treatment groups.

             -  To investigate the rate of emergence of antiretroviral resistance mutations in the
                two treatment groups, in case of virological failure of the current regimen.

             -  To describe the adherence to the prescribed regimen in the two treatment groups

             -  To describe changes in body fat distribution (abdominal, arms and thigh
                circumference) and in the lipid profile, in patients from the two treatment groups

             -  To describe the rate of clinical failure of the antiretroviral therapy in the two
                treatment groups.

        2. Patient population:

           The 60 patients were selected by the investigators according to the study’s inclusion
           and exclusion criteria, and were divided into 2 groups with 30 patients each.

        3. Study design:

           The study is multicentric, open-label, randomized. Virological, immunological and
           clinical failures will be analyzed in both groups. In addition, data on clinical or
           laboratorial toxicity and compliance are being recorded.

        4. Regime:

             -  Group 1 maintenance of the currently used antiretroviral therapy

             -  Group 2 switch to LPV/r antiretroviral monotherapy in the dose of 400/100 mg 12/12
                hs with food. Patients in group 2 who were being treated previously with
                non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (Efavirenz or Nevirapine) were
                instructed to take 4 capsules of Lopinavir/r each 12 hs, during the first 14 days
                of therapy (up to Week 2 visit).

        5. Duration:

      96 weeks of treatment

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patients must fulfill all of the following criteria: The patient has confirmed
             his/her willingness to participate in the study, after being informed about all the
             aspects of the study that might be relevant for his/her decision to participate, and
             has signed and dated the informed consent form, as approved by the Institutional
             Review Board/ Ethics Committee (IRB/EC). And he/she can withdraw the study
             participation at any moment, if he/she wants to do so.

          2. The patient has laboratorial confirmation of an HIV infection through a positive ELISA
             test for anti-HIV antibodies and an additional test (Western-blot, indirect
             immunofluorescence or PCR).

          3. The patient must be in treatment with at least three antiretroviral drugs, for at
