  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab or Herceptin is an antibody directed against Her-2. Her-2 is a growth factor
      receptor which is present on the tumors of 25% of patients with breast cancer. The addition
      of trastuzumab to chemotherapy has been shown in a randomized clinical trial to increase the
      response rate to chemotherapy, the duration of response to chemotherapy, and to improve the
      duration of survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The anticancer mechanism of
      action of trastuzumab is unknown, but it is possible that trastuzumab acts by promoting
      antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), or direct killing of cancer cells by
      immune cells, triggered by antibodies bound to the surface of the cancer cell. G-CSF is a
      drug which is a growth factor for certain types of immune cells. G-CSF has two favorable
      effects on ADCC. G-CSF increases the pool of circulating cancer-killing immune cells, and
      G-CSF increases the strength of binding of cancer-killing immune cells to a specific part of
      the antibody. Therefore, priming with G-CSF significantly increases the efficiency of ADCC,
      and four days of treatment with G-CSF has been shown to optimize ADCC in some studies. Recent
      data from the investigators' laboratory indicates that chemotherapy can augment ADCC directed
      against tumor cells.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that pre-treatment with the drug G-CSF would increase the
      effectiveness of chemotherapy given with trastuzumab.

      This is a randomized phase II study comparing trastuzumab with G-CSF against trastuzumab with
      placebo during the first two weeks of therapy.

      Twenty five patients with metastatic breast cancer will be randomized to receive weekly
      trastuzumab plus either G-CSF or placebo by subcutaneous (SQ) injection daily for five days
      weekly for two weeks. Subsequently, all patients will receive an additional 12 weeks of
      weekly trastuzumab, G-CSF by SQ injection daily for five days weekly for 12 weeks, and
      vinorelbine once weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 weeks 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13. Baseline
      evaluation will include a history and physical exam, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP),
      complete blood count (CBC), serum pregnancy test, computerized tomography (CT) scan for
      disease measurements, and a Multiple Uptake Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan. The CT scan and
      MUGA will be repeated upon completion of the study treatment. Blood will be drawn
      pre-trastuzumab, 2 hours post-trastuzumab, and 48 hours post-trastuzumab on weeks 1, 2, 3, 4,
      and 12 to measure whole blood ADCC activity. Two additional assays for whole blood ADCC
      activity will be drawn at baseline pre-treatment, and following completion of protocol
      treatment. These assays will measure chromium release from a Her-2 positive target cell
      exposed to the patient's effector cells. Measurement of soluble Her-2 in patient serum will
      also be measured at each ADCC time point.

             (FISH) analyses will also be performed on these patients. Patients with 2+ to 3+
             overexpression of HER-2/neu (membranous staining) are eligible, regardless of the
             results of the FISH analysis.
