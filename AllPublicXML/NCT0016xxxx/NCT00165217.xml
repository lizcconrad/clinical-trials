  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about the antitumor activity and the
      safety of capecitabine and thalidomide in patients with colorectal cancer.

      -  Patients will take capecitabine orally twice a day for two weeks followed by a one week
           break period. These three week cycles will continue as long as the patient continues to
           benefit from the the therapy and does not experience intolerable side effects.

        -  Thalidomide will be taken orally once daily in the evening. Each week teh daily dose of
           the medication will be increased by 100mg as long as the patient is not experiencing any
           moderate to severe side effects. The dose will be increased in this manner until the
           daily dose is 600mg. If side effects do develop, the dose will either be held constant
           or decreased until the side effects resolve. If the side effects do not resolve,
           treatment will be stopped.

        -  Before starting treatment and periodically throughout the study, a physical exam,
           routine blood tests, scans and x-rays will be done to monitor the body's response to the
           treatment.

        -  For women patients, pregnancy tests will be performed every 3 weeks while on therapy.

        -  Scans and x-rays will be performed every 9 weeks (after every 3 cycles of treatment) to
           follow the effects of the study drugs on the tumor.
