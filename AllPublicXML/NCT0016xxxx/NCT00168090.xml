        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects of any age

          -  Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of vWD that can be expected to show no hemostatic
             response to DDAVP

          -  Require substitution with vWF/FVIII complex due to a surgery

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known significant hemostatic disorder other than vWD

          -  Acquired vWD

          -  Known antibodies to FVIII or vWF

          -  Known platelet type vWD

          -  Emergency surgery or any surgery with a degree of urgency not permitting completion of
             a pharmacokinetic assessment required by the study protocol

          -  History of allergic reaction to Humate-P®

          -  Treatment with any other investigational drug in the last four weeks before the entry
             into the study (with exception of trials concerning anti-HIV agents)

          -  Progressive fatal disease/life expectancy of less than 6 months

          -  Treatment with DDAVP, cryoprecipitate, whole blood, plasma and plasma derivatives
             containing substantial quantities of FVIII and/or vWF within 5 days of the
             pre-surgical pharmacokinetic assessment

          -  Pediatric patients of insufficient body weight to permit PK sampling

          -  Woman in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy
