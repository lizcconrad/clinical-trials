  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the technique of combined balloon sphincter dilation after an initial
      sphincterotomy and standard sphincterotomy in the endoscopic removal of large bile duct
      stones. The investigators hypothesize that combined balloon dilation and sphincterotomy
      allows for easier stone removal without added morbidities when compared to standard
      sphincterotomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sphincterotomy is a standard technique to enlarge the bile duct opening before
      stone removal during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. However, complete
      sphincter ablation by endoscopic sphincterotomy is not always possible. Also, due to the
      tapering end of the distal duct, standard sphincterotomy may not be adequate for removal of
      particularly large stones. In a retrospective series by Ersoz et al, the addition of balloon
      dilation after sphincterotomy achieves a high stone clearance rate (89-95%). The
      investigators postulate that the combination of endoscopic sphincterotomy followed by balloon
      dilation may allow easier stone retrieval with acceptable complication rate.

    <description>After deep cannulation, a pull-type sphincterotomy will be performed with a 25mm sphincterotome (eg clever cut, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with division of sphincter up to the duodenal wall. A complete sphincterotomy is defined by the free passage of a fully bowed sphincterotome with a 25m wire and spontaneous bile drainage.</description>

    <description>After complete sphincterotomy, a 3-cm long 15mm diameter CRE balloon is passed over a guidewire across the lower end of common bile duct. The contrast filled balloon is inflated to the size of the bile duct for around 30 seconds until waisting is abolished.</description>
