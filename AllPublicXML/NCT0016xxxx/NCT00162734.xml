  <official_title>A Phase 3, Randomized, Open-Label Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dose Levels of Interferon Alfacon-1 (Infergen, CIFN) Plus Ribavirin Administered Daily for 48 Weeks Versus No Treatment in Hepatitis C Infected Patients Who Are Nonresponders to Previous Pegylated Interferon Alfa Plus Ribavirin Therapy and During at Least 24 Weeks of No Treatment in IRHC-001</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      two dose levels of Infergen (interferon alfacon-1, CIFN) plus Ribavirin administered daily
      for 48 weeks and no treatment in patients chronically infected with hepatitis C who are
      nonresponders to previous pegylated interferon alfa plus ribavirin therapy and participated
      during at least 24 weeks of no treatment in IRHC-001.

      At the time of randomization into IRHC-001, the no treatment arm patients will be
      concurrently randomized in a 1:1 ration to receive Interferon Alfacon-1 (9 or 15 µg) +
      Ribavirin (both administered daily) or no treatment for up to 48 weeks. Patients will not be
      eligible for consideration to receive treatment in IRHC-002 until they have completed a
      minimum of 24 weeks of participation in IRHC-001.

      The protocol and informed consent form that will be used must be approved by the
      Investigator's Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before the
      study is initiated.
