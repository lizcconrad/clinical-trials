  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death in developed countries worldwide,
      including Taiwan. The disruption of atherosclerotic plaques and the subsequent formation of
      thrombi are currently recognized as the major cause of morbidity and mortality of
      cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, early detection of vulnerable plaques is clinically
      important for risk stratification and also to provide early treatment. Several imaging
      approaches have been adapted to detect vulnerable plaques, however, most of them are based on
      morphologic characteristics of atheroma. We hypothesize that PPARγ-induced plaque regression
      could be monitored clinically by use of 18FDG PET/CT approach, which could assess the
      inflammatory activity, and can be detected noninvasively earlier than previously reported.

    <textblock>
      The early detection of vulnerable plaques is clinically important for risk stratification and
      also to provide early treatment.Inflammation is important in the both pathogenesis and
      outcome of atherosclerosis. Plaques containing numerous inflammatory cells, particular
      macrophages, have a high risk of rupture. Diabetes is a major risk factor for the development
      of atherosclerosis. The discovery of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
      gene led to the hope of favorably influencing the insulin resistance syndrome. The
      administration of PPARγ agonists have been shown to reduce insulin resistance, to reduce the
      expression of leptin, to lower plasma free fatty acid level and to lower blood pressure.
      Moreover, beyond the glucose effect, PPARγ agonists may theoretically affect atherosclerosis
      also through the inhibition of inflammatory cytokines secreted from the macrophage, such as
      IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, etc. These evidences highlight the possibility of PPARγ agonists could be
      have great impact on plaque regression.

      18FDG is a glucose analogue that is taken up by cells in proportion to their metabolic
      activity. Several papers have reported the potential roles of metabolic imaging in the
      assessment of inflammatory vascular diseases, especially in large vessels. However, PET has
      limited spatial resolution. Recently, a combined PET/CT is emerged as a promising modality
      which could provide both anatomical and functional information. We hypothesize that PPARγ
      agonists-induced plaque regression could be monitored clinically by use of 18FDG PET/CT
      approach, and providing information of early efficacy PPARγ treatment caused by stabilization
      of vulnerable plaque without affecting the lumen size.
