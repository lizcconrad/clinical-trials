  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The survival of children who have received heart transplants has greatly improved over the
      last ten years. One reason for this is better control over rejection. Rejection medications
      require a delicate balance of enough medicine to work without causing side effects. It is a
      goal to avoid both rejection and side effects from the anti-rejection medicines. Usually
      several medicines are used together to prevent rejection. One of these medicines is often
      Mycophenolic Acid or CellceptThis medicine has been used longer for adults than is has for
      children. More information is needed on using it for children. The dose is usually determined
      by the patient's weight or body surface area.

      There have been some early studies of the use of Cellcept, but none have proven a
      relationship between the blood level of the drug and how well it works. More also needs to be
      known about how this drug works with other anti-rejection drugs and how it works in boys and
      girls. This study will look more closely at proper dosing, how Cellcept works with other
      anti-rejection medications, side effects, and any differences in how this medicine works in
      boys and girls.

      All patients in the study will be receiving Cellcept and have blood levels of the drug drawn.
      Results of their usual treatment and testing will be recorded and evaluated for signs of
      rejection. All the information will be analyzed. Results of this study will be reported to
      transplant committees locally and nationally.

      Pediatric heart transplant recipients receiving MMF will undergo study testing to measure MPA
      levels by the HPLC method and T-cell subsets by flow cytometry method. As standard of care
      they receive histological grading of routine endomyocardial biopsies using the International
      Society of Heart Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading scale. The data obtained from standard
      assessments will include medications, echocardiographic reports, pre-and post biopsy
      assessments/physical exams, hospital records for any inpatient hospitalization, and any
      laboratory assessments. Also, information will be collected on all patients which will be
      examined for tolerance and success (side effects and rejection) of immunosuppressive therapy.

      In newly transplanted patients, study testing will occur at the same time as standard of care
      biopsies which are typically 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4
      months, 5 months, 6 months, 8 months, 10 months, 12 months. If the patient has additional
      visits due to rejection or changes in immunosuppression, then more frequent study testing may
      be done per investigator preference. Previously transplanted patients will have study testing
      at the same time as their standard of care visits, usually annually.
