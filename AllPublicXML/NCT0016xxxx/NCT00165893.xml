  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at a new machine called the Accu-Spina which administers internal disc
      decompression by following a computer program. This non-surgical treatment (similar to
      traction) is being compared to a rigorous physical therapy program.

      This study is a randomized trial where out of every 3 people, 2 will receive IDD therapy and
      1 will have standardized physical therapy. Patients are given surveys to complete that ask
      about how their back pain is affecting their quality of life before starting treatment, 6
      weeks after starting treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months after starting treatment. If at the 6
      week point, the patient and doctor do not think the current treatment is working well enough,
      the patient is given the option to try the other treatment.
