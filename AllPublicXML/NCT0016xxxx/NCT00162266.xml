  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of Abatacept combined with
      Methotrexate in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The secondary objectives
      were to assess efficacy, pharmacodynamic marker activity, and immunogenicity of Abatacept
      combined with Methotrexate.

      All participants who completed the 12-month double-blind study period were eligible to
      continue in the open-label study. Participants received placebo, Abatacept 2 mg/kg, or
      Abatacept 10 mg/kg in the double-blind study. Participants receiving placebo in the
      double-blind study were switched 1:1 to continued treatment with placebo or Abatacept 2
      mg/kg. Participants receiving Abatacept 2 mg/kg or Abatacept 10 mg/kg continued at the
      double-blind study dosage. After results from the double-blind period became available, all
      participants were switched to a weight-tiered 10 mg/kg dose of Abatacept.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Double blind study phase:

          1. Males or females (not nursing and not pregnant), at least 18 years of age. Women of
             child bearing potential (WOCBP) are eligible if they are practicing effective
             contraceptive measures

          2. Subjects must meet the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association (1987) for the
             diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and the American College of Rheumatology (1991)
             functional classes I, II, or III

          3. Subjects have been taking Methotrexate (10-30 mg weekly) for at least 6 months, and at
             a stable dose for 28 days prior to treatment

          4. Washout/drug stabilization requirements (except Methotrexate) [Informed consent must
             be signed before making any changes in RA therapy if those changes are solely for the
             purpose of this study].

               -  Leflunomide or Infliximab have already been discontinued at least 60 days prior
                  to enrollment (prior to signing of informed consent) and a total of 90 days prior
                  to treatment. All other Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) (except
                  Methotrexate) have been withdrawn at least 28 days prior to treatment

               -  Oral corticosteroid treatment has been reduced to the equivalent of 10 mg or less
                  prednisone daily and stabilized for at least 28 days prior to enrollment

          5. Eligibility of subjects for the study is based on their disease activity and
             anti-rheumatic treatment at the initial visit:

               -  Methotrexate monotherapy: Subject is receiving only Methotrexate, steroids,
                  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and will not require washout

               -  Combination therapy: Subject is receiving Methotrexate in combination with
                  another DMARD(s) and will require washout

             At entry, Methotrexate monotherapy must have a disease activity:

               -  10 or more swollen joints (66 joint count)

               -  12 or more tender joints (68 joint count)

               -  C reactive protein (CRP) ≥.1 mg/dL (10 mg/L) at &quot;Screening&quot; visit

             At entry, combination therapy must have a disease activity (if subject does not
             satisfy the above):

               -  6 or more swollen joints (66 joint count)

               -  8 or more tender joints (68 joint count)

               -  No restriction on C-reactive protein (CRP)

             In addition

             All subjects who were on combination therapy at entry must undergo a 28 day washout
             period of DMARDs other than Methotrexate. After the washout/drug stabilization and
             prior to randomization such subjects must have:

          <description>ACR 20 response requires a participant to have a 20% reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, and a reduction of 20% in three of the following five parameters: physician global assessment of disease, participant global assessment of disease, participant assessment of pain, C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and degree of disability in HAQ score. A participant achieved a sustained ACR 20 response if the participant had ACR 20 observed for at least 2 consecutive study visits.</description>

        <description>ACR 70 response requires a participant to have a 70% reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, and a reduction of 70% in three of the following five parameters: physician global assessment of disease, participant global assessment of disease, participant assessment of pain, C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and degree of disability in HAQ score. A participant achieved a sustained ACR 70 response if the participant had ACR 70 observed for at least 2 consecutive study visits.</description>

        <description>The AUC for ACR-N is the measure of the area under the curve of the mean change from baseline in ACR-N. The trapezoidal rule was used to compute the AUC. The ACR-N AUC was compared between the two abatacept treatment groups and the placebo group using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for 6- and 12-month data (Day 180 and Day 360). This allowed for the assessment of subject response throughout the study. See Measure Description in Outcome Measure 18 for a definition of ACR-N.</description>

        <title>Number of ACR 20 Responders in OL Period</title>
        <description>ACR 20 response requires a participant to have a 20% reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, and a reduction of 20% in three of the following five parameters: physician global assessment of disease, participant global assessment of disease, participant assessment of pain, C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and degree of disability in Health Assessment Questionnaire score. A participant achieved a sustained ACR 20 response if the participant had ACR 20 observed for at least 2 consecutive study visits.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Clinically Meaningful Improvement on the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (mHAQ) in OL Period</title>
        <description>The mHAQ is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 20 questions that assess physical functions in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The answers are graded on a 4-point scale: 0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, and 3=unable to do. The HAQ disease index is a weighted sum of the scale scores, with a higher score indicating poorer function. A clinically meaningful improvement was defined as a reduction from baseline in mHAQ score of at least 0.30 units.</description>

          <description>SF-36 = PCS &amp; MCS &amp; 8 individual indices (physical function, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, &amp; mental health). Subscales were scored using norm-based methods that standardized scores to a mean of 50 &amp; a standard deviation of 10 in the general population. Scores range from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating better quality of life. Time-matched BL &amp; post-BL values are presented for each post-BL visit &amp; represent only that cohort with measurements available at that assessment. Change from BL data are presented in Outcome Measure 58.</description>
