  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to determine whether the VOICES/VOCES intervention, that was
      shown to be effective in a research study, is still effective when delivered by STD/HIV
      prevention agencies.

      VOICES/VOCES is a brief, single-session intervention for African-American and Latino adult
      men and women at high risk for STD/HIV. It encourages condom use and improves condom
      negotiation skills. A health educator delivers the intervention to groups of 4 to 8 clinic
      patients in a private room. Groups are made up of people of the same sex and same race or
      ethnicity. Information on STD/HIV risk behaviors and condom use is delivered by
      culturally-specific videos, group discussion, and a poster presenting features of various
      condom brands. Participants role-play condom negotiation modeled in the videos. At the end of
      the session they are given sample condoms of their choice.

      In this project, health educators from the health departments of New York City and San Juan,
      Puerto Rico conducted the VOICES/VOCES intervention with a sample of patients from one STD
      clinic in each of their cities. Researchers helped the health departments test whether the
      intervention is effective when local health educators deliver it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project was an RCT with 1699 patients assigned to receive the VOICES/VOCES intervention
      and 1707 to receive standard of care at each of the two STD clinics (total N=3406).
      Participant outcomes and their measures are:

        1. Change in knowledge and attitudes about condoms as determined by participant profile and
           survey data

        2. Condom acquisition as determined by project coupon redemption data

        3. STD incidence as determined by medical chart review and/or surveillance data

      In addition, cost accounting data on the amounts and types of resources required to implement
      the intervention were used to evaluate the intervention's cost-effectiveness. Process
      evaluation data allow identification of factors that influenced intervention implementation
      and the effectiveness of the intervention.
