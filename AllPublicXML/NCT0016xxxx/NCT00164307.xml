      Targeted Area of Intervention: Social skills and development of best friend relationships.
      The specific intervention will be twelve small group sessions (90 minutes each) over a 6-week
      period. Child sessions consist of 4 components: 1) children report on homework assignments;
      2) didactic presentation, behavioral rehearsal, and coaching, 3) coached play, and 4) new
      homework activities assigned with parent. Topics to be addressed across sessions include:
      reduction of maladaptive behaviors, information exchange techniques, places and times to make
      friends, group acceptance, praising other children, negotiation, play dates, dealing with
      teasing, and winner/loser skills. At the start of the intervention, parent and children will
      work with staff to develop a list of social skills, behaviors, and goals that they would like
      targeted for each child.

      Parent component: Kathleen Mitchell (NOFAS) is an investigator to provide parent input to the
      study. Parent-only sessions will instruct them on key features being taught to their child.
      Concurrent parent sessions will include: 1) education on FAS/ARND, 2) parents present
      specific issues with their child, 3) review of current child session objectives and
      techniques, 4) new homework activities developed, 5) parent and child together review
      homework.

      Evaluation Plan: Treatment and control (WL) groups will be compared using pre- and post-tests
      measures. Post-tests will be at the conclusion of the intervention and at a 4-month
      follow-up. Baseline parent measures include Social Skills Rating Scale, FAS Behavior Scale,
      and Test of Advocacy Knowledge. Baseline child measures include knowledge of social skills.
      Process (e.g., homework completion, attendance, etc) and outcome (e.g., social skills
      ratings, progress towards individual goals) measures will be evaluated.
