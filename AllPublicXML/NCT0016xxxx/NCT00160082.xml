      The primary objective was to assess the effect of Xepol compared to placebo on physical
      health and on muscle strength in subjects with post-polio syndrome.The secondary objective
      was to assess the effect of Xepol compared to placebo on functional balance, activity
      patterns, pain, fatigue, sleep, vitality, muscular strength, pulmonary capacity, walking
      ability, balance and safety.

      Study Rationale:

      In an earlier open and non-controlled study in 10 patients with PPS, Xepol was given during
      three days. The patients showed improvements in muscular strength and co-ordination and a
      decrease in pain. The aim of this study was to investigate if these findings can be confirmed
      in a larger, double-blind, randomised and placebo controlled study.

      There are no simple clinical findings and specific laboratory changes that can be used to
      indicate the severity and progress of PPS. Different self-reporting questionnaires and
      objective measures of disability have often been used in clinical studies including SF-36
      questionnaire, muscle strength measurement and walking test. The primary and secondary
      variables in this study were based on the clinical experience and literature reviewed.

               -  History of polio virus infection

               -  Restitution or improvement regarding motor function and disabilities after
                  initial infection

               -  Confirmed polio by EMG

               -  Subjectively increased muscular weakness after a period of at least 15 years
                  functional stability

               -  No other explanation but post-polio syndrome to the symptoms

          3. Confirmed polio by EMG in the lower extremities in at least two of the following major
             muscle groups; musculi quadriceps, gastrocnemicus and tibialis anterior. (Two affected
             muscle groups in the same extremity were accepted).
