      This is an open-label comparative study in three parallel groups. It is expected that 90
      patients and/or healthy volunteers will participate in this biomedical research.

      Distribution in groups

        -  30 patients with type 2 diabetes and an indication for treatment with a GLP1 analogue
           (group 1)

        -  30 patients with type 2 diabetes (control diabetic subjects) not treated with Incretins
           (group 2)

        -  30 healthy subjects (non-diabetics) (group 3)

      This study will investigate modifications in eating behaviour induced by Liraglutide in
      patients who start treatment with Victoza® and certain aspects, such as liking (hedonic
      characteristic of a food), wanting (desire to eat a given food) and salivation in response to
      the presentation of a food by taking measurements at D0 (before initiation of the treatment
      with Liraglutide in the group concerned) then at 15 days (except for the controls), 3 months
      and 9 months (only for controls).
