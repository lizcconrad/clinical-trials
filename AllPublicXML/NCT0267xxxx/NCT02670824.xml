      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single
      escalating dose and repeated doses of CN-105 in healthy adult participants. There will be
      about 48 subjects, 36 active and 12 placebo.

    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which is often associated with longstanding hypertension,
      affects as many as 50,000 people annually in the United States alone. ICH remains associated
      with poor outcome, and approximately 40 to 50% of afflicted patients will die within 30 days.
      Unfortunately, little improvement has been made in the ICH-associated mortality rate over the
      last 20 years. To address this issue, the National Institutes of Health issued a priorities
      report in 2005, and the American Heart Association released a recent set of clinical
      guidelines for the first time in nearly a decade. In these reports, the importance of
      developing clinically relevant models of ICH that will extend our understanding of the
      pathophysiology of the disease and target new therapeutic approaches was emphasized. At
      present, however, there are no proven neuroprotective pharmacological treatments for ICH or
      other forms of acute brain injuries, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarachnoid
      hemorrhage (SAH).

      To meet this unmet medical need, CereNova, LLC has developed a novel therapeutic approach
      based on the known biological function of endogenous apolipoprotein E (apoE), a key mediator
      of the neuroinflammatory response and recovery from a variety of acute and chronic brain
      injuries1-5. There are three common human isoforms of apolipoprotein E, designated apoE2,
      apoE3, and apoE4, which differ by single cysteine to arginine substitutions at positions 112
      and 158. Although originally defined in the context of cholesterol metabolism, apoE is also
      produced in the brain, where it modulates neuroinflammatory responses and functional outcomes
      after injury in an isoform specific fashion1. Specifically, the apoE3 protein isoform plays
      an adaptive role in downregulating glial activation and reducing secondary neuronal injury,
      whereas the E4 isoform is associated with increased neuroinflammation and poor functional
      outcomes.

      Although the intact apoE holoprotein does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and thus
      cannot be administered therapeutically, we have previously demonstrated that smaller apoE
      mimetic peptides do effectively cross the BBB while effectively downregulating the brain
      inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo6. CN-105, CereNova's lead clinical candidate, is
      a small, 5 amino acid apoE-mimetic peptide that is derived from the receptor binding region
      of apoE. CN-105 retains the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of intact apoE, is
      well tolerated in preclinical studies, and readily crosses the BBB to effectively reduce
      inflammatory responses in the brain.

          6. Adequate peripheral forearm vein access.

          7. No significant dietary restrictions and willing to fully consume all Duke CRU &quot;Regular
             Diet&quot; meals and beverages/water provided to them.

          8. No prescription medication except contraception as described in Inclusion #10 within 7
             days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of study entry (randomization and
             initiation of study drug administration) or any over-the-counter (OTC) medication or
             herbal/vitamin supplement within 7 days of study entry, and not expected to require or
             take any prescription or over-the-counter medication or supplement for the full
             duration of the study. Acetaminophen at doses of ≤1 g/day may be used and stable
             treatment for seasonal allergies (other than glucocorticoids via any route) may be
             used. Limited use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect
             subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case by case
             basis following approval by the sponsor.

          9. Women who are of non-childbearing potential, must be:

             Surgically sterile (removal of both ovaries and/ or uterus at least 12 months prior to
             dosing).

             Naturally postmenopausal (spontaneous cessation of menses) for at least 24 consecutive
             months prior to dosing on Day -1 and with an FSH level at screening of ≥ 40 mIU/mL.

         10. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and urine pregnancy test during the study, and must agree to avoid pregnancy
             during study and for three months after the last dose of study drug. Pregnancy is
             tested at screening, during check-in, during the follow-up visit, and at any given
             point if deemed necessary to the PI or designate. During treatment, women of
             child-bearing potential must use two acceptable methods of contraception at the same
             time unless the subject has had a documented tubal sterilization or chooses to use a
             Copper T 380A IUD or LNG 20 IUS, in which case no additional contraception is
             required. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) documented surgical
             sterilization (such as a hysterectomy), (2) barrier methods (such as a condom or
             diaphragm) used with a spermicide, (3) hormonal contraception (combination oral
             contraceptives, transdermal patch, injectables, implantables, or vaginal ring) or (4)
             an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Abstinence is not an
             acceptable form of contraception in this study.

         11. Male participants must agree to take all necessary measures to avoid causing pregnancy
             in their sexual partners during the study and for three months after the last dose of
             study drug. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization
             (such as a vasectomy), or (2) a condom used with a spermicidal. Contraceptive measures
             such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable
             methods for routine use.

         12. Must not have donated blood, platelets, or any other blood components 30 days, or
             plasma 90 days, prior to consenting. Must also agree not to donate blood, platelets,
             or any other blood components for 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

         13. Male participants must agree not to donate sperm during the study and for 12 weeks
             after the last dose.

         14. Subjects who are willing and able to comply with all scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             by the PI or delegate. Any laboratory result outside the normal range and not
             clinically significant will be designated as such by NCS (Non-clinically Significant).

          2. Mental capacity that is limited to the extent that the participant cannot provide
             legal consent or understand information regarding the side effects of the study drug.

          3. Currently abusing drugs or alcohol or with a history of drug or alcohol abuse within
             the past two years or drinks more than 3 cups of coffee per day.

          4. Unwillingness or lack of ability to comply with the protocol, or to cooperate fully
             with the PI and site personnel.

          5. Clinically significant ECG abnormality in the opinion of the PI or delegate.

          6. Has taken any other investigational drug during the 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever
             is longer) prior to the screening visit or is currently participating in another
             investigational drug clinical trial.
