  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After hospitalization, many older adults experience more difficulty getting around in the
      community and performing one or more of their basic activities of daily living (ADLs) like
      bathing or dressing. The goals of this study are to test the effectiveness of a mobility
      intervention, compared to usual care, on change in mobility after hospitalization, to
      determine the impact on one-year outcomes such as nursing home placement and to identify
      which Veterans benefit the most from the intervention. Ultimately, the goal is to improve
      recovery after hospitalization and reduce disability in hospitalized Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this high impact study the investigators propose to use a stepped wedge cluster
      randomization design on five VA hospital wards to compare a mobility program (MP) to usual
      care (UC) among a cohort of Veterans age 50 years. The investigators will examine pre to
      post-hospital mobility and adverse outcomes including functional decline, nursing home
      admission, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization and death in the MP and UC
      groups in the year after hospital discharge. The primary outcome of mobility will be measured
      by the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Life-Space Assessment (LSA).10-13 Secondary
      measures of mobility will include self-reported ability to walk mile and drive a car, as
      described by Gill, et al.14 The investigators will identify patient specific characteristics
      that modify the effect of the mobility intervention on post-hospital mobility and adverse
      outcomes to determine which hospitalized patients are most likely to benefit from this
      intervention.

    <measure>Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>, cognitive function, level of in-hospital mobility, age, comorbidities, length of stay, depressive symptoms, and social support Patients will be asked to complete the Katz ADL at all interviews during the study. Specifically, patients will be asked to rate their current level of independence with six activities of daily living (feeding, bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and walking across a small room).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Level of independence with Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs) will be assessed at the same time points as the basic ADLs using the Lawton Index. The IADL index evaluates 8 domains of function including shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, handling finances, ability to take own medications and use of the telephone. A summary score ranges from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating higher levels of independence with the tasks.</description>

    <measure>Mini Cognitive Assessment (Mini-Cog)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Cog is a brief cognitive screening measure that includes a three-item memory recall and a clock drawing test. The test is scored using a simple algorithm whereby patients who are unable to recall any of the three items are considered demented; those who can recall all three items are deemed not demented; and those with intermediate word recall ability (1 or 2 items) are classified based on the clock drawing test. For persons with intermediate recall ability, if the clock drawing is abnormal, the patient is considered demented and if the clock drawing is normal the patient is not considered demented.</description>

    <measure>Confusion Assessment Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline only</time_frame>
    <description>The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) allows rapid assessment of the presence of delirium. Four clinical features, including 1) Acute onset and fluctuating course; 2) Inattention; 3) Disorganized thinking; and 4) Altered level of consciousness, are assessed. The presence of features 1 and 2 and either 3 or 4 indicates the patient has delirium. The positive and negative predictive values for the CAM are approximately 90%.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionaire (PHQ) -2</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked at each interview the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) - 2, specifically 1) Have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?; and 2) Have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things? The PHQ-2 has been found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 92% respectively and is an excellent brief screening tool for depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQOL five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D)</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be asked to complete the EQ-5D once during the hospital stay, then at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The EQ-5D-3L is a well-validated measure of quality of life which enables the calculation of a single index value ranging from 0, worst imaginable health to 1, perfect health.</description>

    <description>MP patients will participate in a program of progressive walking and transfer training up to three times a day, seven days a week throughout the hospital stay. MP patients will begin with assisted sitting, then standing, progressing to weight shifting and stepping in place, and then to walking as tolerated. The level of mobility recommended to the MP patient by the Walker will be dependent on the individual patient and will incorporate the activities patients were deemed able to do independent of cueing or assistance during each walking session.</description>
