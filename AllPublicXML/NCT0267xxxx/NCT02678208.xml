      Postpartum hemorrhage is the most common cause of maternal death across the world,
      responsible for more than 25% of maternal deaths annually. Although effective tools for
      prevention and treatment of are available, most are not feasible or practical for use in the
      developing world where many births still occur at home with untrained birth attendants .
      primary postpartum hemorrhage is excessive bleeding from or in the genital tract within 24
      hours of delivery of the fetus which affects the general condition.

      Postpartum hemorrhage is responsible for around 25% of maternal mortality worldwide ,
      reaching as high as 60% in some countries. Postpartum hemorrhage can also be a cause of
      long-term severe morbidity, and approximately 12% of women who survive postpartum
      hemorrhagewill have severe anemia.

      Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic compound which is a potent competitive inhibitor of
      the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. At much higher concentrations it is a
      non-competitive inhibitor of plasmin. The inhibitory effect of tranexamic acid in plasminogen
      activation by urokinase has been reported to be 6-100 times and by streptokinase 6-40 times
      greater than that of aminocaproic acid.
