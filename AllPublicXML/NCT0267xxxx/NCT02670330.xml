      The aim is to assess the long-term safety of topical use of ZORBLISA in patients with
      Epidemolysis Bullosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that typically manifest at
      birth as blistering and lesion formation on the skin and, in some cases, the epithelial
      lining of other organs, in response to little or no apparent trauma. In consequence, the skin
      is extremely fragile which can result in shearing of the skin, causing a high risk of
      infection. All forms of EB are both debilitating and life threatening. In some EB subtypes,
      high mortality occurs before the age of 1 (Junctional Herlitz), and others in adolescences to
      early adulthood, typically due to infection or failure to thrive. In addition, children
      surviving into their 20's and 30's are also at risk for development of a virulent form of
      squamous cell carcinoma, which is in many cases fatal.

      There are no standard of care products available to treat the dermal manifestations of EB,
      and there is no approved drug for EB in either Europe or the United States. There have been
      numerous studies published on potential treatments for skin manifestations associated with
      EB, including vitamin E therapy, systemic phenytoin, topical nonsteroidal agents,
      cyproheptadine, tetracycline, and dapsone. No controlled studies showed clinical benefit of
      any therapy. Newer exploratory treatments including skin grafts, bioengineered skin products,
      and gene therapy have been unsuccessful to date.

      This is an open label, multi-center extension study to assess the long-term safety of
      topically applied ZORBLISA in patients with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional
      non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa. ZORBLISA will be applied topically, once a day, to the
      entire body for a period of 1440 days.

      Patients who successfully completed study SD-005 (on study drug at Visit 5) will have the
      option to roll over into the SD-006 study. The baseline visit (Visit 1) will occur at Visit 5
      for SD-005. The Body Surface Area (BSA) assessments of lesional skin and wound burden
      performed at the Visit 5 for SD-005 will be utilized as the baseline assessment for SD-006.
      Patients will return for follow-up visits at months 1, 3, 6, 9 ,12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,
      33, 36, 39, 42, and 48 after Visit 1.

      At each visit, assessments will include BSA of lesional skin and wound burden. For target
      wounds that are not closed by the end of Study SD-005, the ARANZ picture and calculation of
      target wound area at the final visit for Study SD-005 will used as the baseline area size of
      the target wound for SD-006. These unhealed target wounds from SD-005 will be assessed via
      ARANZ at each subsequent scheduled visit until the target wound is documented as closed.
      Closed wounds will be assessed for scarring.

    <description>The primary objective is to demonstrate the longterm safety of ZORBLISA in patients, with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa. Results will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics to be used include proportion of patients with complete closure of their target lesion at each visit, mean and standard deviation of BSAI compared with baseline at each visit, and incidence rates of specific adverse events. Additional evaluations may be made to compare responses of patients in this extension study with their responses in SD-005. For those patients randomized to SD-101-6.0 in SD-005, the use of summary statistics as described in the previous paragraph will provide an understanding of the long term effect of SD-101-6.0 in these patients. For those patients randomized to the control arm in SD-005, summary statistics will be used to compare their response to SD-101-6.0 in SD-006 with their response to control in SD-005.</description>

    <description>The secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of ZORBLISA in terms of the change in Body Surface Area (BSA) of lesional skin and wound burden; as well as closure of unhealed target wounds from the SD-005 study. Change in lesional skin based on BSA estimates compared to Baseline will be measured using the Body Surface Area Index (BSAI). Change in total body wound coverage based on BSA estimates compared to Baseline will be measured using the BSAI.</description>
