    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, Pharmacokinetics (PK),
      and antitumor activity of PDR001 administered intravenous (i.v.) as a single agent to

    <description>PDR001 will be administered i.v. every two weeks until a patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease as per irRC and/or treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or the patient. The treatment period will begin on Cycle 1 Day 1. For the purpose of scheduling and evaluations, a treatment cycle will consist of 28 days. During the study, cohorts of patients will be treated with PDR001 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached or a lower recommended dose (RD) is established.</description>
