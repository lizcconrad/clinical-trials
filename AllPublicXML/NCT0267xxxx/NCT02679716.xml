  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal artery occlusions (RAO) cause deterioration in visual acuity and visual fields. In
      computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies (Leisser et al.) 10% of ascending emboli caused
      RAO, the residual 90% embolized into the cerebral arteries. As only 20% of patients with RAO
      had a history of stroke, there is a discrepancy between CFD-studies and clinical
      observations. Mead et al. postulated small emboli being washed into the cerebral arteries
      without causing clinical symptoms of stroke, whereas similar emboli being washed into the
      ophthalmic artery would cause RAO.

      There is a discrepancy between CFD-study results and clinical observations in RAO patients,
      indicating that there could be a high number of RAO-patients having had cerebral ischemies
      without symptoms of stroke (as postulated by Mead et al.).

      Purpose of the present study is to evaluate hemodynamic pathological changes at the
      ophthalmic artery origin in patients with RAO detected with an already existing CFD-model

    <textblock>
      Retinal artery occlusions (RAO) cause deterioration in visual acuity and visual fields.
      Emboli from plaques of the carotid artery, aortic arch or vegetations of the cardiac valves
      are the main reasons for RAO. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies (Leisser et al.)
      10% of ascending emboli caused RAO, the residual 90% embolized into the cerebral arteries. As
      only 20% of patients with RAO had a history of stroke, there is a discrepancy between
      CFD-studies and clinical observations. Mead et al. postulated small emboli being washed into
      the cerebral arteries without causing clinical symptoms of stroke, whereas similar emboli
      being washed into the ophthalmic artery would cause RAO. Hayreh et al. reported plaques of
      the carotid artery to be the main reason for emboli causing RAO.

      There is a discrepancy between CFD-study results and clinical observations in RAO patients,
      indicating that there could be a high number of RAO-patients having had cerebral ischemies
      without symptoms of stroke (as postulated by Mead et al.). A recently published report showed
      ischemic cerebral lesions in 38% of patients with RAO without neurological symptoms (Lee et
      al.). The fact, that the 3-year risk of patients with RAO to develop stroke is doubled (Chang
      et al.), underlines further associations between RAO and stroke.

      Purpose of the present study is to evaluate hemodynamic pathological changes at the
      ophthalmic artery origin in patients with RAO detected with an already existing CFD-model
