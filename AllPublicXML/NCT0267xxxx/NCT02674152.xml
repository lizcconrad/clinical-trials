  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, non-randomized, uncontrolled, open-label, dose escalating study of BI
      836880 administered intravenously. The eligible patient population will be patients with
      advanced solid tumours. At any time during the trial, it will not be permitted to escalate to
      a dose which does not fulfil the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) criterion

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy which is locally advanced or
             metastatic solid tumor, and either refractory after standard therapy for the disease
             or for which standard therapy is not reliably effective, e.g. they do not tolerate or
             have contraindications to otherwise available standard therapy and tumour lesions
             evaluable for Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI at MTD.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;= 2

          -  Adequate hepatic, renal and bone marrow functions

          -  Signed written informed consent.

          -  Life expectancy min. 3 months in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Recovery from all reversible adverse events of previous anti-cancer therapies to
             baseline or CTCAE grade 1, except for alopecia (any grade) sensory peripheral
             neuropathy CTCAE grade &lt;= 2 or considered not clinically significant.

          -  adequate contraception by male and female patient during the trial and for at least 6
             months after end of treatment.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the trial drugs or their excipients

          -  Current or prior treatment with any systemic anti-cancer therapy either within 28 days
             or a minimum of 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter of trial onset.

          -  Serious concomitant disease, especially those affecting compliance with trial
             requirements or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the endpoints of
             the trial drug

          -  Major injuries and/or surgery or bone fracture within 4 weeks of start of treatment,
             or planned surgical procedures during the trial period.

          -  patients with personal or family history of QT prolongation and/or long QT syndrome,
             or prolonged QTcF at baseline (&gt; 470 ms). QTcF will be calculated by Investigator as
             the mean of the 3 ECGs taken at screening.

          -  Significant cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases (i.e. uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, history of infarction within past 6 months, congestive heart failure
             &gt; NYHA II). Uncontrolled hypertension defined as: blood pressure in rested and relaxed
             condition &gt;=140 mmHg systolic, or &gt;=90 mmHg diastolic (with or without medication),
             measured according to protocol.

          -  History of severe haemorrhagic or thromboembolic event in the past 12 months
             (excluding central venous catheter thrombosis and peripheral deep vein thrombosis).

          -  Known inherited predisposition to bleeding or to thrombosis in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          -  Patient with brain metastases that are symptomatic and/or require therapy.
