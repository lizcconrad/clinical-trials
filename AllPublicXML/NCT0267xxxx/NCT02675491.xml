  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      DS-6051b in Japanese subjects with advanced solid malignant tumors harboring either a ROS1 or
      NTRK fusion gene.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is single arm study with DS-6051b in approximately 9 subjects with advanced solid
      malignant tumors harboring either a ROS1 or NTRK fusion gene. Safety and tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), MTD/RP2D (maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose) and
      preliminary efficacy of DS-6051b will be evaluated.
