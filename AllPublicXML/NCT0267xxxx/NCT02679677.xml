  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The typical clinical progression of COPD usually results in a decreased level of tolerable
      physical exertion for the patient. The avoidance of strenuous physical activity leads to a
      deteriorating level of physical fitness, which further decreases the patient's ability to
      undertake physical activities. Recent research has shown that whole body vibration has the
      potential to improve physical fitness of participants, including such measures as the 6
      minute walking distance. However, information concerning lung function is lacking.

      The goal of the study is to test whether the use of whole body vibration training has an
      effect on the lung function of patients with stable COPD, or if the previously observed
      effects can be attributed to either pharmaceutical therapy or physical therapy interventions.

    <description>The principle of the Galileo vibration platform is a side alternating motion similar to a childrens seesaw. Both the amplitude of movement and the frequency of movement may be altered. Frequency may be controlled on the device and settings range from 5Hz to 30Hz. Amplitude of movement is set by spreading one's legs further apart from the midline. Control arm participants remain fixed at 5Hz through the 6 week training period, while intervention arm participants steadily increase their frequency to a maximum of 28Hz.</description>
