      The study will involve up to 30 pairs of male and female sexually intimate partners who are
      carriers for a genetic disease (e.g Sickle Cell Disease or Thalassemia) and at high risk of
      transmitting the gene. The female partner will be superovulated to mature multiple oocytes
      which can be fertilized, inseminated with her partner's sperm through intra-uterine
      insemination (IUI). Four to six days after IUI, the female partner will undergo a
      non-surgical uterine lavage procedure to recover preimplantation embryos.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single center, single-arm study to evaluate healthy cells which
      do not carry illnesses, by collecting and performing the histological and genetic analyses of
      blastocysts, endometrial tissue and cells, which have been formed in the uterus, without any
      burden of the morbidity and mortality caused by the oocyte collection process, and which
      thereby have not been subjected to any iatrogenic intervention, with uterine lavage.

      The study will involve up to 30 pairs of male and female sexually intimate partners who are
      carriers for a genetic disease (e.g Sickle Cell Disease or Thalassemia) and at high risk of
      transmitting the gene.

      The female partner will be superovulated to mature multiple oocytes which can be fertilized,
      inseminated with her partner's sperm through intra-uterine insemination (IUI). Four to six
      days after IUI, the female partner will undergo a non-surgical uterine lavage procedure to
      recover preimplantation embryos.

      Following lavage, a GnRH antagonist will be administered to cause lysis of multiple corpora
      lutea to mitigate risk of hyperstimulation from the use of fertility medication and reduce
      the risk of ectopic pregnancy should the lavage procedure not recover all preimplantation
      embryos.

      Recovered preimplantation embryos may be screened for aneuploidy and genetic disease, then
      cryopreserved for potential future use by the subjects and the Investigator separate from the
      purpose of this study.

      Each subject participates in the trial for up to 10-20 weeks.
