          2. With diabetic mellitus (DM; currently under DM medication treatment or na√Øve DM
             subject with duplicated HbA1c over 6.5% and fasting plasma glucose over 126 mg/dL
             measured at least one week apart before Screening)

          3. With at least one cutaneous ulcer on the foot (including ulcers on the lower legs) and
             not healing for at least 4 weeks. The largest diabetic foot ulcer will be selected as
             target ulcer. If two or more ulcers have the largest size, the one with worst grade
             will be selected. If two or more ulcers have the largest size and grade, the one with
             longest duration will be selected.

          4. The target ulcer is classified as grade 1 to 3 ulcer according to Wagner Grading
             System and with ulcer size of 1 cm2 to 50 cm2 (Grade 3 ulcer subject may enter the
             study only if after debridement, the abscess of target ulcer is under control at
             investigator's discretion and osteomyelitis does not present)

          5. Subject should be free of any necrosis or infection in soft and bone tissue;

          6. Subject has signed the written informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. With active osteomyelitis

          2. With target ulcer size decreased by at least 30% after at least 2 weeks of
             standard-of-care-only period or any other recorded regular therapy before
             Randomization visit

          3. With poor nutritional status (albumin &lt; 2g/dl), poor diabetic control (HbA1c &gt; 12%), a
             leukocyte counts &lt; 2,000/mm3, abnormal liver function (AST, ALT&gt;3 x upper limit of
             normal range)

          4. Requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or
             chemotherapeutic agents

          5. With known or suspected hypersensitivity to any ingredients of study product and
             vehicle

          6. With coronary heart disease with myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft
             (CABG), or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) within 3 months prior
             to study

          7. Pregnant or lactating or premenopausal with childbearing potential but not taking
             reliable contraceptive method(s) during the study period

          8. Enrollment in any investigational drug trial within 4 weeks before entering this study

          9. With any condition judged by the investigator that entering the trial may be
             detrimental to the subject
