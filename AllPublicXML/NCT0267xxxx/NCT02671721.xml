  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to identify the optimal way to ventilate patients during
      abdominal surgery in order to reduce the amount of post-operative pulmonary complications in
      patients at moderate and high-risk for them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to prospectively compare two methods to individualize Positive End
      Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) settings in the operating room during abdominal surgery: (1)
      Maximization of respiratory compliance during a decremental PEEP titration, and (2)
      Prevention of negative end-expiratory transpulmonary pressures.

      The investigators will exploit the usual intraoperative requirement for a naso/orogastric
      tube to assess transpulmonary pressures,and respiratory mechanics measurements from
      anesthesia machines to titrate PEEP.

      The investigators will measure biomarkers of lung injury and lung function to compare those
      methods between themselves and to the control group. In the process, the investigators will
      assess the ease and reliability of anesthesia teams in implementing the methods. These data
      will allow us to determine the PEEP strategy best suited for the full-scale trial, and to
      estimate the degree of separation the experimental lung protective approach will have from
      the protocolized usual care control settings.
