  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial with the aim to examine the feasibility and the
      effects of a home-based exercise intervention program on activities of daily living (ADL) in
      patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment. Further
      outcomes include functional and body status, quality of life, body composition, and
      chemotherapy completion rate. Study participants will be randomized to an exercise
      intervention group or a wait-list control group

      A randomised longitudinal study. A total of 44 gastrointestinal cancer patients before their
      first-line chemotherapy are recruited and randomised into one of two treatment groups A: Home
      based- physical activity or B: wait-control. The intervention period is 12 weeks. Primary
      outcome are the ADLs (iADL 1-8; FIM 1-7).Secondary outcomes are the physical activity,
      quality of life, peripheral polyneuropathy, chemotherapy regimen, gait speed, postural
      stability, maximal isometric voluntary force of the upper extremity, Maximal isometric
      voluntary force (MIVF) and strength endurance of the lower extremity, nutritional state, body
      composition and perceive functional ability. All measurements are standardized and are
      performed before chemotherapy, after 2 cycles of chemotherapy (4-6weeks) and after 12 weeks.
