  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) is a protein involved in attracting immune cells
      including subsets of T cells (for example Th17 cells), B cells, natural killer cells and
      dendritic cells to inflamed tissues in conditions such as psoriasis (Ps) and psoriatic
      arthritis (PsA). CCL20 acts by binding and activating the chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) present
      on the surface of the inflammatory cells. Levels of CCL20 are increased in inflamed tissues
      in psoriasis (Ps) and inflammatory arthritis. GSK3050002 is a humanized Immunoglobulin G
      (Ig)G monoclonal antibody, which binds to and neutralizes the action of human CCL20. The
      hypothesis is that GSK3050002 will reduce the movement of inflammatory cells into tissues
      affected by Ps or PsA, thereby leading to an improvement in disease activity. The primary
      objective of this multi-centre, randomized, double-blind (sponsor open), placebo-controlled
      trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of GSK3050002, and to
      understand the mechanism of action (by taking skin and synovial biopsy samples) and potential
      for clinical efficacy of GSK3050002 in subjects with PsA. A minimum of 18 subjects and up to
      a maximum of 30 subjects will be randomised into the study to either GSK3050002 or placebo in
      a 2:1 ratio to ensure that approximately 18 evaluable subjects complete the study. The total
      duration of participation in the study will be approximately 21 weeks from screening to last
      study visit.

             different timeframe, in which case local guidelines may be followed, taking into
             account the risk:benefit and the indication for use of those medications. The
