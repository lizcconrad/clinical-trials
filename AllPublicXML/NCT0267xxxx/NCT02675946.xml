  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label study conducted in two phases: Phase 1 consisting of a
      CGX1321 Single Agent Dose Escalation Phase in solid tumors and Dose Expansion Phase in GI
      tumors and Phase 1b consisting of CGX1321 in combination with pembrolizumab in colorectal
      tumors. Both phases are to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Dose Escalation Phase is to examine the safety and determine the maximum
      tolerated dose of CGX1321 when administered to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

      The purpose of the Dose Expansion Phase and Phase 1b is to continue to examine the safety and
      confirm the final Phase 2 dose of CGX1321 alone in subjects with advanced GI tumors (Dose
      Expansion Phase) and evaluate the safety and tolerability of CGX1321 in combination with
      pembrolizumab in subjects with colorectal tumors (Phase 1b)
