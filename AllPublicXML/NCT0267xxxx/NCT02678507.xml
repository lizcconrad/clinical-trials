    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the validity and reproducibility of the POMAQ to
      identify opioid abuse and misuse behaviors among participants who have chronic pain which
      requires long-term opioid use.

      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has requested, as part of a Post-marketing requirement
      (PMR) for new drug application (NDA) holders of extended release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids,
      to conduct a study to develop and validate a measure of the opioid-related adverse events
      misuse and abuse among patients with chronic pain prescribed long-term opioid therapy. This
      measure will be used to assess misuse and abuse in PMR Study 2065-1A and PMR Study 2065-4B.

      To date, no tool currently exists to address the needs of the PMR except for the Self-Report
      Misuse, Abuse and Diversion of Prescription (Rx) Opioids questionnaire (SR-MAD) which has
      undergone several rounds of content validation but requires further validation. The SR-MAD
      has been substantially modified to meet the needs of PMR Studies 2065-1A and 2065-4B and has
      been renamed the Prescription Opioid Misuse and Abuse Questionnaire (POMAQ). The POMAQ will
      undergo content validation via qualitative interviews (Protocol 2065-2A [Qualitative]) prior
      to use in this validation study (Protocol 2065-2A [Quantitative]).

      This quantitative study will seek to further develop and validate the POMAQ following the
      general tenants according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry,
      Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling
      Claims (FDA 2009) which emphasizes the importance of conducting sound psychometric evaluation
      of patient-reported instruments through quantitative research methods. However, it should be
      noted that the POMAQ is not a typical PRO measure capturing a specific latent construct and
      the specified analytic approach to the POMAQ reflects this difference in theoretical
      frameworks.
