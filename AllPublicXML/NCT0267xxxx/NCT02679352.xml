  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder arthroplasty is a reliable procedure for the treatment of severe shoulder joint
      diseases to relieve pain and restore shoulder function.

      Shoulder implants commonly used are characterised by a humeral stem and complications related
      to the stem are not infrequent. These include: bone stock loss, intraoperative and
      postoperative break around the implant, malpositioning of the humeral component and difficult
      eradication of infections inside the bone around the implant.

      With the aim of reducing stem-related complications, a novel prosthesis characterised by a
      stem-less design has been developed.

      The objective of this study is therefore to explore how well people recover after shoulder
      replacement with this novel stem-less shoulder prosthesis. This will be assessed over 5 years
      in three different countries in Europe using patient completed questionnaires and clinical
      and radiographic assessments.

      The hypothesis at the base of the study is that the SMR stemless system might contribute to
      ensure good clinical outcomes and an effective stability and might avoid the potential
      complications associated with a traditional stemmed implant.

      The aim of this study is to assess clinical, radiographic and subjective outcomes after
      anatomic or reverse shoulder arthroplasty with a SMR stemless prosthesis, define the
      survivorship of the implant and identify possible risk factors that may lead to failure.

      This is a post-marketing clinical study, because the study device is registered, CE marked
      and used according to the intended use.

      It is an international, multi-centre, prospective case series. The assignment of any patient
      involved in the study is determined by the aetiology preoperatively evaluated by the
      Investigator and falls within current practice. The decision to use a specific prosthesis
      design is decided by the Investigators independently and clearly separated from the decision
      to include the patient in the study.

      The evaluation has an internal control because the assessment of post-surgery data is
      compared to baseline measurements (pre-operative clinical analysis and radiographic analysis
      at discharge). It is open label.

      The investigation will be carried out in 3 sites in Europe for a maximum total number of 78
      treated patients. Accrual will be competitive until the required recruitment target is met.
      Equal numbers will be recruited at each of three centres (26 patients per site), but a
      deviation of 8 participants will be accepted (minimum of 18 and maximum of 34 participants
      recruited per site).
