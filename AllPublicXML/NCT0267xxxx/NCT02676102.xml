  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this 3-phase mixed methods design study is to investigate how
      presenting content at varying levels of audience specificity (generic, targeted, and
      tailored) influences organ donor registration behavior among black men using video-based
      educational programming produced and distributed in partnership with our network of Black
      Owned Barbershops (BOBs). Investigators have completed a development phase using digital
      video interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos.
      This phase of this investigation is a 3 arm randomized control trial (RCT) phase, in which
      customers will be randomized to receive the generic, targeted, or tailored video programming
      delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered
      through registration online or with a mailed in application. The final phase of this
      investigation will be a failure analysis whereby we will interview a subset of participants
      who registered or failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain
      how the programming impacted their decision (Aim 3 - the subject of a future IRB
      application).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Black men who visit BOBs

          -  Participants whose primary language is English

          -  Participants who reside locally in NYC for at least four weeks (28 days) in a year

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women are excluded from this study, as it is focused on black men who visit BOBs, who
             are among the most in need for transplants, and least likely to register as organ
             donors.

          -  Women are excluded from this study, as it is focused on black men who visit BOBs, who
             are among the most in need for transplants, and least likely to register as organ
             donors.

          -  Persons not self-reporting being a black male are excluded. Including other minority
             groups would preclude conducting this research given its budget and time constraints.
