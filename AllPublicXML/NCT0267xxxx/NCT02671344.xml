      Microarray experiments to assess the expression of thousands of genes providing vast amount
      of information.

      Because the molecular requirements in the different processes related to playback,on the
      hypothesis that there may be more apt semen samples for technical or other assuming molecular
      differences in RNA content messengers or gene expression profile between the They getting
      semen samples in gestation versus those who do not.

      In an attempt to give a functional data obtained view, it is to find out how many of these
      genes in donors who have obtained gestation, they are differentially expressed in playback
      related processes against those donors who did not get pregnant.

      MRNA assembly is characterized by using microarrays on semen samples from donors included in
      the donation program of the clinic.

      This process is performed in donors who have generated at least 3 pregnancies compared those
      samples, however, were not a function of gestation assisted reproduction technique used.

      Consequently, differential expression of genes are identified in assisted reproduction
      treatment cycles from IAD, IVF or ICSI.

        Open retrospective study of 30 semen donors. Comparisons were made of gene expression
        profile between the IAD, IVF and ICSI groups according to the clinical outcomes of
        pregnancy.

          -  The donor recruitment will be made according to standard protocols rather Bilbao IVI
             centers will no visit, checking out additional analytical donation program to the
             donor is attached.

          -  By SIVIS data base, the results of different gestation is collected reproductive
             treatments that allow the allocation to the comparison groups gene profile.
