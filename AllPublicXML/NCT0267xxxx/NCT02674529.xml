      The proposed work aims to examine the neural changes associated with fast-acting
      antidepressant treatments in order to develop imaging-based biomarkers of treatment response
      for depression.

    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, neuroimaging tools have rapidly advanced the field of neural biomarkers
      of treatment response in depression. Still, despite obvious scientific progress in this
      field, the ability to implement neuroimaging biomarkers of antidepressant treatment response
      in clinical trial settings is lacking. In order to objectively asses the neural bases of
      treatment response in depression, the investigators will use a &quot;Real-time Neurofeedback fMRI
      task&quot;, specifically designed to record and modulate mood improvement by providing
      neurofeedback in the context of the administration of an antidepressant treatment. In a pilot
      study, positive neurofeedback during the administration of the drug was associated with
      significant acute mood improvement and increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
      responses in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), a common neural target of
      antidepressant treatments. The central hypothesis is that antidepressant effects in
      depression are mediated by increased neural activity in the rACC (AIM1), which can be used in
      clinical trials of antidepressant treatment to predict antidepressant effects (AIM 2) and
      assess the effect of antidepressant treatment on antidepressant-induced rACC neural responses
      (AIM 3). The results obtained from this project are expected to have an important impact on
      our ability to understand the cognitive and neural mechanisms implicated in antidepressant
      treatment responses in patients with depression, as well as on the ability to implement
      neuroimaging biomarkers of treatment response in the clinical trial settings.

    <description>The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. It was designed in 1979 by British and Swedish researchers as an adjunct to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) which would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale was.[2] There is, however, a high degree of statistical correlation between scores on the two measures.</description>

    <description>Scanning sessions are 90 minutes long. Scans are of the brain during the administration of an FDA-approved fast-acting antidepressant treatment. The investigators will determine the relationship between acute mood improvement and neural responses to positive neurofeedback versus the clinical response [∆ in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores] to 8 weeks of placebo treatment in 35 patients with MDD.</description>

    <ipd_description>The study will follow NIMH schedule for data sharing for clinical trials. The schedule allows for descriptive data to be submitted - but not shared - ongoing and results associated with a finding - both positive and negative - to be submitted prior to the communication of a result. Once a result is communicated, either through publication and/or on the NDCT website the data specifically defined to the clinical trial will then be shared.</ipd_description>
