  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      JNJ-54416076 and any associated metabolite(s) (in Part 1) and safety, tolerability and PK of
      JNJ-54416076 when co administered with food compared to administration in fasting condition
      (in Part 2).

      This is a Phase 1, single-center, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts : a) Single
      Ascending Dose part and b) PK-Food Effect part. Part 1 is a randomized (the study medication
      is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the Investigator nor the participant know the
      treatment), sequential cohort, single ascending oral dose study. Part 1 will assess the
      safety, tolerability, and PK of single ascending doses of JNJ-54416076 in healthy male
      participants. It will consist of 8 cohorts of 8 healthy participants. Within each cohort, 6
      participants will be randomly assigned to JNJ-54416076 treatment, and 2 participants will be
      randomly assigned to placebo treatment. The total study duration for each participant in Part
      1 will be up to approximately 5 weeks. Part 2 is a randomized, open-label (all people know
      the identity of the intervention), 2-period crossover study. Part 2 will assess the effect of
      food on the pharmacokinetics of JNJ-54416076. Each participant in Part 2 will receive 2 doses
      of JNJ-54416076 (one dose in the fasted state and an identical dose in the fed state). The
      dose selected for Part 2 will be selected based on the preliminary safety and PK data in Part
      1. The total study duration for each participant in Part 2 will be up to approximately 7
      weeks. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

             (inclusive) and body weight greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 kg

          -  Healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, vital signs, clinical
             laboratory tests, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If any
             of the results (except for liver function and hematology tests results as defined in
             the protocol) are abnormal, the participant may be included only if the investigator
             judges that the abnormalities or deviations from normal are not clinically
             significant. This determination must be recorded in the participants source documents
             and initialed by the investigator

          -  Blood pressure (after the participant is sitting for 5 minutes) between 90 and 140
             millimeters of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and between 50 and 90 mmHg
             diastolic, inclusive

          -  Men must agree to use condoms (including men who have had vasectomies) even if their
             partner is pregnant (this is to ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the study drug
             through vaginal absorption) and to not donate sperm during the study and for 3 months
             after receiving the last dose of study drug. Male participants should encourage their
             female partner to use an effective method (example, prescription oral contraceptives,
             contraceptive injections, intrauterine device, double barrier method, and
             contraceptive patch) of contraception in addition to the condom used by the male study
             participant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or currently active, significant illness or medical disorders, including

             disease or other bleeding disorders), respiratory disease, hepatic or gastrointestinal
             disease, neurological or psychiatric disease, ophthalmologic disorders (including
             retinal disorders or cataracts), neoplastic disease, skin disorder, renal disorder, or
             any other illness that the investigator considers should exclude the participant or
             that could interfere with the interpretation of the study results

          -  History of Gilbert's disease, Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndrome, or any family history
             of liver or gallbladder disease that may suggest an underlying genetic disorder

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), bilirubin levels (indirect, or direct), or alkaline
             phosphtase above the upper limit of normal of the clinical laboratory's reference
             range at Screening or at Day -1

          -  Hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count below the lower limit of normal of the
             clinical laboratory's reference range at Screening. On Day -1, if participants have
             hemoglobin, hematocrit, or red blood cell count below the lower limit of normal of the
             clinical laboratory's reference range, the participants may be included if the

             not clinically significant
