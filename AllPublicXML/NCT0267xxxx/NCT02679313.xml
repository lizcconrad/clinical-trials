  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare near clinical oculomotor parameters (heterophoria, vergence ranges,
      AC/A and accommodative findings) measured when lenses and/or prisms are introduced using
      three different instruments namely: (i) a standard manual phoropter, (ii) an electronic
      phoropter and (iii) a wearable adaptive refractor (VisionFit).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated differences in a number of near oculomotor parameters
      [e.g., heterophoria, accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio] when measured
      in a manual phoropter versus a trial frame. These differences may be due to variations in
      proximal vergence, differences in head and eye position and restriction of the peripheral
      visual field. Further, a number of standard clinical oculomotor procedures require the use of
      Risley rotary prisms. While prism is typically introduced in a smooth, ramp-like fashion with
      manual phoropters, step changes in prism are created with electronic phoropters. The precise
      effect of these variations on clinical measurements is unclear. Accordingly, after a routine
      refractive examination, a standard clinical near assessment (comprising near heterophoria,
      AC/A ratio, horizontal vergence ranges, amplitude of accommodation and negative and positive
      relative accommodation) will be carried out on the same individuals through: (i) a standard
      manual phoropter (American Optical model 11625), (ii) an electronic phoropter (Topcon
      CV-5000) and (iii) a wearable adaptive refractor (VisionFit). The latter resembles a trial
      frame mounted on a helmet carrier (similar to a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope headset)
      but includes adaptive lenses that can be changed electronically.

    <measure>Near horizontal heterophoria</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Near horizontal heterophoria (measured in prism diopters) will be recorded using both the Von Graefe and Modified Thorington techniques using each of the three lens presentation devices. The single set of measurements will be recorded approximately 15 minutes after the start of the trial.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accommodative convergence to accommodation (AC/A) ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The AC/A ratio will be calculated from measurements of near horizontal heterophoria (quantified in prism diopters) will be recorded using the Modified Thorington technique at 3 different accommodative stimulus levels (1.5D, 2.5D and 3.5D). Measurements will be obtained using each of the three lens presentation devices and calculated in units of prism diopter per diopter accommodation.The single set of measurements will be recorded approximately 15 minutes after the start of the trial.</description>

    <measure>Horizontal near vergence ranges</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Near base-in and base-out vergence ranges will be measured (in prism diopters) while the subject fixates a near target. Measurements will be expressed in terms of the blur point, break point and recovery measurement .The single set of measurements will be recorded approximately 15 minutes after the start of the trial.</description>

Oculomotor measurements, i.e., heterophoria, vergence ranges, AC/A and accommodative findings will be measured at each session using the different devices. Each session will be separated by a minimum of 24 hours and a maximum of 14 days.</description>
