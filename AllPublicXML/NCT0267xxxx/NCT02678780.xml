        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be included in this study:

          1. Subjects must have histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following
             advanced/metastatic neuroendocrine tumor types:

               1. WHO Classification G1/G2 (Ki67&lt;20% and mitotic count ≤20 mitoses x 10 HPF)
                  pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor

               2. WHO Classification G1/G2 (Ki67&lt;20% and mitotic count ≤20 mitoses x 10 HPF)
                  gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor (including stomach, small intestine and
                  colorectal origins).

          2. Subjects must have evidence of measurable disease meeting the following criteria:

               1. At least 1 lesion of ≥ 1.0 cm in the longest diameter for a non-lymph node, or ≥
                  1.5 cm in the short-axis diameter for a lymph node, which is serially measurable
                  according to RECIST 1.1 (Appendix I) using computerized tomography/magnetic
                  resonance imaging (CT/MRI). If there is only one target lesion and it is a
                  non-lymph node, it should have a longest diameter of ≥ 1.5 cm.

               2. Lesions that have had external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or loco-regional
                  therapies such as radiofrequency (RF) ablation or liver embolization must show
                  evidence of progressive disease based on RECIST 1.1 to be deemed a target lesion.

          3. Subjects must show evidence of disease progression by radiologic image techniques
             within 12 months (an additional month will be allowed to accommodate actual dates of
             performance of scans, i.e., within ≤ 13 months) prior to signing informed consent,
             according to RECIST 1.1 (Appendix I)

          4. Subjects must meet the following inclusion criterion regarding primary tumor site:

               1. Pancreatic origin: progression after a previous targeted agent (including mTOR
                  inhibitors, such as everolimus or antiangiogenic therapies, such as sunitinib,
                  sorafenib, axitinib, bevacizumab within others). Combination therapies in the
                  same treatment line (such as sorafenib plus bevacizumab, chemotherapy plus
                  antiangiogenic drugs) are considered one treatment line and are allowed to be
                  included in the study. Patients must be treated with only one previous line of
                  targeted agent(s)-based therapy.

                  Previous therapy with somatostatin analogues and/or interferon is allowed and is
                  not considered as a previous targeted agent therapy.

               2. Gastrointestinal origin: progression after therapy with antitumoral doses of
                  somatostatin analogs (octreotide LAR 30 mg every 28 days or Lanreotide 120 mg
                  every 28 days) and/or interferon treatment.

          5. Only for patients with pancreatic origin neuroendocrine tumors, one previous line with
             chemotherapy is allowed.

          6. Concomitant somatostatin analogues are allowed in both cohorts during the study.

          7. Patients with known brain metastases who have completed whole brain radiotherapy,
             stereotactic radiosurgery or complete surgical resection, will be eligible if they
             have remained clinically stable, asymptomatic and off of steroids for at least one
             month.

          8. All prior chemotherapy or radiation-related toxicities must have resolved to &lt; Grade 2
             (following CTCAE V 4.03 grade levels), except alopecia and infertility.

          9. Subjects must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of
             0 − 1 (Appendix II).

         10. Previous liver locoregional therapies, such as (chemo) embolization, radiofrequency or
             liver-directed (radio) embolization, or systemic peptide-receptor radionucleotide
             therapy are allowed if the procedure was performed at least 6 months previous the
             informed consent form signature.

         11. Adequately controlled blood pressure with or without antihypertensive medications,
             defined as BP &lt; 150/90 mmHg at screening and no change in antihypertensive medications
             within 1 week prior to the Screening Visit.

         12. Adequate renal function defined as calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min per the
             Cockcroft and Gault formula (Appendix III).

         13. Adequate bone marrow function, defined as:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/mm3 (≥ 1.5 ×103/μL).

               2. Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 (≥ 100 × 109/L).

               3. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL.

         14. Adequate blood coagulation function as evidenced by an International Normalized Ratio
             (INR) ≤ 1.5. Prophylactic low molecular weight heparin therapy is allowed.

         15. Adequate liver function:

               1. Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) except for unconjugated
                  hyperbilirubinemia or Gilbert's syndrome.

               2. Alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3 × the ULN (≤ 5 × ULN if subject has liver metastases).

         16. Males or females age ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent.

         17. All females must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25
             IU/L or equivalent units of beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) at the baseline
             visit (and/or within 72h prior to the first dose of study drug).

             Females of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total sexual abstinence*, an intrauterine device, a
             double-barrier method such as condom + spermicide or condom + diaphragm with
             spermicide or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia*) throughout the
             entire study period and for 30 days after study drug administration. The only subjects
             who will be exempt from this requirement are postmenopausal women (defined as women
             who have been amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group, without other known or suspected primary cause) or subjects who have been
             sterilized surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (i.e., bilateral tubal
             ligation with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or bilateral
             oophorectomy with surgery at least 1 month prior to dosing).

             The women using oral hormonal contraceptives should add an additional barrier method
             as there is unknown whether lenvatinib may reduce the effectiveness of the hormonal
             contraceptives. All women who are of reproductive potential and who are using hormonal
             contraceptives must have been on a stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive
             product for at least 4 weeks prior to dosing and must continue to use the same
             contraceptive during the study and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

             ** Sexual abstinence will be acceptable only when this is in line with the preferred
             and usual lifestyle of the subject.

         18. Male subjects who are partners of women of childbearing potential must use or their
             partners must use a highly effective method of contraception (e.g., condom +
             spermicide, condom + diaphragm with spermicide, IUD) beginning at least 1 menstrual
             cycle prior to starting study drug(s), throughout the entire study period, and for 30
             days after the last dose of study drug, unless they are sexually abstinent or have
             undergone a successful vasectomy. Those with partners using hormonal contraceptives
             must also be using an additional approved method of contraception, as described
             previously.

         19. Voluntary provision of written informed consent and the willingness and ability to
             comply with all aspects of the protocol.
