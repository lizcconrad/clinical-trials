  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial to compare two needles used in biopsy techniques to acquire tissue
      from pancreatic cancer. The hypothesis is that the tissue yield, as measured by tumor DNA and
      cellular material is superior for Flexible Needle Biopsy (FNB) compared with conventional
      Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). Specifically, FNB will increase the proportion of cases in
      which sufficient DNA is obtained to allow genomic profiling and whole exome sequencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blinded randomized controlled trial with paired evaluation of conventional
      FNA needle versus FNB needle stratified by lesion location (pancreas head tumor versus
      pancreas body/tail). A minimum of 4 passes ( 2 with each needle) will be performed from all
      the lesions. After each pass of needle, the on-site cytopathologists will evaluate the
      adequacy and the degree of the pathological changes in the obtained material. Based on the
      information provided by the onsite cytopathologists, the endosonographer will repeat the FNA
      until enough histological material is obtained to confirm a diagnosis. Patients will be
      assessed immediately after procedure and during the first 30 days with a follow-up.

    <description>Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure. In fine needle aspiration, a thin needle is inserted into an area of abnormal-appearing tissue or body fluid, and histological material is obtained. FNA will be performed with a standard 25g needle in the usual fashion using back and forth passes for 30 seconds.</description>
