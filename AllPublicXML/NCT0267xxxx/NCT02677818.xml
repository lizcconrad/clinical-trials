      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Plasma Factor VIII Levels are related to
      the treatment of bleeding in ischemic stroke（IS）.

      Clear cerebral infarction patients during hospitalization, treatment process, discharge and
      hemorrhage occurs, the stages F VIII level change and its correlation with bleeding adverse
      reactions. Analysis F VIII whether belong to hemorrhage occurs independent risk factors of
      adverse drug reactions,as well as the feasibility of predicting bleeding occurred adverse
      reaction index.
