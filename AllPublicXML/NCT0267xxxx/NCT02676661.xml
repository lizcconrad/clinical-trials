      To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for peri-implant disease in partially
      edentulous patients rehabilitated with implants supported crown or bridge so as to provide
      evidence for clinical prevention and control.

      The aim of the present study is to identify the prevalence of peri-implant disease in
      partially edentulous subjects treated with osseointegrated implants, using clinical
      parameters, as well as to analyse the possible disease association with demographic,
      behavioural, and biological risk variables.
