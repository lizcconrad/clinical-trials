    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the safety and efficacy of UroGen's TC-3 Gel for sustained release
      of Botulinum Toxin A (BTX) in urinary bladder in patients with idiopathic overactive bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome, defined by the International Continence Society
      (ICS), as the presence of &quot;urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia,
      with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of a urinary tract infection
      (UTI) or other obvious pathology.&quot; This study will evaluate a new of mode of treatment, with
      intravesical bladder instillation with Botox® mixed with TC-3 that may bypass the drawbacks
      of the current bladder injection treatment mode in OAB patients. Additionally it will provide
      preliminary safety and efficacy data that may serve as a basis for a larger study exploring
      safety and efficacy aspects of this new mode of treatment.

      50 patients will be randomized in a horse race fashion in a ~2:2:1 ratio. The patients will
      be screened for up to 3 weeks prior to treatment.

      The patients will be requested to stop their OAB medications 7 days prior to treatment visit.
      20 patients will receive one instillation of 300U of BotuGel (60ml), 20 patients will receive
      one instillation of 400U of BotuGel (60ml) and 10 patients will receive one instillation of
      60 ml RTGel-TC-3 Gel (Placebo), all patients will be followed up for safety and efficacy
      endpoints until 6 weeks post instillation.
