    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomised, parallel group efficacy study. Up to 240 healthy
      female and male participants aged over 18 years will participate. There will be two groups of
      up to 120 participants. Participants will be randomised to the test groups according the
      allocation table prepared by the Statistician.

      Participants will be enrolled on to the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
      After enrollment participants will have their teeth that have been allocated for assessment
      cleaned using a professional prophylaxis polish by the study dentist. The participants will
      then be provided with a standard cosmetic silica Fluoride toothpaste and a toothbrush to use
      at home, twice a day for up to four weeks. After this time they will return to the test site
      and have the baseline dental assessments. Participants will then be randomly allocated to one
      of the two test products which they will use at home, twice a day for the duration of the
      study. Dental assessments will be conducted after 13 and 26 weeks of product use at the study
      site.
