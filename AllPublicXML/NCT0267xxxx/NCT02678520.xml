      Compare the incidence of acute rectal, bladder and other acute toxicities between 3-D
      Conformal Radiation Therapy (RT/CRT) and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in
      Post-Prostatectomy Prostate Cancer Patients treated with post-operative radiation therapy

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2015, the American Cancer Society estimates that almost 220,800 men are expected to be
      diagnosed with prostate cancer, and about 27,540 men are expected to die of this disease.
      Curative treatment of prostate cancer consists of either surgery (i.e., radical
      prostatectomy) or radiation therapy (RT). Approximately one-third of men who undergo a
      prostatectomy will require post-operative adjuvant or salvage RT.

      During the last 2 decades, the techniques used to deliver RT have evolved from 2-D RT in the
      1980's and early 1990's, to 3-D conformal RT (3-D CRT) in the late 1990's, to intensity
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) within the last decade.

      To date, no randomized prospective head to head comparison between 3-D CRT and IMRT to assess
      toxicity differences has ever been conducted in the treatment of post-prostatectomy prostate
      cancer patients. Retrospective evidence suggests comparable acute and late genitourinary (GU)
      and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. In addition, no postoperative randomized trials
      investigating hormonal therapy (HT) and RT have been published, but three prior phase III
      studies of men treated definitively for prostate cancer, one by the Radiation Therapy
      Oncology Group (RTOG) (86-10), one by investigators at Harvard, and one by the Trans-Tasman
      Radiation Oncology Group, concluded that neoadjuvant and concurrent short-term hormonal
      therapy (i.e., 4-6 months) RT reduces cause-specific mortality compared with RT alone.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate, correlate, and compare the incidence of acute
      rectal, bladder and other acute toxicities between 3-D CRT and IMRT in prostate cancer
      patients treated with post-operative radiation therapy, to quantify, compare, and correlate
      the dose volume histogram (DVH) doses (e.g., Vmean, Vmedian, V25, V50, V75) to the
      surrounding critical organs (i.e., rectum and bladder) between 3-D CRT and IMRT, and to
      measure, compare, and correlate the quality of life scores of participants using the EORTC
      Quality of Live Questionnaires (QLQ), called &quot;QLQ-C30&quot; and &quot;EPIC-26&quot;. These survey
      instruments will measure quality of life differences during the study; the comparison will be
      done between 3-D CRT and IMRT treatment arms.

      Hormonal therapy will also be required for patients with high risk disease (both the adjuvant
      and salvage groups) and as per standard of care for patients with low risk disease, but is
      not explored in this study.

      There are 2 arms (groups) in this study:

      Arm 1: 3-D Conformal Radiation Therapy (plus hormonal therapy)

      Arm 2: Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (plus hormonal therapy)

    <time_frame>Toxicity measured weekly starting at pre-treatment eval. and ending at end of treatment of participant 10 in both arms (Btwn approx. 7 to 11 wks per participant/through end of study; approx. 2 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Acute rectal, bladder and other toxicity rates will be estimated and 95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be calculated. Toxicity will be measured via analysis of patient adverse events (physiological parameter). Adverse events will be scored using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0.3 (June 14, 2010). A two-sample binomial test will be used. This time point is an interim toxicity monitoring event designed to protect against the unlikely event of significantly more grade 2 or higher toxicities in one treatment vs. the other. If at any point, after the first 10 patients in each arm, the grade 2 or higher acute toxicity rate in either arm is more than double the grade 2 or higher acute toxicity rate in the other treatment arm, enrollment will be suspended and review of safety profiles conducted. The PI and Data Safety Monitoring Committee will then either modify the protocol or close the study to accrual.</description>

    <description>After safety issues, if any, have been resolved and study continued, the TOTAL of ALL 100 subjects (50 in each treatment arm) will be measured thus: Acute rectal, bladder and other toxicity rates will be estimated and 95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be calculated.

    <description>Intervention: Radiation therapy delivered to a total dose of 6600 centigray (cGy) at 200 cGy/fraction (fx) once daily using a 3-D conformal radiation technique (3-D CRT). The volume of radiation will encompass the prostatic fossa / surgical bed including any suspected regions of microscopic disease such as positive margins, extracapsular extension and/or seminal vesicle involvement. Hormonal therapy will be required for patients with &quot;high risk&quot; disease (both the adjuvant and salvage groups). For patients with &quot;low risk&quot; disease, hormonal therapy will be as per standard of care. Hormonal therapy will typically begin 2 months prior to radiation and continue for a total of 6 months. Hormonal therapy regimen will consist of Casodex (50 mg/day po for 6 months) and Zoladex (10.8 mg sc once every 3 months x 2 injections) or Lupron (22.5 mg im once every 3 months x 2 injections) to start on day 1 once the subject has been enrolled to the clinical trial.</description>
