    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label single center feasibility study to demonstrate basic safety
      and effectiveness of prostate artery embolization for the treatment of symptomatic benign
      prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) in a small series of patients with large (≥90 grams) glands.

      This is a prospective, open labeled, non-randomized, single center feasibility study to
      evaluate the technical and clinical success of prostatic artery embolization utilizing
      Embosphere microspheres.

      At initial consultation patients will be screened to assess the severity of lower urinary
      tract symptoms (LUTS) related to BPH utilizing the international prostate symptom score
      (IPSS). After determining eligibility, pre-procedure baseline evaluation will be completed. A
      baseline prostate ultrasound (TRUS) or MRI will be required to assess prostate mass, and
      baseline prostate-specific antigen will be measured to help exclude carcinoma and also to
      follow response to therapy. Patients with suspected malignancy of the prostate will not be
      enrolled without a negative biopsy finding. Pre- procedure urodynamic studies will be
      required to assess additional objective measurements and to exclude other causes of LUTS.
      Cystoscopy will be performed prior to any intervention to help exclude bladder malignancy.

      If the patient qualifies by the level of symptoms (IPSS score ≥12), prostate size ≥ 90 grams
      and max urinary flow rate (Qmax) ≤ 12, the patient will be asked to consider enrolling in the
      study. A study investigator will review the proposed treatment and baseline/follow-up
      schedule. If the patient agrees to participate in the study, baseline data will be collected
      on a case report form and an appointment will be made for prostate artery embolization in the
      interventional radiology department.
