      The objective of the study is to prospectively assess the use and treatment outcomes of
      nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in the Netherlands.
      Additional objectives are to monitor the incidence and reversibility of neuropathy during
      treatment, to assess the patient's Quality of life when treated with
      nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine and to evaluate the use of resources that come with treating
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.

    <description>The objective is to prospectively assess the use and treatment outcomes of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

        Two-hundred adult patients treated with the combination nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (AG)
        for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be recruited from approximately 25 oncology
        sites in the Netherlands. In all cases, the decision to treat the patient with AG was
        already made prior to the decision to enter the subject into the study. Treatment will be
        according to routine clinical practice and based on recommendations as per SmPC.
