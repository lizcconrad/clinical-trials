    <textblock>
      This is a single center pilot study evaluating the immediate effects of low-dose
      acetazolamide on respiratory control in subjects with treatment emergent sleep disordered
      breathing. The purpose of this study is to assess the immediate effect one-time low-dose
      acetazolamide on sleep breathing in (Treatment Emergent Sleep Disordered Breathing) TE-CSA
      subjects compared to subjects' baseline evaluation without acetazolamide. Investigators will
      also try to determine the immediate effect of one-time low-dose acetazolamide on subjects'
      resting ventilation and ventilatory response slope compared to subjects' baseline evaluation
      without acetazolamide.
