  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients face multiple stresses and challenges in the aftermath of cancer diagnosis. Despite
      needs perceived by elderly patients might differ from those of younger patients, there is a
      paucity of published data assessing the specific evolution and relevant determinants of
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in older patients with cancer. Such determinants may
      include cancer type/location/stage, treatment type/intensity, comorbidities, nutritional
      status or socioeconomic features, but also practical organization of care -frequency,
      geographical distance, supporting measures -, or psychosocial and material support - social
      network, housing conditions and contextual neighborhood features. Comparatively to dementia
      or cancer in younger patients, little is known in the oncogeriatric field of the impact on
      caregivers' perceived burden and HRQol of the support they provide to patients. Further, the
      potential interactions between patients' and caregivers' HRQoL remain largely unknown, while
      caregivers are often themselves old with chronic diseases and/or daily living activities'
      limitations.

      The DEQOLAGE study is a prospective observational cohort study that aims to describe the
      HRQoL of patients aged over 70 years with a colorectal or prostatic cancer during the first
      year following the diagnosis of the disease as well as the HRQoL and burden in their main
      caregivers. This study will allow a comprehensive assessment of multiple determinants of
      HRQoL operating at different levels, including individual (cancer type/location/stage,
      treatment type/intensity, comorbidities, nutritional status or socioeconomic features),
      contextual (social network, housing conditions and contextual neighborhood features) and
      organizational factors (frequency, geographical distance, supporting measures). We also
      hypothesize that complex interactions may operate between patient's and caregiver's HRQoL and
      perceived burden. Quality of life measurement will be based on two recent scales specifically
      designed for the elderly to confirm their psychometric properties and in-field feasibility.
