  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a
      probiotic (Bl-04) on the occurrence of rhinovirus-associated common cold illness in the
      experimental rhinovirus challenge model. A previous study documented that Bl-04 has
      significant effects on the innate immune response in the nose and this study will be powered
      to assess whether these effects translate into a demonstrable clinical benefit. Volunteers
      will be given Bl-04 or placebo for 28 days then challenged with rhinovirus. The primary
      analysis will be on the proportion of volunteers who develop a rhinovirus associated illness
      in the two treatment groups.
