  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess whether treatment with a drug called spironolactone, which is an
      aldosterone inhibitor, can improve ability to cope with exertion, quality of life and ability
      of the heart to relax better in symptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation with preserved
      pumping capacity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IMPRESS-AF study is a double-blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial of 2-year treatment
      with an aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone (25mg once daily) vs placebo in 250 patients
      with symptomatic chronic atrial fibrillation and preserved left ventricular contractility
      (both added to the current optimised care). The trial will establish impact of spironolactone
      on the primary outcome of exercise tolerance (peak oxygen consumption on cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing) and secondary outcomes: (i) health-related quality of life (assessed using
      the validated Minnesota Living with Heart Failure and EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaires
      self-completed by patients), and (ii) left ventricular diastolic function (E/e' ratio on
      echocardiography) - all assessed at baseline and at 2 years; (iii) rates of all-cause
      hospitalisations during 2-year follow-up.
