  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban is a medicine which reduces the formation of blood clots. Acute coronary syndrome
      (ACS) comprises a range of disorders, including heart attack and unstable angina, caused by a
      sudden reduction in blood flow to part of the heart muscle. This study aims to collect
      information on the use of rivaroxaban and its safety when used by patients for the prevention
      of atherothrombotic (plaque rupture leading to a blood clot) events following ACS, during the
      first three months after starting. This study was requested by the European regulatory body
      (EMA) which is responsible for the use and safety of medicines. It will last for
      approximately 3 years and is a national study covering the whole of England and Wales. The
      study aims to recruit 1193 patients who have been prescribed rivaroxaban and antiplatelet
      therapy and 1193 patients who have been prescribed alternative dual antiplatelet therapy for
      the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events following ACS. Each patient will only be
      monitored for the first 13 weeks after hospital admission for ACS. Patients who choose to
      take part will complete a consent form. The patient's care team will be asked to complete a
      baseline questionnaire about the patient at the time the medicine is given and a further
      questionnaire up to 16 weeks later, specifically asking about the patient's experiences
      whilst on the medication. If anything unusual is reported during the observation period, the
      care team may be asked to fill out a followup questionnaire. With the patient's consent, the
      study team will also inform the patient's General Practitioner (GP) of their participation in
      the study and will ask the GP to complete an abridged questionnaire from the patient's
      medical records. The study team will analyse and aggregate the data, carefully protecting
      patient confidentiality, to classify adverse events of interest, in particular bleeding
      events.
