      The investigators are doing a study to learn how to support patients aged 60+ in taking more
      breaks from sitting. The goal of the study is to find out if using commercially available
      devices are helpful in reducing sitting time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no one has tested whether the prompting features of commercially available
      wrist-worn devices (e.g., Jawbone Up) improve breaks from sitting. Single case designs are a
      cost-effective way to conduct a controlled, randomized study that can inform larger
      intervention trials. Because the investigators are interested in ascertaining the effect of a
      very specific intervention on a very specific/single outcome, this study is well-suited to
      this approach.

      The investigators will conduct iterative single case experimental studies using randomization
      tests. This design can help evaluate technologies for behavior change. To increase
      statistical power, the investigators opted to conduct an ABA study design (also termed a
      reversal design) where A is baseline and B is an intervention. Using randomization tests, the
      length of each A and B phase are determined to vary randomly in length prior to the beginning
      of each participant's experiment. The investigators will constrain the total time of each A
      and B phase to last a minimum of 5 days to provide adequate exposure to the A (measurement
      only) and B (intervention) conditions. The maximum total number of days participants will be
      enrolled is 28.
