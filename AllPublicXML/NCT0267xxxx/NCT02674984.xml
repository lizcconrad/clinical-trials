  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of combination probiotic BB-12 with LGG
      in healthy children with autism spectrum disorder aged 4-15 years. Subjects will be
      randomized to BB-12 with LGG orally (LGG dose: 10^9 c.f.u.'s; BB-12: 10^9) for a total of 56
      doses or placebo (maltodextrin) at 2:1 ratio. The time on study treatment is 56 days, and the
      target sample size is 30 individuals (i.e., 20 in the treatment arm and 10 in the placebo
      arm).

    <measure>Effect of combination probiotic BB-12+LGG on gut inflammation</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 56 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>Biological change in fecal calprotectin levels and plasma S100A9 will indicate GI and systemic levels of inflammation. S100 is a damage-associated molecular pattern molecule (DAMP) released by granulocytes, which is reportedly elevated 2-fold in plasma of children with ASD. FC is a highly accurate fecal marker of inflammation. Plasma zonulin, a marker for intestinal permeability (&quot;leaky gut&quot;), which is often associated with inflammation.</description>

    <measure>Effect of combination probiotic BB-12+LGG on fecal microbial community and metabolites</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1, 56 and 84</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine microbial alpha and beta diversity and distribution of the major taxa before and after probiotic treatment. Because bacterial products may be equally or more important than their community structure, we will determine levels of metabolic markers which are reported to be abnormal in autism: fecal amino acids, ammonia, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and phenols.</description>
