    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to determine differences in outcomes in patients who receive
      regional anesthesia (a fascia iliaca block) versus placebo prior to undergoing hip
      arthroscopy with labral repair and/or debridement and osteoplasty for hip impingement.

      Methods: After informed consent is obtained at a routine/pre-surgical clinic visit, all
      patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo randomization into one of two groups.
      These groups are 1) to receive regional anesthesia (a single shot fascia iliaca block using
      bupivacaine) prior to hip arthroscopy, or 2) undergo a subcutaneous injection procedure using
      a normal saline placebo (0.9% sodium chloride in water) instead of bupivacaine.
      Intra-operatively, both groups will receive general anesthesia and local anesthesia
      (lidocaine and bupivacaine in the peripheral compartment).
