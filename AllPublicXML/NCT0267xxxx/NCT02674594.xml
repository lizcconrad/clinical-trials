    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this proposal is to execute a real-world database analysis to
      evaluate hospital readmissions among hospitalized nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)
      patients in the U.S

      Primary objective: To determine the proportions of NVAF patients with bleeding-related
      hospital readmissions that occur within 30 days of the hospitalization of NVAF patients
      treated with the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or
      warfarin in the inpatient setting

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the cost associated with bleeding-related hospital readmissions that occur
           within 30 days of the hospitalization of NVAF patients treated with dabigatran,
           rivaroxaban, apixaban or warfarin in the inpatient setting

        -  To determine the proportions of NVAF patients with all cause hospital readmissions and
           the associated costs that occur within 30 days of the hospitalization of NVAF patients
           treated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban or warfarin in the inpatient setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a primary or secondary diagnosis of AF identified by International Classification
             of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes from the Premier
             Hospital database between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013

          -  Age 18 years or older as of initial hospitalization with AF diagnosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have any primary or secondary diagnosis code or procedure code for valvular disease
             during the study period. This exclusion criterion is consistent with that used in
             other previous BMS HEOR studies and is used to ensure that the study populations are
             NVAF patients

          -  Received multiple types of NOACs during the index hospitalization. Preliminary
             analysis showed that very few patients receive multiple types of new oral
             anticoagulants (NOACs) during the same hospitalization. This exclusion criterion will
             allow to cleanly group patients into the different NOAC usage groups
