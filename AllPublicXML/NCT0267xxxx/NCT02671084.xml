      Increase in CK-MB after percutaneous coronary angioplasty more than 100% of baseline can
      represents a problem to the patients resulting in increase of morbidity and mortality.

      Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of
      creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty.

      Possibly patients who will receive sevoflurane experience a higher level of cardiac cell
      protection with lower incidence in the release of CK - MB values in excess of 100% baseline.

    <textblock>
      Several published clinical studies have shown the benefit of using inhaled anesthetic agents
      in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft(CABG). These benefits involve functional
      state of the heart and reduction damage to the organ. These events are related to
      intracellular phenomena that result in intracellular calcium homeostasis giving physical and
      functional benefits to the heart. Also disclosed is a modulation of the inflammatory response
      to endothelial level with resulting protective character to the coronary bed.

      Patients submitted of coronary angioplasty procedures can release in varying degrees of
      creatine kinase, MB isoform (CK - MB), on the order of 30% of all angioplasty. Even in
      smaller increases than 3 times baseline, a criterion that defines myocardial infarction,
      clinical impact can already be found. Increase in CK-MB more than 100% of baseline can
      represents a problem to the patients. This elevation of CK - MB is associated with various
      factors such as age, characteristic of the lesion, clinical status of the patient, inferring
      that endovascular procedures of coronary, simple or complex, have associated myocardial
      damage, which depending on the intensity of the damage, results in increased morbidity and
      mortality.

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

      Check for reduction in the percentage of patients that release CK -MB at levels above the
      100% baseline in patients anesthetized with sevoflurane compared to the control group.
      Possibly patients who will receive sevoflurane experience a higher level of cardiac cell
      protection with lower incidence in the release of CK - MB values in excess of 100% baseline.

    <description>Sevoflurane Group called group A patients will receive sevoflurane. The patients of group A will receive facial mask properly attached to your face, inspiratory fraction of sevoflurane 3%, with therapeutic target of 1.2% expired fraction into spontaneously breathing.This exposure will during 30 min. Than, the mask will remove of the face and the patient will spontaneously breathing in ambient air during 10 min. This procedure is sufficient to induce the pre anesthetic conditioning in the group exposed to sevoflurane. After the end of this exhibition, patients will be allowed to enter the catheterization laboratory for angioplasty, no more any anesthetic agent will be administer until the end of his procedure.</description>

The patient of group B will receive facial mask properly attached to your face into spontaneously breathing.This exposure will during 30 min.

After the end of this exhibition, patients will be allowed to enter the catheterization laboratory for angioplasty, no more any anesthetic agent will be administer until the end of his procedure.</description>
