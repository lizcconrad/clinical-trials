  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endothelium is a key barrier between blood and tissue compartments. It is a major target
      of factors involved in metabolic and cardiovascular pathologies. However, the study of native
      human adult endothelial cells is difficult due to the lack of appropriate models and
      thereafter the endothelium is actually not easily accessible for clinical investigation.
      However, our results recently showed that the endothelium from human adipose tissue exhibit
      distinct phenotypes, including endothelial cell number and inflammatory, angiogenic and
      senescent state, according to adipose tissue location, i.e. subcutaneous and visceral. It is
      well recognized that estrogens favour gluteo-femoral adipose tissue deposit and their deficit
      after menopause is associated with increased abdominal and visceral fat mass as well as
      metabolic dysfunctions. These perturbations might be prevented with hormonal therapy.
      However, no data are available concerning the endothelial cells from gluteo-femoral and
      abdominal adipose tissues in women.

      The adipose tissues (gluteo-femoral and abdominal) will be obtained from women programmed for
      surgery in which the estrogenic status as well as adipose tissue mass profile will be
      evaluated. The phenotype (inflammatory and angiogenic activation and senescent state) of
      native endothelial cells will be determined &quot;in situ&quot; by immunohistochemical and flow
      cytometry approaches and on isolated endothelial cells by Reverse transcriptase-Q Polymerase
      Chain Reaction and Western blot. In vitro approaches will be performed 1) to establish a
      causal relationship between endothelial senescence and activation state, 2) to define the
      impact of the adipose tissue microenvironment on the endothelial cell activation and
      senescence and 3) to study the potential protective effect of estrogens on endothelial
      senescence.
