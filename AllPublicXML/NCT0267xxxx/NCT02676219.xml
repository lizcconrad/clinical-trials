    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomised, split mouth, blind with respect to study analysts
      (microscopist, image grader) two treatment clinical study in 10 healthy participants with
      sound tooth enamel. The study will comprise of a screening visit, pre-baseline visit and 5
      subsequent clinic visits. At the screening visit, participants will give consent to
      participate in the study. Medical history and concomitant medications will be recorded.
      Eligibility will be determined following an oral soft tissue (OST) examination and an
      evaluation of dentition exclusions. Two suitable anterior teeth will be identified for study
      assessments, these teeth must be at least one tooth apart in the mouth. Saliva samples will
      be collected from the participants at set points during the study to look at any changes in
      salivary pH.
