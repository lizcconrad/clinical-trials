  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks of aerobic endurance exercise as
      adon treatment for moderately to severely depressed inpatients. Endpoints are symptom
      severity, psychological variables, cognitive symptoms, sleep, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
      axis (HPA-axis), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and heartrate variability (HRV).

      Amendment 1 (Nov. 2016): additional evaluation of TNF-alpha at baseline, +2 weeks and post
      (+6weeks) in already existing blood samples.

      Patients are randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or control group (CG). The IG
      will train three times per week on indoor bicycles at 60 to 75% of maximal heartrate aiming
      at a weekly total of 17.5kcal/kg bodyweight for 6 consecutive weeks. The exercise will take
      place under supervision. CG will absolve a basic stretching and mobilisation program 3 times
      per week, also under supervision for 6 consecutive weeks. At the end of every week physical
      fitness is evaluated by the queens step test. No other activities with moderate or high
      intensity are allowed throughout the intervention time.

      All patients will participate in the multimodal treatment program of the depression ward,
      which includes pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and specialized therapies such as art therapy
      and ergotherapy.
