  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional dark-adaptometers are unsuitable as a mass screening tool due to their high
      cost, lack of easy portability, need of trained staff and a totally dark room to be operated,
      arbitrary testing procedures, associated time waste in clinic and patient burden to mention a
      few. Consequently, dark adaptometers are not routinely used as clinical tools for retinal
      diagnosis and monitoring despite the inherent benefits over other visual electrophysiology
      equipment such as the ERG system, whose cost and features may often be surplus to
      optometrists' requirements.

      This trial will assess the dark-adaptometry testing performance of a novel light-emitting
      system by generating full dark-adaptation threshold functions in normal adult healthy
      volunteers.

      The novel system has been proposed to overcome the issues associated with current
      instrumentation; it is semi-automatic and easy to use without the need of any skilled
      operator.

      It is envisaged that this system could spread the practice of dark-adaptometry testing and
      its adoption by high-street optometrists. This will allow diagnosing a number of retinal
      pathologies more quickly and more reliably that, faced with an ageing population, represents
      a major asset to the Health Community and the NHS.

      This trial will involve 20 healthy volunteers, distributed in equal number in 2 groups of
      18-40 and 50-70 years old, respectively. Proven the good health and eye condition of the
      participants, one of their eyes will be randomly-allocated and undergo dark-adaptometry
      testing 3 times on separate days within 3 weeks.

      Testing will clarify whether by using the novel system it is possible to reproduce
      state-of-the-art threshold measurements as good or better than those produced by
      commercially-available dark-adaptometers. Threshold measurements in the elderly will be
      compared with literature data adjusted to exclude aged crystalline lens and pupillary miosis
      contributions. Data variability and system usability will be also assessed.
