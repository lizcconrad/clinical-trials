  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study designed to evaluate the long-term safety of prophylactic
      avoralstat (500 mg three times daily) when given to approximately 150 patients with
      hereditary angioedema (HAE) for a duration of up to 72 weeks. The study will also evaluate
      the long-term efficacy and impact on quality of life of avoralstat prophylactic treatment.
