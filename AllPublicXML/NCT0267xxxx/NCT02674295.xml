      The purpose of this study is to determine the metabolic disposition of radiolabeled
      esketamine administered by the oral and intravenous routes in healthy male participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label (identity of study drug will be known to participant and
      study staff), single-dose, parallel-group study. The study consist of Screening Phase (Days
      -21 to -2), Open-label treatment Phase (Day -1 up to Day 8) and End of Study (9 to 13 days
      after last study assessment). The total duration of study from the Screening Phase through
      Follow-up, is 37-41 days. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the two groups (Cohort 1 and
      Cohort 2) during the treatment phase. The participants will be primarily evaluated to
      determine the metabolic disposition of radiolabeled esketamine administered by the oral and
      intravenous routes. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterisation and Identification of 14C-esketamine Metabolites (Metabolic Profile)</measure>
    <time_frame>upto 168 hour post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Collection of urine and feces for 7 days is considered appropriate to characterize the metabolic profile of esketamine. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), an ultrasensitive technique particularly suited for detection of low levels of 14C, will be used to assess levels of the microtracer in whole blood, plasma, and excreta (urine, feces). Plasma, urine and feces selected samples with relatively high radioactive content will be analyzed for metabolic profiling and identification using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and AMS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 41 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
