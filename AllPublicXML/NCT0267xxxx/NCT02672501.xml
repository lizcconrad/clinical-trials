  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the conventional treatment options, B cell leukemia could be treated with chemotherapy
      drugs or HSCT. But chemotherapy could barely cured leukemia. And HSCT is often limited by
      lacking of HLA-matched donors, even if those patients who received HSCT still could be
      relapsed. And now, chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell infusion maybe an effective
      treatment to solve these problems. The investigators use a 2nd CAR- T with the optimized
      hinge and transmembrane domain to treat patients with relapsed or refractory B cell leukemia,
      including relapsed cases after HSCT. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and
      efficacy of this 2nd CAR-T cells. At the same time, evaluating the possible and clinical
      responses of using donor-derived T cells engineered CAR-T cells.

      Detailed Description: This study is being conducted to assess anti-CD19-CAR-T cells safety
      and efficacy in treating patients with B cell leukemia. The investigators constructed a 2nd
      CAR, CD19 as target protein, 4-1BB as co-stimulator. And optimized the spatial conformation
      by a suitable hinge &amp; transmembrane domain sequences. The source of T cells for CAR-T is from
      two aspects, one is autologous, the other is donor-derived (only suitable for patients
      received HSCT before and relapsed). The infusion dose is (1-5)×106 CAR positive T cells/kg,
      and the specific cells numbers depend on the situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation.
