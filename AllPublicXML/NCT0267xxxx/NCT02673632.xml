  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator suggests that PCOS women with high AMH levels are resistant to ovarian
      stimulation and may need adjustment of the dose of gonadotrophin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a correlation between high levels of AMH and the severity of PCOS. Excessive AMH may
      have a negative effect on the sensitivity of the resting follicles to gonadotropins.

      This is an observational prospective study to investigate the impact of circulating AMH on
      gonadotrophin induction in women with PCOS.

    <description>Using the long protocol of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Down regulation by (Decapeptyl ®, Ferring) 0.1mg subcutaneously once daily starting from day 18 of the preceding cycle, human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG) (Merional ®, IBSA) 75 IU starting from cycle day two after confirmation of down regulation (thin endometrium, number of follicular activity, E2 &lt; 50 pg/mL). hMG dose is optimized according to age, BMI, antral follicles count (AFC), the local protocol, FSH level and previous response. Usually PCO patients start by 150 IU.</description>
