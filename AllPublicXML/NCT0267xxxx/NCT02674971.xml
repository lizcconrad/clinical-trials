  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For weight loss to occur, energy intake needs to be reduced to incur an energy deficit. One
      dietary strategy that may facilitate reducing energy intake and enhancing weight loss is
      consuming a diet low in dietary energy density (ED). The ED of a given food, defined as the
      ratio of energy of the food to the weight of the food (kcal/g), is largely determined by
      water content, but is also affected by fat and fiber. Although the 2010 Dietary Guidelines
      encourage an eating pattern low in energy density (ED) to manage weight, it is currently not
      known what the best strategy is for reducing ED in the diet. Eating a greater number of foods
      low in ED or reducing the number of foods high in ED may reduce overall dietary ED. As ED is
      believed to reduce intake by allowing a greater weight of food relative to total energy
      consumed assisting with enhancing feelings of fullness, it is anticipated that either
      increasing consumption of low-ED foods in the diet alone or combining an increase in
      consumption of low-ED foods with a decrease in consumption of high-ED foods may be the best
      strategies for reducing overall dietary ED for weight loss.

    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in overall dietary intake and changes per eating bout will be assessed by 3 day (2 weekdays and 1 weekend) food records. To determine dietary variables, each food record will be entered into the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R) software developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in self-reported physical activity will be determined by the Paffenbarger Activity Questionnaire (PAQ).16 This questionnaire yields estimates of the total energy expended in PA per week based on flights of stairs climbed per day, city blocks walked per day, and hours of structured activity acquired within a typical week. The PAQ has been shown to be significantly correlated with an objective measure of PA.</description>

    <measure>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>(EMA) refers to a collection of methods often used in behavioral medicine research by which a research participant repeatedly reports on symptoms, affect, behavior, and cognitions close in time to experience and in the participants' natural environment. EMA protocol will be conducted over 7 continuous days using both semi-random and event-contingent sampling. Semi-random responses will be collected at varied times within three windows (morning, afternoon, and evening), with three assessments occurring per day triggered by an alarm prompt that signals a 30-minute window for response. Event-based sampling will be used to assess eating bouts. Semi-random sampling will assess consumption cues (i.e. feelings of temptation, fullness, desire to eat, energy level and control over eating), along with feelings of hunger, satiation, and deprivation using a series of 11 questions.</description>

    <description>This condition will be instructed to make food consumption decisions based solely upon the ED of a food. The goal of the ED condition will be to consume at least 10 foods ≤ 1.0 kcal/g (i.e., fruits and vegetables, broth based soups, non-fat yogurts, some legumes, egg substitutes, some white fish, etc.) per day.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>COMBINATION</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This condition will be identical to the INCREASE condition, except it will also have a goal regarding the number of high-ED foods to consume and substituting low-ED foods for high-ED foods. Thus, this condition will have ED goals to consume at least 10 foods ≤ 1.0 kcal/g (i.e., fruits and vegetables, broth based soups, non-fat yogurts, some legumes, egg substitutes, some white fish, etc.) and no more than 2 foods ≥ 3.0 kcal/g (i.e., crackers, chips, cookies, hard cheeses, hot dogs, salad dressings, etc.) per day. Foods with an ED &gt;1.0 kcal/g but &lt; 3.0 kcal/g will be unlimited; however, lower ED foods will be strongly encouraged. Furthermore, additions to beverages (i.e., sugar, cream) will count toward the &gt; 3.0 kcal/g goal if the additions meet that ED criteria.</description>

    <description>12-week standard lifestyle intervention for obesity, which consists of weekly meetings. Each meeting will last 60 minutes, with participants attending group meetings specific for their condition. In all meetings, participants will be weighed, homework assignments will be verbally reviewed, and a behavioral lesson will be presented. Basic behavioral lessons, will be similar to those that have been successfully used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and Look AHEAD. Topics to be covered in the meetings will focus on the dietary prescriptions and dietary information for each condition, the physical activity goal, energy balance, and behavioral strategies. Each session will conclude with reminding participants of their dietary and physical activity goals, and having participants self-monitor these behaviors every day and implement the behavioral strategies discussed in the session.</description>
