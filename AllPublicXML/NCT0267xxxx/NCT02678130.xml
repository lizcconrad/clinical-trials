  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-approval study is to demonstrate that the InterFuse T modular lumbar
      interbody device is at least equal in safety and efficacy to other (standard of care) TLIF
      devices.

      The primary objective of this post-market study is to collect data to asses the long term
      outcome of the InterFuse T (tm) device in [patients undergoing interbody fusion.

      The primary endpoints of the investigation will include assessment of the maintenance of disc
      height and fusion rates demonstrated by radiographic evidence based on plain radiographs.
      Fusion is defined as a bone bridging across the disc space at the level of the InterFuse T
      implant. Length of stay, implant migration, implant subsidence, re-operation rate and opioid
      use will be recorded. It is anticipated that outcomes with the InterFuse T Interbody Fusion
      Device will be comparable to or better than the historical published results for other
      non-modular TLIF devices and to the control device used concurrently in the study
