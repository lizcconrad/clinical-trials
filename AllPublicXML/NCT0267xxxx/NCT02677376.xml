    <description>NaF is a tracer (dye) that will show changes to the cancer in bones. By using this tracer with PET/CT imaging, our ability to evaluate and measure changes in bone lesions could be greatly improved. Participants will have a NaF PET/CT scan within 14 days prior to starting enzalutamide. All subjects will undergo a secon NaF PET/CT scan after taking enzalutamide for 12 weeks. The NaF PET/CT obtained at week 12 will be compared to the first NaF PET/CT to identify a bone tumor that is responding (shrinking) and a bone tumor that is not responding (not shrinking).</description>

      <textblock>
        Men ≥18 years with progressive, bone-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer who will
        be treated with enzalutamide will be enrolled.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Identifiable prostate cancer-related osseous metastases on bone scan or NaF PET/CT in
             the vertebral body, pelvis or other bone. Such lesions must be amenable to serial NaF
             PET/CT imaging. Preference will be given to subjects with multiple lesions that can be
             imaged in one image acquisition session to obtain maximal information as well as
             locations of lesions amenable to bone biopsies.

          -  Patients must be starting enzalutamide for treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant
             prostate, with cycle 1 day 1 occurring within 14 days after the first baseline NaF
             PET/CT. Subjects will be allowed to receive enzalutamide treatment on a concurrent
             study as long as the enzalutamide treatment study does not prohibit concurrent
             participation.

          -  Men of all races and ethnic groups of age ≥18 years.

          -  The effects of NaF on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and
             because radiopharmaceuticals used for diagnostic imaging and other therapeutic agents
             and imaging procedures used in this trial may be or are known to be teratogenic, men
             must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while her partner is participating in
             this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  Patients must be able to comply with all study procedures, including having both the
             ability and willingness to lie flat for ≥ 30 minutes during imaging and undergo bone
             biopsies.

          -  Patients must have both the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
             written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known bleeding diathesis or on therapeutic anticoagulants (warfarin, low-molecular
             heparin, heparin analogues) that would increase risk of complications from bone
             biopsies.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to sodium fluoride F-18 (NaF).
