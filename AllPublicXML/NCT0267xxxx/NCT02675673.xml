      The purpose of this study is to compare the quality of life (QOL) in head and neck patients
      who are given the GJ tube (which is placed in the bowel) versus those who are given the
      G-Tube (which is placed in the stomach) for prophylactic feeding. The standard of care for
      patients at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) is using GJ tubes. Patients who agree to be in
      the study will be randomized to either the GJ-Tube or the G-Tube arm. Patients randomized to
      the G-tube will receive prophylactic intravenous and oral antibiotics prior to insertion of
      the G-tube. Antibiotics will be given for a total of 1 week. A few hours following tube
      insertion (on return to PMH ward), patients will complete a single item, visual analogue pain
      scale (VAS). Patients will remain in hospital for a minimum of 24 hours and until the patient
      and/or family is able to care for the Enteric Feeding(EF) device at home. Patients randomized
      to the GJ-Tube may receive i.v medication during the procedure. All Patients will be asked to
      fill out several questionnaires at different time- points of the study. All Patients will
      have regular assessments to evaluate their overall quality of Life, toxicity, and how they
      respond to treatment during the study. Patients will also be assessed after they completed
      study treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylactic enteral feeding tubes are used routinely for nutritional support during
      intensive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer.
      Typically, tubes remain in place for up to 3-4 months. Whether small-bore jejunal (GJ) or
      larger bore gastric (G) tubes are used varies geographically, based on tradition, physician
      preference and availability of services. Feeding tube placement is arranged either prior to
      the start of RT, or more commonly within the first 2 weeks of RT, prior to the onset of
      severe mucositis. Patients are admitted to hospital for 1-3 days to monitor side effects of
      the procedure, and to allow our dietetic and nursing staff to provide intensive teaching on
      the use and care of the tube. Feeding tubes are kept in place through the treatment course
      and removed once patients are able to meet their calorie needs and maintain body weight
      through oral feeding. On average, feeding tubes are removed approximately 2-3 months after
      completion of RT; however, approximately 20% of patients may still require enteral feeding at
      1 year post-treatment. This study will compare the QOL in patients who use the G tube versus
      the GJ tube.

    <description>Patients randomized to his arm would usually have a small tube is inserted through the nose into the stomach first, so that air can be used to fill the stomach to make it visible on X-ray. A fine needle is then used to inject freezing medicine (local anesthetic) into the skin of the abdomen. Using an x-ray machine for guidance, a puncture is made into the stomach through the frozen skin. The feeding tube is placed through this puncture into the stomach and the tube tip is placed in the small bowel. Once the GJ-tube has been inserted, the tube in the nose is removed.</description>
