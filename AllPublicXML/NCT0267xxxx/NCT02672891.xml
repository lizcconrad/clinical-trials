      Intrauterine balloon tamponade in the management of postpartum hemorrhage in the obstetrics
      emergency ward in menoufiya university hospitals as a low resource setting.Guidelines for the
      management of postpartum hemorrhage involve a stepwise approach including the exclusion of
      retained products and genital tract trauma. Uterine atony, which is the most common cause, is
      dealt with uterine rubbing and various uterotonic agents. Among the new modalities introduced
      to arrest the bleeding is the uterine tamponade using various balloons and catheters. The
      condom catheter uses a sterile rubber catheter fitted with a condom for uterine tamponade .

      Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of uterine balloon tamponade using condom-catheter in the
      management of primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).

      Material and Methods: Prospective observational study included 50 women with primary
      postpartum hemorrhage unresponsive to uterotonics and bimanual compression, was conducted at
      the department of Obstetrics &amp;Gynecology, Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt. Clinical
      assessment, laboratory investigations and intrauterine condom catheter were applied to all
      patients. The primary outcome was the success of the balloon to stop bleeding, maternal
      complications were assessed as secondary outcomes.

    <description>condom balloon catheter which is composed of a latex condom (SURE natural latex condom, Shanghai) and a 16-20 F, 2 ways silicon coated Foley catheter (Egypt). The catheter was introduced inside the condom and tied over tightly several times with a silk suture, to prevent air escape.</description>

    <description>The condom balloon catheters were inserted into the uterine cavity digitally or with forceps .Tight vaginal pack was inserted or cervical stitch was done to prevent displacement of the balloon catheter.
(2)-Insertion at Cesarean Section: The catheter was inserted through the uterine incision (pushing the tip to the fundus and the drainage port through the cervix into the vagina) or transvaginally and inï¬‚ated after the uterine incision was closed.</description>
