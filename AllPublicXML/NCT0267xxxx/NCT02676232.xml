  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic and recurrent pain is a very important issue in the society, and its treatment is
      challenging.

      In children, one of the most common pain problems is recurrent abdominal pain. This problem
      can affect up to 12% of the children population, and can interfere on daily activities of
      both children and parents. Recurrent abdominal pain in children is also associated with other
      health problems, and can be related to problems in adulthood. Unfortunately, the current
      health system does not have an effective treatment for these children and their families.
      This is why the investigators propose an online intervention, DARWeb, for people in this
      situation.

      DARWeb provides an innovative solution using Information and Communication Technology to
      facilitate access. It is also innovative because it is directed towards secondary prevention,
      in contrast to the majority of current treatments available for pain problems that are
      focused in reducing the impact of pain when it is already severe. Thus, the objective of
      DARWeb is to provide information and teach strategies to children and their parents that help
      them to cope with pain and prevent pain interference in their daily lives (in the short,
      medium and long term).

      With this project, the investigators plan, first, to create a new version of their treatment
      program (DARWeb V2) from the results of the pilot study. Second, the investigators will test
      the effects of DARWeb V2 through a randomized clinical trial with a large sample, and they
      will assess the short, medium and long term effects. In addition, the investigators want to
      study which of the variables that are addressed in their intervention are responsible for the
      potential changes observed.

      The investigators expect that their treatment program will be effective to reduce pain in the
      short, medium and long term.

    <description>Participants in this arm will follow DARWeb: an online psychosocial intervention for children with recurrent abdominal pain and their parents. This is composed by 7 units for parents and 7 units for children, that have been developed from the cognitive-behavioral model, including setting goals, relaxation and distraction techniques, changing maladaptive thoughts and assertive communication training. The team under the program only contact with families for sending reminders and to answer potential technical problems or doubts</description>
