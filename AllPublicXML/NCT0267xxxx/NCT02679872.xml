      Good non-technical skills (NTS) have been shown to prevent adverse events and errors.
      Improvements of NTS can be achieved by simulation based-team training.The NTS of the
      operating theatre team performing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is speculated
      to differ fra open thoracic surgery, as is the case with technical skills; however, these
      have not been investigated. The aim of this study is to explore which NTS the members of the
      VATS team perceive to be most important to patient care and safety. Exploration will be done
      through a deductive, qualitative analysis of semi-structured group and individual interviews
      with VATS team members. A theoretical perspective of Hollnagels Safety-II will be taken using
      the taxonomy of Oxford Non-Technical Skills (NOTECHS) system with the aim of informing
      patient safety.

      BACKGROUND:

      Non-technical skills (NTS) can be defined as 'the cognitive, social and personal resource
      skills that complement technical skills, and contribute to safe and efficient task
      performance'. Human errors, such as communication breakdowns, lack of speaking up and of good
      leadership, are known to contribute considerably to adverse events. Adverse events are common
      in the operating theatre affecting patient safety. Adaptive behaviours have been shown
      important as a response to the dynamic, complex world of the operating theatre to prevent
      potential problems and adverse events.

      As with technical skills, NTS can be taught by team training. Team training have been shown
      to improve attitudes as well as NTS, and reduced technical errors. Large studies have
      additionally shown that team training can reduce adverse events and improve patient outcome.
      A training intervention targeted at operating theatre teams will need to start with an
      assessment uncovering the learning needs of the team members.

      In general minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is shown to be more complex, involve more
      personnel and take longer time than open surgery. The technical skills are different, among
      other things due to complex equipment and two-dimensional vision of a three-dimensional
      operating space. In our systematic review (submitted), only few studies investigated the NTS
      in MIS teams. The communication in MIS compared to open surgery were found to be different,
      relating more to equipment and patient related topics. Working in fixed teams improved
      teamwork climate in MIS teams.

      Correspondingly, the NTS of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) operating team is
      speculated to differ from the NTS needed in open surgery as is the case with the technical
      skills. However, no studies investigated the NTS of VATS teams.

      The aim of this study is to explore, which NTS the members of the VATS team perceive to be
      most important to high quality patient care and patient safety.

      METHODS:

      Frameworks/theory:

      The theoretical conceptual framework for the study is the safety theory by Erik Hollnagel,
      named Safety-I and Safety-II, arguing for a new view on safety: Safety-II. In Safety-I, the
      ontology is that things either function or malfunction, that could be a piece of equipment or
      healthcare professionals following procedures or guidelines. Consequently, the aetiology of
      the outcomes can be explained by a cause-effect relationship, where the malfunction of things
      linearly cause an unwanted effect. The resulting phenomenology then refers to outcomes as
      adverse events / incidents/ accidents. Oppositely, in Safety-II, the ontology is that in
      socio-technical systems, such as the healthcare system, performance adjustments is needed to
      adjust work, that is the task and the tools, to the actual situation of the complex world.
      Hence, as the technology only can vary to a limited extent, human performance needs to vary.
      The aetiological explanation in Safety-II is therefore, that performance variability resonate
      through both proactive and reactive adjustments into observed outcomes, named emergent
      outcomes. The resulting phenomenology sees the performance variability as both the basis of
      adverse events and of acceptable outcomes; that is everyday activities. These performance
      adjustments can be categorised into three types of adjustments: Maintaining/creating,
      compensating and avoiding, thereby characterising the performance variability for a specific
      activity. In all, the starting point is turned around. In Safety-II, the focus is on why and
      how things go right with the aim of understanding everyday activities, termed 'Work-as-Done',
      in contrast to the less interesting written procedure guidelines etc., termed
      'Work-as-Imagined'.

      Within non-technical skills research and education in healthcare, and especially within the
      specialities working in the operating theatre, a taxonomy widely used is the framework of
      behavioural markers adapted from the aviation industry, termed the Oxford Non-Technical
      Skills (NOTECHS) system. This framework is structured around four categories, divided into
      several elements each represented by examples of good or poor behavioural markers. This
      system has been developed and evaluated for operating teams and assesses both the team and
      each subteam's NTS. In this study, the taxonomy of the NOTECHS system in the perspective of
      the conceptual theory of Safety-II will be used as framework for the data analysis as
      described in detail below. In all, the behavioural markers representing good behaviours will
      therefore be the focus of this study to explore how things go right as this is much often the
      case than not. Interviewing the actual VATS team members themselves will explore their own
      perception of the NTS used in their everyday activities including the needed adaptions to
      situational requirements, found by others. This will represent 'Work-as-Done' rather than
      'Work-as-Imagined' with the aim of informing the Safety-II perspective on patient safety.

      Design:

      The study will use the theories described above in an explorative semi-structured interview
      study. The data collection and thereby sample size will be an iterative process until no new
      data is revealed, hence saturation is met. This will include interviews of both
      multi-professional teams and individuals depending on the data revealed during the
      interviewing-analysing process. Interviews will be conducted by KG and ASM using a
      semi-structured interview guide. The interview guide will be adjusted during the iterative
      process of interviews and analysis. All interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed
      verbatim. The study will be reported in accordance with the Standards for Reporting
      Qualitative Research (SRQR). Quality and rigour will be aimed for as suggested for
      qualitative research.

      Ethics:

      The Regional Scientific Ethics Committee of the Capital Region will be applied; however, we
      expect a letter of exemption due to Danish laws on educational studies not involving
      patients. Participants will receive oral and written information and will have to give
      informed consent with the continuous option of retracting their consent and participation.
      Personal data will be stored according to Danish Data Protection Law, and will be presented
      anonymously. The study protocol will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

      Participants, setting and time:

      Participants will be purposefully sampled as subject matter experts in terms of VATS
      operating teams in conjunction with individuals. The teams will consist of one or two
      surgeon(s) with VATS experience, one younger assisting surgeon, one anaesthesiologist, one
      nurse anaesthetist, and one to two scrub nurses with experience as both assisting and
      circulating nurse. The individuals will be relevant healthcare professionals of any of the
      above. Participants will come from the four university hospitals performing VATS in Denmark
      in collaboration with head of departments. Each person will only be included in one team
      interview and/or one individual interview. The interviews are planned to be conducted in
      February and March 2016.

      The interview guide:

      The interview guide will be semi-structured with a scripted introduction before each
      interview setting the scene and the topic of the interview. The interview will try to explore
      all four NOTECHS categories, namely leadership &amp; management, teamwork &amp; co-operation,
      problem-solving &amp; decision-making, and situation awareness in a Safety-II perspective,
      focusing on the performance variability of the team members needed in their daily work to
      adapt to situational requirements. Emphasis will be laid on allowing all team members to give
      their perspective in order to explore views of the entire team. The interviews will be
      semi-structured so probe questions will be used when necessary to obtain additional
      information.

      Prior to conducting the interviews, two authors (KG, ASM) will spend a number of hours
      observing VATS procedures in order to become familiar with the procedures and with any
      critical phases of the operations. This, along with input from experienced VATS surgeons
      (RHP, HJH) and an experienced anaesthesiologist (DO), will inform the interview guide. The
      interview guide will be internally reviewed by the authors consisting of surgeons, a scrub
      nurse and an anaesthesiologist that are experienced qualitative and NTS researchers. It will
      be pilot tested on healthcare professionals without specific NTS knowledge to avoid
      misunderstanding and misinterpretation; however, these data will not be included in the
      study.

      Data collection and analysis:

      The interviews will be conducted face-to-face in undisturbed rooms in relation to the
      operating theatre in or just after normal working hours depending on working schedule. The
      participants demographic data will be collected consisting of profession, age, gender, years
      of clinical experience, years and type of experience with laparoscopic or VATS procedures and
      previous experience with NTS training.

      A deductive data analysis strategy will be applied in this study. With the taxonomy of the
      NOTECHS framework we will use directed content analysis to analyse the interviews. Directed
      content analysis can be applied when 'prior research exists about a phenomenon that is
      incomplete/would benefit from further description'. As we approach the topic from a Safety-II
      perspective, focus will be on which behaviours the VATS team members perceive as important in
      insuring that things go right thereby insuring high quality patient care and patient safety.
      Explicitly we will focus on performance variability in their everyday work, categorising them
      as either maintaining/creating, compensating or avoiding.

      The strategy is to use the categories of NOTECHS as well as categories of performance
      variability, when reading the transcribed interviews. The text will then be coded into these
      categories for condensation, adding new ones when extra text of interest is uncovered in
      order to avoid missing important new information that could inform the theory on NTS in VATS
      teams. The text coded will be marked to adhere to one of the categories, introducing new
      categories if needed. The texts will then be paraphrased to condense the interview quotations
      into observable behavioural examples.

      The analyses will be conducted by KG and ASM. The first interviews will be coded by both KG
      and ASM; the coding will be discussed between these two and LS/DO. When agreement is
      satisfactorily, the two authors will split up and code the remaining interviews
      independently. The results of the coding will be discussed with LS/DO and later the full
      group of authors. The analysis will be conducted using NVivo (version 10).
