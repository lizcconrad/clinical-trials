      This is a single-arm, single-institution pilot study that will collect preliminary data to be
      used in the design of a subsequent study to assess whether changes in fDM (Functional
      Diffusion Maps) derived from primary breast cancer diffusion weighted MRI images can serve as
      an early predictor of response to treatment, and whether the magnitude of the change
      correlates with the effectiveness of treatment.

      This trial has a two-step, sequential design, with continuation to the second part of the
      trial being dependent on the positive results in the first part. In Part One of the trial,
      the investigator will compare intrapatient variability in fDM performed at two timepoints
      prior to chemotherapy (chemotherapy will be chosen by the treating physician and will not be
      assigned as part of this study), with the change in fDM before and approximately one week
      after a dose of chemotherapy, to establish that treatment-related changes in fDM will occur
      in this clinical setting. If there are positive results in Part One, then the investigator
      will proceed to the second half of the trial. In Part Two, the investigator will examine
      changes in fDM that occur one week after each type of chemotherapy is administered, which
      will be compared to pathologic response, radiological response, and clinical response.

    <description>Percent change in apparent diffusion coefficient was determined by calculating the percentage change between the value prior to chemotherapy and at 8-11 days post treatment for treatment responders (patients with Complete Response [CR] or Partial Response [PR]) and for the treatment non-responders (patients with Stable Disease [SD] or Progressive Disease [PD]).</description>

    <description>All patients will receive a double baseline diffusion weighted MRI (performed on the same day as the Baseline MRI).
Patients participating in Part I will receive another MRI approximately 1 week (day 8-11) after the first dose of Chemotherapy (chemotherapy will be determined by the treating physician and is not assigned as part of this trial).
Patients participating in Part II will receive a single MRI 1-2 weeks after the first dose of Chemotherapy A (chemotherapy will be determined by the treating physician and is not assigned as part of this trial). A second MRI will be repeated within 2 weeks prior to the start of Chemotherapy B.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a primary measurable, biopsy proven, invasive breast carcinoma with
             the primary tumor intact. The tumor should be staged clinically as T2-T4 (minimum size
             &gt;2.0 cm).

          -  Patients must have a breast tumor that is resectable or potentially resectable
             following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and be willing to undergo resection, if indicated,
             after chemotherapy.

          -  Patients may not have received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for their
             current breast cancer.

          -  Patients may not have had a clip placed into the tumor that is not compatible with
             MRI.

          -  Patients must be deemed eligible for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as assessed by the
             clinical investigator.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             Performance Status: an attempt to quantify cancer patients' general well-being and
             activities of daily life. The score ranges from 0 to 5 where 0 is asymptomatic and 5
             is death.) of 0 - 1.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant or breast-feeding. Patients with reproductive potential
             must consent to the use of effective contraception while on the study.

          -  Patients must have no contraindications to MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) exams.
             Patients who require sedation with general anesthesia to complete an MRI are not
             eligible for the study.

          -  Patients may have no ferrous metal implants or medical devices which would exclude
             MRI.

          -  Patients must be capable of lying flat in an MRI magnet for 30-60 minutes on 4
             occasions.

          -  Weight must be less than 275 pounds.

          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document.
