  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate in vivo the concordance of the imagery system EOS and
      the spiral CT in women having had an obstructed delivery. If this concordance is
      demonstrated, it would allow the use of this new technique of imagery, to realize a
      pelvimetry during the pregnancy less irradiating for the mother, and the fetus.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate in vivo the concordance of the imagery system EOS and
      the spiral CT in women having had an obstructed delivery. If this concordance is
      demonstrated, it would allow the use of this new technique of imagery, to realize a
      pelvimetry during the pregnancy less irradiating for the mother, and the fetus.

      To answer this objective, the study will be a prospective, monocentric, open clinical trial,
      comparing the radio-pelvimetry realized with EOS technique, to the spiral CT. Measures are
      performed in the 3 months following the obstructed delivery.

    <description>The aim of this study is to compare the measures of the basins with two different techniques : the usual one spiral CT technique, and the new one : the EOS technique that is less irradiating than the older one. If these two techniques give the same measures, researchers would be able in the future to use the new technique less invasive for the mother and the fetus, as a routine technique.</description>
