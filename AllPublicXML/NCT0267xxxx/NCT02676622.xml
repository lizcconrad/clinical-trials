  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is an 'auto-immune' disorder of the gut. In this condition the body's own
      immune system is fighting its gut and causing inflammation and other symptoms. Patients who
      are refractory (not responding) to the medications usually used to control Crohn's disease
      (medicines like steroids, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and antibodies like
      Infliximab), may consider being part of this study.

      In this study, the investigators plan to wipe out (ablate) the 'faulty immune system' with
      medicines (immune-ablation) and then give back the patients own stored stem cells (that have
      been collected before) - a procedure called autologous (self) stem cell transplant (ASCT).
      Once the new immune system regrows again from the stem cells, it is hoped that the 'faulty'
      immune cells do not return again and do not fight the gut leading to remission from symptoms
      of Crohn's disease. The aim of this treatment therefore, is to reset or re-program the immune
      system, so that it does not fight the patient's own body.

      Currently, there are very few trials and experience with this procedure in children and young
      adults. There have been a few studies that have shown benefit of ASCT procedure in adult
      patients. In some patients, the benefit lasted for 1-5 years; but 1 in 5 (20%) participants
      were not taking their medications for the Crohn's disease even 5 years after ASCT. Other 80%
      needed medications again, but in most cases with better disease control.

      In order to potentially improve the long term outcomes of ASCT, the investigators are adding
      another medication (in addition to those used in adult studies) called IL-2 (Aldesleukin),
      which will be given as an every-other-day injection under the skin (subcutaneous) at very low
      doses for 6 weeks after the ASCT and can be taken at home. Low dose IL-2 is known to increase
      a type of immune cell called T-regulatory cells (Tregs) that make immune cells less reactive
      to self. Study doctors believe that increased population of Tregs after ASCT may lead to a
      better control of Crohn's disease- higher percentage of cures or disease control for a longer
      period of time compared to the previous adult trials.

      Therefore, the goals of this study are-

        1. To see if ASCT can be used safely and can provide substantial benefit in young adults
           who have refractory Crohn's disease.

        2. To see if addition of IL-2 after the ASCT is safe and effective.

    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) is an immunologically mediated chronic illness that has a relapsing and
      remitting course, most commonly presenting in the 2nd or 3rd decade and causing life long
      impairment of health and quality of life. Mainstay of clinical treatment for severe disease
      is combination of anti-inflammatory agents like 5-aminosalicyaltes and immunosuppressive
      medications like corticosteroids and newer anti-TNF antibodies like Infliximab. None of the
      drugs are, at present, curative and a relevant subset of patients are refractory to many of
      these pharmacologic approaches.

      Immunoablative treatment followed by autologous stem cell rescue (Autologous HSCT) has been
      tried in this refractory group of patients with successful results. Autologous HSCT works in
      this auto-immune setting through the eradication of effector/memory T-cell clones due to a
      direct immuno-ablative effect of drugs used in the preparative regimen; by leading to an
      immune-reset- recovering clones of T- cells from the infused stem cells do not mount an
      auto-immune response and are tolerant to 'self' antigens and, by upregulation of T regulatory
      cells (Treg, CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ or CD8+ FOXP3+) via change in cytokine mileu during transplant.
      Increased population of Tregs restricts the activity of self reactive effector T-cells.

      This pilot study is designed to gain on the success of previously published adult studies of
      autologous HSCT in refractory CD, with the aim to confirm the feasibility, safety and
      efficacy of HSCT and ultra low dose IL-2 when given post-HSCT in pediatric patients and young
      adults. IL-2 in very low doses has been shown to increase the proliferation of Treg
      lymphocytes and decrease inflammatory response. Hence, use of IL-2 post-transplant will
      result in significant and persistent increase in Treg population that may lead to more
      durable remissions after immunoablative therapy.

      This pilot will focus on the 'safety' of this treatment in pediatric population.Since, this
      combination of immuno-ablative therapy followed by ultra low dose IL-2 has not been studied
      in children with CD, therefore transplant related mortality (TRM) and severe toxicity (&gt;
      grade 3 toxicity by NCI criteria) will be monitored for 100 days post-transplant in all the
      patients and stopping rules will be enforced in case of excessive toxicity or TRM (&gt;10%).
      Correlative studies will be performed at specific time points to assess the cytokine and
      inflammatory markers, immune-reconstitution and quantitative Treg cells; while clinical
      assessments will be done for 1 year post-HSCT for disease activity, steroid free remission
      period to evaluate the 'clinical efficacy' of this procedure.

      The major aim of this pilot is to generate the preliminary safety and cytokine profile data
      to confirm the feasibility and benefit of autologous HSCT and IL-2 in children and young
      adults with refractory CD.

             methotrexate and anti-TNF maintenance therapy or clear demonstration of intolerance or
             toxicity to these drugs. Patients who fail induction therapy with corticosteroids and
             anti-TNF therapy, and are therefore not eligible to receive maintenance therapy with
             thiopurines or methotrexate will also be candidates for enrollment.
