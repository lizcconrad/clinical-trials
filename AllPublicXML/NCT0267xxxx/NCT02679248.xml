  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of a nitric oxide supplementation product, Neo40
      Daily®, on blood pressure in pre-hypertensive and mildly hypertensive adults. Subjects will
      take 2 lozenges per day 12 hours apart for 8 weeks. Half of the subjects will receive Neo40
      Daily® and the other half of the subjects will receive placebo.
