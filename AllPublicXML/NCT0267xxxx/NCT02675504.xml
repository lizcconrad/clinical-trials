  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 2000s, the experiences of children and especially their fear during a consultation,
      a treatment or examination is food for thought in our establishment. There is no tool
      validated self-assessment of fear to 6 faces. It therefore appeared necessary to us to create
      this tool. The scale self-assessment of the fear that we have developed consists of six faces
      representing a gradual level of fear: the child can easily describe their level of fear,
      which allows for appropriate care.
