  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a follow-up trial to NYMC 526 (NCT01461837) to assess the safety, efficacy and
      toxicity of administering Defibrotide prophylaxis for high-risk sickle cell patients
      undergoing a familial haploidentical allogeneic stem cell transplantation with CD34
      enrichment and T-cell addback. This patient population historically has a risk of developing
      sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS) and Defibrotide has demonstrated efficacy in treatment
      of SOS.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must demonstrate one or more of the following Sickle Cell Disease
             Complications (or patients in Cohort 2 can meet the criteria in section 4.4 instead)

          -  Clinically significant neurologic event (stroke) or any neurologic deficit lasting &gt;24
             hours that is accompanied by an infarct on cerebral MRI

          -  Minimum of two episodes of acute chest syndrome (defined as new pulmonary alveolar
             consolidation involving at least one complete lung segment associated with acute
             symptoms including fever &gt;38.5, chest pain, tachypnea, intercostal retractions, nasal
             flaring, use of accessory muscles of respiration, wheezing, rales, or cough not
             attributable to asthma or bronchiolitis) in the preceding two year period prior to
             enrollment that have failed, been non-compliant or declined hydroxyurea treatment, or
             prior to chronic RBC transfusion therapy, exchange transfusion or erythrocyte
             pheresis. The acute chest syndrome event occured despite adequate supportive care
             measures (i.e. despite the use of supportive care and interventions including asthma
             therapy and/or hydroxyurea; patients who decline hydroxyurea or non-compliant with
             this therapy are eligible if they meet the other pulmonary criteria defined above for
             inclusion).

          -  Recurrent painful events (at least 3 in the 2 years prior to enrollment or prior to
             chronic chronic RBC transfusion therapy, exchange transfusion or erythrocyte
             pheresis). Pain occurred in typical sites associated with vaso-occlusive painful
             events and cannot be explained by causes other than sickle cell disease. Pain lasted
             at least 2-4 hours and required parenteral narcotic treatment, or an equianalgesic
             dose of oral narcotics or parenteral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These
             painful events may have been treated in any setting; however, the events, including
             events that were managed at home, will be considered for eligibility only if there is
             documentation of the event in a clinical record that may be reviewed by the
             investigator.

          -  Abnormal TCD study requiring starting on chronic transfusion therapy and/or exchange
             transfusions.

          -  At least one silent infarct lesion on a MRI scan of the head. An infarct-like lesion
             is defined as an MRI signal abnormality that is at least 3 mm in one dimension and
             that is visible in two planes on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)
             T2-weighted images, as determined by a neuroradiologist.

             = OR for Cohort #2 ONLY: Patient must be between 21 and 34.99 years of age, patients
             must demonstrate at least two of the following:

          -  WBC &gt; 13,500 cells/microliter at baseline when not acutely ill (on two separate
             occasions) &gt; 2 weeks from a VOC event or hospitalization.

          -  Tricuspid Regurgitant Jet Velocity (TRV) &gt; 3.0 m/s

          -  Requiring Chronic Monthly Transfusions ( &gt; 12 transfusions in the 12 months)

          -  History of sepsis

          -  N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) &gt; 160 ng/L at clinical baseline
             when not acutely ill or hospitalized.

          -  all patients must meet disease, age, organ function and donor criteria;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant or breast-feeding are not eligible

          -  SCD Patients with documented uncontrolled infection at the time of study entry are not
             eligible.

          -  SCD patients who have an unaffected HLA matched family donor willing to proceed to
             donation will not be eligible for this study.

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky (age appropriate) Performance Score &lt;50% (hemiplegia alone
             secondary to a previous stroke is not an exclusion)

          -  Demonstrated lack of compliance with medical care.

          -  Patients with clinically significant fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver will not be
             eligible.

          -  Patients who have previously received a HSCT will not be eligible.

          -  Patients with contraindications to the use of defibrotide
