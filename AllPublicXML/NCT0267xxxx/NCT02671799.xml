      This trial is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm First-In-Man Continuation study to
      evaluate safety and efficacy of the VenTouch System for treatment of subjects with functional
      MR enrolling up to 15 subjects who have been diagnosed with Grade 3-4 functional mitral valve
      regurgitation. The duration of the study follow-up is 36 months from the time of therapy
      adjustment. Data from this trial may be utilized in support of a CE study in Europe and/or a
      pilot IDE study in the U.S. Follow-up testing will be performed at 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months, and 12, 24, and 36 months post-therapy adjustment.

    <description>The VenTouch System is intended for use in the treatment of functional MR (FMR) in adults who are symptomatic despite optimal medical management. It is intended for subjects with FMR with essentially normal leaflet anatomy and motion, with mitral valve regurgitation attributable mainly to annular dilatation with or without papillary muscle displacement. It is not intended to treat structural defects/degeneration of the mitral valve. The VenTouch System is used to reshape the base of the heart to bring the mitral valve leaflets into better coaptation. By doing so, it brings the mitral valve leaflets closer, allowing proper closure of the valve, and reducing or eliminating MR. There is provision of support to the ventricular myocardium below the annulus as well as the annulus, so the VenTouch System may allow long-term ventricular remodeling with positive impact on the functionality of the mitral valve.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults ≥18 years of age

          2. Symptomatic FMR of grade moderately severe to severe (3 to 4) with structurally normal
             leaflets (preferably with echocardiographic evidence of EROA&gt; 0.20 cm2)

          3. NYHA Class II to IV

          4. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) 20%-50%

          5. Treatment with optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure for at
             least 30 days. Subjects must be receiving a beta blocker for 3 months and an ACE-I or
             ARB for one month unless, in the investigator's opinion, the subject is intolerant to
             beta blockers, ACE-I or ARB. Beta blockers and ACE-I (or ARB) doses should be stable
             for one month prior to study entry. Stable is defined as no more than a 100% increase
             or a 50% decrease in dose.

          6. Subjects with a Class I indication for CRT implant according to current guidelines
             should have CRT implant prior to entry into the study. Subjects who have existing CRT
             implants may be included in the study if the implant has been in place for at least 90
