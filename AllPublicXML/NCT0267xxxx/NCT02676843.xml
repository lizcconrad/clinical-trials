  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the ability of a new PET tracer, 18F-AV-1451, to detect
      depositions of a protein, called tau, in the brains of people with a mutation in the tau gene
      that causes deposition of the protein, and in people without the mutation. A single
      18F-AV-1451 scan will be performed on control subjects without MAPT mutations, presymptomatic
      mutation carriers, and symptomatic mutation carriers.
