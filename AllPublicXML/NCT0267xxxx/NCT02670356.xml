      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are omega-3 fatty acids found in
      fish oil and in krill oil. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of the
      recommended dose of a fish oil supplement (Omax3 4:1 EPA:DHA; recommended daily dose 1650 mg
      - totaling 1500 mg EPA+DHA) and a krill oil supplement (MegaRed; recommended daily dose 300
      mg - totaling 74 mg EPA+DHA) on omega-3 index, plasma biomarkers of inflammation and
      inflammatory cell activation, and plasma lipid levels in subjects with metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases including
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. There has been some evidence that fish oil,
      containing the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid
      (DHA), reduces the risk or severity of these diseases, leading several government and health
      organizations to advocate an increased consumption of fish or fish oil. Fish oil contains EPA
      and DHA either as triglycerides or as ethyl esters. Recently, krill oil has gained popularity
      as an EPA and DHA supplement. Krill oil contains EPA and DHA in phospholipid, triglyceride,
      and free fatty acid form.

      Some studies have shown that the bioavailability of EPA and DHA in krill oil is higher than
      in fish oil and that smaller doses of krill oil are therefore sufficient to observe a
      significant effect on the desired outcome (inflammation, plasma lipid levels).

      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the dose of the EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty
      acids is more important than their bioavailability in effecting changes in systemic
      inflammation and lipid metabolism.
