  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1b/2 study is an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of oral AG-120 + Subcutaneous (SC) azacitidine and oral AG-221 + SC azacitidine
      in subjects with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH1 or an IDH2 mutation, respectively. The
      study population consists of subjects who are not candidates to receive intensive Inductive
      chemotherapy (IC). The study comprises a Phase 1b dose-finding and AG-120 expansion stage and
      a Phase 2 randomized stage.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was redesigned to expand the number of patients analyzed during the Phase 1b stage
      of the study to determine a safe and effective dose of AG-120 administered with azacitidine
      for future studies.

      The Phase 1b (AG-120 expansion) stage will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical
      activity of oral AG-120 when administered with Subcutaneous azacitidine.

      The Phase 2 stage of the study will no longer include AG-120 administered with azacitidine
      (IDH1 subjects) and IDH1 patients will not longer be included in the azacitidine alone arm.
