        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Aged ≥ 18 years or older at time of screening

          -  Has moderate to severe glabellar frown lines at maximum frown (severity score of 2 or
             3 on FWS) as determined by in-clinic assessments by both the investigator and the
             subject(where: 0= 'none', 1= 'mild', 2= 'moderate', 3= 'severe').

               -  18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any medical condition that may place the subject at increased risk due to exposure to
             botulinum toxin, including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton Lambert syndrome,
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, profound atrophy or weakness in the target muscles, or
             any other condition (at the investigator's discretion) that might interfere with
             neuromuscular function or contraindicate botulinum toxin therapy.

          -  Previous treatment with any serotype of botulinum toxin for any indication within the
             12 months prior to screening, or any planned treatment with botulinum toxin of any
             serotype for any reason during the trial (other than the investigational treatment).

          -  Active skin disease/infection or irritation at the treatment area

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the trial.
