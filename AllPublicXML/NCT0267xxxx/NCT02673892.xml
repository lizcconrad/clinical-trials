    <textblock>
      Improving the patient experience has become a major focus of quality improvement efforts in
      Ontario and in health systems worldwide. However, our existing knowledge base is relatively
      under-developed, particularly in how patients experience care as they transition from one
      care setting to another and the relationship between patient experience and clinical
      outcomes. The Patient Oriented Discharge Summary (PODS) is a discharge instruction tool
      created by patients, caregivers, health-care providers and design experts. It provides a
      written template for providers to engage patients and caregivers when reviewing important
      instructions on medications, activity and diet restrictions, follow-up appointments and
      worrisome symptoms warranting emergency care following admission to hospital. The PODS also
      uses plain and simple wording, large fonts, pictograms, and includes white space for patients
      to take notes and provides the option for translation of major headings into the most common
      spoken languages. The PODS impact study will study the impact of using the PODS versus usual
      discharge instructions on patient experience and health outcomes in a provincial-wide
      randomized study across acute care and rehabilitation hospitals.

      Full Title:

      The impact of a patient-centered discharge summary (PODS) on patient experience and health
      outcomes following discharge: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.

      Short Title: PODS Impact Study Primary Objective: To evaluate the impact of a
      patient-centered discharge instruction tool on patient experience following hospital
      discharge.

      Primary Outcome Measures: Patient experience within 72 hours following discharge from
      hospital. This will be a binary composite of the proportion of patients who scored Yes or
      &quot;Completely/Quite a Bit&quot; to 4 out of 6 of the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI)
      Patient Experience In-Patient Survey on transitions of care.

      Secondary Objectives: 1) Evaluate the impact of a patient-centered discharge instruction tool
      on health outcomes following hospital discharge. 2) Identify the level of patient and system
      engagement needed when providing discharge instructions and patient-specific characteristics
      that might impact the use and effectiveness of discharge instructions.

      Secondary Outcome Measures: Self-reported adherence to medications, diet and activity
      restrictions, and scheduled visits with primary care physician and/or specialist at 30 days
      following discharge, and a composite of unscheduled visits to primary care physician,
      emergency room, readmission to hospital or death at 30 days and 3 months following discharge.

      Study Design: The study will use a mixed methods approach with a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) and qualitative study.

      Inclusion Criteria: All patients (&gt;=18 years) admitted to inpatient units at University
      Health Network (UHN) (and other participating hospitals in Ontario) with a primary diagnosis
      of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, stroke, congestive heart failure, post
      hip and knee replacement will be recruited for randomization to receive the PODS versus
      standard of discharge care. These diseases were chosen to align with the Ministry of Health
      and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) quality based procedures.

      Exclusion Criteria: Patients who are being discharged to another facility rather than home,
      who have a prognosis of less than 3 months, who do not have a telephone for post-discharge
      follow-up or with cognitive impairment or significant language barrier for whom a family
      member or professional interpreter is not available will be excluded from the study.

      Intervention: The patient-oriented discharge summary (PODS) is a discharge instruction tool
      co-created with patients which provides a written template for providers to engage patients
      and caregivers when reviewing discharge instructions on medications, activity and diet
      restrictions, follow-up appointments or outstanding investigations and worrisome symptoms
      warranting emergency care (Appendix A). The PODS also uses plain and simple wording, large
      fonts, pictograms, and includes white space for patients to take notes and provides the
      option for translation of major headings into the most common spoken languages. As this will
      be a pragmatic design, we may make modifications to the process involved in completing the
      PODS, such as using pre-filled disease-specific information, if system processes and
      providers involved deem it more usable and feasible.

      Sample Size: We estimate that we will require at minimum 199 and at maximum 388 patients in
      each study arm if we want to detect a 10% minimum improvement in patient experience scores.
      Currently, we have study centers that would like to participate in Toronto, Ottawa and
      Thunder Bay.

      Accrual Period: Enrollment for this study will begin once ethics approval is obtained and
      continue until 776 patients have been enrolled (in total across all participating sites).

      Study Duration: The study is expected to run between December 1, 2015 and March 31, 2018
      (approximately 3 years) following research ethics board (REB) approval. This will allow for a
      year of study enrollment across participating sites until sample size is achieved as well as
      3 months of follow-up for primary and secondary endpoints and a year for data analysis and
      manuscript preparation.

    <description>The PODS intervention is administered during the discharge process which includes discharge teaching. In the acute settings, discharge teaching is provided by a nurse navigator, resident physician, or other members of the care team. In the rehabilitation setting, discharge teaching is provided by a multi-disciplinary team. PODS is used as a useful add-on to the usual discharge teaching process. The PODS form used during the study will be a fillable pdf. Members of the healthcare team will fill it out electronically, then print it out and give the paper to the patient. After the discharge teaching is finished, patients take the completed PODS home with them as a post-discharge reference and guide.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will receive usual discharge care. At UHN, this involves receiving a discharge summary with information pertaining to hospital course including investigations performed and medications used, as well as follow-up care suggested. It is intended to be, unlike PODS, a document for the primary care physician seeing the patient after discharge to refer to. As to discharge instructions provided for the patient, there is no standard procedure and sometimes follow-up instructions are included for the patient. Patient education may or may not be provided to the patient verbally by their nurse, resident, physician, or pharmacist. Moreover, follow-up with the primary care physician may be set up prior to or following discharge with the nurse navigator.</description>
