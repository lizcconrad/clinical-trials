    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, and single blinded study. All work performed
      at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a tertiary care and level one trauma center for the
      state of New Hampshire with 28 operative suites. 100 patients scheduled to undergo
      thoracotomies are randomized to receive an epidural placed (for postoperative pain control)
      using either a traditional approach by feeling the spine for landmarks or using fluoroscopic
      X-ray guidance. Randomization is blinded to both the anesthesia team caring for the patient
      in the operating room and to one member of the acute pain team who follows the patient after
      surgery and is responsible for evaluating post operative pain control (dermatomal
      distribution of sensory blockade and visual analog scale) and pulmonary function (incentive
      spirometer use). All patients receive a standardized epidural infusion with local anesthetic
      and additional pain medications as needed.

      All epidurals catheters are placed by the Acute Pain Service in the preoperative period in an
      operating room equipped for fluoroscopy. Patients will have been previously randomized
      (following written informed consent) to either standard placement of epidural catheters or
      fluoroscopically-guided placement.

      Standard placement (Comparator): According to usual practice, epidurals placed using the
      standard technique will be placed in the sitting position using a 'loss of resistance'
      technique. This technique involves approximation of the T7 vertebral body through palpation
      of the distal aspect of the scapula and identification of midline through palpation of the
      spinous processes. The skin is then anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine and an 18 gauge Tuohy
      needle is inserted until there is engagement with the supraspinous and interspinous
      ligaments. A glass syringe filled with saline and air is then attached to the Tuohy needle,
      which is slowly advanced until the epidural space is identified with loss of resistance to
      injection in the glass syringe. The glass syringe is then detached from the Tuohy needle and
      the epidural catheter is threaded approximately 3-4 cm into the epidural space. The catheter
      will then be aspirated using a 3ml syringe to confirm that it has not been place in the
      intravascular or intrathecal space. Five ml of radiopaque dye (omnipaque) will be injected
      and a single image taken and stored on disc but not read by a clinician. A test dose of 3ml
      of 1.5% Lidocaine with epinephrine will then be injected to ensure that the catheter is not
      intravascular.

      Fluoroscopically guided epidural placement (Experimental): Patients will be placed in the
      prone position. Identification of an appropriate interspace (T7-T12) and midline orientation
      will be accomplished using fluoroscopic guidance. The skin will then be anesthetized and the
      epidural space identified using the loss of resistance as described above. Fluoroscopy will
      be used during identification of the epidural space to confirm midline orientation during
      advancement of the Tuohy needle. Once the epidural space is identified, the epidural catheter
      will be advanced to the T4 level. The catheter will then be aspirated as above. 5cc of
      Omnipaque will be injected into the catheter with anterior-posterior and lateral imaging to
      ensure expected spread of the dye as confirmation of correct placement in the epidural space.
      The catheter will then be bolused with 3cc of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine to ensure that
      the catheters are not placed intravascularly.

      Following epidural placement via either technique, patients will then be transferred to the
      surgical operating room where an infusion of 1/8% Bupivicaine will be started at a rate of
      4ml/hr. This epidural infusion will continue throughout the case. Titration of this infusion
      will be guided by clinical judgment of the primary anesthesia team in the operating room
      between the range of 0-14 ml/hr with primary assessments including the patient's analgesic
      requirement and hemodynamic stability.

      Intraoperative period: A standardized anesthesia induction and maintenance protocol will be
      used. This protocol will include sedation with 2mg of midazolam and fentanyl (1-2mcg/kg) for
      epidural placement, 2-3 Î¼g/kg fentanyl prior to induction, 2-2.5mg/kg propofol on induction
      and isoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia. Additional narcotic administration is at the
      discretion of the primary anesthesia team but recommended for patients up to their daily
      opiate dose, plus an additional 0.1mg/kg morphine at or before emergence. Ketorolac 15mg may
      be administered as clinically indicated unless contraindications such as age &gt;75, renal
      insufficiency (gfr &lt;60) or surgeon preference. In addition, 4mg dexamethasone will be
      administered on induction. Nitrous oxide and ketamine will not be used. Hemodynamic
      monitoring will be accomplished with standard monitors, an arterial line placed by the
      primary anesthesia team, and, if indicated, noninvasive cardiac outcome monitors. The
      arterial line will be placed according to the preference of the primary anesthesia team.

      Postoperative period: Post operative pain management will be dictated by the primary surgical
      service. Typical management includes patient-controlled analgesia of IV morphine, fentanyl or
      hydromorphone with transition to oral medications as indicated on post operative day one.
      Titration of the epidural between the 4cc/hr up to a maximum of 14cc/hr will be made based
      upon a specific protocol for inadequate pain relief. The epidural will be bolused with 4cc
      from the standard solution and then the rate of the infusion will be increased by 2cc/hr if
      and when a patient requires better analgesia. If the epidural is deemed non functioning by
      the supervising attending on the pain service, as evidence by a lack of sensory blockade in
      the distribution of the incision and patient discomfort, then it is at the discretion of the
      acute pain service attending to remove or replace the non-functional epidural.

          <description>Real-time fluoroscopic X-ray guidance to confirm placement of an epidural catheter Following epidural catheter placement, 1/8% bupivacaine is infused at 4ml/hr during and after surgery for pain control.
Fluoroscopy: Device: Fluoroscopy Patients lie prone on X-ray compatible operating table and an X-ray device obtains X-ray images of epidural catheter placement. An epidural catheter is placed with local anesthesia as a needle that is advanced into the epidural space. A catheter is then placed through the needle to the desired location and the needle is removed. After the catheter is placed, a test dose of 1.5% lidocaine with 5ug/cc epinephrine is injected into the catheter to exclude intravascular placement. Following this, a continuous infusion of 1/8% bupivacaine is started at 4ml/hr. After surgery, the bupivacaine infusion may be adjusted with bolus injections of 2ml and/or increase in the infusion rate by 2ml/hr up to a maximum of 14ml/hr</description>

          <description>The traditional approach for placement of an epidural catheter is used with indirect indicators of placement.
Following epidural catheter placement, 1/8% bupivacaine is infused at 4ml/hr during and after surgery for pain control.
Traditional: An epidural catheter is placed before surgery with the patient sitting at bedside. The catheter is placed with local anesthesia using indirect indicators of proper placement: depth of needle insertion and ability to inject solution through the needle ('loss of resistance'). After needle placement, an epidural catheter is threaded through the needle and the needle removed. After catheter is placement, a test dose of 1.5% lidocaine with 5ug/cc epinephrine is injected into the catheter to exclude intravascular placement. Following this, a continuous infusion of 1/8% bupivacaine is started at 4ml/hr. After surgery, the bupivacaine infusion may be adjusted with bolus injections of 2ml and/or increase in the infusion rate by 2ml/hr .</description>
