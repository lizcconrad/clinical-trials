  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a writing
      intervention (Reclaiming Yourself), intended to facilitate bereavement for spousal caregivers
      whose partners died with dementia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current research is part 3 of a multi-phase project, whose purpose was to examine the
      experience of bereavement for spousal caregivers to persons with dementia. Based on spouses'
      shared experiences and the input of experts in the field (i.e. bereavement/dementia
      researchers, health care providers), an existing writing intervention called the Finding
      Balance tool was adapted from the context of cancer bereavement to that of dementia.

      The purpose of this third phase is to test this adapted writing intervention (Reclaiming
      Yourself) with bereaved spouses of persons with dementia. Participants will be randomly
      assigned into one of two groups: treatment (who will receive the tool); and control (who will
      not be offered the tool until a later stage). The feasibility and acceptability of the
      intervention will be assessed, as well as the degree to which it facilitated participants'
      bereavement, ability to find balance, and psychological health.
