    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of appropriate postoperative sedation with
      dexmedetomidine for patients after abdominal surgeries.Prospective randomised controlled
      study was conducted among patients after abdominal surgeries began in October 2015.The
      investigators enroll patients who received abdominal surgeries. One group receive sedative
      along with analgesic and the other group analgesic only for the other group on the first 24
      hours after surgeries and will follow up for 3 days.
