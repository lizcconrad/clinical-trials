  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occupation of firefighting is considered to be one of the most dangerous occupations in
      the United States (U.S.). As such, a high prevalence of musculoskeletal injuries (MSKIs) have
      been observed among the firefighter population. This high rate of MSKI has created an
      extremely large financial impact on fire departments across the United States. Therefore,
      interest in developing methods of identifying those at risk for developing a future MSKI and
      interventions designed to prevent these MSKIs from happening has grown among both the
      firefighter population, as well as among researchers and practitioners.

      Previous research has demonstrated relationships between MSKI and altered movement patterns.
      In addition, researchers have started to demonstrate the ability of functional movement
      assessments to predict future MSKI in various populations, including firefighters. Two of
      these functional movement assessments include the Functional Movement Screen (FMS) and the
      Movement Efficiency (ME) Test, which is a component of the Fusionetics Human Performance
      System. These assessments both quantify the overall functional movement quality of an
      individual by creating a composite movement score (i.e., Total FMS &amp; Average ME Test scores,
      respectively).

      In addition, various theoretical models of corrective exercise programming have been
      proposed. These programs are designed to restore optimal neuromuscular control and correct
      any identified neuromuscular imbalances observed during the movement assessment through the
      use of simple and easy-to-follow exercises. The Fusionetics Human Performance System utilizes
      one such model, with the goal of improving the functional movement quality of an individual
      by correcting the aforementioned neuromuscular deficiencies observed during the ME Test.
      Based on this framework, these corrective exercise programs theoretically lower the risk of
      MSKI of the individual as well.

      However, there is currently a lack of research in the literature examining the influence of
      corrective exercise programming on functional movement quality among the active-duty
      firefighter population. As such, it remains unknown if a corrective exercise intervention is
      capable of significantly improving functional movement quality among active-duty
      firefighters. In addition, recent research suggests that various health and fitness measures
      are associated with functional movement quality. These measures include total body power
      output, lower extremity muscular strength, and core muscular endurance. As such, an
      examination of the influence of a corrective exercise intervention on measures of health and
      fitness among active-duty firefighters is warranted.
