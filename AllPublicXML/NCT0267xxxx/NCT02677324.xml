  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for relapsed or
      refractory Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM). This study is using the study intervention
      ABT-199.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. ABT-199 is a pill that blocks BCL-2, a
      protein that is important for the survival of WM cells.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how well the study drug works and the
      safety of ABT-199 as a single agent in participants with WM that has come back or has shown
      no response to previous treatment.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ABT-199 as a treatment for
      any disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinicopathological diagnosis of Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia and meeting criteria
             for treatment using consensus panel criteria from the Second International Workshop on
             Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (Owen 2003; Kyle 2003).

          -  Measurable disease, defined as presence of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) with a minimum
             IgM level of &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal of each institution is required.

          -  Have received at least one prior therapy for WM.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (see Appendix A).
