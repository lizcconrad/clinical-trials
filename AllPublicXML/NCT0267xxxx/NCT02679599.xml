  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation patients often fail to exercise as prescribed on days they are not
      attending rehabilitation and there is a steep drop off in exercise following rehabilitation
      completion. Moreover, little is known about the amount of time that cardiac rehabilitation
      patients spend in sedentary behavior, which is associated with increased risk of
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, independent of time spent in exercise. This pilot
      study aims to test acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of a smartphone
      application (B-MOBILE-CARDIAC) for increasing time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity
      physical activity accumulated in bouts of at least 10 minutes in duration (i.e. bout-related
      MVPA) and decrease time spent in sedentary behavior. Up to 32 patients will be recruited,
      enrolled, and randomized during the first 2 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation to either: 1)
      B-MOBILE-CARDIAC plus cardiac rehabilitation or 2) cardiac rehabilitation alone. Participants
      will complete 7 days of objective activity monitoring to measure daily minutes spent in
      bout-related MVPA and sedentary behavior (primary outcomes) at baseline, mid-rehabilitation
      (6 weeks), end of cardiac rehabilitation (12 weeks), and 4-week follow-up (16 weeks). At
      these same time points, participants will complete questionnaires assessing sedentary
      behavior, MVPA, exercise tolerance, health-related quality of life, mood, and affect. At
      baseline and end of cardiac rehabilitation participants will undergo a blood draw to measure
      cardiometabolic and inflammatory risk factors and complete a test of cognitive functioning.
      Feasibility and acceptability of the B-MOBILE-CARDIAC application will be assessed at the
      4-week follow-up.
