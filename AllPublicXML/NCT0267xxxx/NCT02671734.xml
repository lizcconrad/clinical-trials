      The investigators employed a randomized control study design to evaluate the efficacy of a
      video intervention augmenting IC discussions in improving parental and youth IC
      comprehension. Sample size was selected to detect a 30% improvement in comprehension scores
      in the intervention v. control group. The local Institutional Review Board approved the
      study. Informed consent and assent were obtained prior to all study procedures.
