    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, pre-post intervention study to evaluate the effect of a
      high-intensity, aerobic exercise program on outcomes of cognition, mood, gait, balance,
      cardiorespiratory fitness, neuromuscular performance, fatigue, sleep, and quality of life for
      patients diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson disease. The primary outcomes will be a
      composite measure of cognitive function and the Timed Up and Go (TUG).

      All subjects will be assigned to aerobic exercise that will use a blend of both unsupervised
      moderate and supervised high intensity exercise. The exercise will consist of walking /
      jogging modalities, dependent on the individual's level of bradykinesia and will be paced by
      the individual's level of perceived exertion. The exercise protocol will be designed to
      target an accumulation of at least 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week.

      Exercise training will be performed 5x/week for a total of 16 weeks. The training will
      consist of 3 supervised high intensity sessions and 2 at home moderate intensity exercise
      sessions. The high intensity sessions will be performed on a treadmill at an intensity rating
      of ~ 15 and 17 on a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale of 6 to 20. The moderate
      intensity exercise will target an RPE of ~10 - 12 and participants will be asked to complete
      this on their own.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with idiopathic PD as determined by United Kingdom Brain Bank Criteria. This
             includes the presence of bradykinesia with one or both of the following: rest tremor
             and/or rigidity

          -  Asymmetric onset of PD and progressive motor symptoms.

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or 3.

          -  Poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score of &gt;5)

          -  Stable dopaminergic medication regimen for 4 weeks prior to baseline visit with no
             anticipated changes for the duration of the study.

          -  Stable doses of medications known to affect sleep and medications for Parkinson's
             Disease for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry without anticipation of medication
             change for the duration of the study.

          -  Ability to complete exercise intervention and assessment visits during at least 16
             weeks of intervention (3x/week for 16 weeks) and at 32 weeks.

          -  Must pass a physical examination to assess exercise readiness.

          -  Women of childbearing potential may enroll but must use a reliable measure of
             contraception and have a negative serum pregnancy test at the screening visit.

          -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment score ≥ 18 and ≤26.

          -  Parkinson's disease - Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) as defined by impaired
             performance on 2 tests in the cognitive battery (at least one test in two cognitive
             domains or two tests in one cognitive domain.)

          -  Ability to pass a Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire to assess exercise
             readiness.
