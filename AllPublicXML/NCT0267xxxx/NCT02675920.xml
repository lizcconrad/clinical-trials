  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare sensitivity for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) of
      bi-annual ultrasonography and low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in patients at high risk of
      HCC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients at high risk of HCC are recommended to undergo biannual surveillance using
      ultrasound. In this study, LDCT is performed in addition to biannual ultrasound surveillance
      in eligible patients to compare their sensitivity for HCC. Standard of reference would be
      follow-up imaging and/or gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI.
