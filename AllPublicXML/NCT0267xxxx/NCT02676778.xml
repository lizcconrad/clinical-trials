      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of E7777 in
      participants with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) and cutaneous
      T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open label, Phase 2 to evaluate efficacy, safety,
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of E7777 in participants with relapsed or refractory PTCL
      and CTCL.
