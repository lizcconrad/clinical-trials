  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment (such as memory problems) due to cancer and its treatment can interfere
      with quality of life and can linger long after treatment has ended, yet research examining
      cognitive rehabilitation approaches has produced limited clinical benefit. The proposed study
      will provide information about systematic light exposure for the treatment of cognitive
      impairment in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) survivors and will investigate how it
      works. This study would facilitate the development of this potential treatment, giving health
      care providers and cancer survivors a much-needed tool to help with cancer-related cognitive
      impairment.
