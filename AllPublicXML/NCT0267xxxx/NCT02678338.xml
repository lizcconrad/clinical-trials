      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of anti-cluster of differentiation
      (CD)47 monoclonal antibody Hu5F9-G4 in treating patients with haematological malignancies
      including acute myeloid leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed)
      or has not responded to previous treatment (refractory), or high risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody Hu5F9-G4, block cancer
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.
