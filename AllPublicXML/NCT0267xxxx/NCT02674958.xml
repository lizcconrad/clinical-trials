  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin at doses used during acute myocardial infarction may inhibit the mobilization of
      endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin has been shown to lower the number of EPCs in a time- and concentration-dependent
      manner. In vitro studies also show that aspirin may reduce the migratory and adhesive
      capacity of isolated EPCs, inhibit iNOS and tubule formation, which are pre-requisites for
      angiogenesis. This is relevant when patients are given a loading dose of 325mg at the time of
      diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction where higher numbers of EPCs have been associated
      with better outcomes. Furthermore, in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes)
      trial, high dose aspirin appeared to counteract the beneficial effect seen when ticagrelor or
      clopidogrel was used with low doses of aspirin in acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

      As aspirin is currently standard of care in the management of ACS, it is difficult to conduct
      a study of the effect of aspirin versus placebo in that scenario. However, during alcohol
      septal ablation for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, the indication for an
      antiplatelet agent is not well defined and varies between operators. When a small amount of
      myocardium is deliberately destroyed in this process, it serves as an ideal model to study
      the effect of aspirin on the biology of EPCs in vivo. This could provide an explanation to
      the different effects of high versus low dose aspirin when combined with a second
      antiplatelet agent in the management of ACS.
