      This research trial studies skin/soft tissue elasticity in head and neck cancer survivors
      with lymphedema and fibrosis. Lymphedema and fibrosis is a common effect of head and neck
      cancer which may lead to skin tightness, pain, and body image issues. Early detection of
      lymphedema and fibrosis may help reduce serious functional loss of the neck. Shear wave
      elastography is a technique that provides a quantitative measure of stiffness using a push
      pulse to generate shear waves within the tissues. Conventional imaging techniques are then
      used to monitor the shear waves generated through the tissue to calculate the shear wave
      speed. Shear wave elastography may help obtain an early and accurate measurement of tissue
      elasticity in head and neck cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain pilot data of the elasticity of skin/soft tissues using shear wave elasticity at
      the defined anatomical sites in head and neck cancer survivors with lymphedema and fibrosis
      (LEF).

      II. To explore the correlation between elasticity of skin/soft tissues and the following: 1)
      symptoms as measured by the Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey-Head and Neck
      (LSIDS-HN); 2) functional impact as measured by Cervical Range of Motion Device and the
      Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey; and 3) physical exam findings as measured by Head
      and Neck LEF Grading Criteria.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be evaluated for LEF status using the Head and Neck External Lymphedema -
      Fibrosis (HN-LEF) Grading Criteria and neck range of motion using the Cervical Range of
      Motion Device. Participants also complete study questionnaires, including Vanderbilt Head and
      Neck Symptom Survey (VHNSS) and Lymphedema Symptom Intensity and Distress Survey - Head and
      Neck (LSIDS-H&amp;N). Participants undergo ultrasound shear wave elastography over 20-25 minutes.
      Participants' cancer disease and treatment information will be gathered from their medical
      records.

    <description>Descriptive statistics will be used to describe data from elasticity measure. Of particular interest will be the measures of central tendency and variability at the multiple sites. Sites with higher variability (coefficient of variation) that others may be indicative of less reliable assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 2 weeks of initial study visit</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation coefficients will be used to assess the strength of the associations of the elasticity values with the respective LEF grades (HN-LEF) for the respective sites. Those values will also be correlated with Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey and HN-LSIDS symptom and Cervical Range of Motion scores. Due to the large number of correlations proposed in this study, effect sizes (strength of the associations) and clinically significant patterns will be of much greater importance than statistical significance.</description>
