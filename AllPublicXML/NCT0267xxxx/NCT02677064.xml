  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to assess the percentage of patients
      receiving stem cell transplantation for the type of blood cancer you have. They want to know
      how many patients get a transplant and why some patients do get a transplant while others do
      not. Also they want to explore why some patients elect not to undergo stem cell
      transplantation, when it is recommended by their physicians.

    <description>Thus, a prospective observational study in which all newly diagnosed or newly relapsed acute leukemia patients would be registered close to the beginning of induction or re-induction therapy would allow us to follow patients throughout their journey and identify prospectively the reasons why patients did not proceed to HCT when deemed appropriate and eligible.</description>
