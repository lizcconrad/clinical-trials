    <textblock>
      A feasibility study for assessing and recording myoelectric activity in patients for early
      detection of a post-operative ileus (POI) in patients who undergo gastrointestinal surgery
      and differentiating the myoelectric signals from those who have normal post-operative return
      of GI function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group 1: Up to 100 subjects may be consented prior to surgery who are planned to undergo
      gastrointestinal surgery or a planned surgery that does not involve the abdominal cavity. The
      post-operative course will be assessed for both clinical symptoms and for myoelectric
      activity for return to normal GI function or the development of a POI in both populations.

      Group 2: Up to 50 subjects who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery or surgery not
      involving the abdominal cavity may be consented post-operatively during their hospital stay
      for this study.
