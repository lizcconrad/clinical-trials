  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and food effect of
      DS102 (up to 2000mg single and multiple daily doses) and placebo in healthy participants.

      DS102 capsules will be orally administered for up to 4 weeks, and will be compared against
      placebo.

      The study will enrol approximately 56 adult subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 7 cohorts enrolled, each consisting of 8 subjects.

      Cohorts 1 - 4 will be orally administered up to 2000mg single doses of DS102 on Day 1.

      Cohorts 5 - 7 will be orally administered up to 2000mg multiple daily doses of DS102 for 28
      days.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety and plasma pharmacokinetics of single and
      multiple daily oral doses of DS102.
