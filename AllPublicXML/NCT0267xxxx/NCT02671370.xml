  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study there are any associations between objective and subjective outcome measures,
      measuring the cervical range of motion and if the restriction matter to the patient.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective and subjective outcome measures are frequently used assessments in clinical
      practice.

      The investigators will use different subjective and objective outcome measures to evaluate
      any possible associations, as well as to investigate if restrictions of movement matters to
      patients.

      Additionally to the assessments tools the investigators will use interviews to extend the
      scope.
