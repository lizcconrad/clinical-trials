  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gliomas, especially high grade gliomas and diffuse low grade gliomas, are characterized by
      their infiltrative nature. Recently, a new conception of supratotal resection has been
      proposed. Given the lack of prospective supporting data, the correlation between supratotal
      resection and the survival of patients with glioma need to be established.

      Therefore, the investigators aim to do a single center prospective randomized controlled
      clinical trial to assess the effect of supratotal resection at least 1 cm beyond the MR
      imaging-defined abnormalities on progression-free survival (PFS) of glioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been demonstrated that an extensive resection (total or subtotal) significantly
      increases the overall survival in patients with gliomas. Yet, recent data have shown that
      conventional MR imaging underestimates the spatial extent of gliomas, since tumor cells were
      found to invade beyond MR imaging abnormalities. Thus, it is hypothesized that an extended
      resection with a margin beyond MR imaging-defined abnormalities—a &quot;supratotal&quot;
      resection—might improve the outcome of gliomas. However, the exact extent of supratotal
      resection remains unclear. Unnecessary removal of brain tissue that does not contain cancer
      cells can lead to neurological deficits that affect quality of life, such as impaired
      cognition, memory, and vision. Recently, studies from human specimens have shown that
      infiltrating glioma cells spread about 1cm beyond the gross and radiographic margins of the
      tumor. The investigators thereof propose to perform extended resection at least 1cm beyond
      the MRI defined margin might improve the outcome of patients with gliomas.
