      The main objective of this study is to compare subject's compliance and satisfaction for two
      modes of treatment of toenails infection (Onychomycosis) with Loceryl Nail Lacquer (Loceryl
      NL) and Ciclopirox Nail Lacquer (Ciclopirox NL).

      A total of 20 subjects are to be included in 1 site in Germany.

      Methodology:

      Subjects will receive the following treatments on the right or left toenails:

        -  Loceryl Nail Lacquer to be applied once weekly for 12 weeks on all affected toenails of
           one foot.

        -  Ciclopirox Nail Lacquer to be applied once daily for 12 weeks on all affected toenails
           of the opposite foot.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with clinically Distal and Lateral Subungual Onychomycosis (DLSO) due to
             dermatophytes and/or yeast (including Candida) on at least one toenail of each foot at
             screening visit,

          -  Subject with less than 80% of the nail surface area with disease involvement and
             without matrix involvement, no dermatophytoma, streaks (spikes) or subungual
             hyperkeratosis &gt; 2mm,

          -  Subjects with positive mycological results (direct microscopy and culture) for
             dermatophytes and/or yeasts (including Candida) at baseline,

          -  Subjects with same number of affected toenails on both feet or no more than one
             additional affected toenail on one of the feet,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with a surgical, medical condition or clinically important abnormal physical
             findings, which, in the judgement of the investigator, might interfere with
             interpretation of the objectives of the study (i.e. lack of autonomy),

          -  Subjects with post-traumatic nail, lichen planus, eczema, psoriasis, or other
             abnormalities of the nail unit, which could affect/influence the subject's compliance
             of the investigational products, or mask the effects of treatment (cure),

          -  Subjects with known immunodeficiency, radiation therapy, immune suppressive drugs.
