  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are 1) To assess the prevalence of tobacco use and cessation treatment
      preferences among YKHC employees, 2) To assess employee's current levels of perceived stress,
      engagement in physical activity, and feelings of resiliency to inform future tobacco
      cessation interventions, and to examine the relationship between these factors and tobacco
      use, and 3) To assess YKHC employees' perceptions and opinions of the hospital's current
      workplace tobacco policy and expansion of these regulations to all YKHC properties.

      All employees at YKHC will be invited to complete an online survey that took approximately
      10-15 minutes to complete. All employees will receive information via email, which includes
      an overview of the project, information regarding privacy and consent, and a link to the
      survey. Those who wish to do so were able to print a copy of the information for their
      reference. Employees who wish to participate did so by clicking on the survey link. Those who
      do not wish to participate could simply delete the email. Participants will be given two
      weeks to complete the online survey. Individuals who do not respond within the first week,
      will be sent an automated email reminder. All employees who participate will received a small
      incentive (approximately $10 in value).
