  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled study with two arms to evaluate
      JointStem as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening
      period, approximately 45 subjects will be randomly assigned into one of the following two
      arms in a 2:1 ratio (2 JointStem : 1 positive control). After the last subject completes
      6-month visit (Visit 6) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the
      database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis. Subjects
      will then be scheduled for 9-month and 12-month follow-up visits (Visits 7 and 8).
