    <textblock>
      This study consists of two clinical series. With the first series investigators monitor the
      healing of skin grafts with bioimpedance measurements. The bioimpedance measurement is done
      with a purpose built patch that has electrodes in contact with the wound and reference
      electrodes.

      In the second series the investigators monitor closed operational wounds (breast
      reconstruction surgery patients) with bioimpedance measurements. This series is also
      conducted with bioimpedance measurements but the wounds are operational wounds.

      Both groups will have 20 patients.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. The investigators will study how bioimpedance measurement results correlate with
           conventional wound healing monitoring.

        2. The investigators will seek the best methods for handling, interpreting and presenting
           bioimpedance measurement results.

        3. The investigators will find out if impedance measurement is applicable to clinical use.
