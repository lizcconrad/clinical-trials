      This study aims achieving of long-term weight loss in T2DM patients by use of comprehensive
      lifestyle changes program, providing patients with structured diet, exercise plan, group
      behavioral support and group education. Additionally the study is designed to establish
      reduction of the body weight leads to the improvement of glycemic and lipid metabolism, and
      can also reduce blood pressure level. The study is also directed to show that lifestyle
      changes program in T2DM patients can lead to decreasing of hospitalization rate and
      healthcare consumption. In order to demonstrate a change from standard of care, data will be
      collected from a parallel cohort from the same centers.
