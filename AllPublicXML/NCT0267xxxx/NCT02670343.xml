    <textblock>
      An open-label, single oral TU dose study was conducted in eight (8) hypogonadal men at a
      single study site. Each study participant received a single oral TU dose immediately prior to
      a standardized breakfast meal comprised of 800 to 1000 calories and approximately 30 g of
      fat. Blood samples were collected 30 minutes prior dose administration and at 0 pre-dose and
      post dose at the following hours post-dose; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours.

      This open-label, single oral dose, phlebotomy study was designed to clarify the issue of the
      influence of blood collection tubes on T, DHT, TU and DHTU measurements by collecting blood
      samples into various collection tubes from a small number of hypogonadal men dosed with a
      single oral TU dose in the form of a SEDDS formulation.

    <measure>% of Mean Difference in T Concentration Compared to Plain Collection Tube</measure>
    <time_frame>Sample collection at -0.5, and 0 hours pre-dose and post-dose samples collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, hours after a single dose of oral TU.</time_frame>
    <description>The measured outcome presented is the difference as a percent of mean of T results when comparing T Concentrations measured in three different types of NaF containing collection tubes (NaF+EDTA, NaF+Oxalate and NaF) to T measured in blood collected in plain tubes. The % of Mean Difference in T concentration for each tube type was obtained by taking the average at each time point a T concentration was obtained, and calculating the mean difference between the test ((NaF+EDTA, NaF+Oxalate and NaF) tubes and the control (plain) tube.
The concentration of total T will be determined in the serum/plasma samples of all subjects using validated LC/MS/MS methods at the Endocrine and Metabolic Research Lab.</description>
