  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, randomized, surgical trial of women with symptomatic
      post-hysterectomy apical (cuff) prolapse desiring surgical treatment. This study will compare
      the three available surgical treatments performed in usual practice. The purpose of this
      study is to compare two commonly performed mesh apical repair (sacral colpopexy vs. Apical
      Transvaginal Mesh) and vaginal native tissue apical repairs with mesh reinforced repairs. The
      primary outcome is measured over time (up to 60 months) using a survival analysis approach.

      The investigators hypothesize that treatment failure will not differ between vaginally and
      abdominally placed mesh for vault vaginal prolapse, and mesh repairs (regardless of route of
      implantation) will be superior to native tissue apical suspension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this three arm randomized clinical trial is to determine if apical
      transvaginal mesh placement is non-inferior to sacral colpopexy for anatomic correction of
      post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse and to determine if mesh reinforced repairs
      performed by abdominal or vaginal approach are superior to native tissue vaginal repair. This
      trial has the following primary aims:

        1. To determine if Apical Transvaginal Mesh is non-inferior to Sacral Colpopexy for
           anatomic correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at time points through 3
           years.

        2. To determine if Sacral Colpopexy is superior to Native Tissue Repair for anatomic
           correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at time points through 3 years.

        3. To determine if Apical Transvaginal Mesh is superior to Native Tissue Repair for
           anatomic correction of post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse at time points through 3
           years.

      Additional secondary aims include:

        1. Evaluate the development of a valid and reliable Global Composite Outcome that balances
           adverse events and patient-centered outcomes to anatomic definitions of failure and
           success.

        2. Determine the impact of preoperative frailty and mobility on surgical treatment outcomes
           and postoperative complications of older women following surgical correction of apical
           pelvic organ prolapse.

        3. Evaluate the patient's perspective about adverse events and their role in patient
           decision-making outcomes. The aims include comparing patient versus surgeon rankings of
           complication grade, outcome, expectedness and seriousness, to estimate the association
           between patient rankings of adverse events (AEs) with decision-making and quality of
           life outcomes and to determine if their perspective about AEs changes over time.

                            examine and assess for evidence of mesh or graft if no evidence of mesh
                            or graft is present on examination subject remains eligible.
