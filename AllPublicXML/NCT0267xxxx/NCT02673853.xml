  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish the incidence of residual paralysis in patients following
      administration of a mini- dose of atracurium (less than ED95 i.e. &lt;0.23mg/kg or &lt;15 mg in
      most patients) during supraglottic airway insertion and correlate it with the duration of
      time from drug administration to arrival at PACU. The secondary aim is to compare the
      incidence of residual paralysis in patients who receive full doses of atracurium (per body
      weight) with those who receive mini-doses.

    <textblock>
      Post-operative residual paralysis may be defined as the incomplete recovery of muscle
      function following intra-operative administration of neuromuscular blockers (NMBs). This
      condition is associated with many negative patient outcomes such as: increased risk of
      aspiration; upper airway obstruction; and delayed Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU)
      discharge, amongst others. Despite the increasing use of shorter acting agents, the
      prevalence of residual paralysis in the PACU remains high at 20-50%. NMBs are commonly used
      to facilitate endotracheal intubation and insertion of the supraglottic airway by obtunding
      airway reflexes. Given the increasing use of mini-dose NMBs without post-operative reversal
      in clinical practice, there is a need to evaluate the incidence of residual paralysis in the
      patient population who have received mini-dose atracurium during the supraglottic airway
      insertion.

    <description>There has been various objective and subject methods of measuring the extent of operative paralysis using established methods such as the train of four (TOF) with ratio of &lt;0.9 indicating inadequate recovery, Double burst stimulation, acceleromyography, five second head lift and tongue depressor test. The relevant data about the patient's condition will be collected and filled up in the data collection form.</description>

        The study population will be picked from all patients who are going surgery at National
        University Hospital (NUH) during the period of data collection, and who are receiving
        supraglottic airway for their procedure. They must fulfil the inclusion and exclusion
        criteria.
