      The SAVER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study to determine the feasibility of
      recruitment. In addition to feasibility data, the investigators will carefully collect
      clinical data to determine if rosuvastatin can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in
      venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients.

      Eligible consenting patients who developed acute, symptomatic, and objectively confirmed
      proximal leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or PE will be randomized and equally allocated to
      2 trial arms, either the treatment group (rosuvastatin tablet (20 mg/day) or the control
      group (usual care). The pilot trial consists of up to 4 study contacts over 6 months:
      screening, randomization, telephone follow-up (90 days), and final study visit (180 days).

      STUDY DESIGN: The SAVER pilot is a randomized, open-label pilot study to determine the
      feasibility of recruitment (main threat to successful completion of the full SAVER RCT). In
      addition to feasibility data, the investigators will carefully collect clinical data to
      determine if rosuvastatin can reduce PTS in VTE patients. Eligible consenting patients who
      developed acute, symptomatic, and objectively confirmed proximal leg DVT and/or pulmonary
      embolism (PE) will be randomized and equally allocated to 1 of 2 trial arms, either the
      treatment group or the control group. The pilot trial consists of up to 4 study contacts over
      6 months: screening, randomization, telephone follow-up (90 days), and final study visit (180
      days).

      DOSE/ROUTE/REGIMEN: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into the treatment or control
      group. Treatment Group: The treatment arm will receive a 20 mg tablet of rosuvastatin to be
      taken orally once daily starting at the time of randomization until the completion of
      follow-up at 6 months. Control Group: Those in the control arm will be followed in the same
      manner but will not receive study medication.

      MEASURES AND EVALUATION

      Screening Visit: Research coordinators at each pilot site will screen patients for
      eligibility and will maintain detailed logs of all excluded and enrolled patients. After
      providing informed consent, eligibility will be confirmed by the following tests: a lipid
      profile, A1C test and transaminase (ALT) level analysis.All eligibility will be reviewed by
      an investigator.

      Randomization Visit: Randomization will be conducted using an Interactive Web based
      Randomization System.

      Medication Diaries will be dispensed to participants in the treatment arm at baseline along
      with their study medication, At the final study visit, the study coordinator will review the
      medication diary and compare to pill count as an indicator of compliance.

      Adverse Events: AEs will be elicited, monitored and recorded throughout the study. The
      investigator will report serious adverse events (SAEs) to the SAVER Trial Office in Ottawa,
      Canada within 24 h of awareness.
