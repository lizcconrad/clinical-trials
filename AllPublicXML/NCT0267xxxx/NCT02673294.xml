  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The level of stroke chronicity has been proposed as an influential variable related to
      functional balance. However, little is known about the effect of this variable on the
      effectiveness and maintenance of gains of physical therapy interventions on balance. The
      objective of this study is to determine the influence of time since injury on the
      rehabilitation of balance after stroke. Participants will be assigned to a least (6-12
      months), a moderate (12-24 months), or a most chronic (&gt; 24 months) group. All the
      participants will train for 20 one-hour sessions, administered three to five times a week,
      combining conventional physical therapy exercises and customized exercises interfaced on a
      balance board that promotes the training of the ankle and hip strategies. Participants will
      be assessed before, after the intervention, and one month later with a posturography test
      (sway speed and limits of stability) and clinical scales (Berg Balance Scale, Functional
      Reaches Test, 30-Second Sit-to-Stand Test, Timed Up and Down Stairs Test, Stepping Test,
      Timed Up-and-Go Test, and the 10-meter Walking Test).
