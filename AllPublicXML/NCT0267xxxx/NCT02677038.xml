    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if olaparib can help to control
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Olaparib is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of ovarian cancer. Its use in this study is investigational. The study doctor can
      explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 24 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take olaparib by mouth 2
      times each day (2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in the evening, about 12 hours apart).
      You should take the tablets at around the same time each day with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water.
      You should not chew, crush, dissolve, or divide the tablets. You may take the tablets with a
      light meal or snack.

      If you vomit shortly after the olaparib tablets are swallowed, the dose should only be
      replaced if all of the intact tablets can be seen and counted. If you miss a scheduled dose
      by less than 2 hours, you should take the missed dose. If you miss a study drug dose by more
      than 2 hours, do not take the missed dose. Wait and take the next dose as scheduled.

      Study Visits:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and biomarker testing.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 8 weeks for up to 40 weeks and then every 12 weeks after that (Weeks 52, 64, 76, and so
      on), you will have a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.

      At any time during the study, you may have some of the above tests repeated if the doctor
      thinks they are needed for your safety. The study doctor will tell you if you need to have
      any of these tests repeated.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your active participation in this study will be over after the follow-up visit.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a core needle biopsy for biomarker testing.

        -  If the disease appears to have gotten worse, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for
           biomarker testing.

      If you stop study treatment and the disease has not gotten worse, you will continue to have a
      CT scan or MRI every 8 weeks for up to 40 weeks and then every 12 weeks after that, until the
      disease appears to get worse.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after the end-of-treatment visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      About 2 months after your end-of-treatment visit and then every 2 months until the study is
      over, you will be called by the study staff and asked how you are doing and if you have taken
      any other anticancer treatments. Each call should last about 10-15 minutes.
