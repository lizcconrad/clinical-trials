    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the immunogenicity of two different
      doses of the GVGH S. sonnei vaccine in healthy adults and represents the first step towards
      testing of the GMMA vaccine in the vaccine target population of children from developing
      countries where shigellosis is endemic.
