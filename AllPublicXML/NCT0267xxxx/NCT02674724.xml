  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate if resistance training exercises performed twice a week with or without gym
      equipment assistance in a 12-week period could improve balance in patients with Parkinson
      Disease (PD).

      Methods: Sixty three patients with idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage II - III) and
      preserved cognitive function will participate in this study. Patients will be randomized
      among three intervention groups: resistance training with free weights, resistance training
      with gym equipment and control group. Investigators will use static platform balance
      variables to assess the primary end-point outcome measures. For the secondary outcomes
      measures, most common clinical functional balances tests for PD will be applied: Berg Balance
      Scale (BBS), Mini-BESTest - Balance Evaluation (Mini-BESTest), Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and
      variables from dynamic posturography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor functions
      and is characterized by bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability.
      Despite of pharmacological treatments, patients remain with deficits in balance, gait,
      autonomic system functions and cognition which impact on their quality of life.

      The effects of resistance training on PD are still controversial when balance and improvement
      on functional tests are the targets.

      Since the results of previous studies about resistance training on balance are still
      controversial, more interventions are required to address the question if strengthening
      exercise may improve or not the balance of PD patients. Our exercises will target the trunk,
      leg and shoulder muscles because of their contribution on patient's posture.

    <measure>Postural sway on Static Posturography</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Static Posturography is a technique used to objectively assess postural sway with patients standing still on a fixed platform that measures center of pressure displacement. Tests were standardized such as the feet position, the eye gaze and environment light, with three trials of 60-second test in eyes - open, eyes closed and eyes open in dual task condition. Investigators will analyze the anteroposterior displacement, medial-lateral displacement, area, velocity and path length.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance on Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale is used to assess balance and falls in elderly using different tasks. It consists of 14 tasks scoring from zero to four, zero means that the patient is unable to perform the task and four means that the task is performed independently.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Balance Evaluation on Mini-BESTest</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-BESTest contains 14 items that assess dynamic balance focusing on anticipatory postural adjustments, postural responses, sensory orientation and stability in gait. Items are scored from 0 to 2 (normal performance in balance).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional balance and gait on Timed Up and Go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG test measures individual speed while performing the sequence: rising from a chair, walking for three meters of distance, turning around and returning to the starting position, sitting on a chair. When the examination exceeds 13 seconds, patients have higher risk of falls.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life on PDQ-39 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 assess quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients over the last month. Contains 39 items and eight dimensions (Mobility, Activities of daily living, Emotional well-being, Stigma, Social support, Cognitions and Bodily discomfort).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional balance on Dynamic Posturography</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic posturography is a quantitative method to assess balance. This system have sensors located below two platforms and measures vertical and horizontal forces produced by the center of gravity during a pre-determined task (sit to stand, tandem walk and step over).</description>

Patients will be encouraged to perform 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions. All subjects will be instructed to rest for 30-60 second intervals between sets.</description>
