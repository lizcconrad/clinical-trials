      This study evaluates the diagnostic performances of Point of Care P. gingivalis test in
      saliva with serum IgG P. gingivalis, in reference to dental examination as a gold standard in
      patients hospitalised in intensive care unit (ICU)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Periodontitis (CP) is a common but under diagnosed chronic infection and inflammation
      of the periodontal tissue. Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the most common pathogens
      associated with CP. In patients hospitalised in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), P. gingivalis has
      been reported to be associated with Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP).

      This pilot study evaluate an easily accessible method the Point of care P. gingivalis tests
      on saliva and detection of antibodies against P. gingivalis in sera (already validated to
      diagnose CP in the general population) to dental examination as a gold standard, in ICU
      patients.

      A biobank from critically ill patients will be establish for future oral health research in
      this patient population: for about 50 patients with both samples available, at enrolment and
      at day 5 +/-2 days after enrolment. Oral pathogens of different sites (tongue, saliva, dental
      plaque, internal jaw) at enrolment and at day 5 +/- 2 days after enrolment. Samples of
      periodontal pocket will be collected only for patients diagnosed with CP. When patients will
      have a pulmonary sample performed in routine, pulmonary sample will also be stored. Plasma
      and sera will also be taken at enrolment and stored for further research on P. gingivalis and
      inflammation in ICU patients Patients will be enrolled and will be contacted after 3 months.

    <description>Dental examination will be performed to diagnose CP based on the Centre for Diseases Control definition.
A point of care P. gingivalis test (Denka Seiken Co (Japan) ) on saliva and detection of antibodies against P. gingivalis in sera will be performed.
In case of discrepancies between both diagnoses methods, RT-PCR for identification of P. gingivalis and other pathogens will be performed on samples of periodontal pocket performed in routine.</description>
