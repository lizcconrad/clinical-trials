  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cerclage was devised in the 1950's for women with prior early preterm births (PTB)
      who developed a dilated cervix detected by manual exam in the second trimester. In
      contemporary practice, there are three possible indications for cerclage. History-indicated
      cerclage (HIC) is defined as a cerclage placed usually between 12-15 weeks based solely on
      poor prior obstetrical history, e.g. multiple second trimester losses due to painless
      dilatation. Ultrasound-indicated cerclage (UIC) is defined as a cerclage placed usually
      between 16-23 weeks for transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) cervical length (CL) &lt; 25mm in a woman
      with a prior spontaneous PTB. Physical-exam indicated is defined as a cerclage placed usually
      between 16-23 weeks because of cervical dilatation of 1 or more centimeters detected on
      physical (manual) examination.

      Randomized trials and meta-analysis of these have shown that UIC is associated with
      significant reduction in PTB and improved neonatal outcome, whereas evidence of efficacy for
      history-indicated cerclage and physical exam-indicated cerclage is limited. In the United
      States, the national data shows that the rate of cerclage has decreased in the last few
      years. The indications of placement of cerclage have recently changed, and so it is important
      to evaluate how many women are getting this procedure. With the recent completion of clinical
      trials, it is plausible that obstetricians and perinatologists may have become more selective
      in terms of the best candidates for cerclage.

      The aim of this RCT is to evaluate the efficacy of cervical pessary in prevention of PTB as
      adjuctive therapy in women with UIC

    <description>Cervical pessary is a medical device used to treat an incompetent (or insufficient) cervix (cervix starts to shorten and open too early). Early in the pregnancy a round silicone pessary is placed at the opening to the cervix to close it, and then remove late in the pregnancy when the risk of a preterm birth has passed.</description>
