  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 2 to 59 months of age.

          -  History of cough &lt;14 days or difficult breathing with chest-indrawing.

          -  Ability and willingness of child's caregiver to provide informed consent and to be
             available for follow-up for the planned duration of the study, including accepting a
             home visit if he/she fails to return to Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) for a scheduled
             study follow-up visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If chest-indrawing observed at screening resolves after bronchodilator challenge,
             among those with wheeze at screening.

          -  Severe respiratory distress (e.g., grunting, nasal flaring, head nodding, or severe
             chest-indrawing).

          -  Presence of World Health Organization (WHO) Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
             (IMCI) danger signs including: lethargy or unconsciousness, convulsions, vomiting
             everything, or inability to drink or breastfeed.

          -  Hypoxia (SaO2 &lt; 90% on room air, as assessed by a Lifebox pulse oximeter).

          -  Stridor when calm.

          -  HIV-1 seropositivity or HIV-1 exposure, assessed as follows:

               -  An HIV-positive result upon rapid antibody test will exclude any child from this
                  study.

               -  If a child is less than 12 months or age with a positive rapid test result, the
                  child will be referred to receive additional confirmatory HIV testing (e.g.,
                  dried blood spot filter paper test) and follow-up from KCH staff, as per standard
                  of care. Even if the confirmatory HIV testing subsequently shows that child is
                  HIV-negative, he or she will remain excluded from the study.

               -  If a child is less than 24 months of age and has an HIV-negative result upon
                  rapid antibody test, the child's biological mother's HIV status will need to be
                  assessed. If the mother is HIV-positive, the child will be excluded. If the
                  mother has a documented HIV-negative test result from within the past 6 weeks,
                  the child will be included. If the mother does not have documentation of an
                  HIV-negative test result, she will be tested via rapid antibody testing to
                  determine the child's eligibility for this study.

               -  If a child is over 24 months of age, an HIV-negative rapid antibody test is
                  required for inclusion in the study.

               -  Note: If a child has documentation of an HIV-negative test result from within the
                  past 6 weeks, that test result will be used for the child's eligibility
                  assessment according to the algorithm described above.

          -  Severe acute malnutrition (i.e., weight for height/length &lt; -3 SD, mid-upper arm
             circumference &lt;115 mm, or edema).

          -  Possible tuberculosis (coughing for more than 14 days).

          -  Severe anemia, classified by WHO pocketbook guidelines (i.e., severe palmar pallor or
             hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL)

          -  Severe malaria, classified by WHO pocketbook guidelines (e.g., positive malaria rapid
             diagnostic test (mRDT) with any danger sign, stiff neck, abnormal bleeding, clinical
             jaundice, or hemoglobinuria)

          -  Known allergy to penicillin or amoxicillin.

          -  Receipt of an antibiotic treatment in the 48 hours prior to the study based on
             caregiver's self-report and/or documentation in child's medical record.

          -  Hospitalized within 14 days prior to the study.

          -  Living outside Lilongwe urban area, the study catchment area.

          -  Any medical or psychosocial condition or circumstance that, in the opinion of the
             investigators, would interfere with the conduct of the study or for which study
             participation might jeopardize the child's health.

          -  Any non-pneumonia acute medical illness which requires antibiotic treatment per local
             standard of care.

          -  Participation in a clinical study of another investigational product within 12 weeks
             prior to randomization or planning to begin participation during this study.

          -  Prior participation in an Innovative Treatments in Pneumonia (ITIP) study during a
             previous pneumonia diagnosis.
