      The purpose of this study is to see how useful the information provided from Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET) scans can be in the actual planning and delivery of radiation
      treatment to patients who have head and neck cancers. Patients participating in this study,
      will have (in addition to their routine tests) a PET scan before and during their radiation
      treatment. Following the intervention, patients will be followed as per standard practice.
