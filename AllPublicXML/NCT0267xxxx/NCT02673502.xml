  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) pathways include multiple evidence-based interventions
      delivered throughout the peri-operative period that aim to attenuate the surgical stress
      response and support rapid physiologic and functional recovery.A key element of the ERAS
      pathway is the administration of a clear carbohydrate-rich beverage 2-3 h before surgery in
      order to keep the patient in a fed state rather than a fasted state when they go to the
      operating room. The aim of the current study is to investigate the impact of a drink
      containing simple carbohydrate on attenuating surgical stress induced insulin resistance in
      patients undergoing major laparoscopic abdominal surgery, compared to drinks containing
      maltodextrin.
