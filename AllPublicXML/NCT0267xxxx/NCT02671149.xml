  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether drinking plain water when mildly dehydrated
      benefits cognitive performance and mood. Volunteers undergo a dehydration protocol designed
      to result in minor dehydration. While some participants receive two 150ml drinks of water
      others do not. Differences in cognitive functioning are assessed.

      As an essential nutrient, an inadequate intake of water has negative consequences: without a
      source of water death will occur in days. When Benton and Young (2015) reviewed the topic
      they concluded that in healthy adults, mild dehydration (in the range of a loss of 2% body
      mass) had been found to adversely influence mood and cognition. However, it is unclear at
      what degree of hypohydration these effects begin to emerge.

      This study was designed to determine whether small changes in hydration, of the level that
      might occur on a day to day basis, influence cognition and mood. During a dehydration
      protocol (sitting in a room heated to 30 degrees for four hours) young adult participants
      receive either drink two 150ml cups of water or nothing. Effects on memory, attention and
      mood are monitored.

    <measure>Episodic memory - list of 30 words</measure>
    <time_frame>change from 0 to 180 minutes after the start of the dehydration protocol</time_frame>
    <description>Participants listen to a list of 30 words presented using a tape recorder. The words are of similar difficulty and matched for the number of syllables and frequency with which they occur in English. The subjects are asked to recall and write down as many words as possible. The difference in the total number of words remembered from baseline (before the intervention) is analysed.</description>

    <measure>Focused attention - Eriksen Flanker Task</measure>
    <time_frame>change from 0 to 180 minutes after the start of the dehydration protocol</time_frame>
    <description>The Arrow Flankers test measures the ability to direct attention and ignore peripheral information. Participants are required to indicate whether the middle arrow is pointing to the right or left by pressing the corresponding arrow on the keyboard. Either side of the central arrow are distractors. Both the average reaction times (in milliseconds) and accuracy are recorded. The difference in performance from baseline (before the intervention) is analysed.</description>
