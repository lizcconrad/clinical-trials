  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial attempts to determine whether the measurement of pleural
      pressures during therapeutic thoracentesis affects the development of chest discomfort after
      the procedure. During thoracentesis, pleural fluid is drained from the pleural space,
      resulting in lung expansion. In some cases, the lung is not completely re-expandable, in
      which case continued drainage results in the development of negative pleural pressures and
      chest discomfort. Negative pleural pressures may also result in other complications such as
      re-expansion pulmonary edema and pneumothorax. The identification of negative pleural
      pressures via manometry during the procedure may lead to a reduction in the complication
      rate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the impact of pleural manometry on the development of chest discomfort during
      therapeutic thoracentesis compared to conventional symptom-guided thoracentesis.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo manometry-guided therapeutic thoracentesis.

      ARM II: Patients undergo symptom-guided thoracentesis.

    <time_frame>one-time assessment, 5 minutes after thoracentesis catheter is removed (on day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>As measured in millimeters along a 10 cm Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The estimated minimal clinically important difference is 15 mm. Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, and ranges will be presented. Investigations for outliers and assumptions for statistical analysis, e.g., normality and homoscedasticity will be made. If necessary, data will be transformed using Box-Cox power transformation. Comparisons between groups, i.e. intervention versus (vs) control, will be made using the t-test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Mixed model will be employed to assess the trend of pain score measured across pre-, intra-, and post-procedure.</description>
