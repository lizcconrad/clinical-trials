  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of an
      internet-based self help program concerning satisfaction with the treatment and their life,
      depression and anxiety. Both study groups get access to the internet-based self-help program.
      The intervention group receives additional feedback to their progress in the program from an
      online therapist. The investigators hypothesize that (1) at least 75% of the patients in the
      intervention group are &quot;satisfied&quot; or &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the self-help program, (2) 50% of
      the patients in the intervention group work with all eight units and (3) patients of the
      intervention group have a higher emotional competence than the patients of the control group
      at the end of the self-help program.
