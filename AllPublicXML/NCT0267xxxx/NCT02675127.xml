      An open label randomized, single dose, two-way crossover bioequivalence study to determine
      the bioequivalence of Daclatasvir from Daktavira 60 mg film coated tablets ( European
      Egyptian Pharmaceutical Industries, Egypt) versus Daklinza 60 mg tablets (Bristol-Myers
      Squibb Pharma, UK) in Healthy Human Volunteers Under Fasting Condition

      Primary Pharmacokinetic Parameters: Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ Secondary Pharmacokinetic
      Parameters: Ke, tmax and t1/2e. ANOVA using 5% significance level for transformed (with the
      90% confidence intervals) and untransformed data of Cmax, AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ and for
      untransformed data of Ke, tmax and t1/2e.

      The confidence intervals of logarithmically transformed Test/Reference ratios for Cmax,
      AUC0→t and AUC0→∞ to be within 80.00-125.00%.

      A comprehensive final report will be issued upon the completion of the study.
