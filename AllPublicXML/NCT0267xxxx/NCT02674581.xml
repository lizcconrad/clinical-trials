    <description>To assess the effect of varying degrees of renal impairment on the exposure of BMS-626529 after a single oral-dose administration of the pro-drug, BMS-663068, will be evaluated by assessing the primary endpoints of Cmax, for BMS-626529.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 - Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the safety and tolerability of BMS-663068 in subjects with normal renal function and subjects with impaired renal functions, will be measured by the following secondary endpoints: Incidence of AEs, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation, and results of vital signs, ECGs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria (For renal impaired subjects):

          -  Classification by renal function based on eGFR

          -  Clinical, ECG, and laboratory findings consistent with renal dysfunction

          -  BMI of 18.0 to 38.0 kg/m2 inclusive

          -  Women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) and sexually active fertile men with partners
             who are WOCBP must use non-hormonal highly effective birth control

          -  Slightly different inclusion criteria are defined in the protocol for healthy subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of uncontrolled or unstable cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematopoietic, psychiatric, and/or neurological disease
             within 6 months of screening

          -  Evidence of rapidly deteriorating renal function, defined as a screening eGFR that has
             decreased from a previous eGFR by ≥ 50% within the last 3 months

          -  Current or recent (within 3 months of study drug administration) clinically
             significant gastrointestinal disease or gastrointestinal surgery (including
             cholecystectomy) that could impact the absorption of study drug

          -  Any major surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.

          -  Other protocol defined exclusion criteria could apply
