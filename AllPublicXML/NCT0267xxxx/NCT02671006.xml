  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A biological tool for quantitative assessment of Chronic Urticaria (CU) is still in need for
      monitoring biotherapies. CU is considered as a sudden degranulation of Mast cells / basophils
      without any identified cause. It is considered that Mast cell/basophil have an abnormally
      high sensitivity in CU and can be triggered with almost nothing (high irritability). In
      allergy, basophils degranulation can be reproduced in vitro with allergens. Anti-IgE
      (immunoglobulin E) antibody mimics allergen triggering of basophils in a dose dependent
      manner. If basophils are abnormally sensitive in CU, it should be reproduced in vitro at very
      low stimulation. The main objective of this project is to set up a method to evidence
      abnormal basophil irritability and look for clinical significance. As many markers
      characterize basophils in different states, researchers shall also look for a profile
      possibly associated with CU basophile irritability. Such tests could be useful in CU
      monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mast cell is a key factor in Urticaria physiopathology. Several mechanisms have been
      hypothesized and could be either synergistic or revealing different types of urticaria. But
      most of these mechanisms seem to converge to Mast cells releasing histamine and other
      products. These mechanisms include auto-antibody and / or cytokines inappropriate production.
      However, internal dysregulation of Mast cell have also been reported, that could be either
      primary or secondary to extrinsic mediators mentioned already. Basophils closely related to
      Mast cells, easily accessible and usually serve as surrogate for clinical analysis of allergy
      or urticaria.

      Flow-cytometry (FCM) is a recent tool with increasing interest due to its exceptional
      capacity of analysis of a large number of cells, individually, at high speed and measuring
      many parameters at a time. FCM has been extensively used in characterization of cell sub
      populations in several diseases such as hematology disorders or immunology and among them the
      basophil. FCM is now the gold standard for ex vivo functional analyses of basophil activation
      as part of the diagnosis of allergy.

      The present project aims to explore phenotypic and functional changes that could reflect the
      dysregulation in Urticaria. This would have diagnosis and physiopathological interest with
      potential impact on optimizing disease monitoring and treatment.

    <description>Urticaria Activity Score 7 will be performed to measure the severity of the disease. After 7 days, average daily scores from the morning and evening assessments are added together. Values can range between 0 to 21 for weekly itch severity, and 0 to 21 for weekly hive count. The UAS7 ranges from 0 to 42.</description>

    <description>Partial activation of some cells such as Eosinophils leads to exposure of tissue factors and low level activation of the coagulation. D-dimers are produced and it was proposed that these d-dimers could be a trigger of basophils. The dosage of the D Dimers will be performed to find a possible correlation with the severity of the disease.</description>
