      The study, investigates the current physical activity promotion practices among physicians
      and nurses, as well as social norms toward physical activity during treatment among cancer
      patients and among physicians and nurses who treat or counsel cancer patients.

      For this purpose, four large surveys with health care professionals (specialized
      practitioners, N=300; general practitioners, N=300; oncology nurses, N=300) and cancer
      patients (N=1200, 400 patients each with breast, prostate or colorectal cancer) with a
      cross-sectional research design are conducted.

      Additionally, a follow-up-study with a sub-sample of cancer patients (N=180) will be
      conducted.
