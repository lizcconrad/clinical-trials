  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are concerns that the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for the treatment
      of pulmonary complications in patients with brain injury may potentially elevate intracranial
      pressure (ICP), and deteriorate neurological status. It is suggested that both respiratory
      system compliance and ventricular compliance would contribute to the elevation of ICP when
      PEEP increases. In theory, PEEP may cause elevation of ICP by increasing intrathoracic
      pressure and diminish venous return. However, the transmission of PEEP into thoracic cavity
      depends on the properties of the lung and chest wall. Experimental study showed that when
      chest wall compliance is low, PEEP can significantly increases intrathoracic pressure;
      whereas low lung compliance can minimize airway pressure transmission. It is generally
      recognized that the lung compliance decreases in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      patients due to extensive alveolar collapse. However, it has been report that the elastance
      ratio (the ratio between elastance of the chest wall and the respiratory system, where
      elastance is the reciprocal of compliance) may vary from 0.2 to 0.8. Therefore, it is
      important to distinguish the compliance of the chest wall and the lung when investigating the
      effect of PEEP on ICP.

      Because intrathoracic pressure (pleural pressure) is difficult to measure in clinical
      situations, esophageal pressure (Pes) is considered as a surrogate of intrathoracic pressure.
      In the present study, the investigators determine the effect of PEEP on intrathoracic
      pressure and ICP by Pes measurement.
