  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain is a common phenomenon in the intensive care unit (ICU) despite the
      multitude of efforts dedicated to promote its effective relief. Mounting evidence shows that
      cardiac surgery ICU patients experience moderate to severe pain reaching proportions as high
      as 74% despite the use of analgesics. The highest pain intensity is experienced in the first
      24 hours post surgery when patients are still in the ICU, and represents a strong predictor
      for the presence and severity of persistent postoperative pain. To maximize pain relief,
      massage has been suggested in the recent clinical practice guidelines of the Society of
      Critical-Care Medicine as a complementary non-pharmacological therapy in the ICU given its
      opioid-sparing and analgesia-enhancing potential. Some randomized controlled trials showed
      promising pain relief effects of massage when administered to cardiac surgery patients in
      acute care units, however, its effects on pain relief while patients are still in the ICU and
      when pain severity is highest remain unknown.

      This study aims to compare the effect of three 20-minute hand massage administrations within
      24 hours postop on the pain intensity (primary outcome), pain unpleasantness, pain
      interference, muscle tension, anxiety and vital signs (blood pressure, heart and respiratory
      rates) of adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients post cardiac surgery versus hand holding
      (i.e., simple touch) and standard care. Other objectives are to describe the location and
      quality of pain of cardiac surgery ICU patients.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients receiving 3 hand massages within 24 hours postop will have lower pain intensity,
      unpleasantness and interference, muscle tension, anxiety and vital signs compared to patients
      receiving hand holding and to those in the standard care group.

    <description>Pain intensity will be captured using the 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale score, and the analysis metric will be the change in pain intensity from baseline (pre-intervention) to immediately after each intervention. For each study group, means and standard deviations of patients' pain intensity levels will be reported.
Change in pain intensity levels will be assessed for each of the three interventions administered within 24 hours postop.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive a 20 minute hand massage by a trained nurse in addition to the standard ICU care. Before administering the massage, a favorable environment will be created that promotes calmness such as dampening the light, reducing the alarm intensity, closing the curtains and the door and posting the notice &quot;do not disturb&quot;, and a comfortable positioning of the patient will be ensured. The interventionist will hold each hand for 5-10 seconds, and apply 5-10 ml of unscented hypoallergenic cream to both hands and wrists. Then, she will perform massage using moderate pressure, and the stroking and kneading techniques during ten minutes on the palm and back of each hand.</description>

    <description>The active control group will receive hand holding by the same trained nurse in addition to standard ICU care. The same hand hygiene and environmental adjustments will be made as for those receiving massage. Patients will have their hands held for 5-10 seconds and unscented hypoallergenic cream applied to both hands. Then, the interventionist will hold each of the patients' hand in her hand for ten minutes without performing any tissue manipulation. The hand holding procedure will last for a total of 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>The passive control group will have a 20 minutes rest period including the same environmental adjustments as the massage and hand holding groups in addition to the standard care administered in the ICU. The standard care includes the pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments used to promote recovery and symptom relief. In the study ICU, cardiac surgery patients are automatically prescribed a pain management protocol that includes the regular administration of morphine, unless extraordinary patient circumstances require different prescriptions. Patients might equally receive breakthrough doses of analgesia in addition to regular opioids. Of the existing non-pharmacological interventions, repositioning and back rubs are commonly employed in the study ICU to provide patient comfort.</description>
