    <textblock>
      Measurement of corneal temperature gives indirect information about the ocular blood flow.
      For this reason corneal temperature can be used as a surrogate to quantify ocular blood flow.
      It can be measured by means of infrared thermography. This test, however, is not used in an
      everyday clinical routine so far. In this study is investigated if ocular blood flow
      disturbances in glaucoma patients can be diagnosed by means of infrared thermography.

      Corneal temperature are measured in normal tension glaucoma patients and healthy controls
      before and after cold provocation test. In the group of patients and the group of controls,
      subjects with and without a primary vascular dysregulation (PVD) are included. This will
      allow to analyze and compare the influence of cold provocation on corneal temperature (and
      indirectly ocular blood flow) in these study Groups.
