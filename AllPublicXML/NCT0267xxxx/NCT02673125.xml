      Chromosomal abnormalities are a major cause of pregnancy loss. Preimplantation Genetic
      Screening (PGS) using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) allows the effective detection of
      these abnormalities and improves clinical outcomes. However even the transfer of a
      chromosomally normal embryo does not guarantee successful implantation. Recent research by
      Fragouli, et. al. 2015 has demonstrated a strong association between mitochondrial DNA
      quantities (also known as MitoGradeTM) and implantation outcomes in embryos that are already
      classified by PGS as chromosomally normal. Investigators have also demonstrated in a clinical
      study that MitoGradeTM normal and PGS normal embryos have higher chances of implantation than
      MitoGrade elevated PGS normal embryos. Transferring MitoGrade elevated PGS normal embryos
      results in less than 10% implantation rates while MitoGrade normal PGS normal embryos
      resulted in more than 65% implantation rates. The risk of miscarriage after replacing either
      type is very low (about 8%).

      In order to understand the complete effectiveness of the test, investigators are conducting a
      paired prospective study. This means that investigators will be transferring a MitoGrade
      normal and a MitoGrade elevated embryo at the same time to see if one implants better than
      the other. It is expected that patients joining this study will benefit from knowing that at
      least one embryo is MitoGrade normal PGS normal.

      Mitochondria are considered the powerhouses of cells. These membrane-bound organelles play a
      vital role in embryonic development and are essential for various cellular functions. And
      unlike other cellular organelles, they contain their own DNA (also known as mitochondrial DNA
      or mtDNA). Embryonic development is a complex energy-driven process and is thought to be
      highly dependent on mitochondrial function and mtDNA gene expression. It is believed that
      amounts of mtDNA remain constant in first three days of preimplantation development.
      Significant alterations in mtDNA are not initiated until after day 5 when the embryo has
      undergone the first cellular differentiation into trophectoderm (TE) and inner cell mass. It
      is possible that mtDNA variation may account chromosomal abnormalities by affecting the
      accuracy of chromosome segregation.

      In addition to describing the relationship between mtDNA expression and clinical outcomes,
      Reprogenetics and Fragouli et al. (2015) were able to establish a threshold over which no
      clinical pregnancy was established. These results were further validated in a prospective
      blinded study and independently validated using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis.
      The quantification of mtDNA therefore provides important information in selecting the best
      embryos for transfer. MitoGradeTM is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based method
      developed to quantify the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) present in human
      preimplantation embryos. It is believed that a chromosomally normal embryo with a MitoGradeTM
      score lower than the established threshold will have a higher chance of successful
      implantation in comparison to a similar embryo with a higher MitoGradeTM score.
