  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to assess the impact of an educational video on the use of
      prescription opioid medication during a 6-month period following spine surgery. Subjects will
      be recruited from the pool of patients coming in for the pre-operative appointment prior to
      spine surgery. Patients that consent and enroll will be randomized to receive either a brief
      educational video at this appointment or usual care. Patients will be followed after surgery
      weekly for the first month, and then again at 6 months to determine their prescription opioid
      medication utilization patterns. Prescription data will also be pulled from electronic
      medical records.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After consenting, meeting inclusion criteria, and enrollment, all participants will complete
      several standard self-report questionnaires related to medical history, social demographic,
      and psychosocial variables that are related to low back pain, and often used in clinics that
      manage patients with low back pain. They will then be randomized to either receive the
      education, or only usual care (which is the typical information the surgeon provides the
      patient verbally during the pre-operative appointment). All patients will receive the usual
      care education from their surgeon.

      Education Group:

      The educational video is a whiteboard style patient-centric video. The content of the
      education focus on providing a historical perspective for opioid prescription from the time
      when the risk of dependence was highly underestimated. The video discusses the current
      evidence for the effect of opioid medications in non-cancer on-acute pain. It also discusses
      some of the dangers of long-term opioid usage.

      All Subjects:

      All subjects will receive the usual care education that is typically given by their surgeon.
      That will be left up to the discretion of each surgeon.

      All patients will proceed with the surgical procedure as planned. Each week during the
      1-month period after the surgery, patients will be contacted, and then again at 6 months to
      ask history of prescription opioid utilization.

    <measure>Modified Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The ODI is a 10-item scale with higher numbers indicating greater disability. Each item has 6 possible questions (0-5), which are then summed and multiplied to provide a % score out of 100%.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 0-10 numeric pain rating scale ('0' indicating no pain, and '10' worst imaginable pain) will be used to assess pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is a 13-item patient-report scale developed to measure the extent to which people catastrophize in response to pain. Each item is scored from 0 ('not at all') to 4 ('all the time'). The PCS is reported as a total score, with higher scores indicating greater catastrophizing, and is composed of three sub-scales: Rumination, Magnification, and Helplessness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ will be used to measure patients' beliefs about how physical activity and work may affect their pain and perceived risk for re-injury. The FABQ contains two subscales; a 7-item work subscale (FABQW), and 4-item physical activity subscale (FABQPA). Higher scores represent higher levels of fear avoidance beliefs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measures the quality and patterns of sleep in the older adult. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep by measuring seven domains: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. Higher scores indicate greater sleep impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI was created to measure pain related disability associated with activities of daily living in people with neck pain. Each item is scored on a 6-point scale and can reach a maximum score of 5; therefore, the maximum score is 50. Higher scores indicating higher levels of disability. Content, construct validity and reliability of the NDI has been previously shown in patients with neck pain. The MCID has been established as a change of 13% (or 6.5 points).</description>
