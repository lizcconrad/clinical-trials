    <textblock>
      The studied pathology concerns post traumatic cervical spinal cord contusion on narrow spinal
      canal.

      The pathophysiology remains controversial. This pathology does not enjoy consensus support.
      Many questions remain regarding the surgical care and its delay.

      The purpose of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of early surgical treatment
      compared to the same surgery performed with a delay among patients identified as having a
      cervical spinal cord contusion on posttraumatic narrowed cervical canal.

      In the current state of knowledge and practices, the treatment of post traumatic spinal cord
      contusions on narrow spinal canal spinal decompression is performed remote diagnosis. The
      generally accepted delay is 15 days.

      The surgical technique is a conventional cervical spinal decompression surgery. The type of
      decompression (anterior or posterior) is dependent on the compression and therefore the
      clinical radiological analysis. The choice of the technique and the surgical approach are
      therefore left to the discretion of the surgeon.

      After completion of the clinical and radiological diagnosis of post-traumatic spinal cord
      contusion on narrow spinal canal, the patient was hospitalized in intensive care or in the
      Neurosurgery Service of the University Hospital concerned.

      After anesthetic consultation determining the feasibility or not of surgery and in the
      absence of other vital injury or involving life-threatening, early surgery within 48 hours of
      diagnosis is then considered (according to the assigned group).

      The surgical technique is a conventional cervical spinal decompression surgery. Way posterior
      surgery, laminectomy for spinal stenosis significant if greater than or equal to 3 floors
      will be preferred. In other cases, the type of surgery will be at the discretion of the
      surgeon and the opinion of the Staff Neurosurgery.

      The surgical procedure is identical in the two groups. Alone, the delay of the surgery varies
      : less than 48 hours for the first group and 15 days for the second.

      During the different monitoring visits (D0 (surgery), D7, M3, Y1 and Y2), the following
      criteria will be assessed : the quality and quickness of the motor and sensory recovery, the
      early post-operative evolution and the long and medium term evolution but also disability and
      functional sequelaes.

    <description>Assessment of the motor skills of upper and lower limbs using the score ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association). The primary outcome measure is the Total Motor Score (Score ASIA) at 2 years : difference between the initial score ASIA at the inclusion visit and the score ASIA at 2 years. This is a functional scale divided into four assessment parameters (motor assessment, perineal assessment, functional assessment - neurological level and sensory evaluation.
The realization of the ASIA score evaluates functional disability of a patient.</description>
