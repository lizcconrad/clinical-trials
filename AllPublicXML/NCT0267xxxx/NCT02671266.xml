      The purpose of the current study is to investigate the effect of an acute administration of
      intranasal oxytocin, relative to placebo, on social cognitive impairments among individuals
      with body dysmorphic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, compared to healthy
      controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the development of efficacious pharmacologic and psychological treatments body
      dysmorphic disorder (BDD), treatment outcome data suggest that there is still considerable
      room for improvement. A closer examination of biological mechanisms underlying
      psychopathology may help uncover mechanisms to target during intervention and thereby provide
      a novel approach to treatment. Given that the neuropeptide, oxytocin, is involved in the
      regulation of a variety of social and cognitive dimensions, including emotion recognition and
      social attentional processing, there are direct implications regarding its role in the
      development of such deficits among individuals with BDD. The current study therefore aims to
      investigate the effect of oxytocin administration on social cognitive impairments in BDD and
      a related disorder, OCD. Twenty treatment-seeking male and female outpatients with BDD, 20
      individuals with OCD, and 20 healthy participants will be assigned to receive an oxytocin and
      placebo nasal spray one week apart. During each visit, subjects will complete a series of
      tasks to measure emotion recognition, attentional biases, interpretive biases, and trust
      behavior. Importantly, these findings may show that a single administration of oxytocin may
      alter social cognitive processes thought to maintain BDD, and ultimately inform treatments
      for BDD.

    <measure>Emotion Recognition Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>45 minutes post nasal spray administration</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 48 items for 2 conditions- a self-referent and other-referent condition. Total scores will be calculated by the number of correct responses on each condition of the ERQ. Total scores range from 0 to 24 for each condition of the questionnaire.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interpretation Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 45 minutes post nasal spray administration</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire includes 33 ambiguous scenarios, each with 3 possible thoughts that may come to mind in the scenarios which reflect positive, negative, and neutral interpretations. Participants will be asked to rate the likelihood of having each of the thoughts on a scale of 0 to 4. Average ratings for positive, negative, and neutral interpretations will be calculated for each participant.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disengagement from threat cues in a spatial cueing task</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 45 minutes post nasal spray administration</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome measure will be difference scores in response latencies on disengagement trials for disgust versus neutral cues. Difference scores will be calculated as response latencies during disengagement trials for disgust cues minus response latencies during disengagement trials for neutral cues.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of initial monetary transfer during trust game</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 45 minutes post nasal spray administration</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will have the decision of sending up to 10 game dollars to another participant, without any expectation of monetary return. This initial investment amount will serve as a measure of trust.</description>
