  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research uses a multi-phase approach to adapt and implement an established intervention,
      Critical Time Intervention, for a new population and setting among individuals with
      co-occurring substance use and mental health problems who are at risk of relapse following
      residential substance abuse treatment. The goals of the study are to: (PHASE 1) identify
      challenges and strategies of community reentry among individuals with co-occurring problems
      in residential substance abuse treatment and their providers and social support networks
      (e.g., family, friends, community members); (PHASE 2) adapt CTI for individuals with
      co-occurring disorders in residential substance abuse treatment to prepare them for discharge
      and transition back into the community; and (PHASE 3) conduct a pilot study to examine the
      feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of the adapted CTI compared to enhanced
      usual discharge planning services.

    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      outcomes of the adapted CTI compared to enhanced usual discharge planning services. More
      specifically, 60 participants will be randomized to either CTI (n=30) or enhanced usual
      discharge planning services (n=30) at the time of discharge. Participants in the CTI group
      will receive pre-discharge preparation and planning services, as usual, in addition to 9
      months of assertive outreach and support following discharge. Participants in the enhanced
      usual discharge services group will receive pre-discharge preparation and planning services
      and three telephone recovery check-up calls following discharge. Participants will complete a
      baseline interview (prior to randomization) and 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up assessments
      post-discharge. All participants will be invited to participate in gender and
      program-specific focus groups to explore barriers and facilitators to transition and the
      support received. This means that separate focus groups will be conducted for the CTI and
      enhanced usual discharge groups and for women and men. The investigators expect to conduct
      four focus groups: one for women in CTI, one for women in usual discharge services, one for
      men in CTI, and one for men in enhanced usual discharge services.
