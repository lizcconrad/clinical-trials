    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this Phase 2 study is that at least 1 dose regimen of DS-1971a will
      demonstrate clinical superiority to placebo in managing pain associated with DPNP, and will
      be generally well tolerated.

          -  HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and &lt; 9% at screening.

          -  On a stable anti-diabetic medication regimen (unchanged dose over the last 3 months
             for diabetes) prior to screening (insulin therapy is acceptable); no recent (i.e.,
             within the previous 6 months) hospitalizations due to noncompliance or uncontrolled
             diabetes or introduction of new medications.

          -  ADPS of ≥ 4 on the 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) over the past 7 days prior to
             randomization (based on completion of at least 4 daily pain diaries during the 7-day
             baseline period prior to randomization).

          -  Painful distal symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy diagnosed for at least 6 months
             (positive Douleur Neuropathique 4 [DN4] questionnaire at screening).

             (e.g., severe hypotension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction)
             or any other concurrent disease within 12 months prior to screening that in the
             opinion of the Investigator would interfere with study participation or assessment of
             safety and tolerability.

          -  Subjects who present with active cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             infection.

          -  Creatinine clearance rate &lt; 60 mL/min.

             questions about suicidal ideation/intent/behaviors occurring within the past 12 months

          -  Other sources of pain that may confound assessment or self-evaluation of DPNP such as
             disseminated osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.

          -  Neurologic disorders unrelated to diabetic peripheral neuropathy that may confound the
             assessment of DPNP.

             diabetes mellitus.

             duration of the trial.

          -  Use of concomitant medications (i.e., opioids, tricyclic anti-depressives, and/or
             gamma retinoids) that may confound assessments of efficacy and/or safety.

          -  Inability or unwillingness to discontinue any other prohibited concomitant medications
             (see Section 5.6).

          -  Abuse or dependence on prescription medications, street drugs, or alcohol within the
