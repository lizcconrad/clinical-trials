    <textblock>
      To evaluate the accuracy of the Flash Glucose Monitoring system (FGM), Abbot FreeStyle Libre,
      used today in clinical practice in Sweden in estimating plasma glucose levels. Data will be
      collected in ambulatory patients with type 1 diabetes to determine safety, accuracy, and
      reliability.

    <description>Each patient with Type 1 diabetes will have a subcutaneous tissue FGM sensor inserted. The sensor will produce a maximum of 1440 tissue fluid glucose measurements per 24 hours and 20160 measurements during the 14 day study. The FGM data (Abbott Freestyle Libre) will be compared to the time-matched reference blood glucose measurements.
Each ambulatory patient will sample capillary blood with the HemoCue meter and measure the concentration of glucose 6 to 10 times per day for 14 days. The concentration of finger-stick capillary blood glucose will be measured using the self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) hemocue meter in their daily living. The subjects will record SMBG, in a written diary. Subjects will dose insulin according to their routine methods throughout the 14 day study.</description>
