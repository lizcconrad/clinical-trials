    <textblock>
      Worldwide, headache disorders are among the most common medical conditions. Many people with
      headache need not experience further pain if the diagnosis and treatment are correct. Most
      patients do not have correct diagnosis and treatment. This study tested a model for treatment
      of people with headache disorders at primary health-care level in rural areas of Haryana,
      India.
