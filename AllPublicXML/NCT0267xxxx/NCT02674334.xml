  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to use Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring on
      participants undergoing shoulder surgery in the beach chair position (BCP) to determine
      cerebral desaturation events (CDE) and to further determine cognitive changes pre and post
      surgery using the Mini Mental State Exam.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, investigators used a standardized
      anesthesia protocol to maintain the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) during surgeries done in the
      Beach Chair Position (BCP). Investigators hypothesized that, if the MAP was maintained, Near
      Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring would not change intra-operative anesthesia
      management and would not affect the post-operative cognitive outcomes of participants
      undergoing surgery in the beach chair position. Investigators secondarily wanted to document
      the actual incidence of cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) recorded by NIRS occurring in
      participants placed in the BCP if the MAP was strictly maintained.

      <recruitment_details>Participants were informed of the study in the Orthopaedic clinic at the visit prior to surgery. The consent form and pre- and post-testing using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was reviewed. Following consent, the baseline MMSE was administered. A score below 24 disqualified participants. Recruitment began October 2012 and ended May 2013.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Excluded reasons: anesthesiologist availability; surgery started early; illiteracy; less than 24 on the pre-operative MMSE; supine and BCP; no surgery; surgery delayed; operating suite could not accommodate NIRS monitor; data not recorded; previous difficult intubation; surgeon in two operating suites simultaneously; not needed, quota met.</pre_assignment_details>
