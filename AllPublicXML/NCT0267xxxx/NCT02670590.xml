  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators perform a counseling intervention study (6 months) in adult subjects with
      evidence of Fatty Liver by Ultrasound, graded 0-3 according to the Bright Liver Score (BLS);
      exclusion criteria are diabetes, renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate &lt; 90
      ml/min), cancer, heart failure &gt; II NYHA ( New York Heart Association) Class), chronic virus
      hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Insulin resistance was assessed as homeostasis model
      assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) . Suggestions and advice on individual &quot;healthy&quot; food
      purchase, storage, and cooking were given. Reliable feedback and evidence of patients'
      adherence were obtained by scheduled dietician's interviews. Investigators will challenge the
      predictive effects of the Adherence to Mediterranean Diet, of Western dietary profile score
      and of increased physical activity at 6 months in a body mass index changes-balanced model to
      detect independent effects, if any, of the studied variable on NAFLD persistence,
      amelioration or disappearance. Threshold and odds of Mediterranean and Western dietary
      profile score will be calculated by contingency tables and receiver operator characteristic
      curve (ROC) analysis..
