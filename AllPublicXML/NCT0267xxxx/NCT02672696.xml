      The aim of the study is to compare Tip-Apex Distance values in two groups of patients after
      intramedullary nailing of proximal femur. The first group of patients is operated with the
      help of a 3D reconstruction device connected to the standard fluoroscopy allowing the surgeon
      to visualize directly the exact position of the tip of the trans-cervical screw while the
      second group (which is the reference-group) is operated with the help of fluoroscopy alone.

    <textblock>
      The main orthopedic complication after fixation of a proximal femoral fracture with a
      cephalo-medullary nail is the cut-out of the cephalic screw from femoral head resulting in a
      protrusion of this screw in the coxo-femoral joint, mostly during the first 6 months after
      the operation. In most cases, the surgeon has to remove the primary implant and perform a
      total hip arthroplasty to his patient, therefore rising the morbidity and social costs linked
      to the treatment of the initial fracture.

      Baumgartner showed the importance of the position of the cephalic screw for predicting
      failure of the implant and proposed a new measurement to evaluate this position, the tip-apex
      distance which is the sum of the distance from the tip of the cephalic screw to the apex of
      the femoral head on an anteroposterior radiograph and this distance on a lateral radiograph,
      after controlling for magnification. He showed a lower TAD was associated with a lower risk
      of cut-out.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the help of a 3D reconstruction software linked to the
      standard fluoroscopy in achieving the lowest TAD and therefore minimizing the cut-out rate.
