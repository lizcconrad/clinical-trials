  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An acute, randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded crossover study in health subjects.
      Participants will complete 4 intervention arms in random order consisting of a placebo
      control beverage, a high dose phenolic beverage, a high dose phenolic beverage combined with
      a fruit extract, and a low does phenolic beverage. The primary objective of the study is to
      assess the effects of the phenolic compounds, at two different levels, alone and in
      combination with a fruit extract, on mood and cognitive performance during extended periods
      of cognitively demanding task performance.
