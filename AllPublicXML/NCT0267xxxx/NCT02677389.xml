    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well survivorship care plan works in
      promoting technology-based physical activity in breast or colorectal cancer survivors in
      Wisconsin. A survivorship care plan may help doctors to better understand how they can help
      people who have been diagnosed with cancer to become more physically active. It is not yet
      known whether a standardized cancer survivor plan used as part of routine care or a
      technology-based physical activity intervention is better in promoting physical activity in
      breast or colorectal cancer survivors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish the feasibility of enrolling breast and colorectal cancer survivors along with a
      co-survivor into a randomized physical activity promotion trial.

      II. Determine the short-term effect of an enhanced survivorship care plan (SCP) compared to
      the standard SCP on objectively-measured physical activity among survivors and co-survivors.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (Enhanced SCP): Participants receive an enhanced SCP, comprised of a personalized
      document that summarizes treatment and follow up recommendations, including basic physical
      activity guidance. Participants also receive a copy of the United States Department of
      Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as well as standardized emails with
      wellness tips and information on stress management provided from the American Heart
      Association's website on &quot;Healthy Habits&quot; at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Specific topics in emails
      include &quot;positive self-talk&quot;, &quot;daily relaxation breathing techniques&quot;, &quot;better sleep&quot;, and
      &quot;ways to find pleasure&quot;. Participants also wear a Fitbit web-integrated physical activity
      tracker daily for 12 weeks and receive email feedback specific to each participant based on a
      series of factors, including their Fitbit data, Emails may provide encouragement, such as
      &quot;keep up the good work&quot;, and/or very specific instructions regarding compliance with the
      intervention, goals for meeting physical activity goals, potential strategies to
      increase/maintain levels of physical activity, etc., and technical or how-to support
      including how to use the device and website, or questions about goal-setting.

      ARM II (Control): Participants receive a standard SCP, comprised of a personalized document
      that summarizes treatment and follow up recommendations, including basic physical activity
      guidance. Participants also receive a copy of the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as
      well as standardized emails with wellness tips and information on stress management provided
      from the American Heart Association's website on &quot;Healthy Habits&quot; at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
      Specific topics in emails include &quot;positive self-talk&quot;, &quot;daily relaxation breathing
      techniques&quot;, &quot;better sleep&quot;, and &quot;ways to find pleasure&quot;.

                  the past 5 years; bilateral or multiple primary breast cancers are permitted;
                  individuals who have had more than one type of cancer (e.g., both breast and
                  melanoma) are permitted as long as the breast (or colorectal) diagnosis meets the
                  other criteria and primary treatment for any cancer is not ongoing

               -  Have completed primary treatment for their cancer; primary treatment will be
                  defined as having completed all (a) definitive cancer surgery, (b) (neo)adjuvant
                  chemotherapy, and/or (c) (neo)adjuvant radiation; breast cancer patients still
                  receiving adjuvant endocrine or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
                  targeted therapies are eligible, as would colon cancer patients receiving a
                  targeted agent; if there is any question whether a patient meets this eligibility
                  requirement, Dr. Tevaarwerk (co-I, Oncology) will adjudicate

               -  Are willing to attempt increase in physical activity level

               -  Have a co-survivor (friend or family member) willing to participate in this
