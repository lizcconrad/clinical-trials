  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim is to assess impact of alveolar recruitment manoeuvres (ARM) on stroke
      volume variation, evaluated by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE). These variations
      will be measured on preload dependency or preload independency status. The principal purpose
      is to determine if variations of stroke volume during standardized ARM can predict the
      preload dependency status.

      Population studied: anesthetized patients for cardiac surgery of coronary bypass.

      Secondary endpoints : - comparison between TEE and mini-invasive monitoring systems in
      accuracy of measurement of stroke volume variation during ARM. These mini-invasive systems
      are : Clearsight system (Edwards Lifescience) and Flotrac system (Edwards Lifescience)

      - Difference between pre and post-cardiopulmonary bypass status on principal purpose
      evaluation
