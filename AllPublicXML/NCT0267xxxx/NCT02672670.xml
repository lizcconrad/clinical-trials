    <textblock>
      The aim of this proposed PhD study is to test the effectiveness of a newly developed
      coping-oriented supportive programme (COSP) for Chinese people with SCI during their early
      period of inpatient rehabilitation in Xi'an, China. The objectives of this study are to
      develop and validate the COSP in the inpatient rehabilitation hospitals; and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of this COSP for the SCI inpatients in two rehabilitation wards on their coping
      abilities, self-efficacy, mood status, and life satisfaction, when compared to those
      receiving routine care in another two rehabilitation wards. This proposed PhD study is a
      quasi-experimental study, using repeated-measures, comparison group design. The study will be
      conducted in two rehabilitation hospitals in Xi'an, China. There will be 50 patients in each
      of the two study groups (i.e., one intervention and one comparison group). The intervention
      group will receive the COSP including 8 weekly sessions, and the comparison group will
      receive usual rehabilitation care in brief didactic group-based education. Outcome measures
      will be examined at baseline and immediately, 1- and 3-month after completion of the
      interventions. The primary outcomes of this proposed study are coping ability and
      self-efficacy, while the secondary outcomes include mood status, life satisfaction, and pain.
      All data will be analysed using SPSS for Windows, version 21.0. Descriptive statistics will
      be employed for demographic and disease-related data and outcome scores. Data analysis for
      intervention effects will be based on both Per-protocol (PP) analyses and Intention-To-Treat
      (ITT). The missing data will be handled by the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)
      strategy. Inferential statistics will be conducted for between-group and within-group
      comparison with specific considerations with the measurement level of the data and the
      fulfillment of the statistical assumptions of parametric or non-parametric tests, and further
      consider to use multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) or the analysis of covariance
      (ANCOVA).This study will provide evidence on the clinical effectiveness of the
      coping-oriented supportive programme in improving patients' psychological adjustment to SCI
      during earlier stage of inpatient rehabilitation, enhancing their psychosocial adaptation to
      the illness and subsequent life satisfaction and hence, integrating this psychosocial
      intervention into the conventional treatment and SCI rehabilitation practices.

    <description>Coping-oriented supportive programme: education of the SCI disease information, learning from role model by watching a well-established DVD, discussion about how to break down stressors and used appropriate coping strategies (problem-solving training, cognitive re-constructing, relaxation exercises, and activity scheduling) to manage the stressors relating to SCI. Social skills training and ways of maintaining and improving social support will also be discussed and practiced in the COSP.</description>

    <description>Usual rehabilitation care--routine inpatient rehabilitation care and brief education in groups (structured by both the rehabilitation nurses and the researcher), which will consist of similar professional contacts as the intervention (COSP) group, and thus can balance between the two study groups for the effect of social contacts and attention to SCI patients during group sessions. The intervention in the comparison group will be conducted by a rehabilitation nurse in the SCI wards. The knowledge/didactic education presented to the patients in the comparison group will be the basic health education and relevant information provided by the rehabilitation nurses in their routine care (mainly including knowledge of SCI, nutritional needs, skin care, bowel and bladder training, and other physical and psychological care of patients with SCI provided by the inpatient rehabilitation wards).</description>
