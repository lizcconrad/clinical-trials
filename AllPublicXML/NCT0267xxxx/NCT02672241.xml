      Nimotuzumab (h-R3), a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 antibody that binds
      to the extracellular domain of EGFR, which blocks the binding of EGF and transforming growth
      factor-α to EGFR. High expression of EGFR protein in glioma has been associated with tumor
      progression and enhanced tumorigenicity. Several clinical trials have demonstrated the
      anti-tumor effects of nimotuzumab, such as head and neck cancer and esophageal cancer15. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nimotuzumab in combination of
      radio-chemotherapy for the treatment of brainstem tumors in children.

    <description>Radiotherapy: The total radiation dose is 52.2Gy (1.8Gy fractions). Chemotherapy: Nimotuzumab, given during radiotherapy, is administered via intravenous drip with a dosage of 150mg/m2, weekly, for 6 consecutive weeks. After radiotherapy and evaluation, disease progression-free patients will continue to receive Nimotuzumab treatment biweekly until disease relapse or progression. Temozolomide is applied to these patients as a chemotherapy drug with a dosage of 75mg/m2, daily. The chemotherapy and radiation therapy are combined as temozolomide is taken 1 hour prior to every fraction of radiotherapy. In 4 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, temozolomide is given for 8 cycles.</description>
