      Introduction: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, autoimmune disease, characterized by
      demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system. The progressive course of
      this disease may cause individuals to develop extreme dependency and create serious
      difficulties both to the individuals themselves and family members and caregivers, since the
      disease brings a number of physical, emotional, psychological and social symptoms. Therefore,
      it is essential to offer healthcare practices that go beyond the usually fragmenting,
      dehumanized care services that focus on the disease bodily processes.

      Objective: Evaluate the effects of Progressive Muscle Relaxation on sleep quality and on
      stress and depression levels of individuals with multiple sclerosis.

      Methodology: This is randomized clinical test. The sample was made up of 40 individuals with
      multiple sclerosis (20 in control group and 20 in the experimental group) in outpatient
      follow-up. The progressive muscle relaxation technique was employed. In order to collect the
      data, we adopted the interview with form filling technique, using the Pittsburgh Sleep
      Quality Index, Perceived Stress Scale and Beck Depression Inventory. Blood pressure, heart
      rate and respiratory rate of experimental group were measured before and after the
      progressive muscle relaxation intervention. In order to treat statistical data, we used
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 19.0.

They will be measured heart rate, respiratory rate and blood pressure. Participants will be guided to realize the Progressive Muscle Relaxation daily for 8 weeks, the time of day you feel more comfortable. the same receive education and training as the technical as well as a audio and a leaflet with the description the stages of the Progressive Muscle Relaxation.</description>
