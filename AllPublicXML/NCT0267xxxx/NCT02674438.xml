  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a condition where the heart pump does not function normally causing the
      lungs to become congested. The primary symptom of heart failure is shortness of breath, and
      this often leads to patients visiting the emergency department for care. Decision-making in
      the emergency department is a high-stakes situation, where there is a need for decision
      support to guide clinicians to make better decisions about admission to hospital or discharge
      home. Many low-risk patients who could potentially be managed at home are admitted to
      hospital whereas some patients who are thought safe to discharge are actually high risk and
      will have adverse outcomes if they are discharged home from the emergency department.

      In this trial, the investigators will study a new strategy for heart failure care, comprised
      of a computer algorithm to help doctors make decisions in the emergency department about the
      risk of their patient. For low-risk patients who are discharged home from the emergency
      department or after a short hospital stay, patients will be referred to a rapid follow-up
      clinic where the heart specialist team will rapidly assess and treat patients.

      Overview: Randomized intervention trial to examine the impact of an acute heart failure
      strategy, which incorporates risk stratification and rapid outpatient care after discharge.

      Study Population: Patients presenting to the emergency department with heart failure will be
      eligible for study inclusion.

      Intervention: The study involves 2 components: clinical algorithm for prognostication and
      post-discharge follow-up in the Rapid Ambulatory Program for Investigation and Diagnosis of
      Heart Failure (RAPID-HF) clinic.

      The clinical decision-support algorithm intervention is a composite of the Emergency Heart
      failure Mortality Risk Grade (EHMRG) 7-day and the EHMRG 30-day (EHMRG30-ST) risk score.
      Using the EHMRG/EHMRG30-ST algorithm, patients will be categorized as high, intermediate, or
      low risk. The decision support algorithm will recommend hospital admission or
      discharge/observation based on patient risk to assist clinicians making the final decision to
      admit or discharge.

      Patients referred to RAPID-HF will be assessed ideally within 48 hours of discharge. RAPID-HF
      provides transitional care for up to 30 days after discharge. After 30-days, care is
      transferred to primary care provider or specialist for ongoing care.

      Study Design: Using a stepped-wedge design, participating sites will be randomized to the
      active intervention. At each step, hospitals that have not yet been randomized will serve as
      control sites.

    <description>Two components to the intervention: (1) clinical algorithm for prognostication, and (2) post-discharge follow-up in the RAPID-HF clinic
Intervention #1 - Clinical algorithm: the EHMRG 7-day and EHMRG30-ST risk scores, which will be used to categorize patients as high, intermediate, or low risk. The clinical algorithm will be used to guide clinicians to decide on admission to hospital, observation, or emergency department discharge.
Intervention #2 - Referral to RAPID-HF (Rapid Ambulatory Program for Investigation and Diagnosis of HF) transitional care clinic: visit to RAPID-HF within 48 hours of discharge. Care provided in RAPID-HF by cardiologist + nurse for up to 30 days from date of discharge.</description>
