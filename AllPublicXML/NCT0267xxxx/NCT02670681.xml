    <textblock>
      The aim of this intervention study is to evaluate the acute and chronic effects of different
      intensity (mild, moderate and high intensity) of aerobic exercise on blood pressure levels of
      subjects classified as resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertensives subjects aged 40 to
      70, men or women with body mass index lower that 40 kg/m² are recruited and subjected in
      acute phase in three sessions of aerobic exercise: mild, moderate, high intensity; and
      session control. After, the subjects will be randomly allocated into four intervention
      groups: mild intensity group, moderate intensity group, high intensity group and control
      group. In both phases, the subjects have blood pressure data recorded by ambulatory blood
      pressure monitoring, for clinic and ambulatory analysis. In addition, continuously be
      registered biological signs of blood pressure (finometer), electrocardiogram (DII derivation)
      and blood flow (venous occlusion plethysmography) for analysis of cardiac autonomic
      modulation, vascular autonomic modulation, baroreflex sensitivity, vasodilator response and
      peripheral vascular resistance.
