    <textblock>
      Few but persistent wounds often remain even after successful hematopoietic cell
      transplantation for systemic genodermatosis epidermolysis bullosa (EB). The investigators
      propose local wound therapy using epidermal skin grafting from the same donor that provided
      the hematopoietic graft, or from the same EB individual with a mosaic (naturally gene
      corrected) skin. In both cases permissive immune system and skin chimerism is expected to
      enable long-term epidermal engraftment and wound healing. The investigators will use FDA
      approved vacuum device (CelluTome®, Regulation number 878.4820) that enables scar-free
      harvesting of epidermis and its transfer on a square of surgical tape (Tegaderm®) to the
      recipient as a wound dressing.

             Epidermolysis Bullosa (JEB) with at least one wound, visibly free from infection (or
             previously treated) and meets the eligibility for Arm A or Arm B based on the skin
             graft source:

          -  Cell harvest from previous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) donor (Arm A) -
