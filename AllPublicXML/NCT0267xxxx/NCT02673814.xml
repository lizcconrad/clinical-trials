      The primary purpose of this research study is to see whether adding bavituximab (an
      investigational drug) to durvalumab will improve the results of the treatment for
      non-small-cell lung cancer.

             alanine aminotransferase [ALT] ≤2.5 × ULN, and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤2.5 ×
             ULN)

             serum pregnancy test upon study entry

          -  All patients of reproductive potential (ie, not surgically sterile or postmenopausal)
             must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception during and 90 days after
             the end of study treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

             hemophilia)

          -  Clinically significant bleeding, such as gross hematuria, gastrointestinal bleeding,
             and hemoptysis within the 6 months before screening, unless the cause has been
             identified and adequately treated (eg, cystitis, ulcer)

          -  Thromboembolic events (eg, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial
             thrombosis) within 6 months before screening

             toxicity

          -  Other active malignancy requiring concurrent intervention.

          -  Acute toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and
