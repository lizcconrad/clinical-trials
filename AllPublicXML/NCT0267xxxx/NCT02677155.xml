  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and is
      often diagnosed in advanced incurable stage. In our previous trail, Lymvac-1, patients were
      treated with sequential intratumoral injections of low-dose rituximab and autologous
      dendritic cells, combined with local radiotherapy at the same site. The aim was to overcome
      tumor tolerance. In this trial, clinical responses correlated strongly with systemic
      anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses detected in blood after therapy. The primary aim of the
      planned study (Lymvac-2) is to significantly improve rates of immunological and clinical
      responses by adding iv anti-PD-1 antibody (Pembrolizumab) relative to the cohort of patients
      previously treated with intranodal immunotherapy without Pembrolizumab (Lymvac-1). The study
      includes 20 patients with untreated or relapsed FL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with advanced stage follicular lymphoma, untreated and relapsed are eligible for
      this study. Staging includes PET/CT, CT and bone marrow specimens. Lymphoma nodes must be
      available for surgical biopsy, radiation and intranodal treatment. Additionally, there must
      be evaluable lesions for measuring systemic effects. The patient undergo leukapheresis for
      collection of monocytes then cultured ex vivo to obtain immature dendritic cells (DC). The
      treatment targets single lymphoma nodes with radiation (single fraction of 8 Gy),
      ultrasound-guided injections of autologous DCs , low-dose rituximab (5 mg) and GM-CSF sc.
      This sequential intranodal immunotherapy (SIIT) is repeated three times, targeting different
      lymphoma nodes. Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (Pembrolizumab) is given iv at each cycle of
      SIIT and then every third week for a total of 11 cycles. Patients are evaluated for clinical
      response with PET/CT, CT and bone marrow analysis. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against
      autologous tumor cells are measured in blood after treatment by flow cytometry. The primary
      aims are to induce systemic clinical responses and correlated T cell responses which may
      prolong time to next standard therapy.
