      Disulfiram (Antabuse®) is a well-tolerated, cheap, generic drug that has been in use since
      the 1950s to treat alcoholism. There is now an increasing amount of independent preclinical
      data to support disulfiram as an anticancer agent. The potency of disulfiram as an anticancer
      agent seems strengthened by copper.

      The investigators aim is to investigate disulfiram and copper-supplement as add-on treatment
      in glioblastoma patients with recurrence receiving alkylating chemotherapy.

      Disulfiram (Antabuse®) is a well-tolerated, cheap, generic drug that has been in use since
      the 1950s to treat alcoholism. There is now an increasing amount of independent preclinical
      data to support disulfiram as an anticancer agent. The potency of disulfiram as an anticancer
      agent seems strengthened by copper. There is now anecdotal clinical evidence of disulfiram as
      an anticancer agent. So far no clinical studies have been published in glioma patients, but
      two small, uncontrolled studies are planned according to clinicaltrials.gov. with search 1st
      November 2015.

      The investigators aim to investigate disulfiram and copper-supplement as add-on treatment in
      glioblastoma patients with recurrence receiving alkylating chemotherapy. The study will be
      performed as a multicenter RCT including patients in Norway and Sweden. This will serve as a
      proof-of concept study.

      The primary end-point is survival at 6 months

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A previous diagnosis of glioblastoma (histologically verified) and presenting with a
             first progression/recurrence documented by MRI.

          2. Indication for treatment with chemotherapeutic alkylating agents (i.e. temozolomide OR
             lomustine including PCV treatment).

          3. Age 18 years or older.

          4. Karnofsky performance status of 60 - 100 .

          5. Not receiving another experimental treatment for glioblastoma at the moment of
             inclusion or during active treatment within the assigned group (i.e. control or
             disulfiram group).

          6. Able to take oral medications.

          7. No known allergy to disulfiram or copper.

          8. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL and platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL

          9. Serum/plasma copper and serum ceruloplasmin within institutional limits.

             a. However increased levels are seen together with ongoing acute phase reaction as
             determined by elevated C-reactive protein (ceruloplasmin is elevated as part of the
             same process) it is possible to retest after normalization of C-reactive protein.

         10. Willing to refrain from ingestion of alcoholic beverages while on the study is a
             criteria to be randomized. However, once randomized alcohol abstinence only affects
             the group treated with disulfiram, and in this group it includes the entire period and
             one month after last dosage of disulfiram.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Earlier treatment for progression (e.g. &quot;rescue therapy&quot;)

          2. History of idiopathic seizure disorder, psychosis or schizophrenia.

          3. History of uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. systolic BP &gt; 180 mmHg) and a diagnosis of
             congestive heart failure

          4. Received radiotherapy within the 3 months before the diagnosis of progression .

          5. Addiction to alcohol or drugs.

          6. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.

          7. Women of childbearing potential who do not have negative pregnancy test not older than
             14 days before enrollment.

          8. History of active liver disease, including chronic active hepatitis, viral hepatitis
             (hepatitis B, C and CMV), cholestatic jaundice of any etiology or toxic hepatitis or
             inadequate hepatic function, defined as baseline ASAT and ALAT &gt; 2.5 X upper
             institutional limit and/or bilirubin &gt; 2.0 X upper institutional limit.

          9. History of Wilson's disease or family member with Wilson's disease (unless excluded as
             a carrier by genetic test).

         10. History of hemochromatosis or family member with hemochromatosis (unless excluded as a
             carrier by genetic test).

         11. Nickel hypersensitivity (disulfiram mobilize nickel causing a brief increase in nickel
             concentrations before excretion. The initial increase may lead to hepatitis and
             predisposed patients).

         12. Need for metronidazole, warfarin and/or theophylline medication (the metabolism may be
             influenced by disulfiram).

         13. Patients who are taking medications metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1, including
             chlorzoxazone or halothane and its derivatives (phenytoin, phenobarbital,
             chlordiazepoxide, imipramine, diazepam, isoniazid, metronidazole, warfarin,
             amitriptyline within 14 days prior to the first dose of disulfiram. Of note, lorazepam
             and oxazepam are not affected by the P450 system and are not contraindicated with
             disulfiram).

         14. Unfit for participation for any other reason judged by the including physician.
