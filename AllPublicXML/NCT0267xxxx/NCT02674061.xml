      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in women with
      advanced ovarian cancer who have demonstrated recurrent disease following the front line
      platinum-based treatment and debulking surgery and received up to 5 lines of treatment for
      recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) per local standard of care. Participants will receive
      pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 2 years.

          -  Has received a front line platinum-based regimen (administered via either intravenous
             or intraperitoneal route) per local standard of care or treatment guideline following
             the primary or interval debulking surgery with documented disease recurrence (note:
             Maintenance treatment following the front line treatment is permitted and counted
             together as part of the front line treatment)

          -  Has fulfilled the following additional requirements regarding prior treatments for
             recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) depending on the cohort participant is to be enrolled.
             Each participant must have documented evidence of clinical response or disease
             stabilization to the last regimen received.

               -  Cohort A: Has received 0 to 2 additional prior lines for treating ROC (or 1-3
                  total prior lines counting the front line) and must have a platinum-free interval
                  (PFI) of ≥ 3 to 12 months if the last regimen received is a platinum-based, or a
                  treatment-free interval (TFI) of ≥ 3 to 12 months if the last regimen received is
                  a non-platinum-based

               -  Cohort B: Has received 3 to 5 additional prior lines for treating ROC (or 4-6
                  total prior lines counting the front line) and must have a PFI of ≥ 3 months if
                  the last regimen received is a platinum-based, or a TFI of ≥ 3 months if the last
                  regimen received is a non-platinum-based
