        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pulmonary thrombo-embolism with contraindication to anticoagulation.

          -  Failure of anticoagulant therapy in thrombo-embolic diseases.

          -  Prevention of pulmonary embolism in patients with a recent history ( &lt;3 months) of
             DVT/ PE who need to undergo urgent surgery at high risk of DVT/PE with temporary
             contra-indication to the use of therapeutic doses of anticoagulants.

          -  Emergency treatment following massive pulmonary embolism where anticipated benefits of
             conventional therapy are reduced and

          -  Chronic, recurrent pulmonary embolism where anticoagulant therapy has failed or is
             contraindicated

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The filter should not be implanted in patients with :

               -  A vena cava which has a diameter &lt; 14 mm or &gt; 28 mm (due to the risk of device
                  migration)

               -  Risk of septic embolism

               -  Known allergy to the materials contained in the kit, allergy to contrast media.

               -  Severely disabled patients whose life-expectancy, up to 6 months, appears limited
                  according to the investigator's opinion.

        In addition, exclusion criteria are also extended to :

          -  Patients who cannot be regularly followed up by the participating center

          -  Subject who already has an implanted vena cava filter

          -  Subject who has a duplicated IVC

          -  Subject who has a contrast allergy to both iodinated contrast and non-iodinated
             contrast material

          -  Subject unable to understand information about participation in the study due to a
             language barrier, intellectual deficiency, psychiatric problems…

          -  Subject who has a renal failure (creatinemia clearance &lt; 30ml/min)
