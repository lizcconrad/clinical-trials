      Background: Varus derotation osteotomy (VDRO) is one of the most popular surgical treatments
      for Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease yet its long term results have not been assessed. Our purpose
      was to determine the long term clinical and radiographic outcomes of these patients.

      Methods: Forty patients (43 hips) who had undergone VDRO for LCPD who participated in a long
      term follow-up study a decade ago were approached for the present study.

      All patients were treated in our institution during 1959 to 1983 with proximal VDRO.

      The patients were invited to for a medical interview and a physical examination. They were
      also asked to fill out questionnaires and to provide or undergo a standing anteroposterior
      (AP) pelvic and a lateral hip radiographs during the visit.

      Patients were asked to self-grade their hip pain as none, mild, moderate or severe and to
      grade their back pain using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) between 0-10. Details regarding
      daily function, physical activity, work status and family history were obtained. All
      participants completed the Harris Hip Score (HHS) with a maximum score of 100 and the Short
      Form-36 which is composed of 8 sections and has a maximum score of 100.

      The physical examination included an assessment of the hip range of motion, leg length
      discrepancy and the presence of a Trendelenburg sign.

      Radiographic parameters evaluated were the Tonnis grade (with a score between 0-3), head size
      ratio, and the center-edge (CE) angle.

    <description>The purpose of surgery was to relocate the protruded, deformed femoral head from its lateral position back to the acetabulum to achieve containment. Surgery was preceded by a hip arthrography with dynamic examination to find the suitable containment position and plan the correct osteotomy angles accordingly. A sub trochanteric osteotomy was performed then after in an open or closed wedge form, with fixation in an angle that gave best coverage.</description>
