    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of the Intelligent Retinal Implants System
      (IRIS V2). Blind patient suffering from Retinitis Pigmentosa, Cone Rod Dystrophy, or
      Choroideremia are implanted with an Intelligent Retinal Implant Systeme. All subjects undergo
      ophthalmological examinations in predefined intervals after implantation. Ophthalmological
      examinations include funduscopy, slit lamp examination and OCT. All adverse events are
      recorded and analyzed. Efficacy is measured using functional vision and visual function tests
      before and after implantation as well as with the system on and system off.

             the optic nerve and/or visual cortex related to the projected implanted eye,

          -  Has any disease (other than study allowed diseases) or condition that affects retinal
             function of the study eye (e.g., central retinal artery/vein occlusion, end-stage
             diabetic retinopathy, current or prior retinal detachment, infectious or inflammatory
             retinal disease, etc.),

          -  Has any disease or condition that prevents adequate visualization of the retina of the
             study eye including, but not limited to, corneal degeneration that cannot be resolved
             prior to implantation,

          -  Has any disease or condition of the anterior segment of the study eye that prevents
             adequate physical examination (e.g., ocular trauma, etc.),

          -  Has severe nystagmus,

          -  Has any ocular condition that leads him or her to eye rubbing,

          -  Has any disease or condition that precludes the understanding or communication of the
             informed consent, study requirements or test protocols (e.g., deafness , multiple

          -  Has another active implanted device (e.g. cochlear implant) or any form of metallic
             implant in the head (other than dental work) that may interfere with the device
             function,

          -  Patients with recurrent or chronic inflammations or infections are excluded from the
             study. Specifically patients with the following disorders are excluded:

               -  Chronic inflammation of the skin in the area of the eye (e.g. dermatitis,
                  rosacea, infection of the skin, herpes zoster)

               -  Chronic inflammation in the area of the eye (e.g. herpes of cornea and/or
                  conjunctiva, recurrent blepharoconjunctivitis, hordeolum, chalazion)

          -  Has a severe psychological disorder. When in any doubt, an expert assessment needs to
             be arranged to clarify whether the patient's psychological health is suitable for the
             trial.

          -  Has severe renal, cardiac, hepatic etc. organ diseases.

          -  Has eye AP dimension that are incompatible (less than 20.5 or larger than 25mm) with
             the implant or head dimension that are incompatible with the Visual Interface. Please
             make sure that the size of the eye socket allows an implantation of the extra ocular
             part which has a thickness of 5mm.
