    <textblock>
      Study conducted to confirm phrenic nerve stimulation using the Lungpacer LIVE Catheter,
      confirm capture of the diaphragm and confirm that the diaphragm can be paced in synchrony
      with mechanical ventilator breaths.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if in an anaesthetized (sedated, intubated and
      mechanically ventilated) subject the LIVE Catheter can be inserted percutaneously and
      activated via the electrical stimulator to stimulate the left and right phrenic nerves
      causing the diaphragm to contract in synchrony with mechanical ventilator breaths via phrenic
      nerve stimulation from a transvenously delivered electrical current.

             pacemaker or defibrillator

          -  Subject has an active systemic infection or local infection at or around the insertion
             site

          -  Subject will be unavailable for, or is unwilling to comply with, follow up
             requirements of the protocol

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in any other study of an investigational drug or device
             who has received treatment under that protocol with the investigational product during
             the 30 days prior to screening.
