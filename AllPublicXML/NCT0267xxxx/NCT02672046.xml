  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate an algorithm to screen patients with a possibility of
      meniscal injury referred to a sports injury outpatient clinic by using patient-reported
      symptoms. It will be investigated whether the algorithm is able to identify which patients
      are deemed relevant to undergo assessment by a physician (i.e. in case the patient need to
      undergo surgery) and which patients are relevant to undergo assessment by a physiotherapist.
      This will be evaluated by estimating the sensitivity of the new algorithm compared to actual
      relevancy based on the traditional clinical assessment of the patients.

    <textblock>
      According to current practice, patients referred to the Clinic of Sports Injuries will be
      assessed by either a physician or a physiotherapist. Current practice will continue unchanged
      during this study.

      Before the scheduled assessment, patients will be asked to fulfill a questionnaire including
      KOOS, a further description of symptoms, previous treatment by physiotherapist and expected
      upcoming treatment (i.e. surgery or referral to physiotherapist).

      An algorithm based on the self-reported information will be used to categorize whether the
      patient are considered relevant to be referred to assessment by a physician or to assessment
      by a physiotherapist.

      After clinical assessment of the patient, the physician or physiotherapist does a
      registration of diagnosis, choice of treatment and complexity. Based on choice of treatment
      and complexity, the patient will be categorized as either relevant to be referred to
      assessment by a physician or to assessment by a physiotherapist. This categorization is by
      definition considered correct.

      The ability of the algorithm will be evaluated by comparing it's categorization to the
      correct result. Sensitivity will be estimated.
