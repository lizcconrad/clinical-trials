      The purpose of the study is to evaluate an algorithm to screen patients with suspected knee
      osteoarthritis referred to an orthopedic outpatient clinic by using radiographs and
      patient-reported symptoms. It will be investigated whether the algorithm is able to identify
      which patients that are deemed relevant to undergo an orthopedic assessment. This will be
      evaluated by estimating the sensitivity of the new algorithm compared to with the traditional
      clinical assessment of the patients.
