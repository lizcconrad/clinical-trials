      This prospective observational study aims to improve the postoperative course after minimally
      invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy (MIP) with stented pancreaticogastrostomy (sPG) for
      pancreatic head or peri-ampullary neoplasms. Patients are submitted to an enhanced recovery
      after surgery (ERAS) program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is the standard of care for patients with malignant or benign
      disease of the pancreatic head or peri-ampullary region. The postoperative course after PD is
      strongly dependent of the occurrence of pancreatic fistula (POPF) and/or delayed gastric
      emptying (DGE). In a recent multicentre randomized controlled trial, the investigators have
      shown pancreaticogastrostomy (PG; without a stent in the pancreatic duct) to be associated
      with 8% POPF rate, significantly lower than pancreaticojejunostomy (20%) (1). Since then, PG
      reconstruction is considered the standard of care in PD, which is also underlined in more
      recent systematic reviews.

      In patients without POPF after PD, the length of hospital stay is determined by the
      occurrence of DGE, which is poorly understood and currently lacks any effective treatment.
      Patients who developed DGE after PD with PG anastomosis (n=18; 20%) had a significantly
      (p=0.014) longer (mean + sem) length of hospital stay (LOS) of 26.3 + 1.58 days, as compared
      to 22.4 + 1.27 days for patients without DGE (n=69). These figures are observed in the
      investigators' center as part of the multicentre RCT.

      Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) or fast-track (FT) programs are able to reduce
      postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS). Indeed recently, ERAS or FT programs have been
      implemented successfully in PD (2). Patients were discharged 4 days earlier in the ERAS
      group, without a negative effect on the clinical outcome.

      Over the last 2 years, the investigators have optimized the PG anastomosis in two ways,
      resulting in even lower POPF rates. First, they have introduced the placement of a plastic
      stent in the pancreatic duct. Second, they have adapted the invaginated PG anastomosis
      technique from separate sutures between the pancreatic capsula and the seromuscular layer of
      the stomach to a new anastomosis technique also called the 'umbrella-technique', i.e.
      separate trans-pancreatic sutures combined with a running suture between the pancreas and the
      posterior wall of the stomach. Additionally, the investigators have implemented minimally
      invasive or laparoscopic surgery with 3D-vision in their pancreatic surgery program, and they
      have performed over 50 minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomies (MIP) over the last 2
      years. The situation they are facing now is an extremely low POPF after 3D- MIP with stented
      pancreaticogastrostomy (sPG), but still with a high rate of DGE (20%) and overall LOS (23 +
      1.07; Standard Deviation 9.9).

      The biliary limb of the hepatico-jejunostomy in MIP is anastomosed in-line with the stomach
      as an iso-peristaltic gastro-enterostomy (Iso-GES). The investigators believe a Roux-en-Y
      reconstruction of the biliary limb of the hepatico-jejunostomy onto the efferent limb of the
      gastro-enterostomy (RY-GES) may reduce the length of hospital stay following MIP with sPG.
