  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The changes to the heart can be evaluated during the course of the chemotherapy with cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and left ventricular (LV) nuclear scans to look at left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Serial LVEF evaluation can detect cardiotoxicity,
      usually after cardiac damage is present and most likely irreversible. Each patient's
      sensitivity to the chemotherapy is different.

      The study is being done to assess the ability of the radiotracer 99mTc-rhAnnexin V-128 to
      image the cell damage from apoptosis, or cell death, in the heart from the effects of the
      chemotherapy. This may allow doctors to identify patients developing cardiotoxicity in the
      future. These patients may then benefit from changes in chemotherapy with dose alterations or
      changes to alternative drugs.
