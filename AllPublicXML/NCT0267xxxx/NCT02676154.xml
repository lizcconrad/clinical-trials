    <textblock>
      This study will be investigating the effects of fesoterodine on autonomic dysreflexia (AD) in
      patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI). The goal of the study is to examine the effect of
      increasing daily use of fesoterodine on episodes of high blood pressure triggered by urinary
      bladder contractions.

      This is a Phase 2, open-label exploratory study investigating the efficacy of fesoterodine
      for treatment of adult patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) with autonomic dysreflexia
      (AD) triggered by neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO).

          -  Chronic traumatic SCI at or above T6 spinal segment and &gt;1 year post injury

          -  Documented presence of AD and NDO during UDS

          -  Hand function sufficient to perform CIC or a committed caregiver to provide CIC for
             management of urinary bladder drainage

          -  Patients must have documented two weeks of bladder and bowel history prior to their
             baseline visit

          -  Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study-related procedures

          -  Able to understand and complete study-related questionnaires (must be able to

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test prior to
             the baseline visit. During the trial, all women of childbearing potential will undergo

             events.

          -  Women of childbearign potential must agree to use adequate contraception during the
             period of the trial and for at least 28 days after completion of treatment. Effective
             contraception includes abstinence.

          -  Sexually active males with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use
             effective contraception during the period of the trial and for at least 28 days after
             completion of treatment

          -  Must Provide Informed Consent

        The exclusion criteria include, but are not limited to, the following:

          -  Presence of severe acute medical issue that in the investigator's judgement would
             adversely affect the patient's participation in the study

          -  A hypersensitivity to tolterodine (available as Detrol, Detrol LA), soya, peanuts, or
             lactose

          -  Recent treatment with intravesical OnabotulinumtoxinA (within 9 months of the baseline
             visit)

          -  Recent treatment with other anticholinergics medications (within 3 weeks of the
             baseline visit)

          -  Use of any medication or treatment that in the opinion of the investigator indicates
             that it is not in the best interest of the patient to participate in this study

          -  Patient is a member of the investigational team or his /her immediate family
