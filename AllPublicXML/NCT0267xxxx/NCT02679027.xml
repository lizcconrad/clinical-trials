      Objectives: The aim of study is to determine the possible usage of tongue movements out of
      the mouth in the prediction of difficult intubation.

      Method: Two hundred twenty three patients undergoing abdominal surgery with general
      anesthesia between 2014 and 2015 were enrolled in this study. Difficult intubation was
      evaluated using the intubation difficulty scale (IDS) score. All intubations were performed
      by anesthesiologist to eliminate the differences among the anesthesiologists' experiences.
      IDS score were evaluated by anesthesiologists who had no idea about the measurements of the
      tongue movements and performed laryngeal intubation in all patients.

      To define the tongue movements, horizontal lines were used. Horizontal line were passing
      through the mid points of mandible and upper lip height. Patients were asked to protrude
      tongue maximally and upward (PTMU), to protrude tongue maximally and downward (PTMD) in
      anatomical neutral position which was sitting down on a chair.

    <description>Intubation difficulty scale score includes 7 variables for difficult intubation. N1: The number of attempts for intubation (for the first attempt 0 point, for the other attempts 1 point each); N2: The number of anesthesiologist for the laryngoscopies (for the first attempt 0 point, for the other attempts 1 point each); N3: Alternative intubation techniques that are used (if not needed 0 point, change of blade type or using blind nasotracheal intubation 1 point each); N4: 1 point less than Cormack and Lehane Classification for defining glottic exposure; N5: The degree of force of lifting laryngoscopy (normal lifting 0 point, more force needed 1 point); N6: Using external laryngeal pressure 1 point; N7: The view of the vocal cords (abduction position 0 point, adduction position 1 point). A score of 0-4 defines easy intubation and an IDS score â‰¥5 defines difficult intubation</description>
