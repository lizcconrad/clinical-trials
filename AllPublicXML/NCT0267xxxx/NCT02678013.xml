  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common and the third leading cause of
      cancer-related death worldwide. Recurrence of tumor within the liver remnant is common, with
      a reported 5-year recurrence rate of 70%. Repeat hepatectomy is an effective treatment for
      intrahepatic HCC but with a small proportion of resection rate because of the poor functional
      liver reserve and postoperative complications. Radiofrequency ablation(RFA) is becoming the
      main effective treatment for small HCC (≤5.0cm). The efficacy of RFA for recurrent HCC has
      been reported to be comparable to those achieved by surgery with minimal, but higher local
      recurrence rate after RFA. It has been reported that immunotherapy in patients who underwent
      curative treatment for HCC, adjuvant immunotherapy with activated CIK cells increased
      recurrence-free and overall survival. But there is little evidence for adjuvant immunotherapy
      of recurrence HCC. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL), a kind of effective T cells that specific
      recognizing and killing antigen targeted cells through cloning amplification after receiving
      antigen information from antigen presented cell and playing key role to clear cancerous
      cells. So our hypothesis is that RFA combined with immunotherapy (Highly-purified CTL) is
      superior to RFA for recurrent HCC. The aim of this prospective study is to compare the
      outcome of RFA combined with immunotherapy (Highly-purified CTL) with RFA for small recurrent
      HCC after partial hepatectomy.

    <description>RFA was performed according to the Guidelines of Radiofrequency Ablation Therapy for Liver Cancer: Chinese Expert Consensus Statement issued by the Chinese Society of Liver Cancer and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology RFA was performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. RFA was performed by using a commercially available Cool-tipTM RFA system (Valleylab, Boulder, CO, USA), or a RF 2000 system (Radio-Therapeutics Mountain View, CA). Grounding was achieved by attaching 2 pads to the patient's back or legs.</description>

    <description>RFA was performed the same as RFA Arm.Peripheral blood (20-30mL) for manufacturing the individualized highly-purified CTL agent was collected from the respective patients who were randomized to the immunotherapy group before starting treatment. The highly-purified CTL agent was prepared at a central manufacturing facility. Patients in the immunotherapy group received 5*10E9 of the highly-purified CTL agent intravenously over 60 minutes without any premedication and then were observed for at least 30 minutes. They were scheduled to receive highly-purified CTL: 4-6 treatments at a frequency of once two-week during 6 months after receiving RFA, followed by 6-9 treatments during 6 months to 2 years after receiving RFA.</description>
