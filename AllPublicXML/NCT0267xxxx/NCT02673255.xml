  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many plasma donation centers have Tetanus immunization programs that are implemented in order
      to collect plasma with high levels of tetanus antibodies. The immunization program requires
      participants to receive multiple tetanus vaccinations over a period of time with the goal of
      hyper-immunizing them to tetanus. Their antibody-rich plasma is then used to manufacture a
      tetanus immunoglobulin product which helps with the prophylaxis and treatment of tetanus
      disease.

      The Tetanus vaccine previously used for these programs is no longer being manufactured.
      Therefore, we must evaluate the safety and efficacy of a different vaccine when used for this
      purpose. The only other FDA approved Tetanus vaccines currently available for adults in the
      US are combination vaccines that also immunize against Diphtheria and/or Pertussis.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate two vaccines that are combinations of Tetanus
      and Diphtheria (Td). Investigators will not evaluate any vaccines containing Pertussis
      antigen. The vaccines to be evaluated are manufactured by MassBiologics and Sanofi Pasteur
      (Tenivac).

      The package insert for these vaccines indicates they should be administered to previously
      vaccinated people once every 10 years. However, this study will evaluate whether they are
      safe and effective for dosing every 90 days.

      The investigators hypothesize that at least 25% of study subjects will have a positive
      response to at least one of the five planned doses. Each vaccine will be evaluated
      separately.

    <description>Number of related adverse events will be compared with prescribing information for the vaccine and with historic data on adverse event rates among Normal Source plasma donors and Hyper-Immunized plasma donors.
