  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to pilot-test an innovative, combined urinary/bowel continence workshop in two
      Wisconsin communities. Between 8-15 women with incontinence will be enrolled in each of the
      two pilot communities and will complete three 90-minute workshop sessions over a 6 week
      period.

  <detailed_description>

      The pilot study will use mixed methods to compare pre- and post-workshop data about urinary
      and bowel incontinence symptoms and care-seeking from workshop participants as well as
      information about workshop acceptability from workshop participants and community partners.
      The study is expected to last 6 months from initial IRB approval through data analysis and
      workshop revision. This research will provide preliminary data for a larger test of this
      workshop in four diverse Wisconsin Communities, followed by a randomized, controlled trial
      and subsequent dissemination research study.
