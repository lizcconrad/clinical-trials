      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of abemaciclib plus trastuzumab
      with or without fulvestrant or chemotherapy in women with hormone receptor positive (HR+),
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) locally advanced or metastatic
      breast cancer after prior exposure to at least two HER2-directed therapies for advanced
      disease.
