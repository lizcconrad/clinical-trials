    <textblock>
      In France, the last national perinatal survey show that 6.6% of live births are premature.
      For these infants, transfer in Neonatology sector may result in mother-child separation can
      last several weeks or months. This hospital can complicate the implementation of the
      attachment process that allows parents to recognize their children as their own, to gain
      confidence in their abilities to deal with them and establish a relationship with him.

      A study of mothers of premature shows the interest of the Brazelton scale to help them
      identify the skills their child and adjust their own behavior.
