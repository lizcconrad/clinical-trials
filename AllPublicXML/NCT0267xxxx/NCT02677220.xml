  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical benefit for patients implanted with the
      Nucleus® CI532 cochlear implant.

      The Nucleus® CI532 has a pre-curved, perimodiolar array, the EA32, which is introduced into
      the cochlea through a straightening sheath.

    <measure>AzBio Sentence Recognition in Noise</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The AzBio Sentence Tests consists of 15 lists of 20 sentences each. AzBio sentences are spoken by different talkers in a conversational style with limited contextual cues that the listener can use to predict or 'fill in' unintelligible words. Each list includes 5 sentences from 4 different male and female speakers. Each word in the sentence counts toward the overall score and the resulting score is presented in percent correct.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glasgow Benefit Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) is a health utility assessment used at six months post-operatively. Performance benefits are a change in score from pre- to post-operatively, scored from -100 to +100.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post-activation</time_frame>
    <description>The Speech Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ) is a subjective measure of satisfaction. Change is reflected in a gain in scores pre- to post-operatively (-10 to +10).</description>
