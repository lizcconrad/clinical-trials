      Emergency ultrasound examinations are increasingly important diagnostic tools in emergency
      and critical care medicine. This study wants to analyze different types of education for
      undergraduate students. Any method of medical training will be proved theoretical and in
      clinical practice.

      This prospective educational study wants to analyze different methods of education for
      undergraduate medical students.

      Method A: Theoretical training will be scheduled for 2 hours with lectures in basics of
      emergency ultrasound. After the theoretical education the students will obtain a
      bedside-teaching on intensive care unit for 4 hours.

      Method B: Theoretical training will be scheduled for 3 hours and included lectures in
      echocardiography, lung ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. After the theoretical education
      the students will obtain a bedside-teaching on intensive care unit for 3 hours.

      Method C: Theoretical training will be scheduled for 3 hours and included lectures in
      echocardiography, lung ultrasound and abdominal ultrasound. After the theoretical education
      the students will obtain a hands-on-training in healthy volunteers for 3 hours. The acquired
      knowledge and practical skills will be analyzed by a multiple-choice exam (5 MC-questions, 5
      video sequences) and a practical exam (five tasks).

      Any method of training will be proved at the end theoretical and in clinical practice.

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>With different kinds of short trainings in ultrasound, students can quickly and accurately determine the main emergency ultrasound diagnosis (free fluid, pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, left and right ventricular failure, pericardial tamponade). The parameter of knowledge score will be used (ratio of multiple choice exam and practical exam).</description>
