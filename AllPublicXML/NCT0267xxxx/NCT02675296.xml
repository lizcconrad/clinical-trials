    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (AKI-D) has increased considerably over last 15 years.
      The national rise in incidence of acute kidney injury has several ramifications in terms of
      cost to the health services resulting not only from cost of therapy but also from the later
      consequences of AKI from development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.
      Mortality in patients with AKI-D is very high and remains unchanged in the last decade in
      England. In recent years it is becoming clearer that even the national incidence and
      case-fatality of AKI is influenced by regional variation. In last three decades, many studies
      have reported unwarranted variation in a wide range of procedures, from the performance of
      cesarean section and coronary angiography to the treatment of early prostate cancer, stroke,
      and the ailments of the chronically ill. In surgical care there is evidence that the
      variation may be driven by forces other than patient illness and medical appropriateness such
      as access to care and other socioeconomic factors, provider capacity of the local system,
      medical malpractice pressure, and distinctly different local practices. Despite the public
      health burden of AKI-D in England, it is unclear if regional variation exists in AKI-D.
      Variation in incidence of AKI-D in different region of a country may be influenced by patient
      and physician demographics of the regions, physician preferences or the nature of the
      hospital serving the population. To reduce the incidence and case fatality of AKI-D, it is
      imperative to understand if variations in incidence and case-fatality in AKI-D exists in
      different regions of the country.

      To address this gap in knowledge, the investigators combined national database of hospital
      admissions and discharge with census data from office of national statistic over a period of
      fifteen years to determine the trend in change in the regional incidence and case fatality of
      AKI requiring dialysis in England. The investigators also explored various determinants of
      the regional variation in the dialysis requiring AKI.

      Methods Data source The investigators extracted 2000-2015 data from the Hospital Episode
      Statistics (HES), a data warehouse containing details of all admissions, outpatient
      appointments, and A&amp;E attendances at National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

      Definitions The investigators identified all cases of AKI by using validated International
      Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes in any
      diagnoses codes, in keeping with the objective of the study. Patients with any of the
      following codes were included: N17.0 for acute renal failure (ARF) with tubular necrosis,
      N17.1 for ARF with acute cortical necrosis, N17.2 for ARF with medullary necrosis, N17.8 for
      other ARF and N17.9 for ARF, unspecified. ARF has been replaced by new terminology, AKI, but
      due to lack of ICD10 codes for AKI, the investigators used the ICD10 codes for ARF and
      henceforth, will be referred to as AKI in this study. The investigators also extracted all
      available secondary diagnosis and up to 24 Office of Population Censuses and Surveys
      Classification of Interventions and Procedures, 4th revision (OPCS-4) codes. To identify
      patients with AKI-D, the investigators included OPCS code of X40.3 for hemodialysis or X40.4
      for hemofiltration in any of the 25 procedures. Patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5
      (CKD-5) starting chronic dialysis and end stage renal disease (ESRD) with ICD-10 code of
      N18.5 and N18.6 respectively were excluded. The investigators also excluded OPCS-4 codes for
      Arteriovenous fistula (L74.2) or Arteriovenous graft (L74.3) during the inpatient admission.
      HES data stratifies patient location into 16 different regions. The geographic regions in
      England were stratified as per the Office of National Statistic (ONS) into nine regions:
      North East, North West, Yorkshire and Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East of England,
      London, South East and South West. Patients' in geographical locations outside these nine
      regions were excluded. Patients who were admitted, but were not discharged during the study
      period will not be included in the study. The investigators also obtained completed hospital
      discharges from each region to estimate the effect of hospitalization on AKI-D incidence
      rates, along with number of nephrology consultants in each region from 2000 to 2015 from
      Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) in the annual census of medical and dental
      staff in the NHS. The investigators will also obtain linkage with ONS and UK Renal Registry
      (UKRR) for long-term patient and renal outcomes. To obtain population incidence of AKI-D for
      each region, mid-year population of the region in each year from 2000 to 2015 was obtained
      from the ONS.

        The 2000 to 2015 data was extracted from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), a data
        warehouse containing details of all admissions, outpatient appointments and A&amp;E attendances
        at NHS hospitals in England. HES collects a detailed record for each 'episode' of admitted
        patient care delivered in England, either by NHS hospitals, primary care trusts, mental
        health trusts or delivered in the independent sector but commissioned by the NHS. These
        data are collected during a patient's time in hospital and stored as a large collection of
        separate records, one for each period of care, in a secure data warehouse.
