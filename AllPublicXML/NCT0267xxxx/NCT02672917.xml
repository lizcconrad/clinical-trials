      Phase I Safety and Tolerability Study in Subjects with Pancreatic Cancer or Other CA19-9
      Positive Malignancies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open label, multi-center, nonrandomized, dose escalation trial of MVT-5873 to evaluate safety
      and determine the MTD and recommended phase II dose of MVT-5873 both as monotherapy (Group A)
      and in combination with a standard of care chemotherapy (Group B) in subjects with pancreatic
      and other CA19-9 positive malignancies. Both groups will utilize a conventional 3+3 study
      design to identify the MTD and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). following determination of
      MTD, 10 additional subjects will be treated at the RP2D in each group. The pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of MVT-5873 will be determined in each Group.
