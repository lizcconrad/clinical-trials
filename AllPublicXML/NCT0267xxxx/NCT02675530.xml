          2. Substance abuse, as per clinical judgment, in the past 1 year.

          3. Current or past DSM-IV Axis-I diagnosis.

          4. A history of significant medical/neurological disease such as cardiac, thyroid, renal,
             hepatic or neurological. Unstable medical condition based on EKG, vital signs,
             physical examination and laboratory work-up.

          5. A hearing deficit greater than 30 dB in both ears detected using a Welch-Allyn
             audioscope (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz threshold will be evaluated) at screening.

          6. Major current or recent (&lt;6 weeks) stressors.

          7. History of counseling, except if counseling was for a life circumstance disorder
             (e.g., bereavement, divorce) or in the opinion of the investigator, is not clinically
             significant.

          8. Lifetime history of treatment with any psychotropic medications for &gt; 1 month duration
             suggestive of psychiatric illness.

          9. Current or past Axis I diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder in first-degree
             relatives.

         10. Any medication that could interfere with either the safety of the study and/or the
             outcome measures.

         11. Use of any illicit substances in the 4 weeks prior to beginning study participation.

             disorder.

         13. History of head injury with loss of consciousness greater than fifteen minutes.

         14. Any other condition or medication, which in the opinion of the investigator would
             preclude participation in the study.
