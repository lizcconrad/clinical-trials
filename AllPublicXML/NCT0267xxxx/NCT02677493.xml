      This study evaluates the immunogenicity and safety of 'IL-YANG Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine
      Inj.' in healthy male and female adults at the age of 19 or older.

    <textblock>
      In this study, only eligible subjects for the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria
      will be randomized to the following stratification groups by age to receive one dose of the
      test vaccine, comparator 1, or comparator 2.

        -  Group A: healthy adults at the age of ≥ 19 and &lt; 65.

        -  Group B: healthy adults at the age of ≥ 65.

      During the study participation, the investigator will assess immunogenicity and safety in
      subjects. The investigator will perform immunogenicity tests at Visits 1 and 3 (end of study
      visit) for immunogenicity evaluation (prior to the investigational product vaccination) and
      instruct subjects to record AEs occurring after the investigational product vaccination for
      safety assessment.

      A blood sample will be collected from a subject who is assigned a subject number. Following
      an intramuscular injection of 0.5mL investigational product in the deltoid muscle of the
      shoulder, the subject will have a study visit on Week 4 for blood sampling for antibody titer
      testing. In addition, a telephone visit will be performed to assess serious AEs (SAEs) up to
      Day 180 after vaccination.
