        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Part 1: Subjects with solid tumors that are refractory to, relapsed after or
             intolerant to standard therapy, or for whom no standard therapy exists or who are
             considered by the investigator to be inappropriate for standard therapy.

          -  Part 2: Subjects with histologically confirmed, locally advanced or refractory TGCT
             (including metastatic disease) that has been deemed unresectable by an orthopedic
             surgeon or similar qualified personnel.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days
             prior to initiation of dosing and must agree to use an acceptable method of birth
             control from the time of the negative pregnancy test up to 3 months after the last
             dose of study drug, Fertile men must also agree to use an acceptable method of birth
             control while on study drug and up to 3 months after the last dose of study drug.

          -  All associated toxicity from previous or concurrent cancer therapy must be resolved
             (to ≤ Grade 1 or Baseline) prior to study treatment administration.

          -  Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent prior to any study-related
             procedures and comply with all study requirements.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status 0-2.

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 3 months.

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases.

          -  Investigational drug use within 14 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) of the
             first dose of PLX73086.

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy (excluding skin cancer resection), or
             significant traumatic injury within 14 days of initiating study drug (unless the wound
             has healed) or anticipation of the need for major surgery during the study.

          -  Active secondary malignancy unless the malignancy is not expected to interfere with
             the evaluation of safety and is approved by the Medical Monitor. Examples of the
             latter include basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in-situ carcinoma of the
             cervix, and isolated elevation of prostate-specific antigen. Subjects with a
             completely treated prior malignancy and no evidence of disease for ≥ 2 years are
             eligible.

          -  Inability to take oral medication or significant nausea and vomiting, malabsorption,
             external biliary shunt, or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate
             absorption.

          -  Baseline mean QTcF ≥ 450 msec (for males) or ≥ 470 msec (for females) at Screening.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias and/or subjects
             who require anti-arrhythmic therapy (excluding beta blockers or digoxin). Subjects
             with controlled atrial fibrillation are not excluded

          -  Congenital long QT syndrome or subjects taking concomitant medications known to
             prolong the QT interval (e.g., tricyclics, azithromycin, methadone).

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac disease or congestive heart failure &gt; New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2. Subjects must not have unstable angina (anginal
             symptoms at rest) or new-onset angina within the last 3 months or myocardial
             infarction within the past 6 months.

          -  Arterial or venous thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident
             (including transient ischemic attacks), deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
             within the 6 months before start of study medication (except for adequately treated
             catheter-related venous thrombosis occurring more than 1 month before the start of
             study medication).

          -  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers as well as inhibitors of breast cancer resistance
             protein (BCRP) within 14 days or 5 drug half-lives, whichever is longer, before start
             of study drug.

          -  Subjects with &gt; Grade 1 (high or low) serum potassium, magnesium, or calcium levels.

          -  Women who are breast-feeding or pregnant.

          -  Known HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Subjects with known active hepatitis B or C, or chronic hepatitis B or C requiring
             treatment with antiviral therapy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness (i.e., active infection ≥ Grade 2) or concurrent
             condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the study
             endpoints or the subject's ability to participate.

          -  The presence of a medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, makes the subject inappropriate for inclusion in this study.
