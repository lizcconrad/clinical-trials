      This study is a multicenter, non-randomized, cross-sectional comparative exploratory study
      comparing the ClearSight System 2D map results to post surgery histopathological analysis of
      excised mass in lumpectomy surgery. The Efficacy Objective is to assess the ability of the
      ClearSight™ System to detect malignant tissue less than or equal to 1 mm of margins of
      excised breast specimen in breast conserving surgery using histopathological assessment as
      reference. The Safety Objective is that all adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE) will
      be reported according to local regulations. The actual reporting is discussed in section 0.
      No device-related adverse events are expected. For more information please refer to the
      Investigator Brochure.
