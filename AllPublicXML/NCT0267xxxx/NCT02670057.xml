    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open label pilot study is to evaluate the utility of sphenopalatine
      ganglion (SPG) block to manage ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) during and/or after cesarean.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain thought to be caused by blood and amniotic fluid irritation of the diaphragm
      and nerves that supply the shoulder, can occur during and/or after a cesarean. Investigators
      will consent 100 patients, and will enroll 10 patients who develop ISP and have a score of is
      &gt;5/10 on the Verbal Analog pain Scale (VAS). Patients will be their own controls. Transnasal
      SPG block will be performed after childbirth, and and beginning at 20 minutes post treatment,
      the patient will be asked to rate their shoulder pain using the VAS a number of times.
