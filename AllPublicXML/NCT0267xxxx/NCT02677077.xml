      The primary objective of the study is to retrospectively investigate the proportion of
      participants free of new or enlarging fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesions
      over time in approximately 300 Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) participants
      with regular MRI follow-up, who have received natalizumab ≥24 month from two different
      observational cohorts: 1) approximately 230 participants from the Czech Republic; and 2)
      approximately 70 participants from Belgium. The secondary objectives of this study are as
      follows: Brain volume change by various measures; Changes in the number and volume of
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions; No evidence of disease activity (NEDA) with and
      without brain volume change.

      Natalizumab will not be provided to participants by Biogen as a part of this study.
      Participants will remain on natalizumab therapy as prescribed by their physician.

          -  Diagnosis of RRMS.

          -  Continuous treatment with natalizumab of ≥24 months. In case of a treatment
             interruption from natalizumab ≥60 days after a total treatment period of ≥24 months,
             only the treatment prior to the interruption will be analyzed. Any data after this
             treatment interruption (even if the patient restarts natalizumab) will not be
             analyzed/collected.

          -  ≥1 MRI scan of sufficient quality for reliable measurement.

          -  Baseline MRI scan ≤6 month prior to natalizumab treatment acquired.

             treatment for ≥6 months.

          -  EDSS ≤ 6.5.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-natalizumab antibody detection.

          -  Prior treatment with alemtuzumab.

          -  Prior treatment with mitoxantrone within 12 months of the first infusion of
             natalizumab.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
