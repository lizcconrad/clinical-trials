      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment of patients with anxiety
      according to the Collabri Model is more effective in reducing symptoms compared to treatment
      as usual (TAU)

      Background:

      Depression and anxiety are common diseases often treated in general practice. However, there
      are obstacles for optimal treatment e.g. a lack of continuity in disease management,
      organized collaboration between primary and secondary care and access to psychotherapy.
      Previous collaborative care studies have shown significant improvements in treatment outcomes
      for patients with depression and anxiety in primary care; however studies have yet not been
      carried out in a Danish context. Thus, the Collabri-model for collaborative care for panic
      disorder, generalized anxiety, social phobia and depression has been developed. The model
      includes: a multi-professional approach to treatment including a care manager (e.g. a
      psychiatric nurse), enhanced inter-professional communication, scheduled monitoring and
      review and structured treatment plans.

      Objective:

      To investigate whether treatment according to the Collabri-model have an effect on symptoms
      for people with anxiety disorders.

      Methods/design:

      Three cluster-randomized, clinical trials are set up to investigate treatment according to
      the Collabri-model compared to treatment as usual for 364 patients diagnosed with panic
      disorder, generalized anxiety and social phobia respectively from general practices in the
      Capital Region of Denmark. For all studies, the primary outcome is anxiety symptoms measured
      with Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) at 6 months.

      Results/discussion:

      The results will contribute new knowledge on collaborative care for depression and anxiety
      disorders in Danish conditions.

    <description>The Collabri Model is a complex intervention and consists of a number of treatment modalities. The Collabri Model includes the following elements: A multi-professional approach to treatment including a care manager, scheduled monitoring and review, enhanced inter-professional communication and a structured treatment plan. It further integrates: Recruitment of staff with psychiatric experience, training of general practitioner and care manager, use of instruments for detection and follow-up, education and treatment of the patient, supervision from a psychiatric specialist, guided self-help, patient- and relative involvement and a stepped care approach to treatment where treatment is always commenced on the least invasive and least resource-demanding level.</description>
