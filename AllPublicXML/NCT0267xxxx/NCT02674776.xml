  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel controlled trial. Patients
      with acute gout will be enrolled and randomly allocated into 2 groups: HuZhen capsule
      treatment group and Placebo control group. Randomization codes were established by the
      biostatistician. Observe will be followed for 3 days (72 hours) after the onset. Change of
      VAS score from baseline, proportion of improvement with damp-heat retention, change in
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR) from baseline, change in
      white blood cell count in whole blood cell analysis from baseline, and the number of adverse
      events will be monitored and compared between each groups.

      The test group will be given HuZhen capsule 1.6g three times per day,the control group will
      be given placebo 1.6g three times per day. The invention will last 3 days.
