      The investigators propose a randomized control trial comparing the rate of implantation of
      the InterStim device following Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation (PNE) performed with or without
      fluoroscopic guidance.

    <textblock>
      Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) is a well-established treatment for refractory urinary
      urgency, frequency, retention and urge incontinence as well as fecal incontinence. Patients
      whose symptoms are refractory to more conservative therapies such as behavioral modification
      and/or medications are candidates for SNS. The InterStim system consists of a permanent tined
      lead and implantable pulse generator (IPG) or battery that delivers the sacral
      neuromodulation. This device is typically implanted after patients have a successful response
      to a trial of sacral neuromodulation with a temporary lead and external battery. The
      temporary lead placement is known as a Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation (PNE) and is typically
      done in as an outpatient procedure using local anesthetic. It is standard practice to use
      fluoroscopy intraoperatively to confirm correct placement of the permanent lead.
      Additionally, some physicians also use fluoroscopy to confirm correct placement of temporary
      lead during PNE while others place the lead based on anatomical landmarks and expected
      elicited responses for S3 stimulation.

      The investigators propose a randomized control trial comparing the rate of implantation of
      the InterStim device following (PNE) performed with or without fluoroscopic guidance.
