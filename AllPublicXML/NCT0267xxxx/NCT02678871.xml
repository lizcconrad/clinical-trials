  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common comorbidity of patients candidates to transcatheter
      aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The management of chronic oral anticoagulation (OAC) for
      the prevention of ischemic stroke is very challenging in this population of complex and frail
      subjects. Since the percutaneous left atrial appendage (LAA) closure with the WATCHAMN device
      proved promising safety and efficacy results in randomized comparisons with OAC (current
      standard of care), the aim of the current study is to assess the feasibility and the early
      safety of performing TAVI with the Lotus System and percutaneous LAA closure with the
      WATCHMAN device at the same session.

    <description>Early safety - composite endpoint of TAVI-related (according to VARC 2 criteria) and percutaneous LAA closure-related events at 30 days. Composite defined as all cause-mortality, all stroke (disabling and non-disabling), life threatening bleeding, acute kidney injury (stage 2 or 3, including renal replacement therapy), coronary artery obstruction requiring intervention, major vascular complications, valve-related dysfunction requiring repeat procedure, pericardial effusion requiring pericardial drainage, and LAA device embolization requiring surgical intervention</description>

    <description>Patients meeting clinical and anatomical pre-requisites will undergo TAVI with the LOTUS heart valve system and LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device in the same setting. Dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid) will be prescribed for 6 months followed acetylsalicylic acid indefinitely. Follow-up will be performed after 1 month, 6 months and 1 year.</description>
