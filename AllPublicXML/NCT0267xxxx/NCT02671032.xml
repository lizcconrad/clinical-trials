      The purpose of the feasibility study is to examine audiological outcomes (audiometry and
      speech perception) and safety (adverse events and adverse device effects) with the Nucleus
      CI532 cochlear implant in group of adult subjects (n=12) who meet current criteria for
      cochlear implantation.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet current cochlear implant indications at the implanting centre

          2. In addition to meeting current cochlear implant indications, subjects must also
             possess preoperative unaided hearing thresholds between 40 to 65 dB HL at 250 &amp; 500Hz
             in the ear to be implanted.

          3. Fluent speaker in the local language used to assess clinical performance

          4. Eighteen years of age or older at the time of implantation with no upper age limit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of hearing loss prior to 5 years of age.

          2. Sensorineural severe-to-profound hearing loss greater than 20 years at 2 kHz and
             above.

          3. Simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation or prior cochlear implantation in the ear
             to be implanted.

          4. Additional disabilities that may affect the subject's participation or safety during
             the clinical investigation.

          5. Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate undergoing general anaesthesia
             or surgery.

          6. Ossification, malformation or any other cochlear anomaly, such as common cavity, that
             might prevent complete insertion of the electrode array, as confirmed by medical
             examination.

          7. Hearing impairment due to lesion or neuropathy of the acoustic nerve, VIII nerve or
             central auditory pathway.

          8. Active middle-ear infection,

          9. Tympanic membrane perforation

         10. Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject, regarding the possible benefits,
             risks, and limitations that are inherent to the surgical procedure(s) and prosthetic
             devices

         11. Unwillingness or inability of the candidate to comply with all investigational
             requirements.

         12. Patients with existing CSF shunts or drains, existing perilymph fistula, skull
             fracture or CSF leak.

         13. Patients with recurrent episodes of bacterial meningitis.
