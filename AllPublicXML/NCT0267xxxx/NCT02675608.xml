      This study evaluates the effectiveness of the seasonal flu vaccine in adults of different
      ages and diabetic disease statuses. These studies will help our understanding of how chronic
      inflammatory diseases impact immunologic function and future research on mitigation
      strategies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to determine if an individual's level of inflammation determines their response
      to vaccination. The aging process and certain diseases, like type-2 diabetes, have been
      characterized as chronic inflammatory conditions. These individuals have higher rates of
      influenza disease and health care costs; hence, yearly vaccination is recommended. There is a
      paucity of information comparing vaccination in these high-risk groups and identifying
      biomarkers that can predict vaccine efficacy. The investigators hypothesize that elderly and
      diabetic patients have reduced responses to seasonal influenza vaccination that are inversely
      proportional to their level of chronic inflammation. In this pilot proposal, the
      investigators will examine adult and elderly diabetic and non-diabetic adults for markers of
      inflammation and vaccine efficacy before and after influenza vaccination. These studies will
      help our understanding of how chronic inflammatory diseases impact immunologic function and
      future research on mitigation strategies.

        In Year 1 during the 2015-16 flu season, subjects were recruited from the New Orleans
        metropolitan area through flyers, radio ads, internet ads, social media, and doctor
        referrals and vaccinated. These subjects were administered the 2015-16 flu vaccine as part
        of their study visit. In Year 2 during the 2016-17 flu season, subjects were recruited from
        populations immediately prior or following receiving the flu vaccine at vaccination events,
        including senior living facilities contracted with the CTU and Tulane University
        vaccination events for faculty, staff, students.
