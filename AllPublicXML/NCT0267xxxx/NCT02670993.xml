    <textblock>
      Alzheimer Disease (AD), characterized by cognitive and psycho-behavioral troubles, concerns
      essentially 65 years old and older patients. Antalgic and psychotropic treatments have
      adverse effects in old people, and have to be used carefully. To improve the pain support and
      limit the drug consumption, it is possible to perform therapies without drugs. Among them,
      musical intervention represents an interesting complementary support, to deal with physical
      and moral pain in AD.

      Alzheimer Disease (AD), characterized by cognitive and psycho-behavioral troubles, concerns
      essentially 65 years old and older patients. At this age, comorbidities are frequent and
      numerous, and often linked to pain. The prevalence is comprised between 40 and 85% according
      to different studies. Antalgic and psychotropic treatments have adverse effects in old
      people, and have to be used carefully. To improve the pain support and limit the drug
      consumption, it is possible to perform therapies without drugs. Among them, musical
      intervention represents an interesting complementary support, to deal with physical and moral
      pain in AD.

      The primary outcome is to evaluate the singing support on physical pain, by comparison with a
      control activity : &quot;painting session&quot;.
