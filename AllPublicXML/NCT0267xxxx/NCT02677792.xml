    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is examine the feasibility and efficacy of providing a
      behavioral family intervention in 30 youth 10 to 17 years of age who are obese and attending
      a multidisciplinary pediatric obesity clinic and their parents. Participating families will
      complete assessments consisting of weight status, dietary intake, physical activity,
      health-related quality of life, psychological functioning, home-food environment, parenting
      skills, and self-efficacy at pre-treatment (Baseline), post-treatment (Month 3), and 2 month
      post-treatment follow-up (Month 5). Family attendance data will be collected during the
      behavioral family intervention and children and parents will complete a treatment
      satisfaction questionnaire at the post-treatment assessment. Health outcomes (e.g., A1C,
      glucose) routinely assessed through standard medical care in the multidisciplinary pediatric
      obesity clinic will be obtained from child medical charts.

    <description>Participating families will receive standard medical care through the Wellness and Weight Clinic, as well as the BFI. The BFI is based on family systems (Minuchin et al., 1975) and social-cognitive (Bandura, 1998) theories. Each dyad will participate in simultaneous, but separate, 75-minute parent and child groups over a 3 month period. The groups will start off meeting every week for 8 weeks and then bi-weekly for 1 month. Thus, dyads will attend a total of 10 group meetings over the 3 month period (12.5 hours of total treatment contact).</description>
