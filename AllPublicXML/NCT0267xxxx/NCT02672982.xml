  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the research is to assess the long-term and cost-effectiveness of a
      combined nutrition psychosocial intervention to a stand-alone nutritional treatment of
      children with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) aged 6 to 24 months in the Saptari District of
      Nepal.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Nepal, the majority of SAM children are treated with therapeutic food in
      community/home-based care, and little is known about the long-term sustainability of the
      nutritional and health benefits of treatment after rehabilitation. The two treatments will be
      compared in terms of costs of treatment and convened health benefits (child nutritional
      status and development, cured rate and relapse, maternal mental health, and family care
      practices) at both short and long-term periods after admission. The proposed complementary
      psychosocial intervention focuses directly on the key underlying determinants of acute
      malnutrition within children's early years, such as child care practices and stimulation,
      parent-child relationships and maternal mental health. It includes the mother/caregiver as
      patient of psychosocial support, but also empowers her as the key ally in the treatment of
      the undernourished child. Adding a brief psychosocial component to the standard
      medico-nutritional treatment is expected to pay off in terms of sustainable recovery, health,
      and development outcomes of children.

    <time_frame>up to 11 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Ages and Stages Questionnaire (Squires et al, 1999), is a low-cost, easily administered, parent-report screening test of development in communication, motor, problem-solving and personal-social domains. The questionnaire has been adapted and used in low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where it has demonstrated sensitivity to child nutritional status and psychosocial stimulation. While it is not a diagnostic test, it offers an opportunity to systematically obtain information about children's development with an instrument that does not require extensive training</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child Care Practices</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 11 months after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of care practices is measured by assessing the level of knowledge and the practices. It comprises sub-thematics: care for women, pregnancy and delivery, care for the newborn, breastfeeding and feeding, access to resources for care, as well as child development and psychosocial care. The Child Care Knowledge &amp; Practices Questionnaire has been developped by Action Contre la Faim.</description>
