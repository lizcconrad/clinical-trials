  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial of the feasibility and utility of implementing a
      smartphone application (MVN) to maintain compliance with a Heart Healthy lifestyle after
      discharge from a cardiac outpatient rehabilitation program. Patients will be randomized into
      one of two groups: usual care (control: UC) or Movn mobile application (intervention: MVN).
      This study will improve and strengthen data collection from this at-risk patient population
      by recording baseline clinical and psycho social measures while gaining insight into
      self-reporting of physical activity and frequency between the UC and MVN groups.

    <description>Intervention participants will receive the same discharge packet as the UC group along with their exit interview and will receive the following:
Participant individualized Heart Healthy instructions for post-cardiac rehabilitation will be integrated into the MVN application including daily medication reminders, physical activity prompts, educational materials, and patient-reported outcome assessment of behavior and psychosocial status.
Text messages will be used on an ad hoc basis to provide positive feedback to the participant; two-way messaging between the participant and the research coordinator will be available to provide opportunities to answer specific questions.</description>
