  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the absorption, metabolism and excretion of [14C] labeled
      ASP8273 in subjects with solid tumors harboring EGFR mutations (per local testing). This
      study consists of two parts (A and B).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts (A and B).

      In Part A, eligible subjects will be admitted to the site on day -1 and remain confined at
      the site until postdosing discharge criteria are met. Subjects will receive a single dose of
      [14C] ASP8273 solution on study day 1.

      Once Part A has been completed, subjects may elect to continue participation in Part B.
      Subjects will receive oral administration of ASP8273 (nonradiolabeled) once daily in 28-day
      cycles.
