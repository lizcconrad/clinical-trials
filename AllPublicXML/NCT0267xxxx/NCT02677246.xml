  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) experience bone toxicity. Those bone
      damages are caused by both a decrease of bone formation and an increase of bone destruction
      after BMT.For long term survivors, bone complications are major determinants of impaired
      quality of life. No standard treatment currently exists to prevent those bone injuries.
      Denosumab is a treatment which specifically blocks bone destruction for 4 to 6 months in
      adults. This trial will study whether it is safe to prescribe Denosumab to children after BMT
      in the aim of preventing bone complications.

      Participant will receive one subcutaneous dose of Denosumab within 2 weeks after confirmation
      of bone marrow engraftment. The dose of treatment will be escalated between participants.
      Denosumab is supposed to be effective for several months (4 to 6 months). The biologic
      activity of Denosumab will be followed by the measure in the blood of a biomarker of bone
      destruction called CTX. This biomarker is supposed to decrease after Denosumab infusion,
      reflecting the blockade of bone destruction by the treatment. Bone density will be assessed
      by a radiologic test named DXA which a standard test. All blood and radiologic tests mandated
      by the study will be done at the same time as standard follow-up after bone marrow
      transplant. Thus, participants will not have extra visits at the outpatient clinic, or extra
      blood punctures, for the specific purpose of the study. Participants will be followed for 36
      months after bone marrow transplantation.For experiencing graft versus host disease, a second
      dose of Denosumab will be allowed, followed by subsequent doses evry 4 to 6 months till a
      maximum of 4 doses within 24months after bone marrow transplantation.

    <description>Phase 1, 3+3 design with inter-patient dose escalation from 1mg/kg/dose to 2mg/kg/dose, and possibility of a dose de-escalation of 0.5mg/kg/dose, A modification of 3+3 design is implemented to take into account the achievement of bone resorption blockade by Denosumab. CTX is a biologic marker of bone resorption. Provided a decrease of CTX blood level will be observed under the lower limit (2,5th percentile) for age and sex, or under 20% of the pre-treatment level, there will be no reason to continue escalating the dose. This modified 3+3 design prevents exposure of children to dose escalations that would not be needed regarding the medical and biological aims of this trial.</description>
