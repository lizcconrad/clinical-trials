      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant
      live attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccine admixture TV005 (TetraVax-DV T005) in
      healthy adults, adolescents, and children in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses (DENV) are the leading arboviral infection globally, with over 2 billion
      people at risk of infection worldwide. The first dengue fever outbreak in Bangladesh occurred
      in 2000, and since then, dengue fever has had a continued presence throughout Bangladesh.
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant live attenuated
      tetravalent dengue virus vaccine admixture TV005 (TetraVax-DV T005) in healthy adults,
      adolescents, and children in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

      The study will enroll four cohorts of participants: adults, adolescents, children, and young
      children. Study researchers will evaluate study data for each cohort before enrolling the
      subsequent cohort.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TV005 vaccine or placebo at study
      entry (Day 0). Additional study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 180, 360, 720, and
      1080. Study visits will include blood collection, physical examinations, and clinical
      assessments. Participants will record and monitor their temperature and symptoms until Day
      14. Study staff will contact participants daily until Day 14; after Day 14, study staff will
      contact participants weekly (and after Day 180, monthly) throughout the study for follow-up
      health monitoring.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy males or females (non-pregnant or lactating) between the ages of 12 months and
             50 years at the time of enrollment into the study.

          -  Reside in Mirpur Wards 2, 3, or 5 (or other Wards within Mirpur as designated by the
             PI if needed to reach enrollment targets) at the time of screening.

          -  Study participants and/or their parents/guardians/legally acceptable or authorized
             representatives (LARs) who the Investigator believes can and will comply with the
             requirements of the protocol (e.g., return for follow-up visits).

          -  Good general health as determined by physical examination, laboratory screening, and
             review of medical history.

          -  If the participant is greater than or equal to 18 years of age, an informed consent
             form signed and dated by the study participant (and by an independent witness if
             required by local regulations). If the study participant is a minor, an assent form
             (for participants age 11-17 years) and informed consent form signed and dated by the
             participant's properly identified parent(s) or legally acceptable representative. If a
             participant is less than 11 years of age, the participant's parent(s) or legally
             acceptable representative will consent by signing the consent form for minor
             participants.

          -  If the participant is female, she must not be pregnant or planning to become pregnant
             up to 28 days post vaccination. Female participants under the age of 18 will be
             enrolled, if they have not yet reached menarche. Females 18 years of age or older,
             must be properly using a method of pregnancy prevention that is known to be highly
             effective per the PI. Reliable methods of contraception include: hormonal birth
             control, condoms with spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, surgical sterilization,
             intrauterine device, and abstinence (greater than or equal to 6 months since last
             sexual encounter). For female study participants who are 18 years of age or older
             pregnancy testing will occur at screening and again before vaccination and they must
             have a negative pregnancy test prior to vaccination. Additionally, they will receive
             counselling on the importance of effective contraception during the 30 days prior to
             vaccination and continuing up to Day 28. Counselling will occur at their screening
             visit, on all clinic visit days up to Day 28. Female participants 18 years of age and
             older will be subject to pregnancy testing on the Study Day 28 and 56 visits. If
             female participants under the age of 18 that have not yet reached menarche prior to
             enrollment, reach menarche during the study, they will continue to be enrolled and
             followed-up through the entire three year follow-up period.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female or female planning to become pregnant within 28 days of
             receiving an investigational product or planning to discontinue abstinence or
             contraceptive precautions within 28 days of receiving an investigational product.
             Menstruating females under the age of 18 will be excluded from being enrolled.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,

             participant unable to comply with the protocol.

          -  Planned administration of any vaccine from 30 days prior to receipt of the study
             vaccine and ending 30 days after; with the exceptions of standard infant and child

             interfere with assessment of the immune response.

          -  A planned or anticipated move to a location that will prohibit full participation in
             the trial for the three year duration.

          -  Potential adult volunteers or parents of potential child volunteers, who do not have
             easy access to a fixed or mobile telephone.

             an older age cohort in this study. Only one participant from each household will be
             enrolled.

          -  Any participant identified as a site employee of the Investigator or study clinic,
             with direct involvement in the proposed study or other studies under the direction of
             that Investigator or study clinic, as well as any immediate family member (such as
             husband, wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the clinic employees or the
             Investigator.

        Elimination Criteria During the Study:

        The following criteria should be checked at each visit subsequent to the first visit. If
        any become applicable during the study, it will not require withdrawal of the participant
        from the study but may determine a participant's evaluability in the per-protocol (PP)
        analysis. The participant will continue to be evaluated for safety purposes at the
        regularly scheduled visits. See the protocol for definition of study cohorts to be
        evaluated.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine/placebo during the study period.

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other
             immune-modifying drugs during the study period. For corticosteroids, this will mean
             prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled and topical
             steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of a licensed vaccine during the period starting from 30 days before
             dose of vaccine/placebo and ending 30 days after, with the exception of standard
             infant and childhood EPI &quot;inactivated&quot; vaccinations.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the study period.
