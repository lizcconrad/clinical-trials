  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is set to describe by objective measures as the range of motion and
      weight-bearing ability of the distal radioulnar joint one to five years after primary
      implantation of a Scheker total distal radioulnar joint prosthesis.The range of motion and
      stability of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) are important outcomes to preserve function,
      especially the pronation and supination. Unlike other ulnar endoprostheses that replace only
      the ulnar head, the Scheker prosthesis replaces the ulnar head, resurfaces the lesser sigmoid
      notch, and is semi-constrained in design.
