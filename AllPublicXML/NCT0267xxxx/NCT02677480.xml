  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The test group consisted of eighteen subjects with hyposalivation used probiotic tablets (≥
      4/day) and gel (once a week) (streptococci, bicarbonate and carbamide) for 3 months and 9
      used placebo tablets and gel. The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial
      samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the
      3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).

      The aim was to analyse the effect of daily intake of probiotic alpha-haemolytic facultative
      anaerobic streptococci (Streptococcus oralis), pH-rising components and Stevia on the oral
      microflora in hyposalivated subjects.

      Material and methods: Subjects with hyposalivation (unstimulated secretion rate of &lt; 0.1
      ml/min and/or a stimulated secretion rate &lt; 0.7 ml/min) and ≥ 10 000 cfu/ml of mutans
      streptococci and/or lactobacilli on the tongue or in the supragingival plaque were included.
      Eighteen subjects used probiotic tablets (≥ 4/day) and gel (once a week) for 3 months and 9
      used placebo tablets and gel. The salivary secretion rates were measured and microbial
      samples collected and analysed using cultivation technique twice both at baseline and at the
      3-month follow up (1-2 weeks between the appointments).

    <measure>Reduction of proportions of mutans streptococci and/or lactobacilli in supragingival plaque and/or on the tongue at 3 months compared with baseline</measure>

    <description>The oral microflora of patients with hyposalivation (unstimulated secretion rate ≤ 0.1 ml/min and/or a stimulated secretion rate ≤ 0.7 ml/min) is analysed. Samples are collected from supragingival plaque and from the tongue and are analysed using cultivation techniques. The total microbial count is registered as well as numbers of streptococci, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. Patients with counts of mutans streptococci and/or lactobacilli ≥ 10000 colony forming units/ml are randomly included in either the test group or in the placebo group. After 3 months, microbial samples are collected again from supragingival plaque and from the tongue and proportions of microorganisms analysed. Statistically significant differences in proportions of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli between baseline and after 3 months will be analysed using Students' paired t-test.</description>
