      To compare the efficacy of a sub-threshold aerobic exercise intervention provided with mobile
      health coaching (STEP-mhc) and a light stretching program (LS) to LS alone for 11-18 yo youth
      with persistent concussion symptoms.

      This is a minimal risk randomized controlled trial whose aim is to test the efficacy of an
      exercise intervention (STEP) for youth 11-18 yo with persistent concussive symptoms (1-6
      months inclusive). The investigators are utilizing an active control (light stretching). The
      primary outcome will be concussion symptoms measured with the Health-Behavior Inventory (HBI)
      in the first month after randomization. Long-term efficacy will be examined using
      standardized measures of quality of life and function over 6 months, and potential mediators
      will be explored including brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), fear-avoidance and
      physical fitness. Physical activity will be measured with accelerometry to evaluate fidelity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sports-related concussion that occurred 1-6 months inclusive prior to the start of the
             study, and was diagnosed by a clinician trained in concussion management consistent
             with the Zurich definition of concussion (&quot;a complex pathophysiological process
             affecting the brain, induced by biomechanical forces [that] results in a graded set of
             clinical symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness&quot;)

          -  Persistent symptoms as defined by the presence of at least 2 concussive symptoms (from
             the Health Behavior Inventory, or HBI) at the time of recruitment which were not
             present prior to injury

          -  11 to 18 years of age (inclusive) at time of recruitment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-English speaking youth or parents

          -  Unwilling or unable to travel to Seattle Children's Hospital or Seattle Children's
             Research Institute twice during the course of the study

          -  Cervical spine or vestibular issues requiring further targeted intervention

          -  Other injuries or medical conditions in addition to concussion which would preclude
             vigorous exercise

          -  Psychiatric hospitalization in the year prior to enrollment

          -  Significant cognitive deficits such as mental retardation or autism

          -  Lack of worsening of concussive symptoms with exertion

          -  Significant abnormalities on routine brain imaging.
