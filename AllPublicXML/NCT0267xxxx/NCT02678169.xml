      Prospective, single-arm, multicenter, observational registry of the ACE Reperfusion Catheters
      and the Penumbra System in Europe. Consecutive patients presenting within 6 hours from
      symptom onset with an acute ischemic stroke (within the internal carotid artery and internal
      carotid terminus, middle cerebral - M1/M2 segments) due to anterior circulation large vessel
      occlusion (LVO) will be treated using the ADAPT technique with thrombo-aspiration as first
      intention and site routine practice.

      Prospective, single-arm, multicenter, observational registry of the ACE Reperfusion Catheters

      symptom onset with an acute ischemic stroke (within the internal carotid artery and internal

      occlusion (LVO) will be treated using the ADAPT technique with thrombo-aspiration as first
      intention and site routine practice.

      The follow-up visit will occur 24 hours, 7-10 days or discharge, 30 days and 90 days
      post-procedure and will review patient's functional outcome, quality of life, and adverse
      events.

               -  Associated myocardial infarction or severe infection (endocarditis or sepsis)

               -  Laboratory evidence of coagulation abnormalities, with an International
                  Normalized Ratio (INR) of &gt; 3.0 or platelets count &lt; 40 x109/L or APTT &gt; 50 sec

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 185 mmHg or
                  diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mmHg)

               -  Baseline glucose &lt; 2.7 or &gt; 22.2 mmol/L

               -  Pre-stroke mRS score &gt; 2

               -  Seizure at the onset of stroke

               -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

               -  Known serious sensitivity to radiographic contrast media.

               -  Significant mass effect with midline shift

               -  Evidence of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), aneurysm, or arteriovenous
                  malformation (AVM)

          -  Angiographic evidence of tandem extracranial occlusion or an arterial stenosis
             proximal to the occlusion that requires treatment prior to thrombus removal. Moderate
             stenosis not requiring treatment is not an exclusion criterion.

          -  Angiographic evidence of preexisting arterial injury, such as carotid dissection,
             complete cervical carotid occlusion, or vasculitis.
