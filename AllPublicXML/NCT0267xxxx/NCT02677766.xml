  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no studies that demonstrate that the intervention of Occupational Therapy
      (OT) in patients considered to be complex, regardless of diagnosis, could improve clinical
      and functional outcome for the patient. For this reason, the investigators propose one
      randomized controlled trial that will compare the group receiving the intervention of OT and
      the control group, to quantify the level of performance and satisfaction in the activities of
      interest of the patient, identified through the COPM. The hypothesis is that the benefit may
      be higher, as clinically relevant, in the group of complex patients treated with the proposed
      intervention of OT compared to those receiving the usual rehabilitation therapy.

      The investigators already implemented an observational pilot study, aimed at defining the
      characteristics and needs of the population in question and the OT intervention
      characteristics. These information will now be used to implement this randomized controlled
      trial, designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the OT intervention on the basis of
      clinically relevant outcome measures.

      This study will be set with exploratory purposes, with appropriate high number, which will
      allow the investigators to quantify the difference between the two groups in terms of
      performance scores derived from the COPM (COPM_p). From the results of this part it will then
      depend on the planning for the subsequent study with the correct sample size.
