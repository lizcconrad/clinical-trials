  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to provide a more comfortable and functional
      prosthetic socket for persons with transfemoral amputation that will ultimately improve their
      quality of life.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will be an assessor-blinded prospective randomized cross-over
      trial wherein participants with unilateral transfemoral amputation will be randomized to
      using one of two socket conditions (i.e., sub-ischial or ischial containment) before crossing
      over to the other socket condition. Random allocation (computer-generated) utilizing blocks
      of random size will be used to assign the initial treatment condition. The trial will be
      balanced such that all subjects will receive all treatments (i.e., both socket conditions)
      and that all subjects will participate for the same number of periods (i.e., two). While a
      washout period is not strictly necessary, it is effectively included as subjects will need to
      transition back to their usual, pre-study socket/prosthesis while the second test socket is
      fabricated.

      Allocation of intervention will be concealed from the investigators until after a subject is
      enrolled. The starting socket design will be enclosed in sequentially numbered, opaque,
      sealed envelopes. Envelopes will be opened sequentially and only after the participant's name
      and other details are written on the appropriate envelope.

      Blinding of prosthetic interventions is challenging given that they are devices that must be
      custom-fabricated and donned each day by the subject. Hence, for this study only the assessor
      will be blinded. The blinded assessor will be responsible for administration of the clinical
      performance and patient-reported measures as well as processing of motion analysis data.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Socket Comfort Score (SCS) between IC socket and NU-FlexSIV socket.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1, 3 and 6 weeks of everyday socket use for each socket.</time_frame>
    <description>SCS is an ordinal scale where the subject responds to the question, &quot;On a 0 to 10 scale, if 0 represents the most uncomfortable socket fit you can imagine, and 10 represents the most comfortable socket fit, how would you score the comfort of the socket of your artificial limb at the moment?&quot; While 6 weeks of everyday socket use is the primary end point, we anticipate that subjects may dropout if one socket is less comfortable, hence we are also collecting SCS at interim time points (1 and 3 weeks).</description>

    <time_frame>At 1, 3 and 6 weeks of everyday socket use for each socket.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to rise from a chair of standard height five times as fast as possible with their arms folded across their chests. Timing begins when the examiner says &quot;Go&quot; and stops when the subject's buttocks touch the chair on the fifth repetition. Participants will perform two RSTS trials, with a three minute rest period between trials.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in Four-Square-Step Test (FSST) between the IC socket and NU-FlexSIV socket.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1, 3 and 6 weeks of everyday socket use for each socket.</time_frame>
    <description>Four sticks are placed flat on the floor in a cross that denotes a square at each of the four angles. Instructions to the subjects are, &quot;Try to complete the sequence as fast as possible without touching the sticks. Both feet must make contact with the floor in each square. If possible, face forward during the entire sequence.&quot; The stepping sequence is demonstrated to the subject and one practice trial is allowed to ensure that the subject knows the sequence. The score is recorded as the time taken to complete the stepping sequence. The stopwatch starts when the first foot contacts the floor in square 2 and finishes when the last foot comes back to touch the floor in square 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in T-Test of Agility (T-Test) between the IC socket and NU-FlexSIV socket.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1, 3 and 6 weeks of everyday socket use for each socket.</time_frame>
    <description>Four cones are set out so a &quot;T&quot; can be traced among them. The subject starts at cone A. On the command of the timer, the subject sprints to cone B and touches the base of the cone with their right hand. Then they shuffle sideways to cone C, and also touch its base, this time with their left hand. Then shuffling sideways to the right to cone D and touching the base with the right hand. The subject then shuffles back to cone B touching with the left hand, and runs backward to cone A. The stopwatch is stopped as they pass cone A. The trial does not count if the subject crosses one foot in front of the other while shuffling sideways, fails to touch the base of the cones, or fails to face forward throughout the test. The best time of three successful trials is used.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Step Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Between week 1 and week 3; and between week 3 and week 6.</time_frame>
    <description>Step activity monitors attached to the test prostheses will allow monitoring of every day socket use. This will provide information regarding compliance with use of each prosthesis. As a secondary consideration, it will allow us to check whether there is a relationship between comfort and step activity.</description>

    <description>NU-FlexSIV sockets have lower proximal trim lines, do not impinge on the pelvis, are highly flexible so as to allow better comfort during sitting and when muscles move within the socket during activity, and are held securely to the residual limb by suction from a vacuum pump and from compression exerted by the deliberately undersized liner and socket.</description>
