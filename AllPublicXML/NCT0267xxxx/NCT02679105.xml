      The study evaluates the safety and effect of intralymphatic allergen specific immunotherapy
      in increasing doses. Patients that have already undergone subcutaneous immunotherapy will be
      treated with three intralymphatic injections in increasing doses; 1000 SQ-U, 3000 SQ-U and 10
      000 SQ-U, or placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      38 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis that have recently (within 20 months) ended a
      full subcutaneous immunotherapy protocol with birch or grass allergen with improvement but
      not full symptom relief are recruited. Study subjects are randomized to intralymphatic
      injections with placebo or ALK Alutard 5-grasses or birch.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-55

          -  Accepted and signed informed consent.

          -  Recently (within 20 months) ended a full 3 year program with subcutaneous
             immunotherapy (SCIT) with amelioration of symptoms but not full symptom relief.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) with total symptom relief.

          -  Previously SCIT but no symptom improvement at all.

          -  Sensitizations to house dust mite or furry animals, with symptoms.

          -  Severe atopic dermatitis.

          -  Patients with significant diseases other than allergic rhinitis. A significant disease
             is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either put the
             patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may influence
             the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Patients with a respiratory tract infection in the past 4 weeks prior to Visit 2.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (i.e., oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices,
             diaphragm, or subdermal implants).

          -  Known autoimmune or collagen disease

          -  Cardiovascular disease

          -  Perennial pulmonary disease including asthma

          -  Hepatic disease

          -  Known renal insufficiency

          -  Cancer

          -  Hematologic disease

          -  Chronic infectious disease

          -  Any medication with a possible side-effect of interfering with the immune response

          -  Previous immuno- or chemotherapy, apart from SCIT

          -  Disease or conditions rendering the treatment of anaphylactic reactions difficult
             (symptomatic coronary heart diseases, severe arterial hypertension and treatment with
             β-blockers)

          -  Major metabolic disease

          -  Known or suspected allergy to the study product

          -  Obesity with BMI &gt; 30 since subcutaneous fat makes ultrasound imaging of lymph nodes
             harder which may risk the correct placement of injection.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, abuse alcohol or drugs within 2
             years prior to Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational drug within 1 month or six half lives,
             whichever is greater, prior to Visit 1.

          -  Mental incapability of coping with the study

          -  Withdrawal of informed consent
