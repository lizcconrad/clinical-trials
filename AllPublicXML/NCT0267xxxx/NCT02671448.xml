  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators plan to see what happens when a person receives care in the
      home setting. They want to find out if caring for a patient who has been treated with an ASCT
      in the home setting is feasible. They want to find out what effects good and/or bad this will
      have on the patient's recovery and treatment after ASCT. Studies in other institutions have
      shown that providing care in the home setting after ASCT is safe, increases patient
      satisfaction, and can decrease the risk of infection. It is our hope that this new approach
      of providing care in the home setting will prove to be a feasible and safe option for
      patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK).

               -  &quot;Home equivalent&quot; must pass the &quot;Home Environment Screening Tool&quot; for homebound
                  stem cell transplantation (not required for other MSK recognized lodging
                  facility).

          -  Adequate caregiver support as defined by:

               -  Single or multiple informal caregivers willing and able to provide 24 hour a day,
                  seven day a week supervision of the transplant recipient in their home or
                  &quot;home-like&quot; environment.

               -  Caregiver willing and able to fulfill the basic stem cell transplant caregiver
                  education requirements as determined by caregiver and healthcare team, including

          -  Appropriate third party payer coverage for &quot;Homebound Stem Cell Transplant Program&quot;

          -  Both patient and caregiver willing to give and sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a documented active infection prior to starting their preparative
