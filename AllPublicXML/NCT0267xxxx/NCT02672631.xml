  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether clinical, sensory and motor development
      correlated with the values obtained from Electroneuromyography and DTI in postoperative
      follow up patients who underwent primary repair after the total median nerve injuries.

      Median nerve is one of three major nerves of hand and forearm and often injure with glass
      etc, in follow up of healing; clinical examination and ENMG are often used. Both of these
      methods are subjective, noninvasive and objective new method is required. In this context;
      differences between intact, recovering and not healed nerve tissue's diffusions have led to
      the hypothesis; &quot;The recovery of the repaired nerve tissue can be monitored by Diffusion
      Tensor Imaging method&quot;.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether clinical, sensory and motor development
      correlated with the values obtained from Electroneuromyography and DTI in postoperative
      follow up patients who underwent primary repair after the total median nerve injuries.

      Median nerve is one of three major nerves of hand and forearm. It is below flexor tendon and
      retinaculum at the level of the wrist and often injured at this level and subtotally. The
      primary microsurgical suture technique under a microscope is the gold standard treatment. In
      follow up of healing; clinical examination and ENMG are often used. Both of these methods are
      subjective, although ENMG is more objective, however that is an invasive method, and need
      experienced neurologists. So, noninvasive and objective new method is required. In this
      context; differences between intact, recovering and not healed nerve tissue's diffusions have
      led to the hypothesis; &quot;The recovery of the repaired nerve tissue can be monitored by
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging method&quot;. There is no similar study in the literature.

      Ten patients who were operated for median nerve injuries in 2014 will be enrolled. In the
      sample, correlations between Tinnel Test, motor strength assessment (Medical Research Council
      (MRC) Scale), static two-point discrimination test (S2PD), Semmes-Weinstein (SW) monofilament
      test, the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) test, EMG with the DTI results will
      be assessed.

      At the end of the study; it is expected that a significant correlation between conventional
      methods and DTI. If the results support the hypothesis; DTI may get to the literature as
      noninvasive and objective method in follow of nerve regeneration.
