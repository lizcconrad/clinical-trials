  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients develop a high psychological burden of the underlying disease. To support
      patients in outpatient phases psychotherapists are not sufficiently available for establish
      regularly face-to-face-contact. The availability of Internet-based psychotherapeutic support
      can bridge this gap. This study examines the effectiveness of MAC-CBT速 via the Internet
      (called Incobeth速) in cancer patients.

      In this study, a randomized trial is conducted in which the online users are allocated into
      two different care services (MAC-CBT速 vs. psycho-educational support program). Participants
      are cancer patients who have been advised by their treating oncologists, family doctors or
      psychotherapists on the online support. All patients are randomized, based on the information
      the referring physician give about type of tumor, treatment status, prognosis and
      psychosocial factors. Initial will be done an extensive psychometric survey. The MAC-CBT速
      group receives an intervention program based on ten modules, in which the aspects of
      Mindfulness, Acceptance and Commitment in detail are included to start a process-oriented
      self-treatment with regular feedback by the individually assigned psychologists through the
      internet-portal and email and through live contacts (via video-telephony). The control group
      will have access to six modules with a psychoeducational support program, which is also
      constructed according to the MAC principle. Both groups can use crisis modules (in case of
      pain, psychological crisis, fear of dying) without access restriction. The control group,
      upon completion of 6 weeks (for each module one week) can switch to active treatment arm.
      Input and output results are determined using validated survey instruments. Randomisation is
      done by a physician not involved in the further course of the evaluation.

    <description>Participants can work on ten modules specialized cognitive behavior treatments to learn and deal with mindfulness, acceptance and commitment.

    <description>Participants can work on six modules with information und education goals for learning something about their possibilities to become a better mood, better psychovegetative or psychosocial situation as cancer patient.
