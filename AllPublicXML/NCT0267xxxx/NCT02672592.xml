  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and the metabolic syndrome in men are associated with a high prevalence of
      hypogonadism of up to 50%. Increased fat mass leads to augmented release of adipocytokines
      and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1-beta, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha which
      in turn suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to hypogonadism. This
      pathophysiological interplay is termed hypogonadal-obesity-adipocytokine hypothesis. TestIL
      is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test
      the hypothesis that inhibition of IL-1-activity diminishes the inhibitory effects on HPG axis
      and increases testosterone levels in men with metabolic syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and the metabolic syndrome are considered as chronic low-grade inflammatory states.
      Elevated pro-inflammatory mediators in obesity and metabolic syndrome have an inhibitory
      effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) leading to hypogonadism.
      Decreased testosterone production in obese men in turn promotes additional fat deposition,
      contributing to a vicious cycle of fat accumulation. This complex pathophysiological
      interplay is termed hypogonadal-obesity-adipocytokine hypothesis, describing a bidirectional
      relationship between low levels of testosterone and the metabolic syndrome.

      TestIL is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to
      test the hypothesis that inhibition of IL-1-activity diminishes the inhibitory effects on HPG
      axis and increases testosterone levels in men with metabolic syndrome.
