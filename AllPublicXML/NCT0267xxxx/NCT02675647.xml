  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal heparin regimen during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has not been well established
      in obese patients.

      Results of a preview study show that the standard heparin management based on total body
      weight in obese patients during CPB resulted in excessive heparin level, which could lead to
      excessive postoperative bleeding.

      To avoid this overdosing, an initial heparin bolus based on ideal body weight in obese
      patients was proposed.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of heparin injection, based on
      ideal body weight, on intraoperative plasma heparin levels and activated coagulation time
      (ACT) in a population of obese patients, compared to a group of obese patients undergoing CPB
      surgery with heparin management based of total body weight.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the relationship between heparin level and ACT in
      each group of patients and at different time points during CPB, and to compare the incidence
      of bleeding, intraoperative transfusions and complications in the two groups of patients.

    <description>Obese patients, randomized to receive an initial IV bolus of Heparin, before beginning of the cardiopulmonary bypass, at the dosage of 340 UI/kg based on ideal body weight of the obese patients.
The objective is to obtain an ACT target ≥ 400 s before the beginning of CPB. If necessary, additional boluses of heparin are administered at the dose of 100 UI/kg based on ideal body weight, to maintain this target during the CPB.</description>
