  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare quality of care and patient experiences in two
      outpatients follow-up activities: 1) Standard telePRO (fixed interval telePRO follow-up) and
      2) Open Access telePRO (patient-initiated telePRO follow-up)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The traditional system of routine outpatient follow-up of chronic disease in secondary care
      may involve a waste of resources if patients are well. The use of patient-reported outcomes
      (PRO) could support more flexible, cost-saving follow-up activities. AmbuFlex is a PRO system
      used in outpatient follow-up in the Central Denmark Region. PRO questionnaires are sent to
      patients at fixed intervals. The clinicians use the PRO data to decide whether a patient
      needs a visit or not (standard telePRO). PRO may make patients become more involved in their
      own care pathway, which may improve their self-management. Better self-management may also be
      achieved by letting patients initiate contact. The aim of this study is to obtain data on the
      effects of patient-initiated follow-up (open access telePRO) on resource utilisation, quality
      of care, and the patient perspective.
