  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the efficacy of a 10-week intervention, using the
      Nordic Hamstring exercise, on repeated-sprint ability in male sub-elite football players. The
      primary outcome measure is total sprint time during 4x6 sprint of 10 meters measured using
      dual-beam photoelectric cells. Additionally, eccentric knee flexor strength is measured using
      the Nordbord hamstring strength measure. The hypothesis is that strength training of the knee
      flexor muscles elicited by the Nordic Hamstring exercise will result in enhanced repetitive
      sprint-ability expressed as a decrease in total sprint time. Furthermore, baseline data is
      used to assess to correlation between eccentric hamstring strength and active hamstring
      flexibility AND sprint performance.

    <description>The Nordic Hamstring group performs a progressive strengthening program (Mjolsnes et al., 2004) comprising of the Nordic Hamstring exercise during a period of 10 weeks. The training load increases from one session per week in week 1 to 3 sessions per week in week 3-10. Number of sets and repetitions progressively increase from 2 to 3 and 5 to 12, respectively. The exercise program is performed in the end of a regular football training session.</description>
