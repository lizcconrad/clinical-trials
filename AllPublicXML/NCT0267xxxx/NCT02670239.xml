  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is an established strategy to evaluate and optimize high-risk
      donor lungs that would otherwise be rejected for transplantation mainly due to the presence
      of edema or infection. Extracorporeal circuits may negatively affects pharmacokinetic (PK) of
      several drugs including antibiotics, thus exposing patients to risk of therapeutic failure or
      drug toxicity. The investigators set out to examine the concentration of imipenem in lung
      perfusate and in lung biopsy during EVLP, and its clinical impact.
