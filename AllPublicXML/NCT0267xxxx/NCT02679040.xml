  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, it is widely admitted not proposing immediate mammary reconstruction when an
      adjuvant radiotherapy is indicated because of the significant change of the cosmetic result
      (profit) and it whatever is the technique of reconstruction adopted. This is true all the
      more as it is about a reconstruction by prosthesis because of the prothetic died risk of
      hull(shell).

      Teams proposed immediate mammary reconstructions to expanding (carrier) patients of carcinoma
      infiltrating, sometimes locally moved forward. For these patients, was not brought
      back(reported) by increase of the risk of local or remote relapse.

      Two studies estimated afterward the feasibility of the mastectomy with immediate mammary
      reconstruction at the close of the chemotherapy and of the radiotherapy. The rate of
      morbidity is judged as acceptable. The rate of local second offense(recurrence) was similar
      to the patients benefiting from the classic therapeutic plan.

      During an other study ( M-RIC), it was shown that the inversion of therapeutic sequence is
      possible and that by prescribing the chemotherapy and the radiotherapy before immediate
      mammary reconstruction, the morbidity is acceptable.

      It is acquired that the chemotherapy néoadjuvant is equivalent to the post-operative
      chemotherapy as regards the global survival.

      On the other hand, the rate of histological answer, according to subgroups, is very
      different. This rate can vary of 9 % for tumors RH +, negative Her2 in 45 % for tumors RH-,
      Her2 over expression. There are 33 % for the RH +, Her2 + and of 35 % for triple-negative.

      The purpose of the investigators study is to estimate the rate of histological response
      during the inversion of therapeutic sequence to make sure of the oncologic safety(security),
      in particular by molecular subgroups, considering the heterogeneousness of the
      results(profits) after chemotherapy néoadjuvant only. Sataloff and Chevallier Classifications
      is the references and will be used here, but the investigators can also use Symmans
      classification in addition.

      The rate of local and metastatic second offenses(recurrences) will also be estimated.
