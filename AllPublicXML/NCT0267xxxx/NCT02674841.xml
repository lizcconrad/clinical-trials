    <textblock>
      This study investigates if live feedback during home-based exercises will improve the ability
      to perform the exercises with the prescribed time under tension (TUT) per repetition compared
      with no feedback among adolescents with patellofemoral pain. The hypothesis is that
      adolescents who receive live feedback from BandCizer™ will have a mean TUT that is
      significantly closer to the prescribed TUT compared to the group not receiving feedback
      during the course of the intervention.

    <measure>Mean deviation from the prescribed TUT per repetition in seconds during the course of the intervention</measure>
