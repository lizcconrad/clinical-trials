    <textblock>
      It is known that teriflunomide, a treatment for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, can be
      found in low concentrations in semen. Because the drug has been associated with
      teratogenicity in laboratory animals, the question is raised as to whether the drug can be
      detected in female partners of sexually active males who are taking the drug to treat their
      multiple sclerosis.
