  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer patients often report that they are not included in important treatment decisions.
      Numerous studies have shown that a training concerning Shared Decision Making (SDM) for
      physicians can improve this situation. This does not only lead to a better quality of the
      doctor-patient interaction, but may have a positive long term impact on treatment adherence,
      the psychological well-being and the coping abilities of the patients. However, previous
      experience regarding the implementation of SDM training programs show that it is difficult to
      recruit physicians for an external SDM group training due to the extensive workload of the
      physicians. In light of the available evidence on the effectiveness of SDM training and the
      low motivation by oncologists for traditional SDM group training, this study aims to develop
      and evaluate a brief SDM intervention. This intervention is disseminated in two different
      ways which both might be attractive for oncologists. On the one hand an individual
      face-to-face context-based SDM training is designed and conducted by a trainer at the
      workplace of the participating oncologists. On the other hand a web-based SDM online training
      is developed. Both SDM interventions are developed on the basis of an SDM manual evaluated in
      previous studies.

      This study therefore aims to examine the effectiveness of different disseminations strategies
      (individualized face-to-face context-based SDM individual training vs. web-based SDM online
      training) compared to a control group without any training. It will be analyzed which
      improvements in medical SDM competence can be accomplished by the different SDM trainings.
      Further the effects of the training on SDM knowledge, quality of the doctor-patient
      interaction and SDM self-efficacy expectation will be evaluated.

    <description>To measure the SDM competence the OPTION scale (Observing Patient Involvement; Elwyn et al., 2003; Elwyn et al., 2005; Goss et al., 2007.) will be used. The OPTION scale is a validated instrument for measuring the process steps of Shared Decision Making. The consultations are assessed on the basis of 12 items. It shows good reliability with a value of 0.79. The Option rating is based on video recordings and anonymised transcripts. A consultation will be assessed by two blinded raters. The average value per item is used as final value. For the consultations standardized patients are deployed.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of a SDM training for oncologists, which is conducted in the form of a web-based SDM online Training (intervention group I). During training, the oncologists are guided to use decision aids for breast and colon cancer patients in their consultations, which were developed and evaluated in a previous project. The SDM training has the same duration (one session à 120 minutes) in both intervention groups. Doctors in the intervention group receive decision aids for breast cancer and colorectal cancer patients during training. The training contents are based on an already developed, evaluated and published SDM manual. The SDM online training works on the modeling principle.</description>
