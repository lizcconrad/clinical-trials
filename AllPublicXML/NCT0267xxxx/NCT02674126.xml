  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A newborn's recognition and preference for their mother's voice occurs early in life, very
      likely during fetal development. Maternal voice stimuli undergo a unique form of cerebral
      processing that lends support for the existence of neurophysiologic mechanisms that reflect a
      child's preference for his/her mother's voice. This study aims to evaluate and compare the
      effect t of maternal sound listening in children undergoing cardiac surgery on stress
      response and physiological parameters.

      Children (4 to 8 years) undergoing repair of Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). Patients will be
      randomized into two equal groups (30 in each group) (control group and maternal sound group);
      in control group patients listened to a blank CD, while in maternal sound group patients
      listened to a recorded CD where the mother singing the most popular songs their children like
      or telling a story to their children. Baseline stress markers (blood glucose and plasma
      cortisol) sampled the morning before scheduled operation. A interview with the patients and
      their parents before operation to collect the questionnaire regarding patient's
      characteristic (age, sex, weight and height), patient's clinical data (medical diagnosis and
      American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status) and haemodynamic data (blood pressure,
      heart rate, oxygen saturation on room air, temperature). In addition, the researcher
      interviewed with the mothers to record on one CD their voice while they are singing the most
      popular songs their children like or telling a story to their children to help them to sleep
      to be used during intra-operative period in maternal sound group.
