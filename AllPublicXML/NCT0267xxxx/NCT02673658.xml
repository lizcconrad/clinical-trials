  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this longitudinal study is to examine the ongoing interaction between the
      domains of cognitive and motor development in infants with neuromotor disability, and to
      compare outcomes of two groups of infants receiving two different types of home-based,
      parent-delivered physical therapy intervention, in order to determine which intervention is
      more effective in advancing cognitive as well as motor development. Knowledge of the
      effectiveness of two types of intervention will lead to improved early intervention for
      children with developmental disabilities, as well as future studies to examine ongoing
      outcomes.

      This longitudinal study will examine the ongoing interaction between the domains of cognitive
      and motor development in infants with neuromotor disability, as well as compare differences
      between groups of infants receiving two types of intervention.

      The specific aims for this study are:

        1. To measure the changes of the head, trunk and pelvis as the primary orienting segments
           of the body during the achievement of sitting and the transition to crawling in infants
           with neuromotor disability.

        2. Describe the changes in problem-solving and cognitive abilities of infants with
           neuromotor disability as they transition to stable sitting and then to crawling.

        3. Using eye-tracking technology, quantify the evolution of focused attention in infants
           with neuromotor disability as the motor skills of sitting and the transition to crawling
           emerge.

        4. Compare motor skill, visual attention and cognitive change as sitting and crawling
           emerge between groups of infants with neuromotor disabilities receiving two different
           interventions, and determine the effects of distinctly different paradigms: one that
           focuses simply on building motor skill, and the other that builds motor and cognition
           together.

      This is a longitudinal study, with between group comparisons to determine the effectiveness
      of the intervention, and within group comparisons to determine change over time. Measures
      will occur in the home at baseline, at the end of month 1 of intervention, the end of month
      2, the end of month 3, and at a 9 month follow-up visit, for a total of 5 measurement times.
      Each session will take approximately 1 hour each time. Because we want to look at the child's
      movement and posture, the child should be clothed in either an undergarment or a bathing suit
      that allows a view of their trunk, legs and arms during the 5 measurement sessions. We will
      video the child's movement and posture and play doing two standardized infant tests during
      these measurement sessions. The child will sit on the floor as independently as they can and
      reach for toys and move through as many developmental postures as they can (crawling, pulling
      to stand, moving in and out of sitting). The parent will always be next to their child during
      measurement sessions.

      Children will participate in one of the parent-delivered interventions for 3-months after
      being randomized to one of two groups. Both intervention groups are parent-delivered
      interventions, with differing goals and differing training. Parents will be trained in one of
      the following approaches:

      Motor-based problem solving approach or the body weight support (BWS) approach.

      In both of the above approaches, parents will receive weekly, one-hour sessions at home for
      updates and training from a physical therapist to advance the program for individual infants.
      Thus, there will be a total of 12 sessions with a therapist. Each program is individualized
      because no two infants will have exactly the same skill set. This individualization of
      programs is standard practice for early intervention. Generally, the suggestions will follow
      standard developmental guidelines, with sequencing of skills presented in the order of normal
      development. Both of these approaches are currently used in early intervention for young
      children with developmental disabilities, but we do not know which is more effective, or if
      either approach is effective.

    <description>This method focuses on spontaneous movement (rather than facilitated movement). Self-initiated, functionally directed movement is emphasized. Intervention includes guidance and cues, which gently call the child's attention to the support surface, and a set-up of the environment for small increments of movement so that the child can solve a movement problem. Passive movements are not used. Each small increment of movement to advance sitting skill or other motor skills is paired with a specific object or toy that challenges a cognitive concept for spatial problem solving. In this approach, the parent will adjust toys and supports to encourage changes of position from sitting, to transitions in and out of sitting to crawling or standing, but will not assist the child physically.</description>

    <description>In this approach, infants will be supported physically by their parents to take steps, sit, crawl, or reach, in practice sessions focused simply on the motor skill. Toys or problem solving will not be part of this intervention, but the child will be assisted (lifted by the parent) through movement to improve strength and learn specific movements and new positions. The child will be able to perform as much of the movement as possible, but the parents will initiate the activity if the child does not initiate, and the parent will lift the child passively through the task if the child is unable to move.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants with a diagnosis of a neuromotor disorder such as cerebral palsy, or a birth
             history and developmental history indicative of cerebral palsy (prematurity,
             intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia) will be selected for this
             study. The infants will be at Gross Motor Function Classification Scale (GMFCS) levels
             I, II, or III, because infants at levels IV and V would be unlikely to reach the level
             of sitting independence to enter the study. Additional behavioral inclusion criteria
             are: between the ages of 9 months and 3 years at the time of entry into the study; the
             child should already be independent in prop sitting (sitting with arm support) for at
             least 1 minute, and be able to lift one arm up in sitting (after being placed in
             sitting) to reach for a toy placed directly in front of them without losing balance

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  blindness, dislocated hip, pending orthopedic or neurologic surgery which would
             interrupt the time period of the intervention, additional diagnosis that affects the
             neuromuscular system such as spina bifida. A child would not qualify for the study if
             sitting skills were mature. Mature sitting is operationally defined as: the ability to
             sit independently without using the arms for support for five minutes or more without
             falling; reaching for toys using both hands at once without disrupting balance; moving
             in and out of the sitting position independently.
