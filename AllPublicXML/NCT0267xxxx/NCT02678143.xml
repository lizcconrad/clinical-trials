  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the overall safety and feasibility of using
      haploidentical or one antigen mismatch unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
      for adult patients with severe sickle cell disease (SCD) who undergo a non-myeloablative
      preparative regimen consisting of total body irradiation (TBI), cyclophosphamide and
      alemtuzumab (and fludarabine for haplo-SCT only) and graft vs. host disease (GvHD)
      prophylaxis consisting of post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy), mycophenolate mofetil
      (MMF), and sirolimus. The investigators anticipate that this approach will expand the donor
      pool and offer a safe and less toxic curative intervention.

    <description>The recipient of one antigen mismatch unrelated HSCT will begin the preparative regimen on Day -7. Alemtuzumab on Days -7, -6, -5, -4, and -3, cyclophosphamide on Days -4 and -3, and 300 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) on Day -2.
The recipient of haplo-SCT will begin the preparative regimen on Day -7. Alemtuzumab on Days -7, -6, -5, -4, and -3, fludarabine on Days -7, -6, -5, -4, and -3, cyclophosphamide on Days -4 and -3, and 400 cGy of TBI on Day -2.
For both types of HSCT, the frozen peripheral blood stem cells will be thawed and infused on Day 0 per institutional guidelines. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of cyclophosphamide on Days +3 and + 4, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) three times a day on Days +5 through +35 then tapered off over 1 week provided there is no evidence of GVHD, and sirolimus starting on Day +5 and continuing for one year. Sirolimus can be tapered at one year only if donor T-cell chimerism reaches more than 50% in the absence of GVHD.</description>
