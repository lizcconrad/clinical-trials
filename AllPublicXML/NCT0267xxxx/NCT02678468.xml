      To evaluate the effect of early vision screening with automated photorefraction device in
      high risk children

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-term, low-birth-weight, and development delay are well-known risk factors related to
      higher incidence of high refractive error and strabismus, which can potentially lead to
      amblyopia and is regarded as amblyopia risk factors. This project is a cross-sectional
      controlled study. Our study includes high-risk group and normal group. High-risk group
      includes children with birth history of pre-term, low-birth-weight and the diagnosis of
      development delay in FEMH. Normal group enrolled age-matched children without those risk
      factors. Vision screening by FDA-approved photorefraction device as well as comprehensive
      ophthalmic exams for definite diagnosis will be performed on the high-risk group and the
      normal group.
