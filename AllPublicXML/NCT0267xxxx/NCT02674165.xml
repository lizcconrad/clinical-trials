    <textblock>
      The Haitian American Responsible Teen (HART) afterschool program, a cultural adaptation of
      the BART curriculum, will provide an HIV/AIDS curriculum adapted to Haitian students that
      consists of eight sessions lasting approximately two hours each over a twelve- week period.
      The comparison group will receive a nutrition intervention during the same time period. The
      primary goals of the evaluation are to determine the effectiveness of the HART program on
      delaying initiation of sexual intercourse, reducing number of sexual partners, and increasing
      &quot;abstinent&quot; behavior and contraception use among those who were sexually experienced at
      baseline.

      Over a five semester period, the programs will be implemented in 7 or more schools in the
      greater Boston area, with offerings in the fall, the spring and summer, among approximately
      780 male and female Haitian students. The programs will recruit 9th &amp; 10th grade Haitian
      students who will range in age from 13 to 19 years old. We will implement a randomized
      controlled trial in which each semester, students within schools will be stratified by gender
      and then randomly assigned to participate in the HART or the nutrition condition. Students
      will be recruited annually and enrolled until the summer of 2015. During the spring and
      summer of 2012, 120 youth will be randomly assigned to a treatment condition. During year
      three, 180 youth will be randomly assigned to condition each semester (360 youth total during
      Year 3). During year four, 180 youth will be randomly assigned in the first semester, and 120
      youth will be randomly assigned in the second semester (300 youth total during Year 4). The
      number of times student-level randomization will occur and the number of groups formed will
      vary depending on the size of the 9th and 10th grade Haitian population served in each
      school.

    <textblock>
      This is an intervention with an evaluation component. In each school, students will have
      equal chance to participate in the sex education class or in the nutrition education class.
      Each participating school will have two (2) groups:

        -  The intervention group which will receive the HART sex education curriculum.

        -  The comparison group which will receive a nutrition education curriculum. There will be
           one PTSD awareness session for both groups.. This session will be provided by mental
           health professionals from the Haitian Mental Health Network. Each group will consist of
           about 13-15 student participants, with the groups meeting each week on specific week
           days. In addition to the ten-week curriculum, there will be sessions at the beginning
           and end of the cycle to administer the pre- and post-test questionnaires. The 12-week
           cycle will be repeated 2-3 times through the school year.

    <description>The pregnancy prevention intervention to be tested is an adaptation of Becoming a Responsible Teen (BART), an evidence-based (proven to work by research) HIV prevention curriculum designed primarily for African American adolescents, ages 14-18, in community-based settings.
The culturally-adapted version HART consists of nine sessions, lasting about 2 hours each, and includes interactive group discussions and role plays that are -performed by adolescents. Unlike BART, one PTSD awareness session has been added to address what happens to people who have been exposed to mental trauma and natural disasters.</description>
