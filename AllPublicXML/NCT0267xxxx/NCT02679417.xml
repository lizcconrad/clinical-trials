    <textblock>
      The type of physical activity such as, aerobic or resistant exercise required to reduce liver
      fat content in patient with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether aerobic exercise should provide improvement of
      hepatic fat content and inflammation as well as metabolic profiles and anthropometric
      parameters better than resistant exercise.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing prevalence of overweight and obese worldwide, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
      (NAFLD) is commonly diagnosed in daily clinical practice. Weight reduction has been the only
      strategy established thus far to reduce hepatic lipid levels. Thus, dietary restriction and
      exercise focusing on weight reduction is recommended as the cornerstone for managing NAFLD.
      Recent reports have indicated that increased exercise greatly reduces hepatic fat
      accumulation and inflammation and the related oxidative stress levels outweigh those achieved
      by dietary restriction alone. Clear guidelines for such a &quot;lifestyle physical activity&quot; for
      NAFLD management are currently lacking. The type of physical activity such as, aerobic or
      resistant exercise required to reduce liver fat content remains unclear.The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether aerobic exercise should provide improvement of hepatic fat
      content and inflammation as well as metabolic profiles and anthropometric parameters better
      than resistant exercise.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatic fat content as assessed by the controlled attenuation parameter.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hepatic fat content will be assessed with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) at baseline and the end of 12 weeks. The CAP measures ultrasonic attenuation in the liver at 3.5 MHz using signals acquired by the FibroScan® M probe based on vibration-controlled transient elastography. The final CAP value, which ranges from 100 to 400 decibels per metre (dB/m), is the median of individual measurements.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepatic inflammation as assessed by serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, ferritin and c-reactive protein.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples will be obtained for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, ferritin and c-reactive protein to evaluate the evidence of hepatic inflammation at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 112 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver fibrosis as assessed by vibration-controlled transient elastography.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Liver fibrosis will be acquired by the FibroScan® M probe based on vibration-controlled transient elastography at baseline and the end of 12 weeks. Liver stiffness measurement will be performed by a single operator who is blinded to all clinical data of the patients. Ten successful acquisitions will be performed on each patient. The median value is considered representative of the elastic modulus of the liver expressed in kilopascal (kPa).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic profiles assessed with the measurement of lipid profiles, plasma glucose, insulin and oral glucose tolerance test.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood samples will be obtained after a 12-hour overnight fast for total cholesterol, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma glucose, insulin, and oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and the end of 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometry and bioelectrical impedance assessed by a bioelectrical fat analyzer.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>All anthropometric measurements will be performed with the subjects wearing light clothes without shoes at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Height will be measured to the nearest 0.01 m using a calibrated wall-mounted stadiometer. Body weight will be determined to the nearest 0.05 kg using a calibrated balance beam scale. Body mass index will be calculated as weight (kg) divided by the height-squared (m2). Body circumferences will be measured with a flexible tape, with the subject in the upright position at the end of a gentle expiration, at the following levels: waist (midway between the lower rib margin and the superior interior iliac spine) and hip (widest circumference over the great trochanters). Bioelectrical impedance analysis will be performed with the use of a bioelectrical fat analyzer at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiorespiratory fitness as assessed with maximal oxygen uptake under treadmill test.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiorespiratory fitness will be assessed by a trained health technician at baseline and the end of 12 weeks. The protocol of treadmill test include a 2-min warm-up, two 3-min exercise stages, and a 2-min cool down period. The protocol goal is to elicit a heart rate that is approximately 75% of the age-predicted maximum (220-age) by the end of the test. Heart rate will be monitored throughout the test, and blood pressure will be measured at the end of each stage. Maximal oxygen uptake (V·O2max) will be estimated using a calculation.</description>
