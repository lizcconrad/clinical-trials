        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  - De novo, restenotic or reoccluded lesion located in the popliteal artery, with or
             without superficial femoral artery involvement

          -  Patient presenting a score from 2 to 5 following Rutherford classification

          -  Patient is willing to comply with specified follow-up evaluations at the specified
             times

          -  Patient is &gt;18 years old

          -  Patient (or their legal representative) understands the nature of the procedure and
             provides written informed consent, prior to enrolment in the study

          -  Prior to enrollment, the guidewire has crossed target lesion

          -  Patient is eligible for treatment with the In.Pact Admiral drug-eluting balloon

          -  The target lesion, visually estimated, has a maximal length of 14 cm and can be
             categorized as either a type A or B lesion according the TASC II guidelines

          -  The target lesion has angiographic evidence of stenosis or restenosis &gt; 50% or
             occlusion which can be passed with standard guidewire manipulation

          -  Target vessel diameter visually estimated is &gt;3.5mm and &lt;7.5 mm

          -  There is angiographic evidence of at least one vessel-runoff to the foot, irrespective
             of whether or not outflow was re-established by means of previous endovascular
             intervention.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - Presence of another stent in the target vessel that was placed during a previous

             stenosis &gt; 30% or ipsilateral iliac treatment conducted after the target lesion
             procedure

          -  Use of thrombectomy, atherectomy or laser devices during procedure
