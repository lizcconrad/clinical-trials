    <textblock>
      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study to assess the effects of
      β-hydroxymethylbutyrate (β-HMB) combined with a resistance training program, after an acute
      process in older patients with sarcopenia in terms of muscle mass, muscle strength and
      physical performance. Treatments compared will be β-hydroxymethylbutyrate (β-HMB) with a
      resistance training program or placebo with a resistance training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is a geriatric syndrome characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and
      strength that occurs with advancing age; it is related to frailty, falls, worsening quality
      of life, and death in chronic and elderly patients. Diagnosis of sarcopenia is based on
      clinical criteria: presence of low muscle mass and the presence of low muscle function and/or
      low physical performance. The latest developments indicate that dietary supplementation
      combined with resistance exercise could be an option to improve muscle mass and function.

      The objective of the study is to assess the effects of β-hydroxymethylbutyrate (β-HMB)
      combined with a resistance training program, after an acute process in older patients with
      sarcopenia in terms of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance.

      Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study with two intervention
      groups. The investigators shall compare placebo against an intervention with β-HMB in
      patients performing a resistance training program after an acute process (post-acute period)
      during 12 weeks. There will be 20 patients in each arm of the study. Additionally a one year
      follow up visit will be performed.
