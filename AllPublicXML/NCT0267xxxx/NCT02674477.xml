  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study whether using an Internet-based program, called the
      Therapeutic Education System (TES), would be helpful for the treatment of substance use and
      other psychiatric problems.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TES has been shown to be helpful as substance abuse treatment in certain groups of people,
      mainly in the outpatient setting by using interactive modules for education. This study will
      expose some participants to this program while they are hospitalized on an inpatient unit,
      and give them access to it after they are discharged from the hospital. Those participants
      will still receive treatment as usual, as will the control group.

    <description>Participants will have the opportunity to use the TES program while hospitalized, at specific, monitored times, and can also use it when discharged by using their specific login information. They can use it as much or as little as they like. They will continue with treatment as usual during and after hospitalization, as well.</description>

    <description>The TES program is made of modules about ways to prevent substance use, such as how to refuse drugs and alcohol, how to cope with thoughts about using, and how to make the best possible decisions for a person's mental health. Each module takes less than 30 minutes to complete. Modules may contain videos or other interactive media. At the end of each module, there are questions about the material.</description>
