  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to examine the effects of atorvastatin, a type of statin, on
      changes to the heart among women undergoing breast cancer treatment. Atorvastatin may reduce
      or eliminate the harmful effects of chemotherapy treatment to the heart tissue of breast
      cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled study. It will compare the effects of atorvastatin against the
      effects of a placebo (an inactive substance, such as, a sugar pill) on changes to the heart
      before and during breast cancer treatment. Participants will be in the study for
      approximately a year and a half, and the study will enroll up to 60 patients. During that
      time, there will be six visits that may coincide with standard of care visits. Participants
      will also receive telephone calls from study staff during the study intervention and a
      follow-up phase to check-in with them.

          -  Histologically confirmed HER2, ER, and PR status

          -  Recommended to undergo trastuzumab treatment, with or without anthracycline. Patients
             will be eligible for up to 3 weeks after starting treatment.

          -  Age minimum 18 years

          -  Able and willing to read, understand, and sign an informed consent form (ICF) and

          -  Not using statin medication but is eligible for statin therapy based on the 2013
             ACC/AHA guidelines (LDL cholesterol &gt;190, or LDL &lt;190 and ASCVD risk &gt;7.5%;
             http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-Estimator/) and is &gt; 50 years old; or is eligible for
             statin therapy based on the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines and is 40-50 years old and wishes
             to be placed on statin therapy

          -  History of adverse effects, intolerance, or allergic reactions attributed to statin

             constrictive pericarditis, or other cardiomyopathy)

          -  Left ventricular dysfunction (EF &lt; 55%)

             in body the prohibiting MRI, prior gadolinium contrast reaction, or uncontrolled
             moderate hypertension (sitting blood pressure &gt;160/95 mm Hg with measurements recorded
             on at least 2 occasions).

          -  Has metallic breast expanders in place at the time of screening
