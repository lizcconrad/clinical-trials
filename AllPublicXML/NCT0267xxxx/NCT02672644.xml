      Study is designed to characterize subject and treating investigator reported outcomes in the
      early post-treatment period, following bilateral correction of nasolabial folds using Emervel
      Classic and Emervel Deep.

        1. to evaluate subject-reported return to social engagement, after the initial treatment
           (Baseline/Day 1 visit).

        2. to evaluate change in Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) at day 30-
           subject/investigator reported

        3. to evaluate subject satisfaction with treatment outcome at baseline, day 14 and day 30.

        4. to evaluate change in Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) from baseline to
           post-treatment follow-up time points at day 14 and Day 30 - investigator reported

        5. to evaluate all adverse events during the course of the study

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects, 35 to 60 years of age

          2. Bilateral NLFs: severe (WSRS = 4/4) or moderate (WSRS = 3/3), as assessed by the
             treating investigator

          3. Subjects of childbearing potential who agree to use medically accepted methods of
             contraception during the study and for 30 days following study completion.

        Childbearing potential is defined as not being surgically sterile (e.g., hysterectomy,
        bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or those who are not post-menopausal
        (absence of menstruation for at least 1 year prior to Day 1).

        - If not surgically sterile or post-menopausal, the subject agrees to use acceptable forms
        of contraception. Acceptable methods of contraception are defined as follows:

          1. use of oral/systemic contraceptives for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
             study; or

          2. use of an intrauterine device; or

          3. use of double barrier (e.g., condom or diaphragm and spermicidal foam/gel, condom and
             diaphragm); or

          4. use of contraceptive implants or injectables for at least 28 days prior to the start
             of the study; or

          5. partner with vasectomy at least 3 months prior to study start; or

          6. strict abstinence.

        Females of child bearing potential must have negative urine pregnancy test (UPT) at Day 1
        and Day 14 if touch-up is to be performed.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject who presents with a severity of wrinkles or folds that require other
             treatments, e.g. laser treatment, chemical peeling, to achieve optimal correction

          2. Previous facial surgery, including aesthetic facial surgical therapy, liposuction or
             tattoo, in the treatment area

          3. Previous tissue augmenting therapy or contouring with permanent filler-type injectable
             product

          4. Previous tissue augmenting therapy with non-permanent filler or fat-injection in the
             facial area to be treated, within twelve (12) months before treatment

          5. Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with neurotoxin below the zygomatic arch,
             within six (6) months before treatment

          6. Previous tissue revitalisation treatment with laser or light, mesotherapy, chemical
             peeling or dermabrasion below the zygomatic arch within six (6) months before
             treatment

          7. Subject who presents with severe midface volume loss

          8. Subject has a beard or facial hair that, in the investigator's opinion, would
             interfere with the study injections and/or study assessments

          9. Woman who plans to become pregnant during the study

         10. Woman who is pregnant or breast feeding

         11. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to any injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) gel

         12. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to local anaesthetics, e.g. lidocaine or
             other amide-type anaesthetics

         13. Known/previous allergy or hypersensitivity to gram-positive bacterial proteins

         14. History of severe or multiple allergies manifested by anaphylaxis

         15. History of bleeding disorders or treatment with anticoagulants or inhibitors of
             platelet aggregation within two (2) weeks before treatment

         16. Treatment with chemotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, immunomodulatory therapy (e.g.
             monoclonal antibodies), systemic or topical (facial) corticosteroids (inhaled
             corticoids are allowed) within three (3) months before study treatment

         17. Any medical condition or treatment that, in the opinion of the treating investigator,
             would make the subject unsuitable for inclusion

         18. Study site personnel, close relatives of the study site personnel (e.g. parents,
             children, siblings, or spouse), employees, or close relatives of employees at the
             Sponsor company

         19. Participation in any clinical study within thirty (30) days before treatment
