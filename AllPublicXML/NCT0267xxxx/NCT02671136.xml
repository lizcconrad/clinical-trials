  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes and Periodontitis are both prevalent diseases affecting millions of Americans.
      Periodontitis is prevalent among Diabetics. Furthermore, Periodontitis and associated
      inflammation can increase insulin resistance in Diabetics and worsens the condition.
      Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) has the potential to improve periodontal treatment outcome
      in poorly controlled diabetics. The study will compare periodontal treatment (SRP) outcome
      between 2 main diabetic type 2 patient groups receiving medical care treatment: either
      Conventional Wound Therapies (CWC) with or without adjunctive Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy at
      LLU Health.

      24 poorly controlled diabetic mellitus (DM) type 2 subjects (HbA1c =&gt;7%) with Periodontitis
      will be assigned into the study arms HBO therapy and Non HBO therapy, based on their medical
      needs.

      For all subjects demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, smoking history, alcohol use
      history, BMI, current medication list) and oral health habits will be obtained. Blood samples
      for HbA1c determinations, clinical periodontal measurements (plaque index, probing
      measurements including pocket depth, attachment levels, gingival index and
      bleeding-on-probing) and subgingival microbial samples will be obtained at baseline and end
      of the study. Subgingival microbial samples will be collected from three randomly selected
      sites and analyzed for detection of about 300 of the most prevalent oral bacterial species.
      Differences in periodontal clinical outcomes and bacterial profiles will be identified
      utilizing ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance).

    <description>Subgingival microbial samples will be obtained at baseline and end of the study. Subgingival microbial samples will be collected from three randomly selected sites with probing depth =&gt;5mm. Collected microbial samples will be processed for HOMINGS analysis (The Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray). Counts and proportions of each bacterial species will be determined for each subject and then averaged across subjects in the two groups. Differences in bacterial profiles will be analyzed using the repeated measures ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) procedure for paired observations.</description>
