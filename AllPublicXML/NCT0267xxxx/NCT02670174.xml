  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of a traditional
      home exercise program versus 2 kinetic chain home exercise programs on treatment outcome of
      overhead athletes with shoulder impingement syndrome. Primary outcome measures are reduction
      of pain and disability, and improvement in functionality and sports performance. Secondary
      outcome measures are strength, mobility, flexibility and functional performance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participant are randomly assigned in 3 home exercise groups.

        1. The traditional program: consists of solely strengthening the rotator cuff muscles and
           scapular muscles (e.g. external rotation)

        2. Separate kinetic chain program: same exercises as the first group but they also receive
           an exercise program to separately train the core and lower body. (e.g. external rotation
           separately and squat separately)

        3. Integrated kinetic chain program: same exercises as the first group but all exercises
           are performed while simultaneously activating the kinetic chain. (e.g. external rotation
           while squatting).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Shoulder Pain And Disability Index (SPADI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill in the SPADI questionnaire to evaluate shoulder pain and function. This questionnaire is a self-administered, shoulder-specific index consisting of 13 items, divided into two subscales, pain and function with responses to each item scored on a 10-point scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Western Ontario Shoulder Stability index (WOSI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>The WOSI is a patient-evaluated disease-specific quality of life scoring questionnaire that has been developed for shoulder instability patients. It consists of 21 items each scored on a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Each item falls into one of the domains of: Physical function, sports/recreation/work, lifestyle and emotional well-being. Each question is scored between 0-100 points and the summation of all the questions results in a final WOSI score. The final score ranges from 0 (best possible score - the patient is experiencing no decrease in shoulder related quality of life) to 2100 (worst score - signifies extreme distress in shoulder-related quality of life).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Return To Play (RTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Is it possible to return to play after 6 weeks intervention or not? In addition, following question was asked: on a scale of 0 to 100%, what is the extent to which the injured shoulder has reached the shoulder function before the injury occurred?</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective perception of shoulder improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rated their subjective perception of improvement of their shoulder pain as ''improved,'' ''not changed'' or ''worse.'' If they selected ''improved'' or ''worse,'' the amount of change was scored on a 5-point scale (very little change, little change, some change, a large change, a very large change)</description>

Shoulder: external and internal rotation
Hip: external and internal rotation
Scapula: scapular upward rotation at 0°, 90° en 120° of elevation in the scapular plane.</description>

    <measure>Changes in scapular dyskinesis</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and within one week after the 6-weeks training program</time_frame>
    <description>Scapular dyskinesis will be measured by observing the scapular movement during active elevation. For both sides (left and right), scapular dyskinesis was evaluated as being present or not. In case dyskinesis was present, the amount of dyskinesis is scored as subtle or prominent.</description>
