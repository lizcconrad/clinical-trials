      Purpose of Project

      Smoke and bio-aerosols are routinely produced by surgical instruments; eg, lasers,
      electrosurgical units, radiofrequency devices, ultrasonic devices, power tools. Plume and
      bio-aerosols contain odor-causing and odorless toxic gases, vapors, dead and live cellular
      debris (including blood fragments), and viruses. These airborne contaminants can pose
      respiratory, ocular, dermatological and other health-related risks, including mutagenic and
      carcinogenic potential, to patients and operating room personnel. The National Institute of
      Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) have also
      studied electrosurgical smoke at length. Therefore, the equipment of smoke evacuation in OR
      needs to be used. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the pre-post smoke evacuation uses
      on surgical smoke and bio-aerosols particles in operating rooms at a university hospital,
      Thailand.

      Methodology Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN) guideline is used as the
      conceptual framework of this study including evidence based practice for smoke and
      bio-aerosols evacuation systems. The study design is a quasi-experimental study (manipulation
      and control only, without randomization) comparing the amount of surgical smoke and
      bio-aerosols particles pre- post smoke evacuation uses. The samples consist of 64 cases of
      surgical patients who receive head-neck or breast surgery and 64 cases of surgical patients
      who receive abdominal laparoscopic surgery. The amount of surgical smoke and bio-aerosols'
      particles in the surgical field and OR environment are measured by AeroTraxTM Handheld
      Airborne Particle Counter Model 9306.

    <description>The intervention group, using the smoke evacuation (RapidVac Smoke Evacuator) in each OR, the data collection for the amount of surgical smoke and bio-aerosols' particles will be collected during pre-surgery and during surgery (every 30 mins).
Before using the smoke evacuation, the amount of surgical smoke and bio-aerosols' particles in the surgical field and OR environment will be measured by AeroTraxTM Handheld Airborne Particle Counter. This record includes the amount and size of smoke and bio-aerosol particles in each area such as anesthetic area (anesthesiologist physicians and nurses area); instrument preparation area (circulating nurses area) and surgical area (surgeons and scrub nurses areas).</description>
