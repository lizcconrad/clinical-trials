          -  Ability to understand and follow study-related instructions.

          -  Females have to be in postmenopausal state, revealed by: Medical history, if
             applicable (natural menopause at least 12 months prior to first study drug
             administration; or surgical menopause by bilateral ovariectomy at least 3 months prior
             to first study drugadministration) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 IU/L at
             screening examination.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use condoms as an effective contraception barrier method
             during the whole study (starting after informed consent) and for 3 months after the
             end of treatment with BAY1841788 (ODM-201). In addition, participants must agree to
             utilize a second reliable method of contraception simultaneously. The second method
             which has to be used by a female partner of childbearing potential can be one of the
             following methods: diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide or intra-uterine device
             or hormone-based contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical and surgical history

               -  Subjects with clinically relevant findings in medical history e.g. history or
                  currently existing relevant diseases of vital organs, central nervous system (for
                  example seizures) or other organs (e.g. diabetes mellitus).

               -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases for which it can be assumed that the
                  absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the study drugs
                  will not be normal.

               -  Febrile illness within 1 week before the first study drug administration.

               -  A medical history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (e.g. family history of
                  Long QT interval in electrocardiogram Syndrome) or other arrhythmias.

          -  History of myopathia after treatment with statins.

               -  History of rhabdomyolysis or myopathia.

               -  Medical history of any type of psychiatric disorder, especially mood disorders
                  including medical history with suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts.

               -  History of thyroid disorders, especially hypothyreosis.

               -  History of respiratory disorder (excluding history of bronchitis or pneumonia).

               -  History of myasthenia.

               -  History of muscle pain or muscle ache, muscle soreness of unknown origin or on
                  frequent occasions although an origin might have been found.

               -  History of any clinically significant hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

               -  Relevant hepatic disorders like a history of viral hepatitis, cholestasis,
                  disturbances of bilirubin metabolism, any progressive liver disease.

               -  Relevant renal disorders like recurrent glomerulonephritis, renal injury, and
                  renal insufficiency. However, a history of a single episode of uncomplicated
                  nephrolithiasis will not prevent participation.
