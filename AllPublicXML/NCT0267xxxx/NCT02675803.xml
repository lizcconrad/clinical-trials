    <textblock>
      This study will have three sequential parts which will investigate the safety and
      tolerability of VAY736 administered as single ascending doses of intravenous infusion (Part
      1), single ascending doses of subcutaneous injection (Part 2), and repeated subcutaneous
      injections of fixed doses (Part 3), respectively, in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Part 1 is
      double blind, placebo controlled, with 11 cohorts. Part 2 is open-label study with 2 dosing
      cohorts. Part 3 is open-label study with 1 fixed-dose cohort.
