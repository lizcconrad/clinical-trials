  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether war-traumatize male adolescents with
      behavioral and emotional problems who participate in mind-body skills groups will have
      improvement in behavioral and emotional problems, aggression, and posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) symptoms, compared to a wait list control group.

    <textblock>
      Mind-body skills incorporate meditation, guided imagery, breathing techniques, autogenic
      training, biofeedback, genograms, and self-expression through words, drawings, and movement
      in a small group setting. These groups have been used in war-traumatize populations in
      Kosovo, Gaza and the United States. This study will be investigating the effect of the
      mind-body skills groups on boys with behavioral and emotional problem at a high school in
      Gaza to determine if there is improvement in behavioral and emotional problems, aggression,
      and posttraumatic stress disorder. The results will be compared to a control high school with
      boys who will not be attending mind-body skills groups and who have experienced similar
      levels of trauma and also have behavioral and emotional problems.

      The mind-body skills groups will be held for 2 hours once a week for 10 weeks and then once a
      month for 10 months. Measures will be taken at baseline, after the 10 week mind-body skills
      group program and again at 10 month follow-up.

    <description>The 25 item Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) measures behavioral and emotional function. These 25 items are divided into 5 subscales: emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and prosocial behavior. The SDQ is scored on a 3 point Likert-type scale with the responses &quot;not true, &quot;somewhat true&quot;, and &quot;certainly true&quot;.
