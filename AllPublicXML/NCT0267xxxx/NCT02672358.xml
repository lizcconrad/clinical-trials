  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm, phase II study to assess
      efficacy and safety of the dabrafenib and trametinib combination in Japanese patients with
      any line, stage IV NSCLC harboring a confirmed BRAF V600E mutation.

      Patients will receive oral dabrafenib twice daily and oral trametinib once daily combination
      therapy. Patients may continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      adverse events, start of a new anti-cancer therapy, consent withdrawal, death, or end of the
      study. Patients who have met the criteria for disease progression (PD) according to RECIST
      v1.1 may continue to receive study treatment if the investigator believes the patient is
      receiving clinical benefit and the patient is willing to continue on study treatment. After
      discontinuation of study treatment, all patients will be followed for survival until death,
      lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or end of study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC stage IV (according to
             AJCC Staging 7th Edition)

          -  Presence of a BRAF V600E mutation in lung cancer tissue. BRAF V600E mutation tested by
             local laboratory (e.g. study center laboratory, local laboratory company) with proper
             quality control and license to operation by local health authority is allowed.

          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with a BRAF inhibitor (including but not limited to dabrafenib,
             vemurafenib, encorafenib, and XL281/BMS-908662) or MEK inhibitor (including but not
             limited to trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib, AZD6244, and RDEA119) prior to start
             of study treatment

          -  Patients with brain metastases are excluded if their brain metastases are:

               -  Symptomatic OR

               -  Treated (surgery, radiation therapy) but not clinically and radiographically
                  stable 3 weeks after local therapy (as assessed by contrast enhanced magnetic
                  resonance imaging [MRI] or computed tomography [CT]), OR

               -  Asymptomatic and untreated but &gt;1 cm in the longest dimension

          -  History of malignancy with confirmed activating RAS mutation at any time.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis

          -  A history or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO)

          -  Current evidence of unstable aneurysm or one that needs treatment

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion may apply.
