  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A PRoBE design study will be used to obtain saliva from patients before undergoing blood
      study evaluation for screening at risk patients for the presence of undiagnosed pre-diabetes
      of type II diabetes. Pre-specified saliva biomarkers will be evaluated along with
      multi-marker models for their discriminatory value for distinguishing patients with normal
      glucose metabolism from those with disease. Appropriate housekeeping genes will also be
      incorporated to allow for the measurement of relative gene expression.

      Prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) methods will be
      employed to collect saliva and evaluate transcriptome markers for early pre-diabetes and type
      II diabetes identification. At risk patients will have fasting blood glucose and insulin
      levels measured along with hemoglobin A1c and 2 hour post-prandial glucose levels. Saliva
      samples will be stored and will be analyzed after pre-specifying a panel of mRNAs and a multi
      marker model for validation. The pre-specified mRNAs and multi-marker model will be
      determined after analysis of data from a currently ongoing case-control study. After
      analyzing the data from this prior trial a validation plan will be locked before analysis of
      the prospectively collected specimens. Pre-diabetes will be defined based on abnormal glucose
      tolerance tests. Insulin resistance will be calculated as HOMA IR. The diagnostic value of
      the salivary transcriptome for will be compared with that of hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood
      glucose for the detection of pre-diabetes, insulin resistance and type II diabetes.
