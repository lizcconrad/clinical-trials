      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Therapeutic Ultrasound is effective in the
      treatment of Plantar fasciitis (PF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis (PF) is the main cause of pain in the bottom of the heel. According to the
      American Physical Therapy Association guidelines since 2008, many treatments have been
      described to correct the problem, but there are very few high level randomized trials that
      proved them. Although not mentioned even in clinical treatment guidelines in PF, one of the
      most common conservative treatments for use, in general and Israel in particular, is a
      therapeutic ultrasound device. Despite this widespread use, there are very few research
      evidence which examining the effectiveness of this device for the treatment of PF. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of therapeutic ultrasound versus sham
      ultrasound on pain, function and quality of life of patients with PF. Our hypothesis is that
      the use of ultrasound parameters that cause an increase in the target tissue heat (from 1.75
      to 1 W/cm2, Continues intensity of 1 MHZ) will result in a significant improvement than
      placebo. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will do a prospective, controlled, randomized,
      double-blind interventional clinical study. The study population will include 60 patients,
      aged 18 or older, suffering from PF and meet inclusion criteria. Subjects will be divided
      randomly into study or control group, Both groups will receive stretching Instructions, when
      the study group will Receive active ultrasound and the control group will Receive sham
      ultrasound. Both groups will receive 8 treatments, twice a week.
