    <textblock>
      This study will consist of three parts: 1) a retrospective chart review of patients treated
      for mRCC from July 2013 until the start of the educational intervention; 2) an educational
      program for DCN community oncology providers and DCN community patients with mRCC, lasting 8
      - 10 months, and 3) a second retrospective chart review of patients treated for mRCC starting
      at the time of the educational intervention until the intervention is completed.

      The initial retrospective cohort will serve as the pre-education control, and the second
      cohort will be the experimental group to assess the efficacy of the educational intervention
      to change care of patients with mRCC.

      Chart Reviews. This study will begin with a multi-site chart review conducted at the Duke
      Cancer Network affiliated sites. The chart review will begin in late fall, 2015. The Duke
      Cancer Network team will perform chart abstraction for this study, with a goal of reviewing
      at least 60 charts of patients treated between July 2013 and October 2015.

      The second data collection period will collect data on patients with mRCC seen at DCN sites
      after the date in fall 2015 when the educational intervention is rolled out. The target will
      again be at least 60 charts of patients treated during the time the educational intervention
      is actively available.
