      Does lung ablation improve clinical outcomes for patients deemed to be surgically high-risk?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection is the gold standard treatment for localized non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). However, surgery is invasive and not all patients are surgical candidates, thus
      providing an opportunity for percutaneous microwave ablation, for both primary and metastatic
      disease. Patients that are deemed inoperable are typically treated with other targeted
      therapies such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation and stereotactic body radiation
      therapy (SBRT), or systemic therapies. Percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) is an
      alternative option for targeted treatment of cancer. Microwave tumor ablation is a procedure
      that uses heat made by an electric current to destroy a tumor (ablation). With imaging
      equipment, such as ultrasound or CT (computed tomography), and a small incision made in the
      skin, the tumor is located and treated with radiofrequency energy. The cells that are killed
      by the microwave ablation are typically not removed but are eventually replaced by fibrosis
      and scar tissue. Patients will be followed for 1 year by contrast enhanced chest CT, chest
      PET/CT and chest PET/MRI to evaluate lesion outcomes.

    <description>The safety evaluation is based on the major complication rates of performing microwave ablation. The intent is to determine if the results are within acceptable range of what is reported for RFA, cryoablation and surgery. If the microwave ablation has a safety profile that is outside the &quot;standard of care&quot; range, then the procedure would be deemed unacceptable and no further studies of the current generation of microwave ablation would be recommended. The study team has deemed major complication rates of 50% or greater as outside of the &quot;standard of care&quot; range.</description>
