      Walking Meditation program will be based on aerobic walking exercise combined with Buddhist
      meditation. The subjects will perform walking while listening to the sound &quot;Budd&quot; and &quot;Dha&quot;
      and squeeze rubber balls according to the sound in order to practice mindfulness while
      walking. In phase 1 (week 1-6), Walking Meditation will be conducted at initial moderate
      intensity (41-50% heart rate reserve) 3 sets, 10 minutes per set and rest 3 minutes between
      set In phase 2 (week 7-12), the training intensity will be increased to ultimate moderate
      intensity (51-60% heart rate reserve) 3 sets, 15 minutes per set and rest 3 minutes between
      set. In both phases of the training, the frequency of Walking Meditation training is three
      times a week.

    <measure>Change from baseline in vascular reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular reactivity or brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) will be assessed with the ultrasound equipment (CX50, Philips, USA), using the blood occlusion technique on the forearm. The brachial artery will be illustrated above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal plane. Brachial FMD will be measured at resting and the cuff placed around the forearm will be inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure for 5 minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes of recovery. FMD will be calculated from the formula FMD= (D2-D1) x100/D1 when D1 is the brachial artery diameter at baseline, D2 is the maximal post-occlusion brachial artery diameter.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Venous blood flow will be assessed with the ultrasound equipment (CX50, Philips, USA). The Basilic vain will be illustrated in the longitudinal plane. Venous blood flow will be measured at resting and squeezing hand for 3 minutes and 5 minutes of recovery. Venous blood flow will be calculated from the formula CSA x V when CSA is the cross sectional area of Basilic vain, V is the velocity in vessel.</description>
