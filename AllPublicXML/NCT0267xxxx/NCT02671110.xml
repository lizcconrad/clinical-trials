      This study compared the recently developed Transforming Your Life (TYL) weight loss program
      to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), considered the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; in behavioral weight
      loss treatment.

      Weight loss programs evidence considerable variability in treatment outcomes and weight
      regain is common, signaling the need for the refinement of effective treatments. This study
      compared the recently developed Transforming Your Life (TYL) program to the Diabetes
      Prevention Program (DPP), considered the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; in behavioral weight loss treatment.

    <description>The TYL program emphasized: 1) helping participants develop and maintain healthy habits and disrupt unhealthy habits, 2) enabling participants to create a personal food and exercise environment that increases exposure to healthy eating and physical activity and encourages automatic responding to goal-related cues, and 3) facilitating participants' weight loss motivation.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The DPP recommends that participants set a weight loss reduction goal of 7% or more of their baseline body weight, reduce consumption of high fat foods as a means to reduce caloric intake, and engage in brisk walking or other moderate intensity physical activity for 150 minutes per week. Sessions include information on changing energy intake and energy output through diet and exercise, and addressing psychological, social, environmental, and motivational challenges to health behavior change.</description>
