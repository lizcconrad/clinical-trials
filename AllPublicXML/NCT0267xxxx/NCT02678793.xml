        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female aged &gt;18 years at the time of the Screening Visit.

          2. Completion of study 4975-MN-202.

          3. Female not of childbearing potential, defined as post-menopausal for at least 1 year,
             or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy), or practicing one of the following medically acceptable methods of
             birth control throughout the study period:

               1. Hormonal methods such as oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal
                  contraceptives for a minimum of 1 full cycle (based on the subject's usual
                  menstrual cycle period) before investigational product (IP) administration.

               2. Total abstinence from sexual intercourse since the last menses before IP
                  administration.

               3. Intrauterine device.

               4. Double barrier method (condoms, sponge, diaphragm, with spermicidal jellies or
                  cream).

          4. Willing and able to understand the study requirements, abide by the study
             restrictions, complete the study procedures, pain scales, and weekly IWRS/IVRS
             entries, and to communicate meaningfully with the study personnel.

          5. Signed an Informed Consent Form approved by the Institutional Review Board.

          6. Subject agrees to take only the rescue medications for neuroma foot pain from the time
             of screening through study completion, and agrees to discontinue all topical
             medications for neuroma pain after Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other chronic pain anywhere in the body that is severe in intensity or would interfere
             with the subject's ability to evaluate foot pain from intermetatarsal neuroma.

          2. Signs of arterial insufficiency in the feet, including clinically meaningful edema.

          3. Raynaud's disease or phenomenon, previous frostbite, or other cause of vascular
             instability in the feet resulting from application of cold to the foot.

          4. Daily use of opioids for any condition.

          5. Corticosteroid injection in the affected foot within 30 days of Screening.

          6. Presence of any medical condition (or taking any medication) or unstable health status
             that, in the judgment of the investigator, might adversely impact the conduct of the
             study or resulting data, including chronic conditions that are likely to alter the
             rate of healing or are likely to result in safety complications unrelated to the study
             medication, such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or vascular disease.

          7. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory result at the Screening Visit (in the
             opinion of the investigator).

          8. Has a positive pregnancy test at the Screening Visit.
