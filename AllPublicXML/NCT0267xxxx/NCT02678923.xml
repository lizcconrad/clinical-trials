    <textblock>
      This study will be a proof-of-concept, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial in
      participants with a recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to evaluate the efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics, safety, tolerability, disease progression measures by IVUS, and
      pharmacodynamics of MDCO-216 infusion. Eligible participants will be randomized to receive 5
      infusions of MDCO-216 20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

    <measure>Change From Baseline In Percent Atheroma Volume (PAV) At Day 36</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 36</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to Day 36 post-randomization in PAV in a targeted (imaged) coronary artery for all anatomically comparable slices, as determined by IVUS. The change is calculated by subtracting the value at Baseline from the value at Day 36, with positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Change in PAV was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included Baseline PAV as a covariate and treatment group as factor. Least Squares (LS) mean was adjusted for stratification factors of country and prior statin use.</description>

             clinically indicated coronary angiogram.

          -  A qualifying ACS event will be defined as follows: a diagnosis of a qualifying
             myocardial infarction (MI) event will be defined by abnormal levels of cardiac
             biomarkers (troponin I or T or creatine kinase myoglobin [CK-MB] mass) with at least
             one determination greater than the 99th percentile or upper limits of normal (ULN) for
             the laboratory and at least one of the following: chest discomfort or symptoms of
             myocardial ischemia (≥10 minutes) at rest within 24 hours prior to hospitalization for
             MI and/or new electrocardiogram (ECG) findings (or presumed new if no prior ECG
             available) indicative of acute myocardial ischemia in absence of left ventricular
             hypertrophy (LVH) and left bundle branch block (LBB).

          -  Baseline coronary angiogram must meet all of the following criteria for IVUS
             interrogation of target artery:

               -  Target artery must be accessible to the IVUS catheter

               -  Target artery must have a stenotic area of ≥20% and &lt;50% in lumen diameter by
                  angiographic visual estimation within the length of the native coronary artery
                  (&quot;target segment&quot;) for imaging by IVUS

               -  Target artery has not undergone prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or
                  coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)

               -  Target artery is not currently a candidate for intervention or a likely candidate
                  for intervention over the treatment phase of the study and until the second IVUS
                  interrogation at Day 36; the target artery may not be a bypass graft

               -  Target artery may not be the culprit vessel for a previous MI.

        The target artery may have the following:

          -  A lesion of up to 60% stenosis, distal to the target segment, provided that this area
             is not a target for PCI or CABG

          -  A single branch of the &quot;target vessel&quot; may have a narrowing ≤70% by visual estimation,
             provided that the branch in question is not a target for PCI or CABG.

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent before initiation of any study-related
             procedures and willing to comply with all required study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Baseline IVUS not completed due to non-qualifying coronary angiogram as demonstrated
             by a greater than 50% reduction in lumen of the left main coronary artery by visual
             estimation, or extensive coronary artery disease (CAD) with no target vessel for IVUS
             interrogation.

          -  Baseline IVUS interrogation determined to be unacceptable by the Atherosclerosis
             Imaging Core Laboratory.

          -  ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) within the last 90 days

          -  Clinically significant heart disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator, is
             likely to require CABG, PCI cardiac transplantation, surgical or percutaneous valve
             repair, and/or replacement following index IVUS imaging (does not apply to PCI that
             occurs as a result of initial screening angiogram and completed prior to index IVUS
             imaging).

          -  New York Heart Failure Association Class III or IV heart failure or last known left
             ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%.

        <title>Change From Baseline In Percent Atheroma Volume (PAV) At Day 36</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline to Day 36 post-randomization in PAV in a targeted (imaged) coronary artery for all anatomically comparable slices, as determined by IVUS. The change is calculated by subtracting the value at Baseline from the value at Day 36, with positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Change in PAV was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included Baseline PAV as a covariate and treatment group as factor. Least Squares (LS) mean was adjusted for stratification factors of country and prior statin use.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Total Atheroma Volume (TAV) At Day 36</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline to Day 36 post-randomization in normalized TAV in a targeted (imaged) coronary artery for all anatomically comparable slices, as determined by IVUS. The change is calculated by subtracting the value at Baseline from the value at Day 36, with positive numbers to represent increases and negative numbers to represent decreases. Change in TAV was analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model that included Baseline TAV as a covariate and treatment group as factor. LS mean was adjusted for stratification factors of country and prior statin use.</description>
