      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of freeze-dried, capsulized FMT and fresh
      FMT in adults with slow transit constipation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Constipation is a chronic disease estimated to affect about 10% - 15% of the worldwide
      general population. Constipation frequency appears to augment with increasing age,
      particularly after 65 years old.

      Recent evidence in the literature and collected in the investigators' laboratory confirm that
      constipation can be a consequence of intestinal dysbiosis, with an increase of potentially
      pathogenic microorganisms and a decrease of potentially beneficial microorganisms. These
      alterations may affect the motility and metabolic environment of colon, especially the
      production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

      A new and under-explored method to manipulate the gastrointestinal microbiota involves fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). There has been growing interest in the use of fecal
      microbiota for the treatment of patients with chronic gastrointestinal infections (e.g. CDI)
      and other extraintestinal conditions (e.g. IBD). Similarly, the investigators suppose that
      reshaping the gut microbiome with FMT would be effective for patients with slow transit
      constipation.
