  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Air pollution continues to be a key global issue with many governments focusing great
      attention on air quality legislation because of its harmful environmental and health impacts.
      Whilst there is much that remains unknown about the mechanisms underlying the negative health
      effects of air pollution, it is generally acknowledged that air pollution exposure leads to
      an increase in cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and respiratory mortality and morbidity. The
      current study will investigate systemic effects during a 72 hour period after a controlled
      diesel exhaust exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to air pollution (both indoor and outdoor sources) contributes to the premature
      deaths of 7 million people each year, primarily linked to cardiovascular and respiratory
      conditions. Within the complex mixture which air pollution comprises, combustion derived
      particulate matter (PM) has been suggested as one of the most harmful components to the
      cardiopulmonary system. In urban areas PM derived from combustion originates largely from
      diesel vehicles.

      Numerous experimental chamber studies have demonstrated respiratory as well as cardiovascular
      dysfunctions after the inhalation of diesel exhaust. Many of these dysfunctions are driven by
      inflammation and oxidative stress. There is much less knowledge concerning the systemic
      effects of diesel exhaust exposure, and especially over longer time courses than 24 hours.

      The investigators aim to investigate the time course of systemic effects (such as markers of
      inflammation, cardiovascular dysfunction, and oxidative stress) in blood and urine samples
      taken after a diesel exhaust exposure. The effects of exercise or rest in an experimental
      chamber exposure will also be investigated.
