      The goal of this project is to examine how estrogen may influence the resting-state
      connectivity and the extinction-induced activation of the fear extinction network.

      The aim of the study was to examine the influence of exogenous estrogen administration on the
      activation of the fear extinction network in women. We collected functional MRI data and
      psychophysiological indices to test the influence of estrogen on women's ability to regulate
      conditioned fear responses. Women underwent a 3day experimental paradigm using classical fear
      conditioning. The first day was conducted outside the scanner, while days 2 and 3 were done
      inside the fMRI scanner and tested fear extinction learning and recall in days 2 and 3,
      respectively. The estrogen (or placebo) pill was given just hours before extinction learning
      test on day 2. No followups were conducted after women completed the 3 day study.
