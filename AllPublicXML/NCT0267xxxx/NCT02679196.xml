    <textblock>
      Multiple ascending dose study to evaluate safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamics effects of KA2237 (PI3 Kinase p110β/δ Inhibitor) in patients with B Cell
      Lymphoma and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Part I of the study. In Part II,
      patients with B cell lymphoma will be treated with KA2237 at the MTD to evaluate safety and
      efficacy in the patient population.
