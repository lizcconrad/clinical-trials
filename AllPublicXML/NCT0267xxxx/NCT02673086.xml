      The primary aim of this study is to compare needle tip visibility between the coracoid
      approach and retroclavicular approach for infraclavicular brachial plexus block in patients
      undergoing elective upper limb surgery. Secondary aim is to investigate the differences
      between the two groups in the needle shaft visibility, sensorial block success rate, block
      performance time, block performance related pain, motor block success rate, surgical success
      rate, complications, patient satisfaction, use of supplemental local anesthetic, use of
      analgesic.

      Infraclavicular blocks are performed with different approaches. Infraclavicular block is
      usually traditionally performed at coracoid approach. Different approaches has been described
      for this block such as vertical approach. This study evaluated the effectiveness, safety and
      feasibility of a retroclavicular brachial plexus block as compared with traditionally
      coracoid approach for infraclavicular brachial plexus block. 100 patients scheduled for
      elective upper limb surgery were recruited and randomized into two groups: Coracoid approach
      for infraclavicular block (Group I), retroclavicular approach for infraclavicular block
      (Group R). Sensory block, adverse effects and complications were evaluated and recorded every
      10 minutes until 30min after local anesthetic injection.Success rate of each nerve sensory
      block, complications, rate of satisfaction, rate of failure and incidence rate of adverse
      effects, the needle tip and shaft visibility, procedure time,duration of the block's effect,
      use of supplemental local anesthetic, use of analgesic.are compared with both groups.
