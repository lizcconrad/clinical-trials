  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the microbiological safety and the efficacy of a new not
      expensive, easy and fast technique (Direct Microswimup) for sperm preparation in In Vitro
      Fertilization (IVF) treatments without the use of centrifuge, able to simplify the procedure
      and to avoid mismatches by ensuring the same results of the standard techniques in terms of
      fertilization rate, blastulation rate, pregnancy/abortion rate, cryostorage rate, and a
      better euploid status of the embryos.
