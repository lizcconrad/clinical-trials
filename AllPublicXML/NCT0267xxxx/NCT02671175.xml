  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 3 months of malaria chemoprevention
      post-discharge using dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DHA-P) in children under 5 years of age
      admitted with severe anemia. One half will receive monthly DHA-P and the other half placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children hospitalized with severe anemia in Africa are at high risk of readmission or death
      within 6 months after discharge. No strategy specifically addresses this post-discharge
      period. In Malawi, 3 months of post-discharge malaria chemoprevention with monthly 3-day
      treatment courses of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in children with severe malarial anemia
      prevented 31% of deaths and readmissions. This study is a confirmatory efficacy trial in
      Kenya and Uganda to determine the efficacy and safety of malaria chemoprevention
      post-discharge. We hypothesize that an additional three months of malaria chemoprevention
      with monthly 3-day treatment courses with DHA-piperaquine (each providing about 4 weeks of
      post-treatment prophylaxis) provided during the post-discharge period to children recently
      admitted with severe anemia is superior to reduce all-cause readmission and mortality rates
      by 6 months compared with 2 weeks of post-treatment prophylaxis provided by the single course
      of oral AL when given as part of the standard in-hospital care around the time of discharge.

All children will then receive a 3-day course of AL (whether they initially had malaria or not), which will be started in-hospital as soon as they are able to take oral medication, and will be completed at home after discharge.
