  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appendectomy is the most common emergent operative procedure performed worldwide. In this
      study investigators will investigate if there is a relationship between breast feeding and
      appendicitis in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis accounts for the commonest indication for emergency visits during daily
      surgical practice. Breast feeding is very important both mother and the child. For the
      infant, breast feeding has an important role on the maturity of immune system. In the
      literature search, there are a little studies about the relationship between the breast
      feeding and appendicitis. In the literature, some studies suggests that the breast feeding
      may possibly give protection against the development of appendicitis. But the number of the
      patients and the control groups are limited. Because of that the investigators have planned
      to make this study with a lot of number of patients.

    <measure>The breastfeeding status questionnaire in the appendicitis patients and participants without appendicitis</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>500 patients who have pathologically proven appendicitis and 1000 controls without appendicitis will be asked the question which is &quot;How long did you had breast feeding?&quot;. The patients and the participants will be in the same age groups. Also the same question will be asked to at least one of the family member (mother, father, older brother or older sister). The breastfeeding status will be in three group ( 0-2 months, 2-6 months and &gt;6 months)</description>
