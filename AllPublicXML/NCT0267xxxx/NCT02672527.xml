  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the transparency committee of the Haute Autorité de Santé pointed out due to lack of data
      regarding comparative trial of Yondelis versus best supportive care, activity of Yondelis in
      soft tissue sarcoma remain to be assessed.

      For an antineoplastic drug toxicity is moderate. As previous studies shown, overall survival
      data for patients with advanced or metastatic STS are of poor prognosis despite improvement
      of results this last years. For example, median overall survival increased from 12,3 months
      (1987-1991) to 11,4 months (1992-1996) and then 18 months (2002-2006).

      Considering the latest results with and without Trabectedin, the investigators may consider
      that comparing Trabectedin with best supportive care is ethically acceptable as long as
      patients consent to enter the trial.

    <description>At Day 1 (D1), premedication with dexamethasone (20 mg) and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist anti-emetic agent will be intravenously administered 30 minutes prior to trabectedin administration. Trabectedin will be administered through a central venous catheter at a starting dose of 1.5 mg/m² over 24 hours, diluted in at least 500 mL of normal saline solution or of glucose 5% injectable solution.
Each treatment cycle will last 21 days. Treatment duration: the treatment might be pursued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or patient refusal, or toxicities.
In case of disease progression, the further treatments will be based on investigator's judgement.</description>

    <description>Treatment:
Patients will receive the best supportive care (BSC) in order to alleviate their symptoms and improve their Quality of Life (QoL).
Antineoplastic agents (including surgery, radiotherapy, thermotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal treatment or antibodies-based treatments) are prohibited.
Treatment duration: the treatment might be pursued until disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or patient refusal.
In case of disease progression, a treatment with trabectedin will be proposed (cross-over). In case of patient refusal, the further treatments will be based on investigator's judgement.</description>
