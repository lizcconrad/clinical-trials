  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of ten leading cancer types worldwide and also in Asia, but
      the five-year relative survival rate is relatively quite low1-3. For hepatocellular carcinoma
      treatment, current options are surgical resection, embolization chemotherapy, radiation
      therapy, a variety of ablation therapy, biological and gene therapy, etc. Among them, the use
      of radiation therapy is getting more and more attention, and it is changing from the past
      palliative treatment to current curable treatment. From an oncologic point of view, a narrow
      margin &lt;1 cm and microvascular invasion is not safe and is often associated with higher rates
      of recurrence and shorter patient survival.On the other hand, it is also believed that most
      intrahepatic recurrences arise from multicentric carcinogenesis and are distant from the
      resection margin. To address this issue, the investigators are going to conduct a series of
      retrospective and prospective studies to investigate the effect of adjuvant Radiotherapy for
      centrally located hepatocellular carcinoma after narrow margin (&lt;1 cm) hepatectomy on tumor
      recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients were pathologically diagnosed as BCLC-A stage hepatocellular carcinomas,
             liver function were Child-Pugh class A or liver function changed from class B to class
             A after short-term liver treatment, PS scored 0-1, and accepted hepatocellular
             carcinomas resection (R0 resection).

          2. No recurrence was found within 3-4 weeks after surgery.

          3. pathologically confirmed as narrow margin (the closest distance from margin to tumor
             capsule (&lt;1 cm) and microvascular invasion was found in tumor capsule and adjacent
             tissues junction (material selection and pathological diagnosis were based on
             &quot;Standardization pathology Guide of primary liver cancer 2015 edition&quot; ).

          4. Postoperative radiotherapy was the only combination therapy within one month after
             surgery.

          5. Radiation range was margin radiation along and/or joint portal vessels radiotherapy.

          6. No lymph node and distant metastasis before surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients were pathologically diagnosed as BCLC-B, C, D stage hepatocellular
             carcinomas, liver function were Child-Pugh class C, PS scored â‰¥2. Or primary liver
             cancer patients were pathologically diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma or mixed type
             liver cancer. Or patients did not accept hepatectomy.

          2. Patients received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, chemotherapy, targeted
             medicine or other anti-cancer therapy before surgery.

          3. Recurrence was found within 3-4 weeks after surgery.

          4. Postoperative adjuvant therapy included treatment other than radiotherapy within one
             month after surgery.

          5. Radiation range involved lymph node other than portal vein area.

          6. Lymph node and distant metastasis were diagnosed before surgery.
