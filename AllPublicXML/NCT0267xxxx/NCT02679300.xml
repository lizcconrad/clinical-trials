  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immersion in a virtual reality environment has been shown to reduce pain during a variety of
      painful medical procedures, such as wound care for burn patients and dental care. Often,
      serious games are used to distract patients from this painful procedures. Recently, serious
      games have also been developed for patients with low back pain. Because patients with low
      back pain frequently experience pain during exercises, the investigators hypothesize that
      exercising with serious games can reduce the pain intensity and the time spent thinking of
      pain during exercises. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a randomized
      controlled trial where two groups will be compared: the experimental group will perform one
      session of exercises with serious games, while the control group will perform one session of
      the same exercises without the serious games.

    <description>During a single intervention session, participants will perform 2 sets of 2 minutes of pelvic tilt exercises using serious games. These serious games have to be controlled by pelvic tilts. Patients will perform the exercises in a standing position in front a TV-screen, on which the games will be displayed. Wireless motion sensors will be mounted to the patient's spine and pelvis to track the movements of the pelvis.</description>

    <description>During a single session intervention, participants will perform 2 sets of 2 minutes of pelvic tilt exercises without a serious game. Patients will perform the exercises in a standing position. The number of repetitions and the tempo of the pelvic tilts will be indicated using a metronome.</description>
