      This study is intended to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of Allogeneic Human
      Mesenchymal Stem Cell Infusion versus placebo in patients with Treatment Resistant
      Depression.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study, with eight subjects in the pilot phase and eighty (80) subjects
      fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion criteria's will be randomly assigned to receive allogeneic
      Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell (hMSCs) or placebo in a 1:1 blinded fashion.

      The 8 subjects in the pilot phase will receive a single infusion of 100 million hMSCs.

      40 patients will receive a single administration of allogeneic hMSCs and another 40 patients
      will receive a single administration of Placebo in a 1:1 blinded fashion.

      Following infusion, patients will be followed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 week's post-infusion
      to complete all safety and efficacy assessments. During these 12 weeks starting after the
      week 2 visit subjects will have a phone call in-between their visits. Patients will
      additionally be followed for up to 12 months post-infusion.

          6. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21-item score greater than 18

          7. Adequacy of previous failed antidepressant trials will be defined using standard

             medication (including NSAIDSs) within 2 weeks of treatment randomization or 6 weeks

             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma in situ or cervical carcinoma.
