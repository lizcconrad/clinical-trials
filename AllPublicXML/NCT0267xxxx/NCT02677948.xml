  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study combines two drugs in the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Investigators are proposing combining
      ibrutinib, an orally-administered, small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (FDA
      approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL), with pacritinib, a novel JAK2-FLT3
      inhibitor that has shown activity in relapsed lymphoma, including CLL/SLL. Investigators will
      first demonstrate the safety and tolerability of Pacritinib when combined with Ibrutinib in a
      phase I study, which will help establish the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose)of Pacritinib when
      combined with Ibrutinib. Once the optimal dose of Pacritinib is established in the phase I
      setting, a phase II evaluation will seek to establish the efficacy of the combination of
      Pacritinib with Ibrutinib. Patients will receive continuous treatment until progressive
      disease and will be followed while on study treatment for a total of 2 years.

    <description>DLTs (Dose Limiting Toxicities) occurring during the 1st cycle (first 28 days) of treatment with the combination of pacritinib and ibrutinib will be used for dose-escalation decisions. MTD is defined as the largest dose at which no more than 25% of patients experience a DLT.</description>
