  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for acute
      leukemia, but relapse remains an important problem. Therapy options for relapse include
      stopping immune suppression, re-induction of chemotherapy, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI),
      and another transplantation used alone or in combination. However, the efficacy of these
      interventions is limited. One approach to the relapse problem is to intervene before
      hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal residual disease (MRD). In this
      study, the efficacy of MRD-directed DLI on transplantation outcomes will be evaluated in
      patients with acute leukemia receiving allo-HSCT.

      hematologic or pathologic relapse occurs based on minimal residual disease (MRD) using immune
      or molecular techniques.DLI is an effective post-transplantation therapy for prophylaxis of
      leukemia relapse, but is associated with a substantial risk of GVHD. Whether MRD-directed DLI
      could improve outcomes remains unclear. In this study, the efficacy of MRD-directed DLI on
      transplantation outcomes will be evaluated in patients with acute leukemia receiving
      allo-HSCT.

    <description>For patients with MRD+ and without grade II/&gt;II aGVHD by day +60 post-transplantation, DLI was given once by day +60 and was then administered based on MRD and GVHD status. If patients were MRD negative, DLI was not given again; if patients were MRD positive and without GVHD, DLI was given monthly until GVHD occurred or MRD became negative or for a total of four times. For patients with NR or PR pre-transplantation and with MRD negative by day +60 post-transplantation, DLI was given once by day +90 regardless of MRD, and was then administered when MRD became positive. For patients with CR pre-transplantation and with MRD negative post-transplantation, DLI was not given unless MRD became positive.</description>
