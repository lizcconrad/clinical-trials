      Little is known about the effects of computerized cognitive training programs on mild
      dementia patients' health. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a
      community-based computerized cognitive training program.However, most of these studies were
      not randomized controlled trial and the samples of these studies were mostly healthy older
      persons, patients with brain injuries, or with moderate and severe dementia. A lack of
      studies for effects of these programs on patients with mild dementia using randomized
      controlled trials was found. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a
      community-based computerized cognitive training program.

    <description>The computer training games included: 1) a phonological loop to train the participants to choose correct song from a list of different songs which can be categorized as people, nature, and musical instrument. The difficulty level progressed from choosing one from two to choosing one from three songs; 2) a visual-spatial sketchpad to train the participants to remember and find the same graphs including vegetable, fruits, daily necessity, and numbers. The difficulty level progressed from finding one pair to three pairs of similar graphs; 3) a central executive system to train the participants to execute dual tasks including conducting dual memory, calculating while listening to music, making phone calls, and matching medication at correct time.</description>
