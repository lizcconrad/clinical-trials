  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue augmentation with injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) is a well-established modality
      for the correction of facial volume loss, fat atrophy, fine lines, and wrinkles. HA is a
      glycosaminoglycan that is composed of repeating D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine
      disaccharide units. Because HA is a natural and inert constituent of the dermis, it
      represents an ideal substance for soft tissue augmentation. Current FDA-approved HA fillers
      are typically utilized to either directly target specific cutaneous rhytids or to restore
      overall contours by placement into fat pads or along bony structures that have remodeled with
      age. Restylane® Silk is a transparent injectable HA gel that received FDA approval in June
      2014 for use in the lips and peri-oral region. Its unique synthesis results in smaller and
      finer particles that demonstrate significant hygroscopic properties and give rise to the
      potential for unique applications. One such application concerns the concept of &quot;skin
      boosting&quot; whereby microaliquots of HA are placed into the skin to induce biophysical
      improvement in dermal characteristics (1). Using this technique, a recent split-body study by
      Streker et al. demonstrated significant aesthetic improvements in face, hands and décolletage
      (2). However, there have been no well-controlled studies with validated aesthetic outcomes
      utilizing Restylane® Silk in this fashion to date. Because of the unique combination of
      ultra-fine product and high water-attracting capability, the investigators hypothesize that
      microinjections of Restylane® Silk can be used in a grid-like injection pattern for
      rejuvenation of the aging cheek.

      This is a single center, prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, split-face
      trial using micro-injections of Restylane® Silk for correction of mid to low cheek fine lines
      and wrinkles. Twenty (20) subjects will be enrolled. Each subject will receive Restylane®
      Silk to a defined area of mid to low cheek in a randomized blinded fashion with the
      contralateral cheek treated by sham injection. The injections will be delivered intradermally
      1mm in depth via multiple 0.02 cc microinjections distributed in a grid array pattern with
      0.5 cm to 1 cm between each injection point over total treatment area. The sham injections
      will be administered in identical fashion and will consist of sterile normal saline.
      Following completion of injection treatment, manual massage will be applied to the full area
      to promote even distribution of the product. The maximum amount of Restylane Silk to be used
      per treatments session/per cheek for balancing treatment is1cc (not to exceed a total of 3cc)
      per treated patient. Three dimensional digital photography utilizing the Vectra 3D System
      (Canfield) will be utilized to document pre-treatment status, sites of injection, and
      post-treatment effect. Subjects will be followed up at 1 week, 2 week, 4 week, day 90, and
      day 180 time points. At the Day 180 time point, every subject will be given the option to
      receive touch up and balancing treatments to both cheeks.
