    <textblock>
      To assess the outcomes of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      assigned to fractional flow reserve (FFR) and angiography-guided selective percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators retrospectively collect STEMI patients received selective PCI from Jan 2012
      to Dec 2015. Clinical follow-up is performed from the date of FFR assessment to Dec 2016 or
      death, which is up to 5 years. The primary endpoint is major adverse cardiac events,
      composite of cardiac death, reinfarction and unplanned hospitalization due to cardiovascular
      reasons. The primary endpoints are cardiac death, reinfarction and unplanned hospitalization
      due to cardiovascular reasons. All deaths are considered cardiovascular unless an unequivocal
      noncardiac cause could be established. Reinfarction is defined as myocardial infarction after
      the PCI procedure. Unplanned hospitalization will be present only if the patient is
      hospitalized unexpectedly because of persisting or increasing complaints of angina,
      ventricular arrhythmias and heart failure. All patients were received FFR-guided PCI or
      angiography-guided PCI before enrollment, and the investigators do not assign specific
      interventions to the subjects during the study. So this study might be considered to be
      observational.
