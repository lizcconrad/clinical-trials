    <textblock>
      This study is a validation study to document the acceptability of the revised
      Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Remediation (PACR) program to patients with
      HIV-associated Neurocognitive Dysfunction (HAND). The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of the revised PACR program on the cognitive abilities (e.g., attention,
      executive function), functional status and quality of life of individuals diagnosed with
      HAND. The secondary objective of the study is to collect relevant data to support a
      pre-investigational device exemption (IDE) submission to the FDA required before the pivotal
      randomized, controlled trial planned for Phase II.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is the useful field of view; change on this measure suggests underlying neural change, and has been shown to predict overall cognitive change. The exercise-based measure serves as a positive control for task learning. The investigators anticipate improvements in this assessment because participants have directly practiced these tasks, as well as tasks within related cognitive domains. The data are relevant because individuals failing to make progress on this assessment may represent a subpopulation not treatable with this program, and individuals making strong progress may represent a subpopulation particularly amenable to treatment with this program. This assessment will be performed on the first day of program use, approximately halfway through program use, and the last day of program use. All participants will access this assessment via Internet portal and study team member may access results via clinician portal.</description>
