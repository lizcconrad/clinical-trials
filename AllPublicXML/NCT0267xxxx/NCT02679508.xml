      The purpose of this study is exploratorily evaluate the effect on gastric mucosal tissue and
      the safety of long-term administration (260 weeks: 5 years) of vonoprazan 10 mg or 20 mg in
      patients receiving maintenance treatment after healed erosive esophagitis (EE), and the
      curative effect of vonoprazan 20 mg versus lansoprazole in patients with EE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study to exploratorily evaluate
      the effect on gastric mucosal tissue and the safety of long-term administration of vonoprazan
      in maintenance treatment after healed EE, and the curative effect of vonoprazan versus
      lansoprazole in participants with EE.

      Participants endoscopically diagnosed with EE of Los Angeles (LA) Classification Grades A to
      D at the start of treatment (Week 0 of the healing phase) will be randomly assigned to
      receive either vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg to be taken once daily for up to 8
      weeks. Subjects with healed EE as confirmed endoscopically at Week 4 or 8 in the healing
      phase will enter the maintenance phase.

      In the maintenance phase, the vonoprazan group and the lansoprazole group will be
      administered a starting dose of 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, once daily up to 260 weeks.

      If the principal investigator or investigator judged the effect of vonoprazan 10 mg or
      lansoprazole 15 mg to be insufficient as the maintenance treatment of EE, vonoprazan and
      lansoprazole may be increased to 20 mg and 30 mg, respectively.

      The research period will consist of two subperiods: healing phase in which participants with
      EE will receive treatment (for 4 or 8 weeks) and maintenance phase in which participants will
      receive maintenance treatment (for 260 weeks), and thus, a total of up to 268 weeks. The
      number of visits will be a maximum of 18 visits. Planned number of research subjects, as the
      number of research subjects for entry to the maintenance phase, will be 130 participants in
      the vonoprazan group and 65 participants in the lansoprazole group.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
