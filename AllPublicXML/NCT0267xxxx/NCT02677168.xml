    <measure>&quot;Sustained Response&quot; of reduction of AHI (apnea hypopnea index) at PSG (polysomnography) II</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks--PSG II will be done after three weeks of home use of cNEP following PSG I</time_frame>
    <description>A response (either initial or sustained) is defined as an AHI that is &lt; 50% of the qualifying PSG (polysomnography) that is also &lt; 15/hr</description>

    <measure>occurrence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events that occur during the three weeks of cNEP home use.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>&quot;Initial Response&quot; of AHI at PSG I</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months after the qualifying PSG</time_frame>
    <description>An AHI (apnea hypopnea index) that is &lt;50% of that of the qualifying PSG, and &lt;15/hr at PSG I, with cNEP in place.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of AHI at PSG I and PSG II</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The AHI determined at PSG II will be compared with that of PSG I</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>time of SpO2 (oxygen saturation) &lt; 90%</measure>
    <time_frame>during each of the overnight PSGs</time_frame>
    <description>the number of minutes during the overnight PSG when SpO2 is &lt; 90% with cNEP in place</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>hours of home use of cNEP per night</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks after initiation of home cNEP</time_frame>
    <description>the number of hours of each night at home that the subject uses cNEP</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Three CGI (clinical global impression) subjective measures</measure>
    <time_frame>three weeks after the initiation of home cNEP</time_frame>
    <description>Seven-item Likert CGI scales of three subjective measures: 1) subject's view of cNEP vs CPAP, 2) overall satisfaction with cNEP, 3) bed partner's feelings about cNEP.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  PSG performed within the previous twelve months that documents the presence of
             obstructive sleep apnea (the &quot;qualifying PSG&quot;)

          -  on that PSG, AHI must be 10 - 50/hr and &gt;80% of the apneas and hypopneas must be
             obstructive

          -  no significant changes in health, medications, or lifestyle since the qualifying PSG

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous major surgery, injury or radiation to the neck

          -  beard or excessive hair on the area of the neck where the collar will be applied

          -  carotid artery disease

          -  serious medical conditions

          -  pregnancy

          -  use of home oxygen

          -  silicone allergy

          -  sleep disturbance other than obstructive sleep apnea
