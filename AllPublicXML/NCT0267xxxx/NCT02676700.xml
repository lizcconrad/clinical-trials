    <textblock>
      This study examines the effect of adding so called Kaatsu training to pelvic floor muscle
      training. Half the participants will perform Kaatsu training on their thigh muscles followed
      by pelvic floor muscle training. The other half will receive pelvic floor muscle training
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SU) is a common problem among adult women . Pelvic floor muscle
      training (PFMT) is recommended as first line treatment but PFMT is not always efficient and
      some women cannot comply with the intensive PFMT needed to obtain effect because of weakened
      or damaged muscles caused by vaginal delivery and age related changes.

      Hypothetically alternative methods could be used to enhance the effect of a strength-training
      program. A low intensity training program with a simultaneous partial occlusion of the blood
      supply for the training muscle, so called &quot;Kaatsu&quot; training has been found to increase muscle
      strength faster than ordinary strength training but with much less effort. It seems difficult
      to make occlusion of the pelvic floor muscles during PFMT but a study found that low
      intensity training of the quadriceps femoris with partial occlusion of the blood supply did
      not only increase muscle strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle but also of the biceps
      humeri muscle if that muscle was trained with low-load training and no occlusion in the same
      training session. The specific reason for this this &quot;cross-transfer effect&quot; could not be
      fully explained but it was believed to be caused by a systemic effect caused by growth
      hormones. The aim of this study is therefore to examine if Kaatsu training offered in
      relation to a low-load PFMT program can increase the effect of PFMT in women with SUI

    <description>Participants are instructed in the PFMT program by primary investigator and instructed in Kaatsu training by a research nurse. The Kaatsu training is performed 4 times a week before PFMT. The program includes 2 x 15 knee extensions with partly occlusion of the blood supply to the thigh. Training level is &gt;12 RM. Training is performed sitting on a chair and rubber bands are used to increase resistance. Training adherence and bother with the training is reported in a training diary. At week 6 the research nurse adjusts the training program.
The PFMT program includes three sets of 10 contractions with an intensity of &gt;12 RM and is to be performed 4 times a week.
Training adherence and any bother with the training is reported in a training diary.</description>
