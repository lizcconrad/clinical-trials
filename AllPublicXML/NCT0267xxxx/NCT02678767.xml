  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will investigate the ability of a novel MRI contrast agent to identify and
      quantitate ongoing monocyte/macrophage (M/MΦ)-mediated inflammation in the brains of
      HIV-infected individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to be prevalent despite effective
      combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and have a significant impact on morbidity and
      quality of life. Monocytes/macrophages (M/MΦ) are believed to play a critical role in the
      pathogenesis of HAND. Neuroimaging HIV research has not focused on assessing M/MΦ-mediated
      inflammation in the brain. Currently, no neuroimaging modality exists that can define the
      extent of active inflammation due to M/MΦ in HAND either as a clinical diagnostic tool or to
      assist in defining objective improvement in clinical trials addressing HAND. Ferumoxytol is
      an ultra-small iron oxide MRI contrast agent avidly taken up by circulating M/MΦ. The
      investigators hypothesize that ferumoxytol-based imaging can identify ongoing inflammation
      due to perivascular M/MΦ which is believed to represent a key pathologic correlate of HAND.
