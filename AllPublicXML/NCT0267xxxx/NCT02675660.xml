  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study represents an initial clinical evaluation of an oral formulation of
      L-homoarginine. L-homoarginine and L-arginine are amino acids found in food proteins and are
      both substrates for nitric oxide synthase (NOS). L-arginine is available as over the counter
      nutraceutical. This study will provide information on the dosing of L-homoarginine in order
      to reach high physiological plasma concentrations in humans.

      1. Study Design In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design
           participants receive either L-homoarginine 125 mg or placebo once daily in the morning
           for four weeks each. The study periods are separated by a washout phase of four weeks,
           and the sequence of the medications is randomly chosen in each participant. The study is
           preceded by a run-in phase, where all participant receive a single dose of 125 mg
           L-homoarginine. Blood samples (2.7 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid vacutainer) for
           plasma L-homoarginine determinations are drawn at time points 0, 15 min, 30 min, 1, 2,
           4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours after single and multiple doses of L-homoarginine and
           placebo, respectively. At baseline and four weeks after each supplementation period
           (hArg and placebo), routine laboratory, arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, pulse
           wave velocity, augmentation index, flow-mediated vasodilatation, transcranial magnetic
           stimulation, and test battery of attentional performance are evaluated as secondary
           endpoints.

        2. Study Duration One year

        3. Sample Size Calculation and Statistical Evaluation Due to the exploratory nature of this
           pilot study, exploratory statistical methods will be used for statistical evaluation of
           the study results, and no formal sample size calculation was performed. In a previous
           study 20 participants were included to assess the kinetic, dynamic, and safety profile
           of L-citrulline and L-arginine [Schwedhelm et al. 2007]. Statistical comparisons will be
           performed using two-sided tests, i.e. Student's t-test and ANOVA. A p &lt; 0.05 will be
           considered significant.
