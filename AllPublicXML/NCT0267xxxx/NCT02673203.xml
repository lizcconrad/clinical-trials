  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether the daily glucose profiles as assessed by continuous glucose
      monitoring for 1 week of normal weight, obese, and diabetic individuals relate to hunger
      levels and food intake.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of blood glucose levels on eating behavior in a population of patients
      with diabetes in a free-living environment; the investigators plan to study 15 lean healthy
      control subjects (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2), 15 obese non-diabetic subjects (BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2), 15 T2DM
      subjects who will be age and BMI-matched to obese, non-diabetic subjects, and 15 T1DM
      subjects who will be age and BMI matched to control, non-diabetic subjects.

      The participants who qualify will be invited to use the CGMS (DEXCOM G4 Platinum) for up to 7
      days. On the visit for placement of the CGMS: 1) the participants will be explained by one of
      the study physicians how to use a glucometer (FreeStyle or Accu-Check), 2) they will have the
      CGMS inserted under the skin, and 3) they will be instructed how to fill up the food log
      (informational brochures are available at the end of the protocol. On the second visit (up to
      7 days after the initial visit) the CGMS will be removed from the skin and the glucose meter
      and food log will be returned to the investigators.

    <description>The CGMS consists of 3 parts: sensor, transmitter and monitor. The small sensor measures the glucose levels from the interstitial tissue. The transmitter is attached on top of the sensor and connects wirelessly to the monitor. The sensor is sterile and comes in an unopened package. It has a plastic wire-like tip that is placed under the skin and continuously measures the glucose levels. One of the study physicians will insert the CGMS wire-like tip under the volunteer's skin with the use of the DEXCOM sensor insertion kit. The transmitter is snapped to the sensor pod and the sensor/transmitter unit will be attached to the skin with an adhesive patch. The monitor is the size of a small hand-held device with a digital screen that displays a graph showing the glucose levels from the previous 4-24 hours.</description>
