      It is well-known that breastfeeding protects infants from illness, especially in the poorest
      regions of the world. The full nature of this protective effect, however, is less well
      understood. A major barrier to understanding is the fact that almost nothing is known about
      the factors that influence the considerable variation in milk composition around the globe,
      or about the effects of this variation on infant health. This INSPIRE project represents the
      first comprehensive investigation of the global differences in human milk composition along
      with the various microbial, evolutionary, environmental, and sociocultural factors that might
      influence both milk composition and infant health. An international, interdisciplinary
      collaboration of physiologists, nutritional scientists, anthropologists, microbiologists, and
      mathematicians will collect biological data from breastfeeding women and their infants, in
      concert with extensive anthropologic and ecological data, in both developed (US, Spain,
      Sweden) and developing countries (Central African Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Peru, and Kenya).
      To test the possibility of a correlation between milk oligosaccharide composition, milk
      microbiota, and the gastrointestinal microbiome of infants, milk samples and infant fecal
      samples will be analyzed using state-of-the-art biochemical and genomic techniques. This
      study will allow important cross-cultural comparisons of milk composition and infant feeding
      practices; it also will utilize sophisticated computational methods to integrate the
      extensive, diverse body of combined biological and anthropological data to elucidate the
      relationships among sociocultural factors, evolutionary history, environmental exposures,
      microbial constituents and milk composition. The researchers predict that what is considered
      &quot;normal&quot; milk composition in one population may not support optimal health in another. This
      information is crucial to the humanitarian quest to understand how infant nutrition and
      overall health can be improved around the world. In addition, this project will provide
      extensive research training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral
      scientists.
