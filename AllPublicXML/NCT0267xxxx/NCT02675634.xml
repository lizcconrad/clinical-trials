    <description>Subjects will evaluate the fit to body for each product by answering the question &quot;how was the baseplates ability to fit the body contours in the area around the stoma?&quot; The question is answered using an ordinal 5 point scale ranging from very poor to very good. The result shown below shows the fraction of subject who answered 'Good' or' Very Good' to the question.</description>
