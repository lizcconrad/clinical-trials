      Many women have the need to run to the restroom frequently during the night and day, a
      condition called &quot;overactive bladder&quot;. Embarrassing urinary leakage is also commonly
      associated with these symptoms. The investigators believe the primary cause in most cases is
      the bladder muscle contracting too frequently but are still not sure exactly why this happens
      and if it is triggered by factors in the environment. When bladder testing using pressure
      catheters (&quot;urodynamics&quot;) is done these bladder contractions are often not picked up, even in
      women with overactive bladder. This may be partly due to the unnatural environment in which
      the testing is done without the presence of the usual visual or audible triggers, such as
      running water or seeing a toilet. The investigators propose adding an audiovisual stimulant
      to the usual bladder testing to see if this makes it more likely for bladder contractions to
      happen. One group of patients would have the usual bladder testing as part of their normal
      care. The other group would receive the normal care in addition to hearing a water fountain
      in the room and watching a video of things that may trigger overactive bladder symptoms;
      seeing public restroom signs in a mall, a toilet bowl being lowered and a kitchen sink with
      water running over dishes. The suspicion is that the proportion of patients in whom bladder
      contractions are seen will be higher for those with audiovisual triggers compared to those
      with the usual care. Women with overactive bladder or leakage with urge who are sent for
      urodynamics by their doctor will be asked if they wish to participate in the study.

      Detrusor overactivity (DO), defined as a rise in detrusor pressure during bladder filling on
      urodynamic evaluation (UDE), is presumed to be involved in the pathophysiology of overactive
      bladder syndrome (OAB) and urge urinary incontinence (UUI). However, the mechanism of DO is
      not fully understood and the detection rate of DO on UDE is low. Currently there is limited
      data in the literature investigating audiovisual stimulation of DO. To improve the
      understanding of the neural regulation of micturition, the investigators propose adding an
      audiovisual stimulant to standard UDE. Methods: 218 women with OAB and/or UUI undergoing UDE
      will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized to standard care versus standard care with the
      addition of an audiovisual stimulant, involving the patient listening to running water and
      watching a video of several well-known triggers. The primary outcome will be proportion of
      patients in whom detrusor contractions are seen. Secondary outcomes will include number,
      amplitude and length of contractions and presence of incontinence associated with a
      contraction. The objective of this study is to estimate the effect of adding audiovisual cues
      during UDE on the proportion of patients in whom DO is detected compared to standard clinical
      care. The hypothesis is that the proportion of patients in whom detrusor contractions are
      seen will be higher in female patients with OAB symptoms and/or UUI using an audiovisual
      stimulant. Data obtained will be analyzed by chi square, t-tests, and multivariable logistic
      regression analysis as appropriate.
