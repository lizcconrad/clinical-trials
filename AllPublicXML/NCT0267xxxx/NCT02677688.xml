      EBV has been implicated in pathogeny of SLE with increase in EBV sero-prevalence, defective
      control in EBV infection and altered both B and T immune responses to this virus The main
      objective of this pilot proof-of-concept (POC) study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of
      autologous EBV specific CTL adoptive transfer in adult patients with serologically active SLE

      Systemic lupus is a disabling disease of the young woman, whose treatment is based on the
      long-term corticosteroid, anti-malarials and immunosuppressants synthesis. This support is
      not without potential side effects. EBV is a herpes causes infectious mononucleosis virus,
      usually encounter in childhood or adolescence, and that our natural immunity cell (CD8 T
      cells) controls all our lives, not eliminate.

      Increasingly scientific studies show that there are patients with systemic lupus (and
      multiple sclerosis), a failure of self-control of the EBV virus, by T lymphocytes (CD8). This
      uncontrolled virus then stimulate the B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies, toxic in
      lupus. The laboratory isolate T cells specific for EBV (EBV-CTL) of a patient, and stimulate
      in culture to strengthen them. They can be then re-injected by a single intravenous infusion
      (autotransfusion), and were used to control the virus in certain diseases where EBV has a
      demonstrated role post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome
      EBV-induced.

      Our therapeutic approach is completely innovative, as based on the principle of cell therapy,
      thus not using new drugs, and based on the restoration of the patient's immune system,
      specific EBV.
