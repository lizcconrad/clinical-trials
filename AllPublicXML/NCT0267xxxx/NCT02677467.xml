    <textblock>
      Investigators examine blood-pressure variance, several cardiovascular risk factors of patient
      with epistaxis. As a result of collected data, investigators look into correlation between
      epistaxis and hypertensive cardiovascular disorder.

      This study is prospective observational single blinded study.

      A participant is visit in the ER who patient with epistaxis.

      Investigators will enroll 50 patients with epistaxis. Exclusion criteria is that patient
      needs immediately treatment for hypertensive urgency or patient with nasal trauma.

      Investigators examine blood-pressure (BP) at five times in Emergency Department (ED) and
      out-patient department (opd) of Otorhinolaryngology (OL) . Investigators explain this study
      and ask to write consent for participant. After proper management of epistaxis, investigators
      get blood sampling of the participant and, the participant has a reservation to &quot;opd of
      cardiovascular division of Internal Medicine&quot; (CV opd) in the hospital.

      When the participant visit CV opd, the participant undergo 24-hours-BP-monitoring and Pulse
      wave velocity (PWV).

      After that, the participant will be follow-up for 3 months.

      Investigators collect 50 data from 50 participants as a registry and analyze the data.
