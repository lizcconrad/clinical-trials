  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strength training can increase muscle mass and strength while improving bone density and
      reducing risk for osteoporosis and related fractures. Strength training can also lead to
      reduced risk for diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, depression, and obesity; and improves
      self-confidence, sleep and vitality. Research demonstrates that strength training is
      extremely effective in helping aging adults with chronic conditions prevent further onset of
      disease and, in many instances, actually reverse the disease process. In Stay Strong, Stay
      Healthy Program elderly subjects perform resistance exercise training (RET) twice every week.
      Past literature suggests that resistance training improved muscle activity, muscle strength,
      muscle mass, and bone mineral density and total body composition, and adiponectin, insulin
      sensitivity, fasting blood-glucose (BG), HbA1c1 (long-term marker of BG), blood pressure
      (BP), blood triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) in healthy and diabetic
      subjects. The purpose of this study is to measure the changes in the above discussed
      variables after 8-weeks of resistance exercises.

      Participants will perform resistance exercise for 8 weeks and measurements (anthropometric,
      electromyography, pulse wave velocity, strength test, dual x-ray absorptiometry, blood
      enzymes/hormones, and sleep, diet, memory surveys) will be performed pre- and post-exercise
      program.
