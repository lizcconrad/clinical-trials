  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of human cells. The growth of normal human cells is
      controlled by multiple mechanisms. Panobinostat belongs to a class of chemotherapy drugs
      called &quot;histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.&quot; HDAC inhibitors like panobinostat block
      enzymes known as histone deacetylases, which stops cancer cells from dividing and causes them
      to die. Fludarabine and cytarabine are chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used to treat
      pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of panobinostat and to find the highest dose
      of panobinostat that can be given safely when it is combined with fludarabine and cytarabine.

      This pilot study will be done in two parts: The goal of Part 1 of the study is to find the
      highest tolerable dose of panobinostat that can be given to patients with AML or MDS, when it
      is combined with fludarabine and cytarabine. Once that dose is determined, participants will
      be enrolled on Part 2: Dose Expansion, to look at the effect of the
      panobinostat/fludarabine/cytarabine combination in patients with leukemia/MDS.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  Determine a tolerable dose of panobinostat when given in combination with fludarabine
           and cytarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetics of panobinostat after the first dose and at
           steady-state.

        -  Estimate the overall response rate to the combination of panobinostat, fludarabine, and
           cytarabine.

      STUDY PART 1: Dose Escalation Cohort

      During the dose escalation phase (Part 1), participants will receive one course of
      panobinostat plus fludarabine and cytarabine. The starting dose of panobinostat will be 10
      mg/m^2/dose, with 2 additional dose levels of 15 and 20, depending on tolerability. Each
      course is 12 days

      STUDY PART 2: Dose Expansion Cohort

      The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be chosen based on the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and the totality of data obtained from study Part 1. Additional patients will be enrolled, if
      needed, so that at least 6 patients are treated with the recommended RP2D to confirm the MTD
      of panobinostat to be given in study Part 2.

      After final MTD determination, 12 additional participants will be treated at this dose level
      for further evaluation of tolerability and response, including more complete toxicity data
      and estimation of the response rate to the combination of panobinostat, fludarabine, and
      cytarabine.

    <time_frame>Up to 56 days following first dose of panobinostat</time_frame>
    <description>Any participant who experiences non-hematologic dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first 28 days after taking the initial dose of panobinostat and before receiving non-protocol therapy is considered evaluable for toxicity. Non-hematologic DLT includes any Grade 5 event and any Grade 3 or 4 event that is at least possibly related to panobinostat, unless the event is clearly due to extraneous causes or disease progression. Hematologic DLT includes failure to recover counts by Day 56 in the absence of persistent leukemia.
Participants without DLTs who receive at least 5 of the 6 prescribed cycle I doses of panobinostat and can be followed for 28 days (56 days for evaluation of hematologic toxicity) after their initial dose of panobinostat are considered evaluable for toxicity. Participants who are not evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.
The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which six participants have been treated with at most one participant experiencing a DLT.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of AML or MDS and must have disease that has
             relapsed or is refractory to chemotherapy, or that has relapsed after hematopoietic
             stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

               -  Refractory disease is defined as persistent disease after at least two courses of

                  levels of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow as assessed by flow
                  cytometry. If an adequate bone marrow sample cannot be obtained, patients may be
                  enrolled if there is unequivocal evidence of leukemia in the peripheral blood.

          -  Adequate organ function defined as the following:

               -  Direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (IULN)

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN for age

             50% for patients who are &gt; 16 years old.

          -  Patients must have fully recovered from the acute effects of all prior therapy and
             must meet the following criteria:

               -  At least 14 days must have elapsed since the completion of myelosuppressive
                  therapy

               -  At least 24 hours must have elapsed since the completion of low-dose
                  chemotherapy, such as hydroxyurea or low-dose cytarabine (up to 200 mg/m^2/day).

               -  For patients who have received prior HSCT, there can be no evidence of GVHD and
                  greater than 60 days must have elapsed since the HSCT. Patients cannot be

             child-bearing potential must agree to use dual methods of contraception and have a
             negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and male patients who are sexually active
             must use an effective barrier method of contraception if sexually active with a female
             of child-bearing potential. For both male and female patients who are sexually active,
             effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for three
             months following the last dose. Abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception.

          -  Use of investigational agents within 30 days.

          -  Any significant concurrent disease, illness, or psychiatric disorder that would

             interpretation of study research.

          -  Uncontrolled infection within one week of the first dose. Infections controlled on
             concurrent anti-microbial agents are acceptable, and anti-microbial prophylaxis per
             institutional guidelines are acceptable.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection (pre-study testing not required).

          -  Patient with diarrhea &gt; CTCAE grade 2. (CTCAE version 4.0)

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases, history of
             arrhythmia (including ventricular fibrillation or torsade de pointes), bradycardia &lt;50
             bpm, screening ECG with prolonged QTc (&gt; 450 msec), uncontrolled hypertension or any
             history or presence of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

          -  Impairment of GI function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of
             panobinostat.

          -  Patients using medications that have a relative risk of prolonging the QT interval or
             inducing torsade de pointes if treatment cannot be discontinued or switched to a
             different medication prior to starting treatment. Granisetron may be administered, but
             antiemetics associated with QT prolongation (e.g., ondansetron) are not allowed.
