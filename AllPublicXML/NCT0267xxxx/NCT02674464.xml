  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators refined research aim is to determine if a clinic-based collaborative care
      team, including a community health worker (CHW) to deliver community-based contextualized
      care, reduces disparities in blood pressure control rates, lowers cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) risk, and improves outcomes among patients with hypertension and other common comorbid
      conditions when compared to standard of care health system approaches to CVD risk management,
      including audit and feedback and staff and provider training.

      Collaborative care includes care coordination and care management; regular and proactive
      monitoring and treatment to target specific patient needs using validated clinical tools and
      rating scales; and regular systematic caseload reviews by the care team and consultation with
      experts for patients who do not show clinical improvement. A typical collaborative care team
      includes the primary care provider, nurse care manager or coordinator, and other members of
      the clinic staff involved in patient care.

      Intervention protocols are designed to address common comorbidities (diabetes,
      hyperlipidemia, depression and coronary heart disease), lifestyle factors (dietary intake,
      physical activity, and smoking) and medication adherence. The investigators intensive
      intervention treats the &quot;whole&quot; patient, driven by individual patient goals and priorities,
      as opposed to the standard of care, which typically focuses on individual conditions. This
      proposed study responds directly to patient desires to feel more equipped to be involved in
      their care and manage multiple conditions that contribute to CVD. The investigators have
      worked successfully in the past with a broad range of stakeholders, including community
      members, patients, providers, and payors, and will continue to engage them through the
      research and dissemination process.

    <description>The standard of care plus arm will include audit and feedback of blood pressure control rates at the provider level along with web-based training about: 1) barriers to blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors management in at-risk patient populations; 2) strategies to address healthcare disparities in clinical settings; and 3) appropriate blood pressure (BP) measurement techniques for all clinical staff. The Hopkins research team will help clinics develop audit and feedback mechanisms if they are lacking and will provide all blood pressure measurement and web-based training.</description>
