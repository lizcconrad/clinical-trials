  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicenter, single arm, prospective study to evaluate safety and
      tolerability of selective and ultraselective drug eluting beads transcatheter intraarterial
      chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) with up to 3 ml of well calibrated 100 µ microspheres and up to
      150 mg of doxorubicin, for the treatment of non resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      The hypothesis is that 100 µ beads penetrate deeper into the tumor than those eluting beads
      with larger volumes without increasing the risk and complications of DEB-TACE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this observational, prospective study patients will undergo DEB-TACE and subsequent follow
      up procedures according to standard clinical practice. The primary aim of the study is to
      describe treatment safety and tolerability of 100 µ beads in DEB-TACE. As a secondary
      end-point a description of efficacy parameters will be obtained.
