    <textblock>
      Anal fistula is a very common disease with a high impact on life quality. The only commonly
      accepted treatment option is surgery. A wide range of operations and techniques have been
      developed all suffering from a relatively high recurrence rate.

      The investigators propose the combination of the mucosal advancement flap with application of
      platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the fistulectomy site. This study aims to test the hypothesis
      that by applying PRP the healing rate of complicated anal fistulas can be improved in
      comparison to a control group where the operation is performed without addition of PRP.
