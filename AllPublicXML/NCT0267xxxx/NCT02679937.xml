  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial assesses the efficacy of a 6-week, dissonance-based,
      weight-gain prevention program (Fit4Duty) designed to reduce unhealthy weight gain among
      military service members at-risk for obesity. The Fit4Duty program is an adaptation for the
      military of an existing civilian obesity prevention program, Project Health, which reduced
      obesity onset by 50% in healthy civilian young adults. Fit4Duty is compared to a nutrition
      education control condition and is hypothesized to reduce excess weight gain beyond the
      control comparison program during the 2 year period following study participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is prevalent in military personnel and raises concerns related to health, readiness,
      and national defense. Adverse health consequences of obesity place military personnel at risk
      for serious medical problems while in the service and upon discharge/retirement.
      Additionally, failure to &quot;make weight&quot; may negatively impact one's military career and can
      lead to discharge from the service. Early identification of personnel at risk and
      implementation of prevention strategies are critical to addressing the problem of overweight
      in the military and are essential to maintaining a fit fighting force. The goal of this study
      is to test the effectiveness of a dissonance-based, weight-gain prevention program (Fit4Duty)
      to prevent excess weight gain among service members at risk for obesity due to a personal
      and/or family history of overweight. The Fit4Duty program is an adaptation for the military
      of an existing civilian obesity prevention program, Project Health. The program utilizes
      dissonance based, participant-driven group counseling to address the excess consumption of
      unhealthy foods and sedentary behavior. Active duty service members will be randomized to the
      Fit4Duty weight gain prevention program or a Nutrition Education comparison condition.
      Participants will complete height, weight, and body composition measurements, and self-report
      instruments at baseline, immediately following the prevention program (6-weeks), and one and
      two year follow-ups. It is hypothesized that Project Fit4Duty will result in significantly
      greater reduction in risk for increases in BMI percentile and percent fat mass, and risk for
      onset of overweight and obesity during the 2-year follow-up relative to a nutrition education
      control program. If successful, Project Fit4Duty would offer an economical approach for
      widespread obesity prevention in the U.S. Military.

Participants design small, gradual healthy lifestyle change plans with added verbal, written, and behavioral exercises designed to elicit dissonance regarding engaging in unhealthy eating and sedentary practices. Participants are asked to voluntarily discuss the health, interpersonal and societal costs of obesity, an unhealthy diet, and sedentary behavior, as well as the benefits of leanness, a healthy diet, and regular physical activity.</description>

    <description>Two, 50 minute educational videos address basic concepts of healthy nutrition and weight management reviewing topics such as macro and micronutrients, the virtue of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and superfoods, the dangers of dehydration and vitamin deficiency. The role of poor eating habits, lack of exercise and cultural and technological issues in America's obesity epidemic is examined. A basic understanding of energy balance is conveyed. The role of nutritional supplements is addressed.</description>
