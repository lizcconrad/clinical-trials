  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At this time, no study has examined the effect of a lifestyle intervention with a reduced
      Sedentary Behavior (SB) prescription on overall physical activity, weight loss, metabolic
      dysfunction, and inflammation in breast cancer survivors. Thus, in collaboration with
      University of Tennessee Medical Center's (UTMC) Cancer Institute, investigators propose to
      randomize 30 female breast cancer survivors (history of breast cancer stages I [&gt; 1 cm], II,
      or III) with a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 45 kg/m2 who are sedentary (engage in &gt; 8
      hours a day of SB) and inactive (engage in &lt; 100 min/wk MVPA) to one of three, 3-month
      conditions:

        1. lifestyle intervention (Lifestyle) (increase MVPA to &gt; 200 min/wk);

        2. lifestyle intervention with a reduced SB prescription (Lifestyle+SB) (increase MVPA to &gt;
           200 min/wk and reduce SB by 2 hrs/day); or

        3. weight management education materials provided via mailed newsletter (Newsletter).

      Lifestyle and Lifestyle+SB will receive a standard dietary (low-calorie [1200-1500 kcal/day],
      low-fat [&lt;30% calories from fat]) prescription that emphasizes intake of fruits, vegetables,
      and whole grains, and a cognitive behavioral intervention to assist with meeting activity and
      diet goals. Dependent variables, measured at 0 and 3 months, include objectively measured SB,
      LPA, MVPA, and total activity via accelerometry; self-reported SB; percent weight loss;
      insulin and glucose, and leptin and C-reactive protein (CRP) (biomarkers of cancer prognosis
      that have been found to be positively related to SB and/or adiposity); diet; body
      composition; and fitness.

    <time_frame>change from baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is well tolerated by participants who are obese. Participants will walk as quickly as possible, without jogging or running, around two cones placed 60 m apart for 6 min. The primary measure will be distance walked. The 6MWT has been significantly correlated to peak oxygen uptake (VO2) values from a cycle ergometer test (r = .73, p &lt; 0.001). The 6MWT has been shown to measure enhanced physical performance beyond that which occurs from weight loss itself in participants with obesity. Standard safety protocols will be used for participants that Dr. Bell considers appropriate for testing.</description>

    <description>Participants will be educated on the relationship between MVPA and improved health outcomes, including weight management, and cancer survivorship. The goal will be to increase MVPA to &gt; 40 min/day 5 times/wk As participants will be overweight/obese, inactive, and coming into the program with different levels of baseline fitness and time since last cancer treatment, participants will shape their MVPA to meet the targeted goals. Initially, participants will be encouraged to complete MVPA &gt; 10 min/day 5 times/wk, and then progressively increase MVPA by 5 min/day every week until reaching the intervention goal (week 7 of the 12 week intervention). Participants will be encouraged to do brisk walking and be allowed to accumulate time spent being physically active by engaging in multiple short bouts (i.e., &gt; 10 min in length). Any MVPA in bouts of &gt; 10 min in length will be counted towards the MVPA goal. Participants will self-monitor their MVPA using the Polar® Loop tracking system.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Lifestyle + SB</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive everything that is described in Lifestyle. Additionally, they will be educated on the relationship between SB and weight management, and cancer survivorship risk. The goal will be to reduce sedentary time by &gt; 2 hrs/day or &gt; 14 hrs/wk. Participants will shape towards the goal. Baseline measures will be used as the starting point from where to calculate the 2 hrs/day reduction, providing participants with a total SB goal per day. For example, if baseline measures indicate that a participant has a mean daily SB amount of 9.75 hrs, the participant's SB goal will be 7.75 hrs/day. To achieve that goal, participants will reduce SB by 20 minutes a day, starting week 2, with a decrease of an additional 20 minutes/day occurring weekly until the SB goal is achieved (week 7 of the 12 week intervention. Participants will self-monitor their SB using the Polar® Loop tracking system.</description>
