  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to validate two measures of chronic itching in kids: itch
      severity (ItchyQuant) and the impact on their quality of life (ItchyQoL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many diseases that affect children where the primary symptom is pruritus. This
      study aims to validate an age appropriate pediatric version of the ItchyQoL, a
      pruritus-specific quality of life instrument, and the ItchyQuant, a self-reported itch
      severity scale, to better understand how pruritus affects the pediatric population. These
      instruments will comprehensively capture the severity and impact of pruritus in children. The
      physicians want to explore the opportunity to integrate patient-reported outcome measures
      (PROM) as a patient-reported tool in the ambulatory setting.

    <description>Subjects in the 4-7 year age group will complete the TotsItchyQoL® questionnaire. This questionnaire has a total of 16 items with cartoons accompanying each question. The interviewer will ask the subjects questions to rate how pruritus affected their quality of life (QOL). The test-retest reliability will be assessed by analyzing the recorded responses to assess improvement, no change, or worsening of their pruritus.</description>

    <description>Age-appropriate ItchyQuant will be administered as follows; subjects 4-5 years will use the modified 3-point ItchyQuant, for subjects 6-7 years, the 3-point and 5-point ItchyQuant and for ages 8 and older, the traditional non-cartoon version of the numeric rating scale (NRS) will be administered. The parent and clinician will also be asked to rate their perceived itch severity on a full-cartoon version of the ItchyQuant. The ItchyQuant is a 10-point numeric rating scale to rate itch severity. The items are scored from 0-10, where 0=no itch and 10= worst imaginable itch. The validity of the ItchyQuant will be assessed by comparing the responses.</description>
