  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV), a virus related to Severe Acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), was first recognized as a cause of severe
      pulmonary infection in 2012. Infection with MERS CoV has been diagnosed in more than 1600
      individuals with a mortality rate between 35% and 40%. GLS-5300 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that
      expresses the MERS CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. This study will evaluate the safety of
      GLS-5300 at one of three dose levels following a three-injection vaccination regimen followed
      by electroporation. The study will also assess immune responses over a 1 year period with
      respect to the generation of antibody and cellular responses.

      GLS-5300 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the MERS CoV spike (S) glycoprotein.
      Following administration of the vaccine, a specialized medical device, CELLECTRA®, will
      deliver brief electrical pulses in a process known as electroporation (EP), to help move DNA
      into cells more efficiently.
