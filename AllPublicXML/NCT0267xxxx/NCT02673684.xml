  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of Neuro-Stim System, a
      non-pharmacologic alternative for pain management, to reduce pain and treat insomnia.
      Neuro-Stim System uses electrical current to stimulate neurovascular bundles (nerves) in the
      ear and possibly the autonomic nervous system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a complex problem that complicates recovery and rehabilitation after traumatic injury
      and surgery. The physician must balance pain management therapies against the potential for
      side effects and complications. Most of the treatment options for pain are pharmacological
      and have the potential for serious side effects and drug interactions. A non-pharmacological
      treatment would reduce the risk of adverse events and likely enhance the overall multimodal
      pain plan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Neuro-Stim System
      (NSS), a non-pharmacological option that uses electrical current to stimulate neurovascular
      bundles (nerves) in the ear and possibly the autonomic nervous system, to treat pain and
      improve sleep. Pain patients will be asked to participate in a study to evaluate the ability
      of Neuro-Stim System to reduce pain and to treat insomnia. NSS is a Federal Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved device intended to be used for chronic and acute pain.

    <description>The primary outcome is pain measured by the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) from 0-10 at baseline, 15 minutes, and daily for 5 days after application. Data will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) and results will be confirmed by examining each time point using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Data for question 2 on the DVPRS regarding the effect of pain on sleep (on a scale of 0-10) will be analyzed similarly.</description>

    <description>In this arm, the subject will receive the standard-of-care with regard to his pain management (which may or may not include opioids such as morphine). Additionally, the subject will receive a sham Neuro-Stim System device that will only be active for five minutes. Identical to the active device in placement, labeling, and packaging. It will remain on the subject's ear for 5 days at which point the subject may discard the device.</description>

    <description>In this arm, the patient will receive the standard-of-care with regard to his pain management (which may or may not include opioids such as morphine).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be inpatients (at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center) at the
             time of study enrollment and study device placement.

          -  Any patient experiencing post-operative pain (visceral, somatic, or neuropathic) and
             has a pain score (measured via DVPRS v2.0) equal to or greater than 4 for at least 3
             hours in the past 24 hours.

          -  Has an intact external ear where device can be placed

          -  The skin of the ear at placement site must be free of infection

          -  The participant cannot have been on regularly scheduled central acting opioids for
             more than 30 days continuously leading up to the initiation of the study. However,
             intermittent, breakthrough opioids are permissible, but the potential subject must
             have a current opioid prescription.

          -  The participant must have vital signs (HR/breathing/blood pressure) within normal
             limits.

          -  Able to understand English and verbalize their pain level.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have inconsistent vital signs (fluctuating, extremely low blood pressure, tachycardia,
             etc.)

          -  Wear any time of implanted electrical device such as a brain shunt, vagal stimulator,
             pace maker, spinal pain pump, etc.

          -  Pregnant (by results of preoperative Human Chorionic Gonadotropin or hCG urine or
             blood testing)

          -  Has a history of skin allergy to metals
