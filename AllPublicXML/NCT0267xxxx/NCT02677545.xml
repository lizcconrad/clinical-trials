    <textblock>
      Patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis in whom carotid artery stenting is
      planned are randomised between antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin or
      clopidogrel plus aspirin and examined with brain MRI before and after stent treatment. The
      proportion of patients with new ischaemic lesions on MRI after treatment is compared between
      the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an emerging treatment for atherosclerotic carotid stenosis.
      The main adverse event is embolic stroke during the procedure. Current medical management to
      prevent peri-procedural embolisation consists of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel
      and aspirin. Ticagrelor, a novel reversible inhibitor of the platelet adenosine diphosphate
      receptor P2Y12, was superior to clopidogrel, as add-on therapy to aspirin, in preventing
      stent thrombosis, cardiovascular outcome events, and death in patients undergoing coronary
      artery stenting, without causing an increase in major bleeding events. This study aims to
      test the hypothesis that ticagrelor is superior to clopidogrel as add-on to aspirin in
      preventing cerebral embolism during the CAS procedure.

             intra-arterial thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours prior to
             randomisation. If a patient requires intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolytic
             therapy during the treatment period, the Study Medication must be discontinued for at
             least 24 hours; Strong cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors leading to substantial
             increases in ticagrelor plasma levels: ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole,

             ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir; or consumption of more than
             1 litre of grapefruit juice daily; Strong CYP3A inducers leading to substantial
             decreases in ticagrelor plasma levels: rifampicin, rifabutin, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, and phenobarbital; CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic indices
             which may be substantially increased by co-administration of ticagrelor: cyclosporine,
             quinidine, simvastatin at doses &gt;40 mg daily or lovastatin at doses &gt;40 mg daily.
             (Co-administration of ticagrelor with simvastatin increases simvastatin Cmax by 81%
             and area under curve (AUC) by 56% and increases simvastatin acid Cmax by 64% and AUC
             by 52% with some individual increases equal to 2- to 3-fold. Ticagrelor may have
             similar effect on lovastatin, but is not expected to have a clinically meaningful
             effect on other statins including atorvastatin and rosuvastatin); Anticipated
             requirement for long-term (&gt;7 days) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs;
             short-term treatment with NSAIDs up to 7 days is allowed during the treatment period
             at the investigator's discretion);

          -  Need for invasive procedure (surgery or intervention) other than the index CAS
             procedure for which the patient was randomised, which requires halting of Study
             Medication within the next 30 days after randomisation;

          -  History of major surgery within the past 30 days;

          -  Moderate or severe hepatic impairment;

          -  Renal impairment requiring dialysis;

          -  Known or suspected non-compliance, drug or alcohol abuse;

          -  Previous enrolment into the present study;

          -  Participation in another study with investigational drug within the 30 days preceding
             and during the present study;

          -  Patients incapable of judgment or patients under tutelage;

          -  Enrolment of the Investigator, his/her family members, employees and other dependent
