      The primary objective is to evaluate neonatal characteristics, and biological and clinical
      investigations as predictive factors of death, or of severe and moderate neurodevelopmental
      disability at 3 years, in a large population-based cohort of full-term and late preterm
      neonates with moderate or severe HIE.

      Contrary to most previous studies which have often analyzed the accuracy of one factor among
      all other clinical investigations, the investigators objective's is to seek a relevant
      combination of several factors among the following list:

        -  Neonatal characteristics: gestational age and birthweight, maternal disease, acute
           intrapartum event, delivery mode, acidosis, neurological examination, place of birth and
           neonatal transfer

        -  Laboratory investigations: pH, lactates and new biological markers as detailed below

        -  Clinical investigations: aEEG, EEG, MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI

      Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a rare neonatal condition affecting about 1â€° births
      and with a high rate of death and severe neurological disability despite significant
      improvement of the management of this illness in the last ten years. During the first hours
      and days of life, different examinations are made by neonatologists to guide decisions about
      the management of HIE and to provide information to families. Nevertheless, better knowledge
      about the early and late predictive factors of long-term severe and moderate
      neurodevelopmental outcomes is badly needed.

      This study is a prospective national observational population-based study involving all level
      III intensive care units in France.

      This population-based cohort study will be performed including all moderate or severe cases
      of HIE, occurring between 34 and 42 completed weeks gestation in newborns admitted to a
      neonatal intensive care unit of the participating French regions. Children will be
      followed-up until the age of 3 years.

      Participating centers will be invited to adhere to current HIE management guidelines and/or
      clinical investigations considered optimal to date, to ensure standardize clinical practice.
      The study will ensure high quality data collection.

      About indications, timing and characteristics of treatments and investigations will be
      elaborated by the scientific committee during the preparation stage of the cohort study. This
      professional advice will have the double advantage of enabling us to record more homogeneous
      and high-quality data, and to standardize and improve clinical management and investigations
      among newborns with HIE.

      Within this main study, an ancillary study will be performed by 21 centers to address the
      first secondary objective (predictive value of very early - first 6 hours of life -
      neurological examination and biological investigations, including specific new biomarkers
      such as Interleukin-6, Metalloproteinase-9, TIMP-1, Albumin modified by hypoxia, troponin I,
      acylcarnitins and amino acids).

    <description>A combined criterion which includes:
Death between birth and 3 years of age
Neurodevelopmental disabilities in survivors, defined as :
o Severe disabilities
Intellectual impairment with a mental score &gt;2SD below the mean or &lt;70 (ASQ)
Or Cerebral palsy with a Gross Motor Function level of 3-5 according to the GMFCS
Or bilateral blindness (vision &lt;20/200 acuity)
Or deafness requiring amplification (&gt;60dB)and/
Or a persistent disorder defined as recurrent seizures after discharge from neonatal intensive care requiring anti-convulsion therapy at the examination time point
o Moderate disabilities
Intellectual impairment with a mental score &gt;1SD below the mean or 70 to 84 (ASQ)
Cerebral palsy with a Gross Motor Function level of 1 or 2 according to the GMFCS
Or hearing impairment requiring no amplification</description>

    <description>The biologist will evaluate the relevance of specific new biomarkers :
Protein levels (IL-6, MMP-9, TIMP-1, Albumine modified by hypoxia, troponine I) unites will be determined using an ELISA
the measurement of acylcarnitins and amino acids by tandem liquid phase chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy.
The analyses will be blinded and centralized to Reims University laboratory</description>

    <measure>Second secondary objective: the predictive value of clinical investigations during the first weeks of life and treatments.</measure>
    <time_frame>first week, At 18 months and 3 years of age</time_frame>
    <description>To analyze the predictive value of clinical investigations during the first weeks of life and treatments, including cooling:
for normal outcomes (absence of death, any disability, any epilepsy or any need for physiotherapy, orthophonist or psychologist or other measures of reeducation), moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disabilities, and death
At 18 months and 3 years of age
In this part, we will assess the ability of a normal developmental assessment at 18 months to predict survival free of disability or retardation at 3 years. This information will be useful in the future to define different strategies of follow up according to the assessment at 18 months of age.</description>
