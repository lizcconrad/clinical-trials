          -  Any active participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior to this study.

          -  The presence of clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) anterior segment abnormalities;

             structures.

          -  A known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity), corneal ulcer,
             corneal infiltrates or fungal infections.

          -  A history of papillary conjunctivitis that has interfered with contact lens wear.
