      This is a prospective, single-blinded, two-arm, randomized, parallel, pragmatic,
      effectiveness trial that will enroll patients undergoing arthroscopic anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction in order to evaluate the efficacy of using Medipore tape to improve
      cosmetic wound healing and scaring.

    <description>One layer of Medipore tape will be placed across the incision.
Patients will be instructed on how to change the tape, and will be encouraged to change the tape as often as once per week for hygiene.
When patients return to the office for their regularly scheduled visit, the Medipore tape will be changed and a picture of the scar will be taken.</description>
