    <textblock>
      This single-institution randomized controlled trial prospective will enrolled 48 patients
      scheduled for an aortic valve replacement. The objective of the present investigation is to
      determine the role of Polaramine® on reducing hemodynamic instability after separation from
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery. Our hypothesis is that Polaramine® play
      an important role reducing dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system and hemodynamic
      stability after separation from CPB.

    <textblock>
      Vasoplegic syndrome is recognized as a common complication after CPB. Its incidence ranges
      from 5% to 25% after cardiac surgery requiring CPB. Such syndrome is related to an
      inflammatory reaction, which is attributed to the CPB. This syndrome is typically
      characterized by a combination of different parameters with low specificity and sensitivity,
      such as low systemic vascular resistance leading to a hypotension imposing perfusion of
      vasopressors with high or normal cardiac outputs.

      Investigators preliminary data suggest that vasoplegic syndrome might be related to heart
      manipulation during surgery. Tearing maneuvers performed on the heart chambers trigger peaks
      pressure stimulating, consequently, baroreceptors and finally resulting in arteriovenous
      vasodilation via neurogenic and endogenous pathways. According to investigators initial
      investigation, such reaction appears to be related to basophils degranulation and release of
      vasoactive substances.

      The hypothesis of the present trial is that a reduction of basophils degranulation and
      release of vasoactive substances via an antihistaminic could lower the incidence of the
      vasoplegic syndrome. This study aims to determine the effect of an antihistamine
      (dexchlorpheniramine (Polaramine®)) administered intravenously before CPB, on the vasoplegic
      syndrome incidence after separation from CPB.
