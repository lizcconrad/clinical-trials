  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery has evolved considerably after the advent of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), a
      feature that allowed more precision and tranquility to the heart surgeon. But their influence
      on exacerbation of inflammatory response can unbalance the whole homeostasis so happens
      surgical trauma. The attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response in major surgeries
      like cardiac surgery for aortic aneurysm appears to represent an important advance in
      reducing morbidity and mortality of these patients. Some studies suggest that inhaled
      anesthetics such as sevoflurane appear to play an important role in this control, but the
      mechanism by which this happens is still unclear. This study has the primary purpose of
      analyzing from a clinical study sevoflurane inhalation anesthetic can change the inflammatory
      response induced by CPB, significantly reducing the release of inflammatory markers,
      especially elastase PMN.
