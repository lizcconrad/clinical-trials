      This study compared robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) and laparoscopic total
      mesorectal excision (LTME) with regard to urinary function, sexual function and sphincter-
      preservation outcomes for low rectal cancer.

      Urinary and sexual dysfunction are recognized complications of rectal cancer surgery in men.
      This study compared robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) and laparoscopic total
      mesorectal excision(LTME) with regard to these functional outcomes.Sphincter- preservation
      outcomes for low rectal cancer was observed as well.

    <description>Robot-assisted total mesorectal excision (RTME) for rectal cancer. Two different RTME procedures were chose to personalized patients. Generally, when the tumor located within 5-15cm from the anal verge, low anterior resection (LAR) was employed, and tumor located below 5cm, abdominoperineal resection (APR) was applied usually.</description>

    <description>The Da Vinci Surgical System may help to protect subtle anatomical structure and provide more functional protection when compared to laparoscopic surgery. This study aimed to compare RTME and laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) for rectal cancer with regard to Urinary, sexual function and sphincter- preservation outcomes.</description>
