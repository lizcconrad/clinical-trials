      The aim of this study is to compare the effect on ketone production of dietary an MCT
      supplement combined or not with physical exercise in two groups of women (N=10/group),
      healthy adults and patients with prediabetes. After an evaluation of the metabolism (a 4-hour
      visit with multiple blood samples) at the beginning of the study, all the participants are
      taken for one-week the MCT supplement alone follow by a one-week period of taking the MCT
      supplement in combination with physical exercise. At the end of each period of time, the
      4-hour visit for the evaluation of the metabolism is repeated.
