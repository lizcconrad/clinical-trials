    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, multi-center, parallel group Phase 3
      study of MSRD-100 in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in subjects aged 3 months and up
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-week efficacy, safety and tolerability study of MSRD-100 applied twice daily for
      4 weeks compared to its vehicle among subjects ≥3 months of age in the treatment of atopic
      dermatitis covering ≥5% body surface area.

      The study will consist of up to 4 visits which includes Screening - Visit 1 (Screening),
      Baseline - Visit 2 , Visit 3 (Day 14), and an End of Treatment/Final Study Visit - Visit 4
      (Day 28).

      Study IDs M169981001 and M169981002 are two identical studies being run in parallel with
      different study sites.

    <description>Treatment success is defined as an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear or almost clear and a minimum of a 2-grade improvement in IGA score from baseline plus no worsening on any of the signs present at baseline.
The primary endpoint is a composite of: (1) the IGA score of clear or almost clear as well as subjects having a minimum two point improvement on the IGA, plus (2) no worsening of any of the signs present at baseline.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are male or female, ≥3 months of age on the date of Baseline Visit.

          2. Subjects with a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, active inflammation and meeting the
             Hanifin and Rajka Diagnosis Criteria for atopic dermatitis.

          3. Subjects must have an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥2 at baseline.

          4. Subjects who have atopic dermatitis covering ≥5% Body Surface Area (BSA) excluding the
             eyelids, perioral area, around the nostrils, and in the diaper area (for subjects who
             wear diapers or plastic pants).

          5. Subjects who have atopic dermatitis with a sign and symptom score ≥ 2 on the following
             three signs and symptoms: erythema, infiltration/papulation, and
             erosion/oozing/crusting present in at least one body surface area affected.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unstable course of atopic dermatitis (spontaneously improving or rapidly
             deteriorating) as determined by the investigator over the previous 4 weeks prior to
             baseline.

          2. Concurrent conditions and history of other diseases.

          3. Used any of the following treatments within the indicated washout period before the
