    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate MECC compared with conventional
      extracorporeal circulation of diabetic patients undergoing elective coronary
      revascularization procedures. The investigators focused on the effects of extracorporeal
      circulation especially the renal function between both groups.

      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is known having a negative influence referring to systemic
      inflammatory reaction after cardiac surgery which can cause acute kidney injury (AKI).
      Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) attempts to reduce the adverse effects of
      conventional extracorporeal circulation bypass. Finally, AKI after CPB is a significant
      clinical problem that increasingly complicates the course of hospitalization and clinical
      outcome.

    <description>Coronary artery bypass grafting is used with the help of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The technique used in this arm based on the minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system (MiECC). MiECC has been developed based on the concept of a closed total CPB circuit. The basic elements are a centrifugal pump, a membrane oxygenator and an arterial filter. The priming volume compared to CECC could be reduced. The complete circuit is heparin-coated for maximizing the biocompatibility.
CPB was performed under normothermic conditions of 36°C. Retrograde autologous priming was performed for all patients with stable hemodynamic circulation.</description>

    <description>Coronary artery bypass grafting is used with the help of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The technique used in this arm based on the conventional extracorporeal circulation system (CECC). The CECC is an opened circulation system. The basic elements are a membrane oxygenator, a centrifugal pump, an open perfusion system containing the venous hard shell cardiotomy reservoir and the arterial line filter.
CPB was performed under normothermic conditions of 36°C. Retrograde autologous priming was performed for all patients with stable hemodynamic circulation, leading to a reduction of the priming volume. The CECC flow was set as required in order to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 50 and 75 mmHg.</description>

          <title>MiECC</title>
          <description>Coronary artery bypass grafting is used with the help of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The technique used in this arm based on the minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system (MiECC). MiECC has been developed based on the concept of a closed total CPB circuit. The basic elements are a centrifugal pump, a membrane oxygenator and an arterial filter. The priming volume compared to CECC could be reduced. The complete circuit is heparin-coated for maximizing the biocompatibility.
CPB was performed under normothermic conditions of 36°C. Retrograde autologous priming was performed for all patients with stable hemodynamic circulation.

          <description>Coronary artery bypass grafting is used with the help of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The technique used in this arm based on the conventional extracorporeal circulation system (CECC). The CECC is an opened circulation system. The basic elements are a membrane oxygenator, a centrifugal pump, an open perfusion system containing the venous hard shell cardiotomy reservoir and the arterial line filter.
CPB was performed under normothermic conditions of 36°C. Retrograde autologous priming was performed for all patients with stable hemodynamic circulation, leading to a reduction of the priming volume. The CECC flow was set as required in order to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 50 and 75 mmHg.
