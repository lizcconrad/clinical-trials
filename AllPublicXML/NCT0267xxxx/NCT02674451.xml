  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-medium induced nephropathy (CIN) is a frequent and devastating complication of
      coronary angiography, occurring in 10-50% of cases. As would be expected, the incidence of
      CIN is much higher in patients with underlying renal dysfunction. Multiple trials have found
      CIN to be an independent predictor of prolonged hospitalization and both 30 day and 1 year
      mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Intravenous contrast dye is felt to cause
      renal ischemia as the mechanism of injury. Unfortunately, despite the significant morbidity
      and mortality with CIN, there are few therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk with the
      exception of hydration and high dose statin therapy. Recently, remote ischemic
      preconditioning (RIPC), a process of inducing transient arm ischemia by inflating a blood
      pressure cuff to 200 mmHg for 3 repetitive 5 minute cycles, leads to a systemic
      cytoprotective response and ultimately reduces ischemic renal injury, myocardial injury, and
      even cerebral injury following coronary bypass grafting. While there is significant data
      supporting the role of RIPC in reducing systemic ischemic injury in surgical patients, there
      is only one small trial studying RIPC in patient's undergoing coronary angiography. The
      investigators hypothesize that RIPC will reduce the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy
      in patients with baseline renal dysfunction undergoing coronary angiography for stable or
      unstable coronary artery disease.

      Contrast-medium induced nephropathy (CIN) is a frequent and devastating complication of
      coronary angiography, occurring in 10-50% of cases dependent on individual risk factors (JACC
      2004; 44:1393). Multiple trials have found CIN to be an independent predictor of prolonged
      hospitalization and both 30 day and 1 year mortality in patients with coronary artery disease
      (Clin Res Cardiol 2009;98:765, JACC 2004:44:1780, Ann Int Med 2009;150:170, JACC 2008; 51:
      1419). The largest retrospective study of over 16,000 hospitalized patients exposed to
      iodinated contrast found an in-hospital mortality rate of 34% in subjects developing CIN
      versus 7% in matched control subjects (JAMA 1996;275:1489). Despite the incidence of CIN and
      the deleterious outcomes, few therapies exist to prevent CIN other than hydration and
      withdraw of nephrotoxic medications prior to coronary angiography.

      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a protective response resulting from transient
      episodes of ischemia, followed by reperfusion, to vascular beds remote from the organ which
      will undergo the prolonged ischemic insult. Studies in humans indicate that RIPC decreases
      cardiac enzyme release, clinical events, and improves mortality in patients undergoing
      elective coronary bypass surgery (Circulation 2009;119:820; Lancet 2007;370:575, Lancet 2013;
      382: 597). In addition to the cardio-protective effects of RIPC, a small, single center
      randomized trial showed a reduction in the incidence of contrast-medium induced nephropathy
      of approximately 30% in patients receiving RIPC prior to elective coronary angiography
      compared to a control population (Circulation 2012; 126:296). RIPC was safely performed in
      all of these studies by inflating a blood pressure cuff to supra-systolic levels (200mmHg)
      for 3 five minute episodes separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion.

      RIPC is a well-tolerated, easily administered mechanism that may reduce the incidence of
      contrast-mediated nephropathy. However, additional and larger trials are needed to validate
      the use of RIPC in both elective and urgent coronary angiography in patients at risk for
      contrast-medicated nephropathy.
