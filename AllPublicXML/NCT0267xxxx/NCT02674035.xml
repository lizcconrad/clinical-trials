  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty women with similar abdominal deformities, who had had at least one pregnancy, were
      randomized into three groups to undergo abdominoplasty. Plication of the anterior rectus
      sheath was performed in two layers with 2-0 monofilament nylon suture (control group) or in a
      single layer with either a continuous 2-0 monofilament nylon suture (group I) or using a
      continuous barbed suture (group II). Operative time was recorded. All patients underwent
      ultrasound examination preoperatively and at 3 weeks and 6 months postoperatively to monitor
      for diastasis recurrence. The force required to bring the anterior rectus sheath to the
      midline was measured at the supraumbilical and infraumbilical levels.

    <textblock>
      Inclusion criteria were female gender; 25 to 50 years of age; history of at least one
      pregnancy; body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m2; desire to undergo abdominoplasty as
      a single procedure without receiving liposuction or other cosmetic surgeries; deformities of
      the skin and subcutaneous tissues in the abdominal region; and musculoaponeurotic defect.

      Non-inclusion criteria were smoking habit; abdominal wall scar (except for a Pfannenstiel
      scar related to a Cesarean section); abdominal wall hérnias; history of deep-vein thrombosis;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; câncer; hypertension; diabetes or other chronic
      systemic diseases; and use of corticosteroids. Patients lost to follow-up and those who did
      not undergo ultrasound examination were excluded from the study.

      Primary outcome: Get a technique that provides a safe correction with lasting results and in
      every segment of time.

      Secondary clinical outcome: confirms the plication of a single layer as positive in women
      patients at two years of surgery compared to two planes.
