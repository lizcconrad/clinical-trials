  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this three-year project, our research teams are going to consecutively explore these
      important clinical, drug and physical rehabilitation treatment effects, noradrenergic
      network, autonomic dysfunction and microRNA signalling data as well as the correlations
      between them in early Parkinson Disease (PD) patients. The investigators hypothesize that the
      explorations of the above insights are unique and can provide an important source data for
      Taiwanese Parkinson Disease (PD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (1) 70 patients with PD. (2) 30 age and sex-match controls.

      Methods:

      -1st year To built up the biobank of 30 early PD patients (Hoehn and Yahr stage 1-3) and 30
      health controls in all examination.

      The PD patients will accept the MRI, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral microRNA
      examination and their correlations among each other at least 12 hours after the least
      medication.

      -2nd year Second year, the investigators will follow-up the 30 PD patients enrolled in the
      1st years.

      The PD patients will receive studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics effect before
      medication, including MRI, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral microRNA examination.

      -3rd year the investigators will study the rehabilitation effect in PD (3 days per week, for
      12 weeks).

      30 PD with rehabilitation and 30 PD without rehabilitation will be enrolled and compared
      their difference in MRI study, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral microRNA examination
      before and after 3 month follow-up.

      Goals

        1. To define the effect of norepinephrine network to autonomic dysfunction in PD

        2. To define the effect of peripheral microRNA level to norepinephrine network in PD

        3. To associate drug/physical rehabilitation effect to alteration of norepinephrine
           network, autonomic dysfunction, and peripheral microRNA and their interactions to
           striatal dopaminergic network in PD.

        4. According to previous results, to verify the role of norepinephrine network and
           autonomic dysfunction in long-term PD evolution.

    <description>The Rehabilitation treatment group will receive rehabilitation training once per day, 3 days per week, for 12 weeks. The duration of each session is about 1 hour. Participants will first receive relaxation exercises, positioning and self-stretch exercises (emphasizing on spinal mobility and flexor muscle groups of limbs and trunk) for 15 minutes. Then they will have balance training for 20 minutes. The investigators will use goal-directed tasks, such as different types of ball games, for balance training. At the end, participants will receive walking exercise for 20 minutes, and cool down exercises for 5 minutes.</description>
