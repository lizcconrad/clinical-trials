  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to investigate whether an intensive educational
      intervention can reduce the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy. It is hypothesised that the
      use of antipsychotic polypharmacy is, in some degree, dependent on non-patient related
      factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several surveys have shown a high prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy (concomitant
      prescription of at least 2 different antipsychotics) among patients with schizophrenia even
      though international guidelines recommend monotherapy.

      From register data areas with differences in the prevalence of antipsychotic polypharmacy
      will be identified. Two high prevalence areas will be randomized to either control or
      intervention area. In the intervention area an intensive educational intervention consisting
      of outreach visits with a multifaceted approach will be carried out with the duration of 1
      year.

      Differences in health staff related factors such as knowledge and attitude towards clinical
      guidelines will be assessed with a questionnaire before and after the intervention in the
      intervention area as well as in the low prevalence area at baseline.

      Medical records data describing the use of antipsychotic polypharmacy will be collected. With
      register data health economic issues will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The intervention is not aimed directly to the patients but their health care
             providers.

          -  Patients with schizophrenia (F2* diagnosis according to ICD-10) taking antipsychotic
             medication and their health care providers in the specified areas will enter the
             study:

          -  The patients will enter with data from their medical record, register data and a few
             exploring interviews while the health staff will enter with their questionnaire data.
