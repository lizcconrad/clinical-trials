  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to find out whether Hylenex recombinant (for short, Hylenex)
      in subcutaneous (SC) injection improves the speed and effectiveness of SC opioids in hospice
      patients. Specifically, this study proposes to compare the level of self-reported pain in
      hospice patients started on SC infusions of morphine and hydromorphone (Dilaudid) over the
      initial 8 hours of opioid infusion with and without the preceded co-injection of Hylenex.
      Hospice patients include both home-bound patients as well as those under intensive care in
      hospice houses.

      As of January 2009, 58 patients were recruited to the study as study subjects. Target goals
      for the study is to recruit 88 subjects with full and accurate information with about 44
      patients in the Hylenex group and another group of subjects in the control group.
