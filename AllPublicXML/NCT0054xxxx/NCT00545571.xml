    <textblock>
      This single-arm study will assess the long-term maintenance of hemoglobin levels, safety, and
      tolerability of once-monthly intravenous administration of Mircera in hemodialysis
      participants with chronic renal anemia. Those currently receiving darbepoetin alfa, epoetin
      alfa, or epoetin beta maintenance treatment will receive intravenous Mircera at a starting
      dose of 120, 200, or 360 micrograms (mcg) per month (based on the erythropoiesis stimulating
      agent [ESA] dose administered on Week -1). Subsequent doses will be adjusted to maintain
      hemoglobin levels within the country-specific target range (11 to 13 grams per deciliter
      [g/dL] for Switzerland and 10 to 12 g/dL for Austria).

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Within Plus/Minus (±) 1 g/dL of Reference Hb or Within Target Range During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Weeks -4, -3, -2, -1, 0; pre-dose (0 hours) and immediately before dialysis (minimum 3 sessions per week) during Weeks 18, 20, 22, 24</time_frame>
    <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to 0). During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. Sampling was also performed prior to each dialysis session. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the country-specific target range (11.0 to 13.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL in Austria) and within ±1 g/dL of their individual reference Hb was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

    <description>During the LTSP (Weeks 18 to 52), participants provided a total of 16 pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. Sampling was also performed prior to each dialysis session. Time spent in the country-specific target range (11.0 to 13.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL in Austria) was defined as time from first on-target Hb to time of last known on-target Hb, as collected during the EEP.

The percentage of all Hb values outside of the country-specific target range was determined and reported separately as Hb values above the upper bound (13.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 12.0 g/dL in Austria) and Hb values below the lower bound (11.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 10.0 g/dL in Austria).</description>

    <description>During the LTSP (Weeks 18 to 52), participants provided a total of 16 pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. Sampling was also performed prior to each dialysis session. Deviation from the country-specific target range was calculated as [Hb value minus country-specific upper bound] for deviations above the target range and [Hb value minus country-specific lower bound] for deviations below the target range. Deviations were averaged among all Hb values from all participants and expressed in g/dL, reported separately as mean deviation above the upper bound (13.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 12.0 g/dL in Austria) and mean deviation below the lower bound (11.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 10.0 g/dL in Austria).</description>

          <title>Mircera in Renal Anemia</title>
          <description>Participants with chronic renal anemia who were previously treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy received intravenous methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera), also known as continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), every 4 weeks for a total of 52 weeks in this single-arm study. The first dose of 120, 200, or 360 micrograms (mcg) was based upon the dose of ESA received prior to administration of study treatment, while subsequent doses were adjusted during a 16-week dose titration period (DTP) to maintain hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations within a country-specific target: 11.0 to 13.0 grams per deciliter (g/dL) in Switzerland and 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL in Austria.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Within Plus/Minus (±) 1 g/dL of Reference Hb or Within Target Range During the Efficacy Evaluation Period (EEP)</title>
        <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment stability assessment (Weeks -4 to 0). During the EEP (Weeks 18 to 24), participants provided a total of four pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. Sampling was also performed prior to each dialysis session. The average Hb during the EEP was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the country-specific target range (11.0 to 13.0 g/dL in Switzerland and 10.0 to 12.0 g/dL in Austria) and within ±1 g/dL of their individual reference Hb was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

The 95% CI was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>
