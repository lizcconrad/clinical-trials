          -  Male and/or female patients aged from 40-75 years of age with mild to moderate COPD.

          -  Diagnosis of mild/moderate COPD, according to the GOLD guidelines.

          -  Bronchodilatory response to ipratropium at screening

          -  Current or ex-smokers with a smoking history of &gt;10 pack-years. Ten pack-years is
             defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years etc.

          -  Female patients must have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to

             least 1 year prior to inclusion.

          -  Lab and post-bronchodilator values within a certain range.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 to 32 kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant medical condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may
             compromise patient safety, patient compliance, interfere with evaluations, or preclude
             completion of the trial.

          -  Any medical condition that may make spirometry unsafe

          -  History of glaucoma, symptomatic prostatism or urinary retention.

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing or longer
             if required by local regulations and for any other limitation of participation based
             on local regulations. Previous participation in a study with either the
             investigational or comparator drugs does not exclude a patient from participation in
             this study.

          -  Donation or loss of 400 ml or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to first dosing, or
             longer if required by local regulation.

          -  Significant illness (other than respiratory illness) within the two weeks prior to
             dosing.

          -  Clinically significant ECG abnormalities indicative of an unstable underlying cardiac
             problem, e.g. recent myocardial infarction, 2nd/3rd degree heart block, or a family
             history grandparents, parents and siblings of a prolonged QT-interval syndrome.

          -  History of clinically significant drug allergy or history of atopic allergy (asthma,
             urticaria, eczematous dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drugs
             similar to the study drug.

          -  History of immunocompromise, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test
             result.

          -  A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C test result.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or
             baseline evaluations.

          -  Patients who are unable to demonstrate appropriate use of the Concept 1 device at
             screening
