  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common condition associated with significant
      long-term cognitive, behavioral, and functional morbidities. There are minimal controlled
      efficacy data of various acute rehabilitation intervention approaches.

      Objective: To determine the relative efficacy of two different acute TBI rehabilitation
      approaches - cognitive-didactic versus functional-experiential. Secondarily to determine
      relative efficacy for different patient subpopulations based on baseline cognitive
      functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomly assigned, intent-to-treat model of two different comprehensive treatment programs
      conducted between July 19 1996 and May 16, 2003 in 360 adult participants with moderate to
      severe TBI treated in four participating Veterans Administration TBI rehabilitation centers.

      All patients admitted to the Commission for Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF)
      accredited acute inpatient rehabilitation brain injury programs at 4 participating Veterans
      Administration Medical Centers (VAMCs) (Minneapolis, Palo Alto, Richmond, and Tampa) during
      the study enrollment period were screened for eligibility.

      The design was a randomized-controlled trial with two treatment arms (cognitive-didactic and
      functional-experiential), both embedded within an interdisciplinary TBI rehabilitation
      program. All treatment was hospital based. The interactive nature of the experimental
      conditions precluded subject blinding. Since each participating site serves a wide geographic
      area, the protocol permitted post-hospital outcome assessments by structured telephonic
      interview, to minimize drop out.

      Participants completed baseline assessment then received by random assignment one of the two
      standardized protocol rehabilitation programs (summarized below and described in detail
      elsewhere). Participants received 1.5 to 2.5 hours daily of protocol-specific therapy plus
      another 2 to 2.5 hours daily of occupational and physical therapy. Independent teams of
      therapists functioned at each site to deliver the separate treatments and by necessity were
      not blinded to treatment. Protocol monitoring site visits, biweekly conference calls, and
      biannual investigator meetings were conducted to ensure uniformity of protocol treatment over
      time.

    <description>Developed by Sohlberg &amp; Mateer to target four cognitive domains often impaired by TBI: attention, memory, executive functions, and pragmatic communication. Subjects practiced progressively more difficult paper-and-pencil or computerized cognitive tasks in 1:1 cognitive therapy sessions (1.5-2.5 hours daily).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The works of Giles and Clark-Wilson and Hartley guided the basic concepts and treatment of the functional-experiential arm (Functional). The objective of the functional protocol was to use real life performance situations and common tasks to remediate or compensate for functional deficits after brain injury. Functional protocol treatment interventions (1.5-2.5 hours daily) typically occurred in group settings and natural environments (hospital recreation areas, group rooms, simulated home environments in the dining room, community outings, etc.).</description>
