  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition that can result from a
      bacterial infection in the lungs. Viral infections may impair the body's immune system
      response to bacteria, which may lead to more serious lung injury. This study will evaluate
      the association between the immune response and ARDS severity in people who have ARDS plus a
      viral infection.

    <textblock>
      ARDS is a serious condition that involves inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs,
      leading to low blood oxygen levels and breathing failure. It is often fatal and affects
      approximately 150,000 individuals each year in the United States. Common underlying causes
      include bacterial infections, lung trauma, and pneumonia. Even in people with similar risk
      factors for ARDS, there are often varying levels of condition severity. This may be because
      some people experience an ongoing viral infection that further predisposes them to the
      bacterial infection, worsening the severity of ARDS. Viruses release a protein called Type I
      interferon. This protein increases the response of the interferon stimulated genes (ISG) in
      neutrophils, which are white blood cells that protect the body against disease and infections
      by destroying bacteria. Preliminary studies have shown that some people at risk for ARDS have
      elevated ISGs in their neutrophils and that ISGs are associated with an impaired neutrophil
      response and increased severity of ARDS. This study will evaluate the association between
      viral-related neutrophil ISG response and the severity of ARDS.

      Participants will include people on mechanical ventilation who are enrolled in either the
      ARDSNet 06 or 07 studies. For this study, participants will undergo blood collection within
      48 hours of beginning the main ARDSNet study. There will be no study visits specifically for
      this study. Study researchers will analyze participants' blood samples and ARDSNet study data
      to gather information on mortality, the number of ventilator-free days, markers of severity
      of organ dysfunction and inflammation, and neutrophil response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients that are eligible for ARDSNet Study 06 (Prospective, Randomized,
             Multi-center Trial of Aerosolized Albuterol Versus Placebo in Patients with Acute Lung
             Injury [ALI] or Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) and ARDSNet Study 07
             (Prospective, Randomized, Multi-center Trial of Initial Trophic Enteral Feeding
             Followed by Advancement to Full-Calorie Enteral Feeding vs. Early Advancement to
             Full-Calorie Enteral Feeding in Patients with Acute Lung Injury [ALI] or Acute
             Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS] and Prospective, Randomized, Blinded,
             Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Trial of Omega-3 Fatty Acid, Gamma-Linolenic Acid,
             and Anti-Oxidant Supplementation in the Management of Acute Lung Injury [ALI] or Acute
             Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) will be eligible for co-enrollment in this study

          -  Experiences acute onset of each of the following criteria within a 24-hour time
             period:

               1. Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen
                  (PaO2/FiO2) less than or equal to 300; if altitude is greater than 1000 meters,
                  then PaO2/FiO2 must be less than or equal to 300 x (barometric pressure [PB]/760)

               2. Bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema on frontal chest
                  radiograph. The infiltrates may be patchy, diffuse, homogeneous, or asymmetric.

               3. Requires positive pressure ventilation via endotracheal tube

               4. No clinical evidence of left-sided cardiac failure to account for bilateral
                  pulmonary infiltrates

        patient meets the first three inclusion criteria but has a pulmonary arterial wedge
        pressure (PAOP) greater than 18 mm Hg, then the first four criteria must persist for more
        than 12 hours after the PAOP has declined to less than or equal to 18 mm Hg, and still be
