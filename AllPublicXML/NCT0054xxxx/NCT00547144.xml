        Inclusion Criteria:1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed
        adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The site of the primary lesion should be confirmed
        endoscopically, radiologically, or surgically to be in the pancreas.

        2. Patients must be deemed unresectable due to involvement of critical vasculature,
        adjacent organ invasion, presence of metastasis, or other medical condition making surgical
        resection unfavorable.

        3. Patients must have a primary or metastatic lesion measurable in at least one dimension
        by RECIST criteria within 4 weeks prior to entry of study 4. More than 4 weeks must have
        elapsed from the time of major surgery or completion of the last dose of chemotherapy,
        radiation therapy, investigational therapy and patients must adequately recover from these
        effects.

        5. Life expectancy of &gt;3 months. 6. Karnofsky performance status &gt;70%. 7. Patients must
        have normal organ and marrow functions as defined below: absolute neutrophil count
        &gt;1,500/mm3 platelets &gt;70,000/mm3 total bilirubin &lt;1.5 mg/dL AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X
        institutional upper limit of normal creatinine within normal institutional limits OR
        creatinine clearance &gt;60mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above
        institutional normal.

        albumin &gt; 2.8 mg/dL 8. Patients must have adequate clotting function (platelet &gt; 70k;
        INR&lt;1.4; PTT&lt;60).

        9. Age &gt;18 years. 10. The effects of DCs on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
        this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
        contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for
        the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
        pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately.

        11. No history of autoimmune diseases. 12. Ability to understand the study protocol and a
        willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:1. Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. 2. Patients who have
        received prior gemcitabine or radiation therapy to the pancreatic bed 3. Patients receiving
        any other investigational agents. 4. Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded
        because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurological
        dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurological and other adverse effects.

        5. Uncontrolled concurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situation that would limit compliance with study
        requirements.

        6. Patients who test positive for Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus or HIV.
