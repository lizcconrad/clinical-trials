  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The occurrence of Peripheral Vascular Disease has been increasing which includes the large
      artery in the upper leg called Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA). The Peritoneal Lined Stent
      has been developed as a new method for treating narrowed area in the SFA. This research study
      will determine the safety and effectiveness of the Peritoneal Lined Stent in keeping th
      Superficial Femoral Artery open and allowing blood to flow in the leg.

             short segment occlusion(&lt;5cm first two patients and &lt;10cm there on) or high
             grade(&gt;50%)stenosis

          -  Patient has a signed and dated informed consent

          -  Patient has a resting ABI &lt;0.9 or an abnormal exercise ABI if resting ABI is normal.
             Patients with incompressible arteries (ABI &gt;1.2) must have TBI &lt;0.8

          -  Life expectancy greater than one year

          -  The ability to comply with protocol follow up requirements and required testing

          -  Angiographic lesion requirements assessed at time of procedure

               -  Lesion of the superficial femoral artery with a short segment occlusion(&lt;5cm
                  first two patients and &lt;10cm there on) or high grade (&gt;50%) stenosis

               -  Target lesion 1 cm below profunda/superficial femoral artery origin and 3cm above
                  knee joint

               -  Angiographic evidence of a minimum of at least one tibial with continuous artery
                  runoff to the ankle that does not require intervention

               -  Guidewire has successfully traversed lesion and is within the true lumen of the
                  distal vessel, and successful placement of 9 french(Fr) sheath

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Untreated iliac artery in-flow limiting lesion

          -  Significant proximal common femoral or superficial femoral artery disease above or
             below target lesion

          -  Any previously treated superficial femoral artery lesion

          -  Any previous stenting or surgery in the target vessel

          -  Femoral or popliteal aneurysm

          -  Non-Atherosclerotic disease resulting in occlusion (e.g. embolism, vasculitis,etc)

             coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure, severe chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease, metastasis malignance, etc.)
