      Primary objective: to demonstrate the non-inferiority of PCR adjusted adequate clinical and
      parasitological response at D28 of artesunate + amiodaquine versus artemether + lumefantrine,
      based on the first malaria attack of each subject.

      Secondary objectives:

      For the first attack: To compare the two groups of treatment in terms of:

        -  D14 efficacy

        -  Parasitological and fever clearance

        -  Clinical and biological tolerability

        -  Evolution of gametocyte carriage

        -  Cardiac tolerability (QTc)

      For the repeated attacks: To compare the two groups of treatment in terms of:

        -  D14 and D28 clinical and parasitological effectiveness (PCR adjusted)

        -  Clinical and biological tolerability

        -  Proportion of patients without fever at D3

        -  Proportion of patients without parasite at D3

        -  Compliance

        -  Impact on anaemia

      During the total follow-up of the cohort: To compare the two groups of treatment in term of:

        -  Treatment incidence density

        -  Impact of repeated treatment on clinical and biological safety

        -  Impact of repeated treatment on hearing capacity
