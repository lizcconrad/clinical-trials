  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether six months of daily finasteride (PROSCAR),
      following an initial negative prostate biopsy, will improve the detection of prostate cancer
      on repeat biopsy.

      144 subjects with an initial negative prostate biopsy will be randomized to receive either
      finasteride or placebo for 6 months. The subjects will undergo a second prostate biopsy
      following drug intervention. PSA (prostate specific antigen) measurements, testosterone
      levels, and quality of life questionnaires will also be assessed during the study. The two
      groups will then be compared.

      5.0. Study Design and Treatment 5.1. Study Design This is a randomized, two-arm, double
      blind, placebo controlled study of daily PROSCAR® or placebo for 6 months in men with an
      initial negative prostate biopsy.

      5.1.1. Biopsy The TRUS guided biopsy, to be carried out at Visit 4, will be performed by one
      physician. The biopsy will be performed as per the standard protocol at UHN, including 13-15
      cores. The physician performing the biopsy will be blinded to the initial biopsy results and
      the PSA change over time. Before biopsy, a DRE will be performed. Aside from the standard
      biopsy scheme, suspicious areas on TRUS can be further biopsied. (e.g. a hypoechoic nodule).

      5.2. Methods for Accrual and Randomization: Patients with an initial negative prostate biopsy
      that was performed at UHN and seen at the Prostate Center of the Princess Margaret Hospital
      will be considered for enrolment. Randomization by a random numbers table will be performed
      in blocks of 4 patients. After patients are deemed eligible for the study, the central office
      at Merck will be contacted and patient assignment given. The code will match the study drug
      label and the drug shipment will contain a blinded allocation envelope. The investigators,
      study participants and research coordinators will be blinded to the intervention.

PROSCAR© 5 mg tablets are blue, apple-shaped; film coated with the code MSD 72 on one side and PROSCAR on the other. They will be provided in bottles of 35 tablets.</description>
