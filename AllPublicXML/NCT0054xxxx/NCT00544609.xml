        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, in clinical stages T2-4a
             N0 M0 (if multifocal evaluation of all lesions by biopsies), who are not candidates
             for radical cystectomy by medical reasons or refusal.

          -  No prior treatment with radiotherapy to the bladder or systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must be ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Patients must have ECOG performance status 0 to 2.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients with adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function as assessed by the
             following laboratory requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to screening:

        hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.500/mm3 platelets ≥ 100.000/mm3. total
        bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normality SGOT (AST) and/or SGPT (ALT) ≤ 2.5 times
        the upper limit of normality alkaline phosphatase ≤ 4 x ULN serum creatinine ≤1.5 upper
        limit of normality PT-INR/PTT &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normality creatinine clearance ≥ 40
        ml/min using Cockcroft-Gaul

          -  Patients must give their written informed consent before any procedure related to the
             study is performed; therefore, it must be given at the selection visit. The patient
             must be informed that he has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without
             any kind of prejudice.

             contraceptives, intrauterine device, condom, sterilization) whilst participating in
             the protocol. After the retreat of treatment with sorafenib, the contraceptive methods
             must be used during 4 weeks in women and during 3 months in men.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active infection or other serious medical conditions (autologous bone
             marrow transplant or stem cell rescue within 4 months of study, patients undergoing
             renal dialysis, known HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B or C, active clinically
             serious infections &gt; CTCAE Grade 2, non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture).

          -  Abuse of substances, clinical conditions, psychological or social, that would preclude
             appropriate informed consent or compliance with protocol.

             entry).

          -  Concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer- or immunotherapy during the study or
             within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  Treatment wuth mitomycin C or nitrosureas during 6 weeks prior of study entry.

             carcinoma.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding patients.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to sorafenib.

          -  Cardiac disease: Congestive heart failure &gt; class II NYHA; active CAD (myocardial
             infarction more than 6 months to study entry is allowed); cardiac arrythmias requiring
             anti-arrythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin are permitted).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mm Hg or diastolic
             pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg, despite optimal medical management.

          -  Known brain metastasis. Patients with neurological symptoms should undergo a CT
             scan/MRI of the brain to exclude brain metastasis.

          -  Thrombotic or embolic events such as cerebrovascular accident including transient
             ischemic attacks within the past 6 months.
