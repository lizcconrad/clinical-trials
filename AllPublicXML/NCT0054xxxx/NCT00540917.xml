  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lasers are the treatment modality of choice for Port Wine Stain birthmarks.The epidermis is
      not totally spared due to partial absorption of energy therein by melanin that presents an
      optical barrier through which the light must pass to reach the underlying blood vessels.
      Absorption of laser energy by melanin causes localized heating in the epidermis, which may,
      if not controlled, produce permanent complications such as hypertrophic scarring or
      dyspigmentation.

      The researchers want to establish a correlation between non-invasive skin temperature
      measurements and the minimum laser energy during skin laser treatment using cryogen spray
      cooling.

      This study would eliminate the need for test pulses to estimate the safe and acceptable
      radiant exposure prior to laser treatment.
