  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the project is to investigate in eyes with dry AMD, the efficacy and safety as
      preventive therapy of the immunomodulatory substance named copaxone which had been proven as
      safe and effective agent for a neurodegenerative disease, in arresting the progression as
      well as the conversion of dry AMD to wet AMD. The hypothesis that the immunomodulatory agent
      copaxone proven for a neurodegenerative disease may work in the eye is revolutionary and may
      open a new avenue of preventive treatment for the disease which is the major cause of legal
      blindness in the industrial world
