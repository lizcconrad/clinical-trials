  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help determine the frequency and magnitude of nocturnal hypoglycemia (low
      blood sugar at night during sleep), in children with type 1 diabetes who are on a standard
      insulin regimen, by using a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS). Secondary objectives
      include the establishment of a definition of nocturnal hypoglycemia for the CGMS and for the
      calculation of sample size needed for future studies using CGMS. Nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH)
      can be associated with significant morbidity including seizure and coma. The investigators
      intend to use the CGMS in a future study investigating the use of a new insulin combination
      aimed to decrease the frequency of NH in the pediatric population.

      Thirty pediatric subjects with established type 1 diabetes mellitus will be asked to wear a
      CGMS for 3 days. During this time the participants will be required to test and record
      self-monitored blood glucose readings at designated time periods and if they have symptoms of
      hypoglycemia. The comparison of these values with each other and with different previously
      defined values of NH will allow for a clear definition of NH to be made. A survey has also
      been designed to assess participant satisfaction with the CGMS.
