  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of GSK1325760A on improvement
      in exercise capacity in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate administration of GSK1325760A on:

        -  The safety and tolerability

        -  Improvement of PAH

        -  The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of GSK1325760A

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Six Minutes Walk Distance (6MWD) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the baseline value. 6MWD was measured by a 6 minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a subject can walk in a period of 6 minutes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Six Minutes Walk Distance (6MWD) at Week 24/Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24/Withdrawal</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 24/Withdrawal value minus the basline value. 6MWD was measured by a 6 minute walk test. This test measures the distance that a subject can walk in a period of 6 minutes. Imputation technique was last observation carried forward.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Borg Dyspnea Index (BDI) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The BDI was calculated by using a 10-point scale (0 = None, 10 = Maximum). Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 and 24 values minus the baseline values. The BDI indicates the degree of breathlessness after completion of the 6 minute walk test. The BDI scale was assessed by each participant. Imputation technique was last observation carried forward.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With a Change From Baseline in Their World Health Organization (WHO) Functional Classification (FC) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>There are four grades for WHO FC (class I = none, Class IV = most severe). The WHO FC indicates the severity of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and is an adaptation of the New York Heart Association classification. It was assessed by the investigator. Imputation technique was last observation carried forward.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With the Indicated Event, as an Assessment of Time to Clinical Worsening of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) at Week 24, Assessed as the First Occurrence of a Particular Event</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Time to clinical worsening is defined as the time from baseline to the first occurrence of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for PAH treatment, atrial septostomy, or study discontinuation due to change to other PAH treatment. Time to clinical worsening is measured as the number of participants who experienced these events during 24 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>mPAP and mRAP are measures of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 and 24 values minus the baseline value. Observed data analysis (no imputation techniques).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Cardiac Index (CI) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>CI is a measure of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 and 24 values minus the baseline value. Observed data analysis (no imputation techniques).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Cardiac Output (CO) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>CO is a measure of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 and 24 values minus the baseline value. Observed data analysis (no imputation techniques).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>PVR is a measure of cardiopulmonary hemodynamics. Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 and 24 values minus the baseline value. Observed data analysis (no imputation techniques).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Values at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 12 and 24 values minus the baseline value. BNP is a surrogate maker of heart failure and was measured by a central laboratory. Observed data analysis (no imputation techniques).</description>
