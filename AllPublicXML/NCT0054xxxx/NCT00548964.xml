  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As of May 21st, 2012, the purpose of this study is to test the antidepressant effect of
      ketamine when given repeatedly over a period of 1 week, as well as the use of Lithium as a
      relapse-prevention strategy for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who
      respond to an initial series of ketamine infusions. Ketamine is a Food and Drug
      Administration approved anesthetic (a drug used to produce loss of consciousness before and
      during surgery). Ketamine is not approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder and
      is considered experimental in this study.

             negative serum B-HCG at screening and at pre-infusion;

          -  Participants must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression without psychotic
             features, based on clinical assessment by a study psychiatrist and confirmed by a
             structured diagnostic interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV TR Axis
             I Disorders, Patient Edition (SCID-P);

          -  Participants must have a history of at least one previous episode of depression prior
             to the current episode (recurrent MDD) or have chronic MDD (of at least two years'
             duration);

          -  Participants have not responded to two or more adequate trials of an antidepressant as
             determined by Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) criteria (score &gt;=3);

          -  Participant scores on the IDS-C30 must be greater than or equal to 32;

          -  Current major depressive episode is of at least 4 weeks duration;

          -  Each participant must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all tests
             and examinations required by the protocol and must sign an informed consent document;

          -  Each participant must be able to identify a family member, physician, or friend who
             will participate in the Treatment Contract.
