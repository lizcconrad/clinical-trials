    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the tolerability of nebivolol to metoprolol ER in a
      populatoin of patients with mild to moderate hypertension also receiving hydrochlorothiazide
      (HCTZ)

      This study is an 18-week study to evaluate the tolerability of nebivolol compared to
      metoprolol ER in outpatients with mild to moderate hypertension taking HCTZ. It is a
      multi-center, randomized, double blind (DB), active-control, parallel-group study, starting
      with a 4-week HCTZ run-in phase, followed by a 12-week DB treatment phase. Patients meeting
      the entry criteria at the end of run-in are randomized to one of two treatment groups,
      nebivolol or metoprolol ER. Uptitration of dose of study drug will occur if needed during the
      first 4 weeks of the DB phase, after which there is an 8-week stable-dose period of
      treatment. A 2-week double-blind withdrawal phase follows, during which tapering off study
      drug occurs.
