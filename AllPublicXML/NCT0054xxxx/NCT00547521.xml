DAS28-CRP: continuous variable which is a composite of 4 variables:number of tender joints out of 28, number of swollen joints out of 28, C-reactive protein (CRP) in mg/L and self assessment of disease activity measure on a VAS of 100mm. DAS 28 = 0.56 * sqrt(tender28) + 0.28 * sqrt(swollen28) + 0.36 * ln(CRP+1) + 0.014 * VAS + 0.96. HAQ-DI includes 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score sums worst scores in each domain and divides by the number of domains answered. Baseline was Day 1 of Short Term Study. Day 113 was the last day of the Short Term Study.</description>

          <title>SC Abatacept Cohort</title>
          <description>In the ST period, participants in this cohort were administered monotherapy, a dose of 125 mg abatacept SC, once weekly, for 4 months. Participants did not receive MTX at screening ie, MTX naive, or discontinued MTX due to lack of efficacy or tolerability at least 4 weeks prior to first injection of SC abatacept. During the LTE, all eligible participants continued to self-administer abatacept (125 mg SC) on a weekly basis with or without background MTX. During the LTE period, adjustments to RA medications (other than prohibited therapies), including MTX, were permitted at the investigator’s discretion based upon the participant’s clinical status. Consideration was given to decreasing corticosteroids and MTX in the presence of improvement in the participant’s clinical condition. LTE period pooled all participants into 1 arm. Participation in the LTE continued until the abatacept SC formulation was commercially available in the country or until the study was terminated by the sponsor.</description>

The questionnaire includes 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score is calculated by summing worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered.</description>

For anti-abatacept antibody ELISA, a sample was considered seropositive if it had a titer of 400 or greater and if immunodepletion was observed. The responses that were negative in initial screen were reported as seronegative with a value of &lt; 400. A sample was considered positive in CTLA4-T antibody ELISA if it had a titer of 25 or greater and if immunodepletion was observed. The responses that were negative in initial screen were reported as seronegative with a value of &lt; 25.</description>
          <population>Treated participants in the ST period who were evaluable for anti-abatacept or anti-CTLA4-T responses. n = those participants who were evaluated for this measure at each timepoint, for each group respectively.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Positive Anti-abatacept Responses to Abatacept (Meso-Scale Discovery [MSD] Electrochemiluminescence [ECL] Assay Method) Over Time During the ST Study</title>
        <description>The ECL (MSD) assay method is a validated, sensitive assay technique used to analyze presence of abatacept-specific antibodies in serum. It is more sensitive and has a higher drug tolerance than ELISA method. For the anti-abatacept antibody ECL (MSD) assay, a sample was considered seropositive if it had a titer of 10 or greater and if immunodepletion was observed with abatacept, or abatacept and CTLA4-T. Those responses that were not positive in the initial screen or were not confirmed to be positive based on immunodepletion were reported as seronegative and were assigned a value of &lt; 10.</description>

        <description>ELISA is a validated, sensitive assay technique used to analyze presence of abatacept-specific antibodies in serum. For anti-abatacept antibody ELISA, a sample was considered seropositive if it had a titer of 400 or greater and if immunodepletion was observed. The responses that were negative in initial screen were reported as seronegative with a value of &lt; 400. A sample was considered positive in CTLA4-T antibody ELISA if it had a titer of 25 or greater and if immunodepletion was observed. The responses that were negative in initial screen were reported as seronegative with a value of &lt; 25.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI takes into account participant’s use of aids or devices or assistance in scoring algorithm for a disability category. The questionnaire includes 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score is calculated by summing worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered.</description>

The questionnaire includes 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score is calculated by summing worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered.</description>
          <population>All treated participants included those participants who received at least 1 dose of the study medication (abatacept) in the ST period. n is the number of participants with baseline and post-baseline values.</population>

        <description>The Meso-Scale Discovery (MSD) electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay method is a validated, sensitive assay technique used to analyze presence of abatacept-specific antibodies in serum. It is more sensitive and has a higher drug tolerance than ELISA method. For the anti-abatacept antibody ECL (MSD) assay, a sample was considered seropositive if it had a titer of 10 or greater and if immunodepletion was observed with abatacept, or abatacept and CTLA4-T. Those responses that were not positive in the initial screen or were not confirmed to be positive based on immunodepletion were reported as seronegative and were assigned a value of &lt; 10. Antibody responses included CTLA4 and possibly immune globulin (IG), IG and/or junction region.</description>

During the LTE Study, adjustments to RA medications (other than prohibited therapies), including MTX, were permitted at the investigator’s discretion based upon the participant’s clinical status. Consideration was given to decreasing corticosteroids and MTX in the presence of improvement in the participant’s clinical condition.

        <description>DAS28-CRP is a continuous variable which is a composite of 4 variables: the number of tender joints out of 28, the number of swollen joints out of 28, C-reactive protein (CRP) in milligrams/Liter (mg/L) and subject assessment of disease activity measure on a VAS of 100mm. DAS 28 = 0.56 * sqrt(tender28) + 0.28 * sqrt(swollen28) + 0.36 * ln(CRP+1) + 0.014 * VAS + 0.96. Baseline was Day 1 of the ST Study; Day 113 was the end of the ST Study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI in the LTE Study - All Treated Participants in LTE Study</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI takes into account participant’s use of aids or devices or assistance in scoring algorithm for a disability category. The questionnaire includes 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score is calculated by summing worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered. Baseline was Day 1 in the ST Study and Day 113 was the last day of the ST Study.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI in the LTE Study - All Treated Participants in LTE Study</title>
          <description>HAQ-DI takes into account participant’s use of aids or devices or assistance in scoring algorithm for a disability category. The questionnaire includes 20 questions assessing physical function in 8 domains: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. The questions are evaluated on a 4-point scale: 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty and 3 = unable to do. Higher scores indicate greater dysfunction. The score is calculated by summing worst scores in each domain and dividing by the number of domains answered. Baseline was Day 1 in the ST Study and Day 113 was the last day of the ST Study.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With MAs in Urinalysis During the LTE Period: Protein, Glucose, Blood, Leukocyte Esterase, Red Blood Cells (RBC) and White Blood Cells (WBC) - All Treated Participants in LTE Study</title>
        <description>MAs are laboratory measurements marked as abnormal, per pre-defined study criteria, at any study time point. The following definitions specify the criteria for MAs in urinalysis: protein, glucose, blood, leukocyte esterase, RBC, WBC: &gt;= 2+ (or, if value &gt;= 4, or if pre-Rx value = 0 or 0.5, then &gt;= 2x or if pre-Rx value =1, then &gt;= 3, or if pre-Rx = 2 or 3, then &gt;= 4).</description>

            <description>During the LTE Study, all eligible participants continued to self-administer abatacept (125 mg SC) on a weekly basis with or without background MTX. During the LTE Study, adjustments to RA medications (other than prohibited therapies), including MTX, were permitted at the investigator’s discretion based upon the participant’s clinical status. Consideration was given to decreasing corticosteroids and MTX in the presence of improvement in the participant’s clinical condition.</description>
