    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical cure rates of two dosing regimens of
      iclaprim with vancomycin (every 12 hours [q12h]) in the treatment of patients with
      hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or
      health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP) suspected or confirmed to be due to Gram-positive
      pathogens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected or confirmed acute bacterial pneumonia due to Gram-positive pathogens in one
             of the following subgroups:

               -  hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), i.e., pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more
                  after admission, which was not incubating at the time of admission; or

               -  ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), i.e., pneumonia that arises more than 48
                  hours after endotracheal intubation; or

               -  health-care-associated pneumonia (HCAP), i.e., pneumonia diagnosed within 48
                  hours of hospital admission, in a patient who fulfills at least one of the
                  following criteria:

                    1. hospitalization for at least two days within 90 days of the current
                       infection,

                    2. residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility,

                    3. recipient of intravenous antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, or wound care
                       within 30 days of the current infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Enquiry (APACHE) II score &lt; 8 or â‰¥ 25.

          -  Pneumonia not requiring empiric or targeted treatment effective against Gram-positive
             pathogens.

          -  Pulmonary infection due to Gram-positive organisms known to be resistant to either
             study medication prior to study entry.
