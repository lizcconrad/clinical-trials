    <textblock>
      Several studies have described the use of supplemental oxygen during exertion or activities
      of daily living (ambulatory oxygen) in study populations that have different characteristics.
      This report, based on specialized randomized controlled trials, characterizes ambulatory gas
      usage among patients with COPD who experience low oxygen levels during activities.
