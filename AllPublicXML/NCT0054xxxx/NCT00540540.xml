  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately twelve percent of the women in the United States will develop breast cancer,
      the most common form of cancer affecting women, with 183,000 new cases projected for 1995.
      Despite the increasing incidence, the age-adjusted death rate from carcinoma has remained
      relatively stable. Although the reason for this has not yet been demonstrated, this stability
      may be a direct consequence of early detection and improved therapy. Screening mammography as
      an early detection technique has been shown to reduce mortality by 23%. Mammographic
      abnormalities that go on to biopsy show 24% being positive for malignancy with great
      variability (6-75%). Breast biopsy is an expensive procedure with the risks of anesthesia and
      surgery which may be obviated by more specific non-invasive testing.

      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging a new method for quantitative characterization of the
      optical properties of tissues. The diagnostic tools utilize anomalies in the transmission of
      diffusing near infra-red light for the rapid detection of oxygenated and deoxygenated
      hemoglobin, near infra-red absorbing drug levels, blood volume changes, and scattering
      properties in tissues.

      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopic Imaging measurements of breast tissue optical properties probe
      is similar in shape to an ultrasound probe. The imaging can measurements on different areas
      of the breast including diseased location and normal area. Optical measurements can guided by
      co-registered ultrasound measurements for the purpose of determining lesion size and
      location. Each measurement will require about 5-60 seconds to record the data and calculate
      optical properties. The process will be repeated until an adequate number of measurements are
      performed and measurements take 30 to 90 minutes.

      The researcher can determine that breast optical properties on demographic information, such
      as age and menopausal status as well as medical history.
