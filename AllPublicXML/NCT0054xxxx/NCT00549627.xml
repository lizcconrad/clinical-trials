    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the relative effectiveness of the PediGuardTM , a device
      manufactured by SpineVision, Inc, for placement of a pedicle screw pilot (drill) hole and for
      reducing pedicle screw breaches during thoracic and lumbar pedicle screw fixation of the
      spine.

      Hypothesis #1 The PediGuardTM will be more accurate for pedicle screw placement as compared
      to other standard manual techniques of similar size of pedicle screw insertion. At least 90%
      of screws placed with the PediGuardTM will be positioned correctly in the pedicle (defined as
      less than 2 mm breach by CT scan). In contrast, only 80% of screws using manual placement
      will be positioned correctly in the pedicle.

      Hypothesis #2 The PediGuardTM will not be inferior to fluoroscopic techniques for pedicle
      screw insertion. Both techniques will achieve at least 90% accuracy in the placement of
      pedicle screws.
