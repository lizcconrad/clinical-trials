  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying patients with diabetes who under proper medical care and administer an
      approved drug. Our interest is if this drug has any sideeffect on vision and if this drug may
      cause swelling of the retina.

    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety of pioglitazone treatment for diabetes. Recent reports suggest that
      oral glitazone treatment may cause or exacerbate retinal edema. We hypothesized that
      glitazone treatment may cause subclinical edema evidenced by increased retinal thickness. We
      will conduct a double-masked, prospective safety study of 19 subjects undergoing
      placebo-controlled treatment with pioglitazone. Patient treatment consisted of either insulin
      with placebo or insulin with pioglitazone. The main outcome measures are ETDRS visual acuity
      and retinal thickness measured with optical coherence tomography.

        Male or female patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy, 30-75 years of
        age with Hgb 1c values between 7.5 - 10% and a BMI of &lt; 40kg/m2. Patients were enrolled if
        they have been on a stable anti-hypertensive and lipid regimen for 90 days prior to study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy, 30-75 years
             of age with Hgb 1c values between 7.5 - 10% and a BMI of &lt; 40kg/m2.

          -  Patients were enrolled if they have been on a stable anti-hypertensive and lipid
             regimen for 90 days prior to study randomization.

          -  Patients must have had the ability to understand the requirements of the study,
             provide written consent and agree to abide by study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with sulfonylurea, or metformin within 21 days before study entry,
             prior treatment with NSAIDs, or diuretics within 21 days of screening, serum
             creatinine levels above 1.5 mg/dl for males or above 1.4 for females or creatinine
             clearance less than 70 ml/min by Cockcroft and Gault, or serum albumin levels of less
             than 2.5 gm/dl.

          -  Other exclusion criteria were elevated hepatic enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase or
             alanine aminotransferase more than 2.5 times upper limit of normal) or uncontrolled or
             untreated significant pulmonary, neurological condition, or cardiovascular disease,
             including hypertension, congestive heart failure (specifically New York Heart
             Association Type III or IV patients), angina, peripheral vascular disease, or greater
             than +1 peripheral edema.

          -  Furthermore, any patients with any condition that would jeopardize their safety or
             affect the validity of the trial results were excluded from this study.
