      The purpose of this study is to estimate the direct costs associated with switching, in
      either direction, between a rapid-acting analog therapy and short-acting human insulin
      therapy within the first year following the switch. The additional goals are: 1)to assess the
      impact of a switch from or to a rapid-acting analog insulin therapy on patient treatment
      satisfaction, 2) to assess the impact of a switch from or to a rapid-acting analog insulin
      therapy on patient quality of life, 3) to assess the impact of switch from or to the
      rapid-acting analog insulin therapy on the quality of metabolic control and, 4) to estimate
      the total costs (direct and indirect) associated with switching, in either direction between
      rapid-acting analog and short-acting human insulin within the first year following the
      switch.
