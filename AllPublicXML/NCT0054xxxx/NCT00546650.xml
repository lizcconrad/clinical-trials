      The primary objective is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NP101 with the currently
      approved oral, injection and nasal spray formulations of Imitrex® in healthy volunteers and
      to assess the bioavailability relative to the 6 mg subcutaneous injection.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of NP101 in healthy volunteers.
