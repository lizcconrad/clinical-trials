            <groups_desc>The null hypothesis was that the mean change from Baseline in 24-hour micturition-related urgency was the same at Week 12 for the two treatment groups: fesoterodine + alpha-blocker vs. placebo + alpha-blocker. It was estimated that 900 randomized subjects would have 85% power to detect a mean difference of -0.93(SD = 4.15) between the 2 treatments on the primary endpoint,mean reduction of micturition-related urgency episodes/24hr from Baseline to Week 12,assuming a 10% non-evaluability rate.</groups_desc>

        <description>Nocturnal micturitions were defined as micturitions with USS rating 1-5 that occurred between the time the subject went to bed and the time he or she arose to start the next day. USS rating: 1. No feeling of urgency, 2. Mild feeling of urgency, 3. Moderate feeling of urgency, 4. Severe feeling of urgency, 5. Unable to hold; leak urine. The mean number of nocturnal micturitions per 24 hours was calculated as the total number of nocturnal micturitions divided by the total number of diary days collected at that visit.</description>

        <description>PPBC: self-administered, single-item, validated questionnaire. Rated on a 6â€“point scale: subject was asked: â€œWhich of the following statements describes your bladder condition best at the moment?&quot; 1=no problems at all; 2=some very minor problems; 3=some minor problems; 4=some moderate problems; 5=severe problems; 6=many severe problems. A post-baseline vs baseline variable with ordinal values was derived: 1=Deterioration=Difference in scores was positive; 2=No Change=Difference in scores was 0; 3=Minor Improvement=Difference in scores was -1; 4=Major Improvement=Difference in scores was â‰¤ 2.</description>

          <description>PPBC: self-administered, single-item, validated questionnaire. Rated on a 6â€“point scale: subject was asked: â€œWhich of the following statements describes your bladder condition best at the moment?&quot; 1=no problems at all; 2=some very minor problems; 3=some minor problems; 4=some moderate problems; 5=severe problems; 6=many severe problems. A post-baseline vs baseline variable with ordinal values was derived: 1=Deterioration=Difference in scores was positive; 2=No Change=Difference in scores was 0; 3=Minor Improvement=Difference in scores was -1; 4=Major Improvement=Difference in scores was â‰¤ 2.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Per 24 Hours at Week 4 and 12</title>
        <description>OAB-q is a self-administered, 33-item, validated questionnaire that assesses how much the subject has been bothered by selected bladder symptoms during the previous week. Each item rated by subject on Likert scale 1 (least symptom bother) to 6 (most symptom bother). Raw scores were transformed to a score from 0-100. Once transformed, higher scores represent less favorable outcome.</description>
