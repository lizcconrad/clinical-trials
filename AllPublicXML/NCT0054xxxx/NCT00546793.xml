  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing schedule of
      veltuzumab can be established in NHL or CLL patients and to confirm the safety and efficacy
      of veltuzumab that was previously established when administered intravenously.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first study of veltuzumab given IV weekly in NHL patients (IM-T-hA20-01) has shown
      excellent tolerability and even efficacy at weekly intravenous doses as low as 80-120 mg/m2
      over 4 consecutive weeks. These clinical results confirm experiments laboratory studies.
      Laboratory studies using Veltuzumab administered subcutaneously showed potent activity based
      on B-cell depletion. The current study's goal is to determine if a subcutaneous (SC) dosing
      schedule of veltuzumab can be established in patients with NHL or CLL
