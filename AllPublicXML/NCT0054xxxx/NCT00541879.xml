  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes and obesity in children continue to increase at alarming rates with
      devastating results. However, both these metabolic diseases are largely preventable through
      adoption of a healthy lifestyle, an understanding of what happens to food in the body, energy
      balance and some simple aspects of glucose regulation. Can elementary school children be
      taught the knowledge and skills necessary to prevent type 2 diabetes and obesity? Children
      need to learn this essential knowledge and practice these important health behavior skills.
      Elementary school may be an ideal place to master this subject that is a direct and logical
      extension of current health curricula including nutrition and physical activity blended with
      science and math.

      Biomedical scientists lead a classroom series of interactive, inquiry-based science and
      health explorations directed at type 2 diabetes, obesity and their prevention in three
      elementary schools serving children at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Diabetes knowledge was
      measured in children and parents at the beginning, end and 9 months after the end of the
      intervention using validated questionnaires.
