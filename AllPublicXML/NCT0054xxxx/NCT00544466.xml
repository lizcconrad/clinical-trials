      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine phosphate and melphalan, and HT
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop
      the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving HT
      together with fludarabine phosphate and melphalan before a transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies helical tomotherapy (HT), fludarabine phosphate, and
      melphalan followed by donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with hematologic
      malignancies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the feasibility in terms of toxicity and safety of HT in
      combination with Fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) and Melphalan as a preparative regimen
      for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with Hematological Malignancies: acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes
      (MDS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate within the confines of this pilot study, incidence of
      neutrophil and platelet engraftment, survival on day +180, the overall survival, and disease
      free survival in patients with Hematological Malignancies: ALL, AML, and MDS.

      II. To evaluate incidence of primary and secondary engraftment failure, incidence of relapse,
      incidence of acute and chronic transplant related complications, including veno-occlusive
      disease of the liver (VOD), organ toxicity, secondary malignancies, including
      treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease
      (GVHD), as well as post-transplant chimerism.

      OUTLINE: PREPARATIVE REGIMEN*: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on
      days -7 to -3 and melphalan IV on day -2. Patients also undergo HT twice daily on days -7 to
      -4.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on day
      0. NOTE: *Treatment begins 2 days earlier in patients receive tacrolimus and/or sirolimus for
      GVHD prophylaxis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years.
