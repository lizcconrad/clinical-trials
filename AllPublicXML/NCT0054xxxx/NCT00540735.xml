  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unresectable type III or IV cholangiocarcinoma has a very bad prognosis; survival median
      ranges between 6 and 9 months.

      Survival depends on biliary drainage quality, obtained by plastic or metallic prothesis
      setting up in one or several hepatic segments.

      Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy didn't prove yet their efficiency on survival. In France,
      gemcitabin is recommended by the French Digestive Oncology Federation in metastatic tumours,
      in monotherapy or associated with cisplatin or oxaliplatin (Gemox) for patients in good
      general condition.

      Photodynamic therapy has shown in 3 prospective studies - one randomized - with small patient
      series, a significative efficiency on survival and quality of life of treated patients, in
      comparison with historical series, or patients' groups whose biliary drainage was in most
      cases unefficient.

      A new randomized study, including patients whose biliary drainage is efficient and comparing
      their becoming when they are treated by PDT in addition to current practice, or only by
      current practice, seems to be justified.

      The principal objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of PDT with Photofrin® on
      patients with unresectable type III or IV cholangiocarcinoma.
