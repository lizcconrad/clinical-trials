             target lesion according to RECIST;

          4. Has previously received treatment with 5-FU, alone or in combination with other
             anti-tumor medications (except as in exclusion #1 below); Prior treatment with

             treatment with 5-FU;

          6. Has a life expectancy of &gt; 3 months;

          7. Has adequate bone marrow reserve as evidenced by:

               1. ANC ≥ 1,500/μL

               2. PLT ≥ 100,000/μL

               3. HGB ≥ 9 g/dl;

          8. Has adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5X the upper limit of
             normal (ULN) for the reference lab;

          9. Has adequate hepatic function as evidenced by:

               1. Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.0 mg/dL

               2. AST ≤ 3X ULN for the reference lab (≤ 5X ULN for patients with known hepatic
                  metastases)

               3. ALT ≤ 3X ULN for the reference lab (≤ 5X ULN for patients with known hepatic
                  metastases);

         10. Has discontinued any CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (such as phenytoin,
             phenobarbital or carbamazepine) and antimicrobials (such as refampin and rifabutin),
             St. John's Wort, and ketoconasole at least two weeks prior to Day 1

         11. Has recovered from the effects of any prior surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy;

          1. Has previously received treatment with cetuximab or irinotecan;

          2. Has a known hypersensitivity to cetuximab, murine proteins, or any component of
             cetuximab;

          3. Has a hereditary fructose intolerance;

          4. Has a known hypersensitivity to baker's yeast, or has an active yeast infection;

          5. Has had previous exposure to Betafectin® or Imprime PGG;

          6. Has received previous radiation therapy to &gt;30% of active bone marrow;

          7. Has a fever of &gt;38.5º C within 3 days prior to initial dosing;

          8. Has known or suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases;

          9. Had a second malignancy within the previous 5 years, except for basal cell carcinoma,

             of &lt; 2.0 ng/mL;

         10. Has known HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, connective tissue or autoimmune disease,
             or other clinical diagnosis, ongoing or intercurrent illness that in the

             therapy within a period of 30 days prior to the first scheduled day of dosing
             (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no
             regulatory-authority-approved indication); or

         13. Has previously received an organ or progenitor/stem cell transplant.
