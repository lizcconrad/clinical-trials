  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GenasenseÂ® is currently administered to subjects in clinical studies as a multiple-day
      continuous intravenous infusion. Subjects are treated on an outpatient basis and carry a pump
      that delivers the drug through a peripheral or central intravenous line. The route of
      administration limits the convenience of treatment, and catheter-related complications have
      been reported. This study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of G3139
      administered by subcutaneuous injection.

             history of brain metastasis will be eligible if there is no evidence of cerebral edema
             or treatment with steroids.

          -  Adequate organ function as determined &lt; 7 days prior to starting study medication

          -  History of leptomeningeal disease

          -  Coexisting condition that would require the subject to continue therapy during the
             treatment phase of the study with a drug known to alter renal function.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 3 weeks prior to starting study medication
