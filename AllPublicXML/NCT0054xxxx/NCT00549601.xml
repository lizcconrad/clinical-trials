  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study used two doses of rivastigmine transdermal patch (5 cm^2, 10 cm^2) to establish
      the feasibility of 2 switch schedules (with transdermal patch one-step dose titration or
      without dose titration) from rivastigmine capsules (3 mg bid (bis in die, twice a day), 4,5
      mg bid, 6 mg bid) to rivastigmine transdermal patch and to assess safety, tolerability,
      convenience, and caregivers preferences of rivastigmine transdermal patch versus capsules.

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Who Had a Gastrointestinal Adverse Event (AE) at Any Time During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Gastrointestinal adverse events (including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) were coded using the medical dictionary MedDRA v11.0 and the number of patients who suffered an AE were described by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With an AE Involving the Skin (Local Tolerance) Recorded Over the Course of the Study Period (Patch Groups Only)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events involving the skin included urticaria, pruritus, erythema, and pigmentation disorder. Only the groups administered rivastigmine transdermally via patch were analyzed. The adverse events were coded using the medical dictionary MedDRA v11.0 and the number of patients who suffered an AE were described by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With at Least 1 AE of Any Kind Recorded During the Period of the Study.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were coded using the medical dictionary MedDRA v11.0 and the number of patients who suffered an AE were described by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT). They were also tabulated by severity, relationship with study treatment, and action taken.</description>

    <measure>Overall Caregiver Satisfaction With Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At end of study (Month 3)</time_frame>
    <description>Caregivers were asked to rate their overall degree of satisfaction with the Alzheimer's disease treatment on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 &quot;Very good&quot; - 5 &quot;Very poor&quot;) at the end of the study (Month 3). A higher score indicates less satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Overall Patient Satisfaction With Treatment</measure>

    <description>Patients were asked to rate their overall degree of satisfaction with the Alzheimer's disease treatment on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 &quot;Very good&quot; - 5 &quot;Very poor&quot;) at the end of the study (Month 3). A higher score indicates less satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score From Baseline to Month 1 and Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 1 and Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate the patient's cognitive status and how it progressed over time. The 35-point version used in this study was made up of five sections: orientation, fixation, attention and calculation, memory and language, and constructional praxis. The total score for each patient was obtained by adding the score from each of the above sections. The individual receives 1 point for each correct answer. The total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meet DSM-IV (Diagnostic &amp; Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version IV) criteria
             for dementia of Alzheimer type and NINCDS-ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological
             and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related
             Disorders Association) criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), have a MMSE
             (Mini Mental State Examination) score &gt; 10 and &lt; 26

          -  Have received continuous treatment with rivastigmine capsules at least with 3 mg bid
             (6 mg of total daily dose) for at least 3 months before entering in the study

          -  Cooperative, willing to complete all aspects of the study, and capable of doing so,
             either alone or with the aid of a responsible caregiver

          -  Have a primary caregiver willing to accept responsibility for supervising the
             treatment, (eg, application and removal of the patch daily at approximately the same
             time of day) and assessing the condition of the patient throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A medical or neurological condition other that AD that could explain the patients
             dementia (eg, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's Disease, abnormal thyroid function
             test, B12 or folate deficiency, post-traumatic conditions, syphilis)

          -  Current diagnosis of an active skin lesion/disorder that would prevent accurate
             assessment of the adhesion and potential skin irritation of the patch (e.g., atopic
             dermatitis, wounded or scratched skin in the area of the patch application)

          -  History of allergy to topical products containing vitamin E

          -  Taken any of the following substances prior to randomization:

               -  succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during the previous 2 weeks

               -  an investigational drug during the previous 4 weeks

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to the study.

        <title>Change in the Total Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score From Baseline to Month 1 and Month 3</title>
        <description>The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to evaluate the patient's cognitive status and how it progressed over time. The 35-point version used in this study was made up of five sections: orientation, fixation, attention and calculation, memory and language, and constructional praxis. The total score for each patient was obtained by adding the score from each of the above sections. The individual receives 1 point for each correct answer. The total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>
