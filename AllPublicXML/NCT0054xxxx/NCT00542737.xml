  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a severe lung condition
      that causes respiratory failure. Individuals with ALI/ARDS often require the use of a
      respirator or artificial breathing machine, known as a mechanical ventilator, while in an
      intensive care unit (ICU). Research has shown that lung protective ventilation (LPV), a type
      of mechanical ventilation technique, is an effective way to reduce the number of deaths due
      to ALI/ARDS. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a Web-based educational program
      that aims to educate ICU clinicians about the use of LPV in patients with ALI/ARDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALI/ARDS is a life-threatening condition that involves inflammation of the lungs and fluid
      accumulation in the air sacs, leading to low blood oxygen levels and respiratory failure.
      Common causes include pneumonia, septic shock, and lung trauma, and most patients require
      immediate care in an ICU. The main form of treatment for ALI/ARDS is the delivery of oxygen
      and a continuous level of pressure to the damaged lungs through mechanical ventilation. Each
      year, 74,500 people die due to ALI/ARDS and 22% of these deaths could be prevented with the
      use of LPV. LPV is a mechanical ventilation technique in which lower volumes of oxygen are
      administered. The purpose of this study is to implement and evaluate a Web-based educational
      program that will provide educational and instructional resources about ALI/ARDS and LPV to
      ICU clinicians, including physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists.

      Hospitals participating in this study will be randomly assigned to access the Web site at
      either the beginning of the study period or a later time. Participating clinicians at each
      hospital will access the Web site as often as necessary for a 6-month period. The Web site
      will contain background and educational information on ALI/ARDS and LPV, including how to
      recognize ALI/ARDS and how to implement LPV in patients. Scholarly articles and other
      materials, including a chart to help clinicians determine appropriate ventilator settings for
      each patient, will be available to download. Clinicians will also be able to email questions
      to critical care experts. At the end of the 6-month study period, study staff will compare
      the number of patients receiving LPV to the number of patients who received LPV prior to the
      start of the study.
