  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate if patients who have had a stroke and suffer from spasticity
      might benefit from being given BOTOX® in addition to the normal Standard Care. Spasticity is
      characterized by stiffness or frequent cramps accompanied by pain and abnormal movements and
      can prevent the carrying out of everyday tasks such as walking and getting dressed. BOTOX® is
      a neurotoxin, which is used to prevent the contraction of muscle fibre and has been shown to
      reduce spasticity significantly. Patients will be enrolled in this study at about 33
      locations in Europe and Canada. Study participation will last for about 1 year.

          <description>Physician assessment of success, as determined by percentage of patients who achieve their principal active functional goal (i.e. a score of 0 to +2 inclusive on the goal attainment scale [GAS]) at week 24 (or 10 weeks post second injection). The GAS is a 6-point scale where -3 means function is worse than at start, 0 means the expected goal was attained, and +2 is much better function than expected.</description>

        <title>Activities of Daily Living Quality of Life (QOL) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>Activities of daily living QOL score at week 24 (or 10 weeks post second injection) as measured by SF-12 Physical Component (PCS-12). The SF-12 consists of 12 questions on various health questions. The PCS-12 is a sub-score calculated from the SF-12 total score based on the physical health questions where 0 is worse and 100 is best. A higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
