      To develop a biotechnological assay which will be able to recognize germ cells of the
      spermatogenic lineand and to identify the chromosomal and morphological structure of mature
      and immature male germ cells, in cases of of sperm production disorders(azoospermic
      patients).

      To recognize IL-18 in testicular tissue of azoospermic men compared to control group as it
      has been suggested that this cytokine may serve as a paracrine defense factor in the male
      gonad associated to spermatogenesis.

      A new biotechnological assay was developed by adapting an existing computerized system which
      scans cell morphology and chromosomal ploidy in the same cell of hematologic line using
      digital technology, to recognize germ cells of the testis by their morphology and
      cytogenetics. Testicular tissues which obtained from 15 men were enzymatically digested and
      the cells received were fixed on slides. The cells were stained by Giemsa May Grinwald
      staining and scanned automatically in a bright field for cell morphology. Fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH) using centromeric probes for chromosomes X, Y and 18 was performed
      on the same slide after destaining. The cells were automatically scanned and classified
      according to the ploidy of the chromosome signals. The presence of IL-18 in the same men's
      testis was examined parallelly, by immunohistochimical staining using specific antibody for
      human IL-18.
