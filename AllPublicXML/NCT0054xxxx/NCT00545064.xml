        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patient with newly diagnosed and untreated for open-angle glaucoma or ocular
             hypertension with an Intra-ocular Pressure (IOP) of &gt; 27 mm Hg (in at least one eye)

             to affect the IOP, e.g. clonidine, corticosteroids, oral beta-blocking agents. patient
             on a non-glaucoma medication that contains a preservative agent, i.e. benzalkonium
             chloride, benzododecinium bromide or stabilized oxychloro complex

          -  Patient with hypersensitivity to any component of preservative free
