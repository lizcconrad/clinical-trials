      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid
      when given together with cisplatin and etoposide in treating patients with advanced solid
      tumors or extensive stage small cell lung cancer. R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid may stop the
      growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid
      together with combination chemotherapy may help kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      AT-101 (R-(-)-gossypol) when combined with cisplatin and etoposide in patients with advanced,
      refractory solid tumors and/or extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). In addition,
      to determine the MTD or RP2D of AT-101 when combined with cisplatin, etoposide, and Neulasta.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of AT-101 in combination with cisplatin and
      etoposide in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors and/or ES-SCLC. In addition,
      evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of AT-101 with cisplatin, etoposide, and Neulasta.

      III. To evaluate the antitumor activity of this combination per tumor measurements using the
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of AT-101 as a single agent and in combination with
      cisplatin and etoposide in plasma.

      II. To perform pharmacodynamic studies (genotyping of drug metabolizing enzymes, gene
      expression, and proteomics of drug-related pathways) on archived blood samples from patients
      treated with AT-101 in combination with cisplatin and etoposide.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of R-(-)-gossypol.

      Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol twice daily on days 1-3, cisplatin intravenously (IV)
      over 60 minutes on day 1*, and etoposide IV over 30 minutes on days 1*-3. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 6 courses during the dose escalation and 4 courses in the expanded
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer cohort, in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected on day 1 of courses 1 and 2 for pharmacokinetic analysis,
      biomarker assays, and correlative studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      [Note: *Cisplatin and etoposide will be started on day 2 during course 1; they will be given
      on day 1 during all subsequent courses.]

             they have stable/improved lesions for at least 1 month following treatment, no
             neurological symptoms and not require corticosteroids; an magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) of the brain or computed tomography (CT) scan of the head must be performed at
             baseline if patient has a history of brain metastases

             collection and creatinine clearance can be measured if indicated

          -  The effects of AT-101 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and
             because other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women
             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration
             of study participation, and for at least one month following the last dose of AT-101;
             should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Patients should display the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a
             written informed consent document

          -  Female patients of child bearing potential must not be pregnant

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients without small cell lung cancer who have had chemotherapy, radiotherapy or
             hormonal therapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered (=&lt; grade 1) from clinically
             significant adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier; prior
             treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in combination with thoracic
             radiation therapy is allowed for patients with ES-SCLC provided that recurrence of the
             SCLC occurred more than 6 months from definitive therapy for limited-stage small cell
             lung cancer; no other prior chemotherapy is allowed for the patients with ES-SCLC

          -  Failure to recover fully (as judged by the investigator) from prior surgical
             procedures

          -  Concurrent treatment with an investigational agent other than the investigational
             agent(s) used in this study OR treatment within 4 weeks of study entry with any
             investigational agent(s) or device(s)

          -  Any prior use of racemic gossypol or AT-101

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to AT-101 or other agents used in study

          -  Requirement for routine use of hematopoietic growth factors (including granulocyte
             colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, or
             interleukin-11) or platelet transfusions to maintain absolute neutrophil counts or
             platelets counts above the required thresholds for study entry; if patient requires
             routine use of erythropoietin, eligibility at investigator discretion

          -  Any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take
             oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures
             affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their ability to
             swallow and retain AT-101 tablets

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel are excluded; subjects with
             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel
             obstruction are also excluded

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of AT-101 on the
             developing human fetus are unknown, but could potentially include teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AT-101,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AT-101; these
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             AT-101 or other agents used in this study; in addition, these patients are at
             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy;
             appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated
