      This study is an investigator-initiated study. The study will be performed as a prospective,
      randomized, controlled multi-center trial to evaluate the safety and efficiency of Xpert
      stents compared to PTA in patients with chronic distal artery occlusions or stenosis
      undergoing catheter revascularization. Patients will be eligible for randomization if they
      are over 18 years old, if they undergo percutaneous catheter revascularization of an artery
      below the knee stenosis/occlusion that is less than 15 centimeters in length. Up to two
      vessels may be treated in this study. All lesions greater than 50% in the below the knee
      artery region have to be treated either with PTA or stenting according to the randomization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Clinical:

        1. Age between 18 and 95 years. 2. Subject or subject's legal representative have been
        informed of the nature of the study, and have signed the patient informed consent form.
        Patient is willing to take part in the follow-up protocol of the XXS study.

        3. Rutherford stage 4 and 5 Anatomical:

          1. Additional lesions inflow lesions might be successfully treated before randomization
             and treatment of the target lesion. The inflow lesions which were treated before
             randomization should only be classified TASC A or B. (TASC= Trans Atlantic
             Intersociety Conference)

          2. Target vessel with documented run-off to the foot distally of the index lesion with
             patent plantar arteries

          3. Reference vessel diameter of the target lesion should be ≥ 2 and ≤ 5 mm.

          4. Maximum treated length in the target vessel is 15 cm (might also be divided up into
             multiple segments with up to 3 different lesions being treated).

          5. Maximum of treated vessels per leg below the knee: 2 (all treated vessels should be
             treated within the randomization to the study group [PTA or stenting]).

          6. Minimum distance target lesion to talus is 5 cm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical
