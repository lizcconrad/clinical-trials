    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine whether a standardized
      Pilates exercise program can effectively strengthen pelvic floor muscles when compared with
      conventional pelvic muscle rehabilitation.

      Urinary incontinence is a widespread problem that affects 10-40% of all ambulatory women and
      pelvic floor muscle training is an effective treatment for this problem. However, its
      efficacy is proportionate to the effort expended. Even among women who are diligent with
      pelvic muscle rehabilitation, long term follow-up reveals that benefits are lost in the
      absence of maintenance exercises.

      While this intervention is effective, recent studies demonstrate that long term adherence to
      treatment is low. As compliance appears to be a prerequisite to achieving sustained benefit,
      finding a method of pelvic muscle strengthening that better lends itself to long term
      commitment could prove beneficial.

      The currently popular exercise program, known as Pilates (named after founder, Joseph
      Pilates) consists of a series of low impact, flexibility and muscle toning exercises. The
      philosophy centers around developing core strength which includes strengthening the pelvic
      floor. Its use has been described in the US since the 1920s.4 Five million Americans
      currently participate, as opposed to five thousand ten years ago.5 Given its mainstream
      popularity, Pilates would be an appealing as a therapeutic modality for women experiencing
      pelvic muscle weakness. Currently, there are no studies that assess the efficacy of Pilates
      in increasing pelvic muscle strength.
