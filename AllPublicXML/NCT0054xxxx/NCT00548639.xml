  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a growing epidemic within the United States that disproportionately affects
      economically disadvantaged communities like East Harlem. As diabetic patients are at very
      high risk for heart disease, experts recommend an aggressive approach towards using statins
      in people with diabetes. However, statins and other helpful drugs are only effective if
      patients decide to take them. Adherence to this medication is notoriously poor and is
      aggravated by its required life-long use. This study is designed to test the effectiveness of
      a new decision aid in helping diverse, inner-city patients with diabetes understand the risks
      and benefits in taking statins and whether this enhanced decision making process improves
      their adherence to the medication.
