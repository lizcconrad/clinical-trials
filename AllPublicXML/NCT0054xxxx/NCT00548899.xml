      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in the
      neoadjuvant setting in patients with primary breast cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel (EC/P) is a well tolerated regimen with
      high clinical activity. Histopathological complete remission after preoperative chemotherapy
      has a direct correlation with the disease-free and overall survival. The aim of combining a
      chemotherapy regime with sorafenib in the neoadjuvant setting is to increase the locoregional
      and systemic outcome of these patients
