  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of TMC278
      given at a dose of 25 mg once daily versus efavirenz (EFV) at a dose of 600 mg once daily,
      when combined with a background regimen containing 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
      transcriptase inhibitors ( investigator choice of ABC/3TC, TDF/FTC or AZT/3TC) in HIV-1
      infected patients who have not yet taken any anti-HIV drugs. The following evaluations will
      be done: antiviral activity, immunologic changes, and viral geno-/phenotype evolution,
      relationship of Pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/Pharmacodynamics and Medical resource
      utilization and treatment adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs have been introduced
      sequentially for use in the clinic. Currently, patients are routinely being treated with 3 or
      4 drug combinations including nucleoside/tide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs/NtRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors
      (PIs), and/or fusion inhibitors. New potent antiretroviral (ARV) compounds that work in
      people whose HIV-1 virus is resistant to available drugs are urgently needed. This is a Phase
      III, randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the study
      physician nor the patient knows the name of the study assigned medication), double-dummy,
      active-controlled trial to compare the effectiveness, safety, and ability to tolerate TMC278
      versus efavirenz (EFV). The study will last for 104 weeks which includes a screening period
      of 4 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, followed by a 4 week follow-up period. Patients will
      be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to TMC278 or to efavirenz in combination with two
      other anti-HIV drugs of the class nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The
      hypothesis to be provided in this study is that the investigational drug TMC278 will perform
      just like efavirenz (EFV) in terms of antiviral effectiveness (i.e., suppressing of the
      plasma viral load to a level &lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA (ribonucleic acid) copies/mL, in ARV-naïve
      HIV-infected patients. During the trial, patients' health will be monitored by physical
      examination, interview to assess health and well being, and laboratory testing on blood and
      urine samples. Experimental Group: One tablet of TMC278 25 mg daily; plus efavirenz (EFV)
      placebo; plus 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors; Control Group: One
      tablet of Placebo daily that looks just like TMC278 plus EFV 600 mg daily plus 2
      nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors for 104 weeks.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load less than (&lt;) 50 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (ribonucleic acid [RNA]) copies/milliliter (ml) at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/ml after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/ml).</description>

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis is based on the last observed viral load (VL) data within the Week 48 window. Virologic response is defined as a VL&lt;50 copies/mL (observed case). Missing VL was considered as non-response. Virologic Failure includes subjects who had VL&gt;=50 copies/mL in the Wk 48 window, subjects who discontinued early due to lack or loss of efficacy, subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or lack or loss of efficacy and at the time of discontinuation had a VL&gt;=50 copies/mL and subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count was imputed in case of missing values: in case of premature discontinuation, data were imputed with the baseline value after discontinuation (i.e. change=0, Non-Completer [NC] = Failure); otherwise last observation carried forward was applied.</description>

    <description>Virologic failure for the resistance determinations was defined as lack of virologic response (never having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL) and plasma viral load increase of &gt;=0.5 log 10 copies/mL above nadir (i.e., never suppressed), or confirmed loss of virologic response (2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL; i.e., rebounder), or discontinued with a last observed on-treatment plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL. For this study, treatment-emergent reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance associated mutations (RAMs) occurring in at least 2 virologic failures (for at least one treatment group) for the following lists are presented: i) Extended list of Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI RAMs) ii) IAS-USA list of Nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI RAMs).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;50 Copies Per mL) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load less than (&lt;) 50 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (ribonucleic acid [RNA]) copies/milliliter (ml) at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/ml after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/ml).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;400 Copies Per mL) at Week 96</title>
          <description>Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load &lt; 400 HIV-1 (RNA) copies/mL at Week 96. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 400 copies/mL after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;400 copies/mL).</description>

        <description>Virologic failure for the resistance determinations was defined as lack of virologic response (never having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL) and plasma viral load increase of &gt;=0.5 log 10 copies/mL above nadir (i.e., never suppressed), or confirmed loss of virologic response (2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL; i.e., rebounder), or discontinued with a last observed on-treatment plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL. For this study, treatment-emergent reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance associated mutations (RAMs) occurring in at least 2 virologic failures (for at least one treatment group) for the following lists are presented: i) Extended list of Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI RAMs) ii) IAS-USA list of Nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI RAMs).</description>
