  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4 arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 4 neoadjuvant treatment regimens in
      female patients with locally advanced, inflammatory or early stage HER2 positive breast
      cancer. Before surgery, patients will be randomized to one of 4 treatment arms, to receive 4
      cycles of a)Herceptin + docetaxel b)Herceptin + docetaxel + pertuzumab c)Herceptin +
      pertuzumab or 4)pertuzumab + docetaxel. Pertuzumab will be administered at a loading dose of
      840mg iv, then 420mg iv 3-weekly, Herceptin at a loading dose of 8mg/kg iv then 6mg/kg
      3-weekly, and docetaxel at a dose of 75mg/m2 escalating to 100mg/m2 3-weekly. During the
      entire pre- and post-surgery period all patients will receive adequate chemotherapy as per
      standard of care, as well as any surgery and/or radiotherapy as required. The anticipated
      time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target sample size is 100-500 individuals.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from date of randomization to first documentation of PD or death. Any evidence of contralateral disease in-situ was not considered as PD. Participants who were withdrawn from study without documented progression and for whom evaluations were made, were censored at date of last assessment when the participant was known to be free from progressive disease.

      <recruitment_details>A total of 107, 107, 107, and 96 participants (total 417) were randomized to Arms Trastuzumab plus (+) Docetaxel (T+ D) , Trastuzumab+Pertuzumab+Docetaxel (T+Ptz+D), Trastuzumab+Pertuzumab (T+Ptz), and Pertuzumab+Docetaxel (Ptz+D), respectively and were included in intent-to-treat population (as randomized).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>3 participants did not receive correct treatment, as randomized, and 1 (in Arm Trastuzumab + Docetaxel) did not receive any treatment. Safety population (as treated) included 107, 107, 108, and 94 participants in Arms ‘T+D’, ‘T+Ptz+D’, ‘T+Ptz’, and ‘Ptz+D’, respectively. Participant flow was available for “As Treated” participants.</pre_assignment_details>

Adjuvant (2-Week Post-Operative) Treatment: Participants received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m^2 IV, epirubicin 90 mg/m^2 IV, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m^2 IV (FEC) on Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (Cycles 5−7).

        <description>Tumor assessments were made based upon the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria - version 1.0. The clinical response at each cycle up to the last assessment prior to surgery was derived for primary breast tumor using the following algorithm: CR: if measurement of ‘0’ is noted at a given cycle as compared to baseline measurement which is greater than (&gt;)0 at screening or cycle 1 Day 1; PR: if measurement is at least a 30 percent (%) decreased compared to baseline levels . (Reference= baseline size or sum of sizes); SD: if measurement at a given cycle is not sufficient shrinkage to qualify for neither PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD compared to baseline levels. PD: if lesion is at least a 20 % increase from measurements at baseline.</description>

Docetaxel IV infusion was administered at a starting dose of 75 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 followed by 100 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-4, if no dose limiting toxicity occurred.
Adjuvant (2-Week Post-Operative) Treatment: Participants received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by FEC on Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (Cycles 5−7). Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was continued every 3 weeks from Cycle 8 to Cycle 21.</description>

        <description>Tumor assessments were made based on the RECIST criteria - version 1.0 The overall response at each cycle up to the last assessment prior to surgery was derived for: i) the primary breast lesion; (ii) across secondary breast lesions, (iii) across all breast lesions (iv) across axillary nodes (v) across supraclavicular nodes and (vi) across all nodes (vii) across all lesions (overall) using the following algorithm: CR: if measurement of ‘0’ is noted at a given cycle as compared to baseline measurement which is &gt;0 at screening or cycle 1 day 1; PR: if measurement is at least a 30% decreased compared to baseline levels . (Reference= baseline size or sum of sizes); SD: if measurement at a given cycle is not sufficient shrinkage to qualify for neither PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD compared to baseline levels. PD: if lesion is at least a 20 % increase from measurements at baseline. Overall response is derived based on the sum total of breast tumors and all nodes examined.</description>

Docetaxel IV infusion was administered at a starting dose of 75 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycle 1 followed by 100 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-4, if no dose limiting toxicity occurred.
Adjuvant (2-Week Post-Operative) Treatment: Participants received trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV followed by FEC on Day 1 and every 3 weeks thereafter for three cycles (Cycles 5−7). Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg IV was continued every 3 weeks from Cycle 8 to Cycle 17.</description>

        <description>Time to clinical response was defined as the time from the date of first dose received to the date of assessment of clinical response. Time to Clinical response was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Tumor assessments were made based on the RECIST criteria - version 1.0. The clinical response at each cycle up to the last assessment prior to surgery was derived for: i) the primary breast lesion; (ii) across secondary breast lesions, (iii) across all breast lesions (iv) across axillary nodes (v) across supraclavicular nodes and (vi) across all nodes (vii) across all lesions (overall) using the following algorithm: CR: if measurement of '0' is noted at a given cycle as compared to baseline measurement which is &gt;0 at screening or cycle 1 day 1; PR: if measurement is at least a 30% decreased compared to baseline levels . (Reference= baseline size or sum of sizes). Clinical Responders are participants who have achieved CR or PR during the Neo-adjuvant treatment.</description>

Participants without progression after surgery were considered Disease Free. Any evidence of contralateral disease in-situ was not considered as PD.

Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from date of randomization to first documentation of PD or death. Any evidence of contralateral disease in-situ was not considered as PD. Participants who were withdrawn from study without documented progression and for whom evaluations were made, were censored at date of last assessment when the participant was known to be free from progressive disease.
