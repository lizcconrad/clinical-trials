    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of TMC278
      given at a dose of 25 mg once daily versus efavirenz (EFV) at a dose of 600 mg once daily,
      when combined with a fixed background regimen consisting of emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF), in HIV-1 infected patients who have not yet taken any anti-HIV
      drugs. The following evaluations will be done: antiviral activity, immunologic changes, and
      viral geno-/phenotype evolution, relationship of Pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      PK/Pharmacodynamics, medical resource utilization and treatment adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs have been introduced
      sequentially for use in the clinic. Currently, patients are routinely being treated with 3 or
      4 drug combinations including nucleoside/tide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (NRTIs/NtRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors
      (PIs), and/or fusion inhibitors. New potent antiretroviral (ARV) compounds that work in
      people whose HIV-1 virus is resistant to available drugs are urgently needed. This is a Phase
      III, randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the study
      physician nor the patient knows the name of the study assigned medication), double-dummy,
      active-controlled trial to compare the effectiveness, safety, and ability to tolerate TMC278
      versus efavirenz (EFV). The study will last for 104 weeks which includes a screening period
      of 4 weeks, a 96-week treatment period, followed by a 4 week follow-up period. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to TMC278 or to efavirenz, either of these treatments will be in
      combination with two other anti-HIV drugs (2 NRTIs: emtricitabine (FTC) + tenofovir (TDF)).
      TDF/FTC will be administered as a fixed dose combination if available. The hypothesis to be
      provided in this study is that the investigational drug TMC278 will perform just like
      efavirenz (EFV) in terms of antiviral effectiveness (i.e., suppressing of the plasma viral
      load to a level &lt; 50 HIV-1 RNA (ribonucleic acid) copies/mL) in ARV-naïve HIV-infected
      patients. During the trial, patients' health will be monitored by physical examination,
      interview to assess health and well being, and laboratory testing on blood and urine samples.
      Experimental Group: One tablet of TMC278 25 mg once daily plus one tablet of placebo once
      daily that looks just like efavirenz (EFV) plus tenofovir/emtricitabine; Control Group: One
      tablet of Placebo once daily that looks just like TMC278 plus EFV 600 mg once daily plus
      tenofovir/emtricitabine.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load less than (&lt;) 50 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (ribonucleic acid [RNA]) copies/milliliter (ml) at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/ml after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/ml).</description>

    <measure>The Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Snapshot, &lt;50 Copies/ml) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis is based on the last observed viral load (VL) data within the Week 48 window. Virologic response is defined as a VL&lt;50 copies/ml (observed case). Missing VL was considered as non-response. Virologic Failure includes subjects who had VL&gt;=50 copies/ml in the Wk48 window, subjects who discontinued early due to lack or loss of efficacy, subjects who discontinued for reasons other than an adverse event, death or lack or loss of efficacy and at the time of discontinuation had a VL&gt;=50 copies/ml and subjects who had a switch in background regimen that was not permitted by the protocol.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count was imputed in case of missing values: in case of premature discontinuation, data were imputed with the baseline value after discontinuation (i.e. change=0, Non-Completer [NC] = Failure); otherwise last observation carried forward was applied.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Virologic Failure for the Resistance Determination by Emerging Resistance Associated Mutations: First Available On-Treatment Genotypic Data After Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Virologic failure for the resistance determinations was defined as lack of virologic response (never having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL) and plasma viral load increase of &gt;=0.5 log 10 copies/mL above nadir (i.e., never suppressed), or confirmed loss of virologic response (2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL; i.e., rebounder), or discontinued with a last observed on-treatment plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL. For this study, treatment-emergent reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance associated mutations (RAMs) occurring in at least 2 virologic failures (for at least one treatment group) for the following lists are presented: i) Extended list of Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI RAMs) ii) IAS-USA list of Nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI RAMs).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Virological Response (Intent-to-Treat - Time to Loss of Virologic Response [TLOVR], &lt;50 Copies/ml) at Week 48</title>
        <description>Virological response is defined as confirmed plasma viral load less than (&lt;) 50 human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) (ribonucleic acid [RNA]) copies/milliliter (ml) at Week 48. The TLOVR algorithm was used to derive response. Response needed to be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who permanently discontinued were considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure was considered as failure. Virologic Failure includes participants who were rebounder (confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/ml after being responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/ml).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Virologic Failure for the Resistance Determination by Emerging Resistance Associated Mutations: First Available On-Treatment Genotypic Data After Failure</title>
        <description>Virologic failure for the resistance determinations was defined as lack of virologic response (never having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL) and plasma viral load increase of &gt;=0.5 log 10 copies/mL above nadir (i.e., never suppressed), or confirmed loss of virologic response (2 consecutive plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL; i.e., rebounder), or discontinued with a last observed on-treatment plasma viral load &gt;=50 copies/mL after having had 2 consecutive plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL. For this study, treatment-emergent reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance associated mutations (RAMs) occurring in at least 2 virologic failures (for at least one treatment group) for the following lists are presented: i) Extended list of Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI RAMs) ii) IAS-USA list of Nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (N[t]RTI RAMs).</description>
