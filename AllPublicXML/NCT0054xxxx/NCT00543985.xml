  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We plan to test the hypothesis that patients with metabolic syndrome will have impaired left
      ventricular diastolic parameters. These parameters will be measured before and after a stress
      test at the end of a 3 month period of exercise training and a 10% weight loss.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have 2 of the 5 criteria for metabolic syndrome and be able to exercise in a
      monitored setting for 45 min 5 times a week.

      <recruitment_details>Patients were recruited as part of the parent study on Weight Regain (PI Tom Thomas) funded by NIH. These patients were recruited from clinics, volunteers from advertisements. Patients needed to have 2 of 5 criteria for the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) plus have obesity.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All patients in this study had successfully been screened as part of the parent study. All patients were to exercise (aerobic) and have a 10% weight loss. Echocardiography was performed prior to and immediately following a maximal stress test at the end of 12 weeks of exercise.</pre_assignment_details>
