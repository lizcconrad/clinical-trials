    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the effect of fenofibrate treatment on glomerular
      filtration rate (GFR), kidney hemodynamics and tubular function in middle-aged subjects with
      normal kidney function to further investigate the increase in creatinine levels observed in
      fenofibrate-treated subjects.
