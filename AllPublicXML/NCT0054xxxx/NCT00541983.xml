    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary
      efficacy of XOMA 052 in subjects with active Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D).

      IV administration of XOMA 052 is likely to improve glycemic control in subjects with T2D by
      blocking certain receptors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  American Diabetes Association (ADA) diagnostic criteria for T2D: Fasting blood glucose
             concentration ≥ 126 mg/dL (≥ 7.0 mmol/L) (must be measured within 28 days prior to Day
             0) OR Symptoms of hyperglycemia (e.g., thirst, polyuria, weight loss, visual blurring)
             AND a casual/random plasma glucose value of ≥ 200 mg/dL (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) (must be

          -  Current T2D of duration &gt; 3 months and ≤ 10 years at Screening

          -  T2D and other diseases must be stable. Stable disease is defined as disease that is
             judged stable by the investigator and which did not require a change in medications or
             dosing level on 4 or more consecutive days or 7 days in total within 28 days prior to

             in dosing level on 4 or more consecutive days or 7 days in total

          -  Fasting C-peptide &lt; 400 pM (&lt; 1.20 μg/L)
