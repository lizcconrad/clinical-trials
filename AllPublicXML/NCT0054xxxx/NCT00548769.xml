    <textblock>
      Sufficient subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MS (EDSS score of 6.5 or below), will be
      recruited to ensure that 30 subjects (approx. equal numbers of each gender) complete the
      study. Subjects will undergo a screening visit, then four study days, each separated by a
      washout period of at least 7 days, when the different firategrast batches of drug substance
      will be administered, and a follow-up visit.

      An open-label, randomised, four period crossover study to investigate the relative
      pharmacokinetic profiles of tablets from three batches of firategrast with different surface
      areas and two different tablet formulations containing the same batch of firategrast, given
      as single 900mg doses to male and female subjects with a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis

          -  A female subject is eligible to enter the study if she is of non-childbearing
             potential, or of childbearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at
             Screening, and agrees to consistent and correct use of adequate contraception

             non-systemic steroids are being used for other chronic inflammatory conditions,
             subjects may be included at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with
             the GSK medical monitor.

             neurological health

          -  Current or history of cancer, excluding localized non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Uncontrolled or any active bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. Any previous serious
             infections should be discussed with the GSK medical monitor (e.g. opportunistic or
             atypical infections).

          -  History of tuberculosis or positive chest X-ray for TB

          -  Known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency.

          -  Any abnormality on 12-lead ECG at Screening which is clinically significant in the
             opinion of the investigator.

          -  Subjects with positive hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV tests at Screening.

          -  Women who are lactating, pregnant (positive pregnancy test at Screening), or planning
             to become pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Recent history or suspicion of current drug abuse (including analgesic abuse) or
             alcohol abuse within the last 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  Use of an investigational drug for condition other than MS within 30 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) preceding Screening. Prior use of an investigational
             drug for MS should be discussed with the GSK medical monitor.

          -  Any concurrent illness, disability or clinically significant abnormality (including
             laboratory tests) that may affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy or safety
             data or prevent the subject from safely completing the assessments required by the
             protocol.
