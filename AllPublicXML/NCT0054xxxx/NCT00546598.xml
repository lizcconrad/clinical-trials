      This study is being conducted to gather medium and long-term information regarding the
      performance and safety of the commercially available DURALOC® Option Ceramic-on-Ceramic Hip
      Prosthesis System.

    <textblock>
      This two-phased study on hip arthroplasty consists of a clinical follow-up phase and a
      clinical outcomes phase.

      The DURALOC® Option Ceramic-on-Ceramic Hip Prosthesis System consists of:

        1. a modular ceramic bearing insert that secures to a titanium metal alloy DURALOC® Option
           Acetabular Shell via a taper locking mechanism; and

        2. a ceramic femoral head that is attached to a conventional femoral stem to complete the
           total hip prosthesis device configuration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Skeletally mature

          -  Provide informed consent

          -  Sufficient acetabular and femoral bone stock to seat the prosthesis

          -  Willing and able to return for follow-up as specified by the study protocol

          -  Willing and able to complete the hip outcomes questionnaire and quality of life survey
             (SF12)

          -  Undergo hip replacement due to non-inflammatory joint disease, including
             osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, congenital hip dysplasia or post-traumatic
             arthritis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile
             rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus, erythematosis etc.

          -  Active infections that may spread to other systems such as osteomyelitis, pyogenic
             infection of the hip joint overt infection, etc.

          -  Loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the affected
             limb which impedes evaluation.

          -  Poor bone quality (e.g. osteoporosis) such that there is concern about the ability of
             inadequate bone stock to support the implant.

          -  Morbid obesity

          -  Involvement in high levels of activity or participation in active sports

          -  Involvement in heavy manual labor employment

          -  Increased likelihood of falls due to concomitant illnesses or impairment

          -  Pregnancy, breast-feeding, a prisoner, mentally incompetent, a known alcohol or drug
             abuser

          -  Diagnosis of metabolic disorders or receiving systemic pharmacological treatments
             leading to progressive deterioration of solid bone support for the implant

          -  Known history of conditions that may interfere with the total hip arthroplasty
             survival or outcome (e.g. Paget's disease, Charcot's disease)

          -  Known presence of active metastatic or neoplastic disease

          -  Known allergic reactions to implant materials (e.g. ceramic, metal)

          -  Known history of tissue reactions to implant corrosion or implant wear debris

          -  Disabilities of other joints that impedes evaluation (e.g. knees, ankles)

          -  Known presence of highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit follow-up
             (e.g. immunocompromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis etc.)

          -  Previous prosthetic hip replacement device (any type including THA, surface
             replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis etc.)
