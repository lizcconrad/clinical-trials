  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label pilot study of the safety and tolerability of 7% hypertonic saline
      inhaled twice daily for 14 days in infants with CF, 12 to 30 months of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline (HS) in CF patients over 6 years of age has been
      demonstrated in clinical trials of 2 to 48 weeks' duration. Based on these results, a large
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the efficacy and safety of 7% HS administered twice
      daily for 48 weeks to infants with CF, 4 to 15 months of age at enrollment, is planned (the
      Infant Study of Inhaled Saline (ISIS) trial). It is anticipated that 150 infants at up to 16
      sites will be enrolled in the ISIS trial.

      To date, the only evaluations of the safety of HS in infants with CF have been small
      single-dose studies. There has been no evaluation of the tolerability of chronic HS
      administration. The goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of exposure
      to 14 days of 7% HS administered twice daily in infants with CF, prior to enrolling subjects
      in the planned large, randomized, controlled trial. Conduct of this study will provide
      evidence for the tolerability of chronic HS administration in infants with CF and estimates
      of the proportion of infants who do not tolerate chronic HS treatment. The results will be
      used to establish the appropriate measures of tolerability at enrollment in the ISIS trial,
      and to refine sample size estimates to account for withdrawal due to intolerance of HS.

    <description>7% hypertonic saline administered twice daily for 14 days by nebulization.
A Pari Sprint Junior nebulizer equipped with a Pari Baby face mask and a Pari Proneb compressor will be used to administer the HS (PARI Respiratory Equipment, Inc., Midlothian, VA).
To minimize the risk of cough and bronchospasm with HS inhalation, infants will be pre-treated prior to each dose of HS with albuterol by metered dose inhaler</description>
