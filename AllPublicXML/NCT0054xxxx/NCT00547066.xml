      This trial will study different dose levels of hA20 (IMMU-106) to see if they are safe and
      effective for treating ITP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of current treatment guidelines for most patients with chronic adult ITP is to
      maintain platelet levels above 30 x 109/L. The conventional first-line therapy is
      corticosteroids with or without intravenous immunoglobulins, but many patients relapse when
      steroids are tapered. Standard therapy then is splenectomy, but patients with refractory ITP
      who do not respond require further therapy. Unfortunately, immunosuppressive agents or other
      available treatments typically produce only short-term responses. Because of the lack of
      medical options after first-line therapy, the target population for this first study of
      anti-CD20 immunotherapy with hA20 are adult patients with chronic ITP who failed at least one
      standard ITP therapy (i.e., received at least one standard ITP therapy and now present with
      platelet levels below 30 x 109/L).

      In autoimmune disease, rituximab as well as other anti-CD20 antibodies currently being
      considered for commercialization have focused on a different dosing schedule in rheumatoid
      arthritis, and use fixed dosages rather than variable doses based on body surface area. In
      addition, recent studies of these newer anti-CD20 antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis have
      reported that lower doses indeed appear effective when administered twice, 2 weeks apart.
      Based upon these considerations, patients in this study will receive hA20 twice, 2 weeks
      apart, and administered at one of 3 dose levels.

          -  Male or female, &gt;18 years old, with or without prior splenectomy

          -  Signed written informed consent obtained prior to study entry

          -  ITP according to ASH guidelines, with other potential causes of thrombocytopenia
