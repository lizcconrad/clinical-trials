      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as topotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together
      with topotecan hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan
      hydrochloride when given together with bortezomib in treating patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of combining PS-341 with topotecan in patients with
      advanced solid tumor malignancies.

      II. To define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan when administered in combination
      with a fixed dose of PS-341 and to described the toxicities at each dose studied.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of topotecan when given in combination with PS-341 at
      MTD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform laboratory correlative studies on patients tissue investigating potential
      predictors of response.

      OUTLINE:

      PART I (completed as of 09/06/06; all patients enrolled in study after 09/06/06 are enrolled
      in part II): Patients receive escalating doses of topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 8 followed 6 hours later by bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      PART II: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed 6 hours later by
      escalating doses of topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      In both parts of the study, patients who achieve a response may receive additional courses of
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
