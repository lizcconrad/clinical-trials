  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the administration of insulin, different needles are available with a length from 5 to
      12.7mm. Insulin injections with a needle of 8 mm is injected in a lifted skinfold, a 5 mm
      needle can by used without lifting a skinfold (1). In the Netherlands obese people (BMI ≥ 30)
      are usually advised to use an 8mm or even longer needle (1). Increased BMI and the thickness
      of the subcutaneous tissue slow insulin absorption (2, 3, 4), possibly related to reduced
      subcutaneous blood flow. Furthermore, the capillaries are located just under the skin and
      between the fat and muscle layer. This could possibly determine the absorbing speed (2). It
      is not know if the administration of insulin with a 5mm needle by obese people has a
      different influence on the HbA1c compared to longer needles. The hypothesis of this study is
      that for the purpose of insulin injections, a 5 mm needle can be used without negative
      effects on metabolic parameters in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and a Body Mass Index
      (BMI) ≥ 30.
