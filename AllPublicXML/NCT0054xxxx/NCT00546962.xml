  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research study is to collect and store the specimens that are left over after
      patients undergo tests ordered by their physicians. These specimens will be used at a later
      time by researchers in the Pulmonary Division to develop a better understanding of pulmonary
      diseases or for the development of new treatments. Typical research studies that will be
      conducted on the stored tissue, fluid, or bacteria from the patient sample involve obtaining
      bacterial cultures, measurement of inflammatory markers, and examination of the
      characteristics of the tissue. Other similar tests may be done in the future; however, these
      tests have not all been determined at this time. It is important to note that no genetic
      testing will be performed on any samples that are obtained as part of this protocol.
