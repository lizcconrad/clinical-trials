      Background: The TB and HIV epidemics are closely linked in developing countries, where
      450,000 children die from HIV annually. TB is a major cause of death in HIV-infected children
      and is reversing gains made in child survival.

      The traditional tuberculin skin test (TST) has limited diagnostic accuracy for detecting TB
      infection. Adult studies suggest that new blood-based diagnostic TB testing offers a quicker,
      more accurate way to diagnose TB infection. Such diagnostic testing may directly guide
      clinical management and preventive strategies in immune-suppressed HIV-infected children, who
      are at high risk of becoming TB diseased following infection. Data regarding the usefulness
      of these tests in children is currently limited.

      Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es): The investigators hypothesize that blood-based TB diagnostic
      testing can accurately identify children with TB infection. In a community with high rates of
      TB and HIV infection, the following specific aims will be investigated in HIV-infected and
      uninfected children:

        1. assess the agreement between the TST and blood-based diagnostic testing,

        2. compare the performance of the TST and blood-based diagnostic testing to a standardized
           history of TB exposure,

        3. measure the impact of age, nutritional and immune status on children's response to
           blood-based testing,

        4. describe factors that might modify children's response to testing over time, and 5)
           examine the effect of environmental exposures and previous vaccination on the TST,
           blood-based testing and other measures of immune responses to TB.

      Potential Impact: The benefits of an accurate, rapid diagnostic test of TB infection in
      children include 1) timely institution of treatment for TB infection to prevent severe
      disease and mortality, and 2) preclusion of over diagnosis and treatment. Treatment of
      childhood TB infection also prevents future contagious adult disease, thus decreasing
      community transmission. Blood-based diagnostic testing may also be able to identify children
      that are more likely to become ill following TB infection. Therefore, blood-based diagnostic
      testing has great potential to improve TB control and the health of HIV-infected and
      uninfected children, their households and communities.
