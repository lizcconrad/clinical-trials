  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to compare the effect of long acting vs short acting opioids in chronic non-malignant
      pain. The study opioid is Dihydrocodeine Continus and Dihydrocodeine 30 mg tablets. We
      measure pain relief, health related quality of life, sleep, breakthrough pain and depression
      with validated questionnaires to compare the two treatment arms.

      Hypothesis: The pain relief will be better and more stable with long acting opioids. Quality
      of sleep, breakthrough pain and quality of life will also be improved with long acting
      dihydrocodeine.
