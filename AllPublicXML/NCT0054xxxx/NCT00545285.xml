      There are two distinct aims of this study:

        1. This prospective study is designed to document the long-term (10-year) radiographic and
           clinical outcomes of a new type of highly cross-linked polyethylene liner which contains
           vitamin E as an anti-oxidant, (E-Poly), in a group of primary total hip arthroplasty
           subjects. The clinical outcome of E-Poly will be compared to a group of subjects
           receiving Arcom XL polyethylene.

        2. This study is also designed to document the long-term (10-year) radiographic and
           clinical outcomes of a new cementless acetabular component having a titanium porous
           surface (Regenerex). The clinical outcome of this new FDA cleared device will be
           compared a group of subjects receiving an acetabular component having a plasma sprayed
           surface.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects requiring primary total hip replacement

          -  Subjects with diagnosis of osteoarthritis or traumatic arthritis

          -  Subjects who demonstrate the ability to return for follow-up for the next 10 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with limited life span

          -  Subjects with difficulty in comprehending study protocol for any reason.

          -  Subjects with inflammatory disease, previous infection or those requiring revision hip
             surgery.

          -  Subjects with avascular necrosis

          -  Subjects whose bony structures are so small that a femoral head less than 32mm in
             diameter must be used.

          -  Subjects whose bony structure deviates substantially from the general norm
             sufficiently to require non-standard techniques and non-standard implants. Specific
             examples of these are total dislocation of the hip, severe coxa vera deformity, severe
             forms of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia

          -  Subjects with complex disease entities which significantly increase the risks of the
             surgery such as any major platelet abnormality, hematological disorder, positive for
             HIV or any other major medical complication which substantially reduces longevity.

          -  Female subjects that are pregnant or who may suspect they are pregnant or who plan to
             become pregnant while participating in this study.
