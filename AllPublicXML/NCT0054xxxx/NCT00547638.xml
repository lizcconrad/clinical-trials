  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study for the purpose of comparing
      DERMABOND PROTAPE to DERMABOND HVD for closure of wounds in the Emergency Department. The
      objective of this study is to demonstrate whether the incidence of wound closure for
      DERMABOND PROTAPE is equivalent to that measured for DERMABOND HVD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the literature, cyanoacrylate adhesives (topical skin adhesive) have performed
      as intended and have not produced results that would bring into question the safety or
      effectiveness of cyanoacrylate adhesive for closure of surgical incisions and traumatic
      wounds in humans.

      As such, this is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study for the purpose of
      comparing two forms of topical skin adhesives, DERMABOND PROTAPE &amp; DERMABOND HVD for closure
      of wounds in the Emergency Department.

      Patients presenting in the Emergency Department with traumatic wounds meeting the acceptance
      criteria will have their wounds closed with DERMABOND PROTAPE or DERMABOND HVD, and will be
      monitored and evaluated at 14 &amp; 30 days.

    <measure>The Incidence of Wound Closure Post-treatment, as Defined by Continuous Approximation of Wound Margins From the Time of Wound Closure Until the Day of Evaluation Without Dehiscence or Need for Reclosure.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days (±2 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Data is presented as binomial tables of proportions of successes and failures for each treatment. The 90% two-sided exact confidence intervals (CI) for the differences in the proportions for each study group was calculated. The upper limit of the 90% CI was then taken to represent the upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI. The primary objective of the study was met if the upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI of the difference in proportions (comparator minus treatment) did not exceed 8%.</description>

    <description>The evaluation of healing and cosmetic outcome post-treatment using the modified Hollander Cosmesis Scale (mHCS). The proportion of patients with a zero (0) score will be compared between the test and control arms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Comparison of Test and Control Arms Regarding Incidence of Clinical Infection at Day 14 and Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of clinical infection (defined by observation of redness, swelling, purulent discharge, pain, increased skin temperature, fever or other systemic signs of injection) collected at the Day 14 and Day 30 visits. A formal statistical analysing using Fisher's Exact Test was performed.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The Incidence and Extent of Local Acute Inflammatory Reactions Including Edema, Erythema, Pain and Local Temperature at Day 14 and Day 30</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 14 and Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Each parameter (edema, erythema, pain and location temperature) is measured on a 4 point scale (0, 1, 2, 3). The individual values are added to generate an overall AIRE Score. AIRE Scores were summarized as good (score=0) versus poor (score&gt;0) by treatment group and compared for differences using the Fisher's Exact Test.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Skin Blistering at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence of skin blistering is presented as a tabulation of the presence or absence of skin blistering by treatment group. A formal statistical analysis of the incidence of blistering at Day 14 was performed using the Fisher's Exact Test.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Any Other Anticipated or Unanticipated Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were coded using the MedDRA dictionary. In addition severity, relationship to treatment and procedure, action taken and outcome were described. Adverse events were summarized by treatment group. No formal statistical analysis was performed on overall incidence of adverse events with the exception of clinical infection, acute inflammatory reactions and skin blistering.</description>

        <title>The Incidence of Wound Closure Post-treatment, as Defined by Continuous Approximation of Wound Margins From the Time of Wound Closure Until the Day of Evaluation Without Dehiscence or Need for Reclosure.</title>
        <description>Data is presented as binomial tables of proportions of successes and failures for each treatment. The 90% two-sided exact confidence intervals (CI) for the differences in the proportions for each study group was calculated. The upper limit of the 90% CI was then taken to represent the upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI. The primary objective of the study was met if the upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI of the difference in proportions (comparator minus treatment) did not exceed 8%.</description>
