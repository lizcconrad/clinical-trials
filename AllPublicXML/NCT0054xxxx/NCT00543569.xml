    <description>The impact of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) symptom severity score. The GIQLI is a 36-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past 2 weeks on a scale from 0 (all of the time) to 4 (never). Possible overall scores ranged from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life according to the different symptomatic criteria.</description>

        <title>Graft Survival at Month 6 and Month 12</title>
        <description>Graft survival was defined as any participant who was known to have a functioning graft (i.e., not graft loss) at 6 months and 12 months after the skin closure date. Graft loss was defined as patient death, retransplant, permanent return to dialysis (dialysis greater than 30 days) or transplant nephrectomy.
The Kaplan-Meier estimates at Days 182 and 365 were used for the analyses at 6 months and 12 months respectively. Lost to follow-up or participants with missing outcomes were censored at their last follow up visit.</description>

        <description>The grade of acute T-cell mediated rejection was classified as IA, IB, IIA, IIB and III according to Banff 2005 criteria. If a patient had more than 1 T-cell mediated rejection, the episode with the most severe grade was used in the analysis.
Grade IA: Cases with significant interstitial infiltration (&gt; 25% of parenchyma affected) and foci of moderate tubulitis; Grade IB: Cases with significant interstitial infiltration (&gt; 25% of parenchyma affected) and foci of severe tubulitis; Grade IIA: Cases with mild to moderate intimal arteritis; Grade IIB: Cases with severe intimal arteritis comprising &gt;25% of the luminal area; Grade III: Cases with “transmural” arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells with accompanying lymphocytic inflammation.</description>

        <title>Maximum Grade of T-cell Mediated Rejection as Assessed by Central Review</title>
        <description>The grade of acute T-cell mediated rejection was classified as IA, IB, IIA, IIB and III according to Banff 2005 criteria. If a patient had more than 1 T-cell mediated rejection, the episode with the most severe grade was used in the analysis.
Grade IA: Cases with significant interstitial infiltration (&gt; 25% of parenchyma affected) and foci of moderate tubulitis; Grade IB: Cases with significant interstitial infiltration (&gt; 25% of parenchyma affected) and foci of severe tubulitis; Grade IIA: Cases with mild to moderate intimal arteritis; Grade IIB: Cases with severe intimal arteritis comprising &gt;25% of the luminal area; Grade III: Cases with &quot;transmural&quot; arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells with accompanying lymphocytic inflammation.</description>

        <description>The impact of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) symptom severity score. The GIQLI is a 36-item self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past 2 weeks on a scale from 0 (all of the time) to 4 (never). Possible overall scores ranged from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life according to the different symptomatic criteria.</description>
