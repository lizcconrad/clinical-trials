    <textblock>
      Long QT syndrome (LQTS)is a cardiac disorder that may lead to ventricular arrythmias and
      culminate in syncope and/or possible death.

      Recently, researchers have developed a way of discovering patients with LQTS by using low
      doses of epinephrine by a continuous, intravenous infusion in adults. Epinephrine, or
      adrenaline, is produced by our bodies in times of stress. By producing adrenaline, your body
      allows itself to adapt to its stressful environment and take appropriate actions (i.e. fight
      or flight response). By simulating this response with very small amounts of epinephrine,
      researchers have shown prolongation of the QT interval does not occur in normal healthy
      adults. However, adults with confirmed LQTS Type 1 (LQTS-1) will prolong their QT interval
      when given low dose epinephrine. Therefore, this test can act as a safe means of identifying
      adults with LQTS-1 who do not have prolonged QT intervals on their resting EKGs.

      However, LQTS is not just a disease of adults, it affects children as well. Currently the
      standard of care is to obtain resting EKGs on our pediatric patients which can miss those
      patients with concealed LQTS. Those patients, who are old enough, can undergo exercise
      testing. Yet this leaves young children unable to run on a treadmill without a diagnostic
      test.

      Hypothesis: The low-dose epinephrine infusion stress test does not cause prolongation of the
      QT interval in an electrophysiologically normal healthy pediatric population.

    <textblock>
      This study will involve asking fifty children coming to the hospital for their standard of
      care procedure to treat a separate cardiac condition to participate. Patients approached will
      already have an intravenous line in place for their procedure. After consent and assent as
      necessary are obtained, the patient be brought to a separate room for the low-dose
      epinephrine infusion trial. The patient will lie down on a table, be hooked up to an EKG
      machine and the infusion will start. The amount of epinephrine actually infused is based on
      the weight of the patient but is substantially less than the dose received from an
      epinephrine auto-injection for anaphylaxis. After about 40 minutes, the trial will be
      completed and the patient may return to the waiting room for their original procedure. We
      have performed this test on a number of pediatric patients suspected of having LQTS with
      promising results and with little to no side effects. The patient will be awake for the
      procedure and will be able to verbalize concerns or complaints. A pediatric
      electrophysiologist and nurse will be present throughout the entire procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if children who are infused with low amounts of
      epinephrine will also maintain their normal QT interval as it does with healthy adults. This
      study would hope to prove that low-dose epinephrine infusion trials can serve as a way of
      identifying children with LQTS so that they may be effectively treated and potentially have
      their lives saved.

    <description>QT interval refers to the time interval on the standard electrocardiogram from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Each participant had four QT intervals measured at each timepoint and the average was calculated for each patient at each timepoint for an absolute QT interval. Lengthening of the absolute QT interval greater than 30 milliseconds on low dose epinephrine infusion would be considered a positive result.</description>

    <description>We will follow the protocol outlined by Ackerman et al. known as the Mayo protocol4 which is currently used routinely in our electrophysiology laboratory. Epinephrine infusion will begin at 0.025 ug/kg/minute, for ten minutes and a twelve-lead electrocardiogram is obtained at time=0 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes. The epinephrine infusion will then be increased to 0.05 ug/kg/minute for five minutes and the electrocardiogram repeated. The epinephrine infusion will then be increased to a maximal dose of 0.1 ug/kg/minute for five minutes and electrocardiogram obtained. The epinephrine infusion is then discontinued and measurements are obtained at five minutes and ten minutes after stopping the epinephrine infusion. The total time of procedure will be 35 minutes.</description>
