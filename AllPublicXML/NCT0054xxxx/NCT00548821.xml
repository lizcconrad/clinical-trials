    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research protocol is to compare if there is a difference in
      progression free survival between weekly versus 5-day 3 weekly cisplatin based chemotherapy
      regimen in women with locally advanced cervical cancer. The secondary aims are to compare
      quality of life assessment of patients and their carers as well as toxicity profiles both
      acute and late.
