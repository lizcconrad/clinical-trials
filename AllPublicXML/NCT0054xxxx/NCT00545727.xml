    <textblock>
      Research to date suggests that the selection of lower glycemic index foods, that is, foods
      provoking a slower, more sustained blood sugar response, may result in improved glycemic
      control in youth with diabetes. However, there is currently insufficient data to support
      practice recommendations. The purpose of this pilot study is to test the blood glucose
      response to low and high glycemic index meals in youth with diabetes using continuous blood
      glucose monitoring, and to determine whether the effect of glycemic index differs by regimen
      or diagnosis. In this pilot study up to 42 youth with type 1 diabetes or impaired glucose
      metabolism (elevated fasting glucose, insulin resistance, or type 2 diabetes) will
      participate in 5 days of continuous blood glucose monitoring during which they will receive
      both low and high glycemic index meals. Children will be provided with 1 full day of low
      glycemic index meals and 1 full day of high glycemic index meals in a supervised setting in
      randomized order. Each of these test days will be preceded by a standard evening meal and
      snack. Continuous blood glucose monitoring will also be conducted during regular food intake
      ad libidum away from the clinic, as well as during one day of instructed low glycemic meals
      at home. All food intake, insulin, and blood glucose self-monitoring will be recorded. While
      in the clinic, measures of satiety and acceptability of the food will also be obtained. Data
      analysis will include indices of blood glucose levels and variability.
