  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine whether combining iniparib (BSI-201) with
      standard chemotherapy in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative, progesterone receptor
      (PR)-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative metastatic breast
      cancer patients improve clinical benefit compared to treatment with standard chemotherapy
      alone.

      Based on data generated by BiPar/Sanofi, it was concluded that iniparib does not possess
      characteristics typical of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class. The exact
      mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, however based on experiments on tumor cells
      performed in the laboratory, iniparib is a novel investigational anti-cancer agent that
      induces gamma-H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) in tumor cell lines, induces cell cycle arrest in
      the G2/M phase in tumor cell lines, and potentiates the cell cycle effects of DNA damaging
      modalities in tumor cell lines. Investigations into potential targets of iniparib and its
      metabolites are ongoing.

      Patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, Investigator's
      decision to discontinue, or withdrawal of consent. After treatment discontinuation, all
      patients were evaluated every 90 days after last dose of gemcitabine/carboplatin with or
      without iniparib, for up to 3 years or death or end of study, which ever occurred first.
