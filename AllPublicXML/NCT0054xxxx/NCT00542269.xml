  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof of concept study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the
      combination therapy of aliskiren and ramipril as add-on to amlodipine in the treatment of
      patients with essential hypertension and metabolic syndrome who do not respond adequately to
      amlodipine monotherapy.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Automated blood pressure determinations were made with the Omron HEM-705CP blood pressure monitor at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post-dose) and recorded at all study visits following detailed directions specified in the study protocol. Three readings were made and msSBP was calculated as the average of the 3 readings. In the event of aberrant readings, ie, the lowest reading was ≥ 10 mmHg systolic or ≥ 5 mmHg diastolic lower than the highest of the 3 readings, 3 additional readings were obtained. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study - Aliskiren/Ramipril/Amlodipine vs Ramipril/Amlodipine)</title>
        <description>Automated blood pressure determinations were made with the Omron HEM-705CP blood pressure monitor at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post-dose) and recorded at all study visits following detailed directions specified in the study protocol. Three readings were made and msSBP was calculated as the average of the 3 readings. In the event of aberrant readings, ie, the lowest reading was ≥ 10 mmHg systolic or ≥ 5 mmHg diastolic lower than the highest of the 3 readings, 3 additional readings were obtained. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Baseline to End of Study - Aliskiren/Amlodipine vs Ramipril/Amlodipine</title>
          <description>Automated blood pressure determinations were made with the Omron HEM-705CP blood pressure monitor at trough (24 hours ± 3 hours post-dose) and recorded at all study visits following detailed directions specified in the study protocol. Three readings were made and msDBP was calculated as the average of the 3 readings. In the event of aberrant readings, ie, the lowest reading was ≥ 10 mmHg systolic or ≥ 5 mmHg diastolic lower than the highest of the 3 readings, 3 additional readings were obtained. A negative change indicates improvement.</description>
