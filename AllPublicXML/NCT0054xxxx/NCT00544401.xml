    <textblock>
      Infertility is a common and distressful problem for many couples, with assisted reproductive
      techniques (ART) such as IVF and ICSI, with slightly more than 34% pregnancies per cycle.
      Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese treatment in which thin needles are inserted into various
      points along the skin, harmonizing&quot; the body's &quot;energy. Acupuncture has been found to
      increase pregnancy rates following IVF/ICSI treatments, and is believed to affect ovulation
      and fertility through elevation of beta-endorphin release and GnRH secretion, as well as
      reduced sympathetic response with increased blood flow to the uterus. The sympatho-inhibitory
      properties and impact on beta-endorphin levels of acupuncture, as well as its efficacy in
      treating depression, may be helpful in reducing stress among women undergoing fertility
      treatments as well. Hypnosis is a mind-body technique which uses suggestions during a relaxed
      state to promote healing. Hypnosis can also significantly reduce the sympathetic response,
      and is believed to produce uterine relaxation and quiescence during embryo transfer (ET),
      which may lead to a reduction in embryo displacement from the uterine cavity. No research has
      been published on the use of hypnosis with acupuncture (hypnopuncture) in ART.

      This is a pilot study to evaluate the effect of a combined regimen of hypnopuncture on
      clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing IVF/ICSI following two failed cycles. During the
      initial pre-treatment meeting, participants who fulfill all inclusion criteria and none of
      the exclusion criteria will undergo hypnotic induction, followed by suggestions for increased
      uterine blood flow. On the day of embryo transfer, participants will be randomly divided into
      either treatment or no-treatment groups. Treatment will consist of the insertion of
      acupuncture needles into pre-determined points, to be followed by a hypnosis pre-recorded
      hypnosis session, as described above. Patients in the control group will receive standard
      care without hypnopuncture and those participants in this group who do not conceive following
      the 3rd cycle will be treated with hypnopuncture during the 4th cycle, following ET. A total
      of 100 women will be enrolled, 50 in each arm of the study.
