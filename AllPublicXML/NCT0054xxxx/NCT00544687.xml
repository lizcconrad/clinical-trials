    <textblock>
      CRx-191 is a proprietary synergistic combination drug candidate being evaluated by
      CombinatoRx for topical psoriasis therapy. CRx-191 was identified via a proprietary screening
      assay for novel drug combinations demonstrating enhanced inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-
      alpha and interferon-gamma release, cytokines that are implicated in the pathogenesis of
      psoriasis.
