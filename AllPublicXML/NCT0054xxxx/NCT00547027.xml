      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a tailored, print-based physical
      activity intervention for patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the growing rates of type 2 diabetes and the documented benefits of physical activity
      in the treatment of this illness, further research is needed to examine methods of targeting
      this patient group to achieve improvements in physical activity behavior. The primary aim of
      this planning grant is to implement a pilot study examining the feasibility and efficacy of
      an individually-targeted, theoretically-based physical activity intervention for patients
      with type 2 diabetes. The physical activity intervention is compared to usual care, and the
      primary outcome is weekly physical activity at a one-month follow-up. These pilot data would
      demonstrate the feasibility of partnering with a community agency for participant recruitment
      and program implementation, as well as the potential efficacy of this intervention to promote
      physical activity in this high-risk population.
