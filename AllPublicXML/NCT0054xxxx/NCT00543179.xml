      Background Somatostatin and octreotide LAR (long-acting analogue) exert a number of
      inhibitory effects: on gut hormones, but also on gastro-intestinal secretion and motility.

      Somatostatin analogues are effective in preventing symptoms and signs of both early and late
      dumping as demonstrated previously. However, octreotide LAR causes gastrointestinal side
      effects and the injection solution is difficult to prepare. Recently, a new somatostatin
      analogue with a prolonged release formulation, Lanreotide autogel (L-autogel), has become
      available. It is a viscous aqueous gel, composed solely of water and lanreotide. Deep
      subcutaneous administration may lead to increased treatment acceptance compared with
      intramuscular depot preparations. It is more easy to prepare and is though to cause less
      local side effects and technical problems than octreotide LAR. Recent studies have been done
      to measure the efficacy and safety of L-autogel in acromegalic treated previously with
      octreotide LAR. These studies showed that L-autogel is effective and well-tolerated in these
      patients, with equivalent or better disease control and less gastrointestinal adverse events.
      Until now, there is no data available on the effectivety of L-autogel in patients with a
      dumping syndrome. Therefore, this study aims to establish the effectiveness and tolerability
      of L-autogel in patients with a dumping syndrome, previously treated with octreotide LAR.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with typical early dumping symptoms after gastric surgery are selected on the
             basis of the clinical diagnostic index devised by Sigstad. In addition their dumping
             score after an oral glucose challenge (dumping provocation test) is positive (1,2);

          -  Patients with late dumping are selected on the basis of a history suggestive of
             postprandial hypoglycaemia, a plasma glucose of less than 3.0 mm/l at least 60 min
             after ingestion of 50 g glucose/ m² body surface and hypoglycaemic symptoms at least
             60 min after the oral glucose load;

          -  Patients will be on long term octreotide LAR therapy;

          -  Over 18 years of age;

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with disorders of the endocrine system, patients with severe kidney, liver or
             cardiovascular disease;

          -  Current or planned pregnancy or lactation;

          -  Gastrointestinal surgery one year prior to inclusion;

          -  Other gastrointestinal diseases that might influence symptoms of the dumping syndrome.
