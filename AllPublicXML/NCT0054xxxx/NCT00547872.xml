    <textblock>
      In the present study a cohort of diabetic patients without any symptoms and without known
      coronary artery disease (CAD) will be screened at the investigators' diabetes outpatients
      services. Those with intermediate or high risk will be asked to participate and enrolled.
      They will be seen and followed by the cardiologists in order to provide the best adherence to
      medical therapy. By mean of a randomization process, a group of patients will undergo an
      exercise electrocardiography (ECG) testing while the other group will continue to be
      regularly seen at the investigators' cardiology service. Those patients with a positive
      exercise ECG test will be study by coronary angiography and treated according to the severity
      of coronary lesions by percutaneous stenting or surgery. Both groups of patients will be seen
      every six-eight months for the next three years.
