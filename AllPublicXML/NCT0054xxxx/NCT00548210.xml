  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to demonstrate effectivity of Dermatix in promoting
      maturation of the scar, versus a control region that will be treated with an indifferent
      cream.

    <textblock>
      The healing of deep thermal injuries is always associated with scarring. The healing process
      can lead to the formation of large scar bundles (e.g. hypertrophic scars). The scars can be
      discomforting, disfiguring and restrict motion if situated over or near joints. Evidence for
      effectivity of treatment for reduction of hypertrophic scars or the prevention of them is
      limited.

      Different treatments are used such as intralesional injected steroids, topically used oily
      creams, silicone sheets or occlusive dressings. Compression garments are also frequently
      used. There is some evidence as to the effectivity of silicone sheets for recuction of
      hypertrophic scarring, however, these sheets cannot be used easily on all anatomical
      locations.

      Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has developed a silicone based scar remodelling gel,
      DermatixÂ®, which has been empirically shown by others to have potential to reduce
      hypertrophic scars.

      Primary objectives are to demonstrate effectivity of Dermatix in promoting maturation of the
      scar, versus a control region that will be treated with an indifferent cream.
