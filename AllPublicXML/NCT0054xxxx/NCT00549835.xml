      This research is being done to see if acupuncture helps relieve mucositis pain in patients
      with leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy. Many patients receiving chemotherapy develop
      mucositis (painful sores or blisters in the mouth or throat). Mucositis is not only a
      frequent complication in cancer care and extremely painful, but also increases the risks of
      infection and malnutrition and often leads to discontinuing or delaying the chemotherapy
      treatments.

      Acupuncture is one of the oldest, most commonly used medical procedures in the world. The
      practice originated in China more than 2,000 years ago, and is widely used by doctors in
      Korea, China, Japan, and other countries to ease pain or various symptoms. In the past two
      decades, acupuncture has grown in popularity in the United States, and by 2002, an estimated
      8.2 million adults in the US report having used acupuncture.

      The term acupuncture describes a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical
      points on the body by a variety of techniques. The acupuncture technique that has been most
      studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles that
      are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation. Acupuncture needles are metallic,
      solid, and hair-thin. People experience acupuncture differently, but most feel no or minimal
      pain as the needles are inserted. Some people are energized by treatment, while others feel
      relaxed.

      Acupuncture has been used to ease some cancer treatment-related side effects such as nausea
      and vomiting. In this study we will assess the potential usefulness of acupuncture to ease
      the pain associated with mucositis.

    <description>Participants will have acupuncture performed at a rate of 3 times (Mon, Wed, Fri) / week for total of 2 weeks (total of 6 sessions). We will follow Saam Acupuncture methods, which have been the mainstream of acupuncture methodology in most Korean Oriental Medical Colleges and among clinical practitioners &gt;400 years. Standardized acupuncture prescriptions for mucositis will be acupuncture points tonifying Spleen Meridian (R side) and Small Intestine Meridian (L side). In Oriental Medicine, the spleen has functions of promoting water metabolism, transporting nutrients, and controlling blood. Mouth belongs to the spleen system according to Five element theory. Small intestine is related with mucositis symptoms including thirst and tongue ulcers. We will use sterile, disposable, filiform needles, size 0.16 (40Gauge) - 0.30 mm (30Gauge) in diameter and 15-40 mm long. Total number of acupuncture needles will be 8 (4 needles each side) and needles will be retained for 20 minutes.</description>

    <description>Sham needles are developed to exclude sham effect and to prove real acupuncture efficacy. We will use specifically retractable Park Sham Device (AcuPrime, Exeter, UK) for control group. Because this sham device gives the impression of insertion with telescopic needle body and some pricking sensation with a bunt needle tip. It is a valid control for many acupuncture trials as it doesn't penetrate skin and doesn't create active stimulation as much as real needles or acupressure. To avoid unnecessary stimulation of penetrating skin in this population, we plan to use non-penetrating sham device rather than penetrating non-acupuncture point with real needles as control intervention.
All other procedures will be same as Real Acupuncture group except using non-penetrating sham needles on non-acupuncture points. After final session, we will ask all subjects in both groups which form of treatment each subject believe to have during study and will analyze blinding credibility.</description>
