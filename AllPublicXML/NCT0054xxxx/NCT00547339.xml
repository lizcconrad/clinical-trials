      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic
      body radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with prostate
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To escalate the dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to a tumoricidal dose
           without exceeding the maximum tolerated dose in patients with organ-confined prostate
           cancer. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the late, severe grade 3-5 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity
           occurring between 270-540 days (i.e., 9-18 months) from the start of the protocol
           treatment as assessed by CTCAE v3.0. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity of SBRT in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the 2-year biochemical (PSA) control (freedom from PSA failure),
           disease-free and overall survival, local control, freedom from distant metastases, and
           the incidence of high-grade adverse events of any type in patients treated with this
           therapy in order to determine if the therapy is promising enough for further clinical
           investigation. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II
      open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients undergo 5 treatments of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).

        -  Phase II: Patients undergo SBRT at the maximum tolerated dose as in phase I. After
           completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1.5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months,
           every 6 months for 5 years, and then once a year for years 5-10.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 97 patients will be accrued for this study.
