    <textblock>
      The investigators want to find out if their specially designed exercise programme will be
      more successful at helping women with depression to feel better than a basic programme will,
      by measuring the effect the programme has on mood, physical health, and social wellbeing.
      Their specially designed exercise programme will involve physical exertion at the
      participants' chosen level of intensity (how hard the body has to work during exercise), and
      will include motivational support. By contrast, the basic exercise programme will be at an
      intensity recommended by national guidelines, of the type that may be prescribed by a general
      practitioner (GP), and will include no extra motivational support.

Each session will comprise: fifteen minutes of psychosocial and motivational support, run by a qualified rehabilitation psychologist and overseen by a qualified health psychologist; a half hour preferred intensity exercise session run by a qualified sports physiotherapist. Participants preferred intensity (chosen exertion level) will be established using the Borg RPE scale (Borg G 1998).</description>
