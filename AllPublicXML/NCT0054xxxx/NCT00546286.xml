        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has been recently diagnosed and is presently untreated for Open-Angle Glaucoma
             Or Ocular Hypertension With An iop of at least 27 mmhg in at least one eye (patient's
             worse eye)

          -  Patient Already Diagnosed With Open-Angle Glaucoma Or Ocular Hypertension And
             Untreated For At Least 30 Days Are Eligible For The Study If They Have An Iop Of 27
             Mmhg Or More In At Least One Eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A History Of Any Illness That, In The Opinion Of The Investigator, Might Confound The
             Results Of The Study Or Pose Additional Risk By Administering Dorzolamide-Timolol
             (Cosopt®) Or Prostaglandins

          -  The Presence Of Any Fundus Pathology Likely To Change During The Study Or To Influence
             Iop (Background Of Diabetic Retinopathy Is Permitted)

          -  Any Contraindication To The Use Of Cosopt® Including: - Bronchospasm, Including

             Double-Barrier Methods) Beginning At Least 7 Days Prior To Treatment And Continuing At
             Least 14 Days After The Last Visit Or The Discontinuation Visit. (Women Who Are
             Postmenopausal Or Have Received A Hysterectomy Or Have Undergone Tubal Ligature Are
             Considered As Not Having Childbearing Potential.)
