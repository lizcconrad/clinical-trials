    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, double-blind, prospective trial. Newborn infants (enrollment
      age 0-14 days) will be assigned randomly to receive one of two products, provided in
      identical packages except for the lid color. Neither the investigators nor the parents will
      know which product the infant is receiving.

      The infants will be monitored at study enrollment, and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age.

      There will be two study groups, each receiving one of the following formulas:

        1. The new partially hydrolyzed whey formula (NF) - Materna cow's milk infant formula
           containing partially hydrolyzed whey protein, produced and packaged by Materna
           Laboratories, Maabarot.

        2. The currently marketed partially hydrolyzed whey formula (CF) - Nan HA, produced by
           Nestlé. In order to maintain blinding, the Nan HA will be repacked in packaging
           identical to the Materna product, except for the lid color
