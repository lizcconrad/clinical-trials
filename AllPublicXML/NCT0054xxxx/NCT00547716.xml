  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States and
      is a leading cause of chronic liver disease affecting 130 million people around the world. It
      is estimated that 1.6% of the US population may be affected by Hepatitis C infection. The
      only recommended treatment that has been approved for your condition is the use of interferon
      and ribavirin. In patients with chronic Hepatitis C, there tends to be an accumulation of fat
      in the liver. Fatty liver has been associated with failure of treatment.

      The accumulation of fat in the liver has been blamed on a particular type of fat called
      triglycerides. Fish oil, by reducing a type of fat called VLDL, can lower the triglyceride
      concentration by as much as 50 percent or more. This study seeks to determine if the
      administration of fish oil along with standard treatment to patients with Hepatitis C will
      increase the treatment response rates.

      Hepatic steatosis may be present in up to 66% of cases of chronic Hepatitis C infection.
      Previous studies have reported steatosis to be an independent predictor of treatment failure
      in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.

      The pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis in chronic Hepatitis C infection has not been fully
      elucidated. Hepatic steatosis is a manifestation of excessive triglyceride accumulation in
      the liver. Hypertriglyceridemia may benefit from Omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil supplements)
      which, by reducing VLDL production can lower the serum triglyceride concentration by as much
      as 50 percent or more.

      The treatment of chronic hepatitis C results in an average sustained viral response rate of
      54%-63%. We have found response rates of around 50% on treatment of patients. We hypothesize
      that by giving omega-3 fatty acids along with interferon therapy for patients with Hepatitis
      C, we may be able to increase the treatment response rates. Thus, the purpose of the study is
      to look at the effect of omega 3 fatty acids on early and sustained viral response rates in
      patients with chronic HCV infection.
