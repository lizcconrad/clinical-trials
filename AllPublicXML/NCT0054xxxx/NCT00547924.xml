  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe hypotension during reperfusion in liver transplantation is a frequent adverse event.
      Rare data exist so far about pathophysiology of this phenomenon. The exact role of left
      ventricular function, which might be impaired causing hypotension, has not been elucidated
      during the period of reperfusion.

      Goal of this study is to:

        -  perform transesophageal echocardiography in order to assess systolic and diastolic left
           ventricular function during reperfusion

        -  determine inflammatory mediators in the plasma which could cause left ventricular
           dysfunction
