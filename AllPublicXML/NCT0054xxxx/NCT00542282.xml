  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive lung disease is usually a differential diagnostic consideration when a patient
      presents with breathlessness or cough. Spirometry is the key diagnostic test used to confirm
      airflow obstruction particularly in the primary care setting. Airflow obstruction that
      completely resolves after administration of a bronchodilator, by definition, excludes a
      diagnosis of COPD. Evaluation of obstructive lung disease must include pulmonary function
      testing; bronchoreversibility testing is an adjunct in differentiating between asthma and
      COPD. Bronchoreversibility cannot serve as an absolute diagnostic criterion for separating
      asthma from COPD.

      Vibration response imaging (VRI) technology provides a simple, radiation-free method to image
      the lungs, by visualizing vibration energy (lung sounds) emitted during respiration cycle. In
      this study, regional quantitative and qualitative information on vibration response is
      compared with spirometry in assessing lungs function of COPD and Asthma patients.
