  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to determine the bioequivalence among three commercial tablet
      formulations of MQ, i.e. Lariam, Mephaquin, and Mefloquine-(AC Farma) when given in
      combination with artesunate.

    <textblock>
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for mefloquine in whole blood from Peruvian
      subjects with uncomplicated falciparum malaria administered Mephaquin®, Mefloquine-AC Farma,
      and Lariam®. The Mefloquine-AC Farma arm comprised 13 patients while the reference (Lariam)
      and Mephaquin arms consisted of 12 patients. Although Cmax was significantly less (p=0.04) in
      the Mephaquin arm (AUC0-t = 2500 ng/ml/day) relative to the reference (AUC0-t = 2820
      ng/ml/day) arm, there were no significant differences in the AUC∞, tmax, and t1/2 for
      Mefloquine-AC Farma or Mephaquin relative to the reference. Except for the Cmax of the
      Mefloquine-AC Farma, the 90% confidence intervals for all parameters of both treatments were
      outside the specified FDA range of 80-125%. Therefore both formulations were not considered
      bioequivalent to the reference.
