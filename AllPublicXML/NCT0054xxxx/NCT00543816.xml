  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look to see if MK0767 works better than placebo in controlling blood sugar in
      patients with Type 2 Diabetes who are taking insulin but do not have adequate control of
      their blood sugar.

      This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is in progress and not
      publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants).
