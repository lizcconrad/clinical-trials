  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the fixed-dose combinations (FDC) KIVEXA™ (abacavir/lamivudine) and TRUVADA
      (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine) have facilitated the usage of once-daily
      regimens. However data from head-to-head randomized trials comparing these two FDCs as part
      of an initial regimen are not available at present. The long-term toxicity profiles of these
      regimens are of particular importance, as treatment of HIV is currently life-long and
      therefore, minimizing long-term toxicity and maximizing adherence and duration of regimen
      maintenance are critical therapy objectives.

      The primary endpoint is estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as measured by the
      modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) equation, a validated estimate of renal function.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), Calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation, at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 48 value minus the baseline value. GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. MDRD is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR in participants with impaired renal function based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175 * (Scr)^-1.154 * (Age)^-0.203 * (0.742 if female) * (1.212 if African American) (conventional units). mL, milliliters; min, minute; m^2, meters squared; Scr, serum creatinine; BMI, body mass index.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 48 value minus the baseline value. GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. MDRD is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR in participants with impaired renal function based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175 * (Scr)^-1.154 * (Age)^-0.203 * (0.742 if female) * (1.212 if African American) (conventional units). mL, milliliters; min, minute; m^2, meters squared; Scr, serum creatinine; BMI, body mass index.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), Calculated by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation, at Week 96</title>
        <description>Change from baseline was calculated as the Week 96 value minus the baseline value. GFR is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered by the kidney. MDRD is an equation (calculation) used to estimate GFR in participants with impaired renal function based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m^2) = 175 * (Scr)^-1.154 * (Age)^-0.203 * (0.742 if female) * (1.212 if African American) (conventional units). mL, milliliters; min, minute; m^s, meters squared; Scr, serum creatinine.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density (BMD), Measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), at Week 24</title>
        <description>BMD is a measure (grams [g] per centimeters cubed [cm^3]) of the mineral content of bone in a particular skeletal area. DXA scans use low energy x-rays to measure the density of bones. The standard error (SE) of both treatment groups was based on the model on the log scale.</description>
