  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW870086X is a novel inhaled steroid that has an improved safety profile over other steroids
      but is also less potent. This study will look at higher doses to confirm the improved safety
      profile.

      A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose ascending, 3-cohort parallel group study
      to measure the systemic cortisol profile and evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of GW870086X, administered as single doses (12mg and 15mg),and repeat doses
      over 3 days (6mg, 12mg and 15mg) in healthy male subjects.
