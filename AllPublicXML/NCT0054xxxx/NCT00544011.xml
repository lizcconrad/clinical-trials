      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and
      help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      irinotecan, fluorouracil, and capecitabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      bevacizumab together with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well bevacizumab given together with combination
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Evaluate the objective response (complete and partial) rate in patients with metastatic
           colorectal adenocarcinoma treated with bevacizumab and modified FOLFIRI 3 chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival.

        -  Determine the tolerance to this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the resectability rate.

        -  Evaluate biological markers predictive of the efficacy of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over
      90 minutes on days 1 and 3, and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      At 14 days after completing chemotherapy, patients with progressive or stable disease receive
      maintenance therapy comprising bevacizumab and capecitabine.

      Biological specimens are collected at baseline and before the fourth course of chemotherapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
