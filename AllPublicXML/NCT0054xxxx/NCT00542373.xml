    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate fluorescence imaging, widefield
      fluorescence imaging, point spectroscopy imaging methods, and or/ oral brush cytology that
      may help doctors monitor patients at an increased risk of developing an oral cancer,
      including those with pre-cancerous lesions in the mouth.

      The Imaging Methods:

      All tissue and cells are made of tiny particles. Some of these particles give off small
      amounts of light. This light is called fluorescence. Researchers have learned that cancerous
      cells and normal cells give off different amounts and different types of fluorescence and
      also reflect light differently. Researchers need to better understand whether fluorescence
      and reflectance of light from tissues in the mouth can be used to tell whether areas of the
      mouth are abnormal. This information may help doctors detect pre-cancers and early cancer.

      Fluorescence Imaging:

      Researchers have developed instruments that shine different wavelengths (colors) of light in
      the mouth and can collect and analyze fluorescence and reflected light. This is an imaging
      system that takes fluorescence pictures through a portable head light.

      A second, handheld device, named the Identafi 3000, is similar in size and shape to a
      standard dental mirror. It uses white, violet, and amber light to highlight abnormal tissue
      areas. The users, wearing special filter eyeglasses, can evaluate and identify changes in the
      mouth.

      Widefield Fluorescence Imaging:

      This is an imaging system that takes fluorescence and reflectance pictures through a dental
      microscope. Different colors of light are used to shine in the mouth and pictures are taken
      using a digital camera. Researchers hope to study the pictures to better understand the
      differences in fluorescence from normal and abnormal cells.

      Point Spectroscopy System:

      This study may also test a technique called fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy.

      Different colors of light are directed through fibers to the lining of the mouth and then
      light is collected and sent to a special camera and a computer to be analyzed. The
      spectroscopy system has a small probe about the size of a writing pen which is placed gently
      against the lining of the mouth. The exposed tissues will give off very small amounts of
      light called fluorescence. This light is not seen by the eye, but is seen by a computer.

      Brush Cytology:

      This is a method to analyze cells from the lining of the mouth. A brush is used to scrape
      cells from the mouth. The cells can then be stained and checked under a microscope for
      pre-cancerous changes.

      Study Procedures:

      If you agree to take part in this study, a researcher may use fluorescence and/or widefield
      fluorescence imaging instruments to take pictures of several areas in the mouth. Then, the
      researcher may gently place point spectroscopy probe on 1-4 normal-looking areas and 1-4
      abnormal areas. Different colors of light will be shone on the lining of the mouth through
      the probe. The light that returns from the tissue is collected through the probe and recorded
      on the computer.

      Then the researcher may press a brush inside your mouth and rotate 5-10 times to collect
      cells.

      Researchers will record whether the doctor thinks the area is normal, abnormal but not
      suspicious for cancer, pre-cancer, or cancer.

      If your doctor thinks it is necessary, as per standard of care, a biopsy of abnormal areas
      may be performed. If any biopsies are performed, the information learned from the tissue will
      be compared with the imaging and spectroscopy data.

      These procedures should take about 20 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study until you complete the 1-time imaging.

      If you agree to the optional procedures, you will be on study for as long as you continue to
      return to MD Anderson for clinic visits.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 300 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at MD Anderson.
