    <textblock>
      Approximately 10% of all couples will be diagnosed as infertile. The most efficient
      infertility treatment is In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). One major determinant for success is
      production of an adequate number of oocytes (eggs) from the female in order to finally have
      good-quality embryos and finally acceptable pregnancy and delivery rates. Some women will not
      respond adequately to hormonal stimulation and will only a small number of oocytes.
      Therefore, the chances of finally having a successful delivery are significantly reduced.
      Although the specific definition of this situation is controversial, these patients are
      diagnosed as having &quot;low ovarian response&quot;. This condition is more prevalent in older IVF
      patients as part of the reproductive aging process; it is possible at any age. Currently, the
      understanding of &quot;low ovarian response&quot; is limited, and although many therapeutic approaches
      have been suggested, no treatment has been proven significantly efficient.

      DHEA is a pro-hormone produced by the adrenal gland and the ovary. DHEA serum levels become
      lower with age and in some chronic diseases. Therefore, some believe it may be beneficial as
      an 'anti-aging' factor. DHEA pills are available as a food-supplement, without need for
      prescription in the US.

      DHEA is involved in the regulation of follicular growth in the ovaries. In a 2000 report,
      five IVF patients who had low ovarian response were treated with oral DHEA (Casson et al, Hum
      Reprod 2000;15:2129). A small increase in the ovarian response to hormonal stimulation was
      noticed. Barad and Gleicher reported their relatively extensive experience, summarizing
      treatment outcome in 25 IVF low-responders treated with oral DHEA pills (Barad and Gleicher,
      Hum Reprod 2006; 21, 2845). They observed increased increases in fertilized oocytes, normal
      day 3 embryos, and number of embryos transferred after DHEA treatment compared with a
      previous treatment outcome before DHEA.

      Based on this observation, DHEA may appear useful for improving IVF outcome in some patients.
      However, a prospective randomized study on DHEA supplementation for IVF patients was not yet
      published. Our aim is to conduct such a study, focusing on IVF patient with low ovarian
      response.
