      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate equivalent blood glucose control in patients with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin VIAject™ and regular human insulin as prandial insulin
      and to demonstrate an equivalent safety profile for VIAject™ in comparison to regular human
      insulin.

          -  Three months on a stable insulin regimen that meets the current standard of care.

          -  Age: 30 to 70 years.

          -  Body Mass Index: Not more than 45 Kg/m2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus as determined by the investigator.

          -  Patients being treated with a thiazolidinedione for less than 3 months.

          -  History of frequent severe hypoglycemia within the prior six months.

          -  Treatment with investigational diabetes drug in the last 3 months or treatment with
             any other investigational drug in the last 30 days before study entry.

          -  Current short-term treatment with systemic oral, injected, or inhaled corticosteroids.
             (inhaled corticosteroids may be allowed when the treatment is long-term).

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years except for basal cell epithelioma.

          -  Known significant hepatic disease or serum AST or ALT values ≥ 3 X upper limit of
             normal or bilirubin levels ≥ 1.5 X upper limit of normal.

          -  Severe complications of diabetes mellitus including a history or finding of Stage III
             or IV diabetic retinopathy, proteinuria &gt; 2+ by urine dipstick, serum creatinine of
             &gt;1.8 mg/dl for males or &gt;1.5 mg/dl for females, history of renal transplant, severe
             peripheral vascular disease which has resulted in an amputation, chronic foot ulcers
             claudication or absent pedal pulses.

          -  Known history of autonomic neuropathy.

          -  History of moderate to severe ketoacidosis within the 3 months preceding screening for
             the study.

             will impair patient safety or protocol compliance.

          -  Current significant cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal,
             neurological, psychiatric and/or hematological disease as evaluated by the

          -  Abnormal ECG, safety lab or physical examination results which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, render the participation of the patient in the study to be inappropriate
             or unsafe.

          -  A history of lack of compliance with medical instructions, recent drug or alcohol
             abuse, or other reasons which, in the opinion of the investigator, render the
             participation of the patient in the study to be inappropriate or unsafe.

          -  Current significant diseases of the adrenal gland, pituitary gland or thyroid at the
