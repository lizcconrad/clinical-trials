      The primary objective of this study (TOTXVI) is to compare the clinical benefit, the
      pharmacokinetics, and the pharmacodynamics of polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEG)
      asparaginase given in higher dose (HD PEG) versus those of PEG-asparaginase given in
      conventional dose (CD PEG) during the continuation phase.

      This study has several secondary objectives:

      Therapeutic Objectives:

      To estimate the event-free survival and overall survival of children with ALL who are treated
      with risk-directed therapy.

      To study whether intensifying induction, including fractionated cyclophosphamide and
      thioguanine, in patients with day 15 MRD &gt; 5%, will result in improved leukemia cytoreduction
      in this subgroup compared to TOTXV.

      To assess whether intensification of central nervous system (CNS)-directed intrathecal and
      systemic chemotherapy will improve outcome in patients at high risk of CNS relapse.

      Exploratory Pharmacologic Objectives:

      To identify pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic predictors for
      treatment-related outcomes in the context of the systemic therapy used in the protocol.

      To compare the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of PEG-asparaginase given in higher dose
      (3,500 or 3,000 units/m2) versus those of PEG-asparaginase given in conventional dose (2,500
      units/m2) in the continuation phase.

      Exploratory Biologic Objectives:

      To determine the prognostic value of levels of minimal residual disease in peripheral blood
      at day 8 of remission induction.

      To validate new markers and methods for MRD detection. To genotype natural killer (NK) cell
      receptors and measure their expressions at diagnosis and before reinduction, and to associate
      these features with treatment outcome.

      To identify new prognostic factors by applying new technologies to study patient material
      (e.g., stored plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and normal and leukemic cells).

      Exploratory Neuroimaging Objectives:

      To use quantitative MR measures (Diffusion Tensor Imaging and high resolution volumetric
      imaging) to assess differences in myelin and cortical thickness development in patients
      treated for ALL relative to healthy controls matched for age and gender.

      To assess the impact of folate pathway genetic polymorphisms on myelin and cortical thickness
      development and neurocognitive performance.

      To assess the impact of frontal-parietal lobe myelin and cortical thickness development on
      neurocognitive performance in attention, working memory, fluency, visual-spatial reasoning
      and processing speed.

           triple intrathecal treatment on days 4, 8, 11, and 22.[t(1;19)/E2A-PBX1.

           Induction treatment will begin with prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin,

      intramuscularly (IM) Day 1. Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV, Day 1. Cytarabine 300 mg/m2 IV,
      Day 1. Dexamethasone 12 mg/m2 (std/high risk) or 8 mg/m2 (low risk) PO daily (divided t.i.d.)
      for 5 days, Day 1-5 (between week 21 and week 68).Decrease dexamethasone to 6 mg/m2 PO daily
      (divided t.i.d.) x 5 days,Day 1-5 between week 69 and week 101 for all risk groups.

      Vincristine2 mg/m2 IV push (max 2 mg), Day 1 (0.05mg/kg for patients &lt; 1 year or &lt; 10 kg).

      PEG-ASP 2,500 vs 3,500 units/m2 IV randomization (until week 30)

      Dexamethasone, vincristine, and asparaginase will be given regardless of blood counts,
      provided that the patient is clinically well. Cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine
      and methotrexate will be held if WBC &lt;1000/mm3 or ANC &lt;300/mm3. Mercaptopurine and
      methotrexate will be reduced for WBC &lt; 1500/mm3, or if WBC and ANC do not increase by at
      least 2 folds a week after the start date of dexamethasone pulse. Doses of cyclophosphamide
      and cytarabine may need to be reduced if patient misses 25% of chemotherapy and if the low
      counts deem to be related to this combination.

      The same treatment (weeks 30-37) will be repeated for a total of 5 times, until week 69 (see
      Section 5.5.3 for intrathecal therapy). After week 69, all patients will receive daily
      mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate interrupted with pulses of dexamethasone, vincristine,
      and mercaptopurine every 4 weeks. The dose of dexamethasone will be decreased to 6 mg/m2
      between week 69 and week 101, after which only mercaptopurine and methotrexate will be given.
      Intrathecal treatment will be given every 8 weeks only to patients at risk of CNS relapse
      after week 49 and will be discontinued after week 97. Continuation therapy will be
      discontinued after 120 weeks.

      Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (for patients who meet the criteria of high-risk ALL
      are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation). However, if the
      option is declined by the patients or guardians, or the procedure is deemed unsuitable by the
      attending physician and the principal investigator, the patient will remain on study and
      continue to receive chemotherapy.
