  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vision loss can result in feelings of frustration, helplessness, anxiety, depression, and
      anger, which compromise a person's activities of everyday living. While emotional distress
      may resolve in some persons without intervention, unmanaged and persistent distress places
      the person at risk for continued decrements in health status and the potential development of
      more severe conditions (i.e., depression, poor health outcomes). Persons with low vision will
      be recruited and randomly assigned to either an innovative, problem-solving training (PST)
      intervention group designed specifically for persons with low vision or a sham
      intervention/control group. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed at baseline prior
      to intervention and at 3 month follow-up, 7 month follow-up, 12 month follow-up, and 24 month
      follow-up by a research interviewer masked to participants' randomization. This project will:
      (1) demonstrate how specified physical and emotional outcomes of persons with low vision
      change across time, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of a PST intervention that will be
      delivered to persons with low vision; and (3) identify persons with low vision who are at
      risk for adverse emotional and health outcomes.
