        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any medical history or clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening
             medical examination, vital sign measurement, 12-lead ECG recording and/or clinical
             laboratory examination that is deemed by the principal investigator and/or medical
             monitor to make the subject ineligible for inclusion because of a safety concern.

          -  Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disorders and other conditions
             known to be associated with chronic inflammation (e.g. Inflammatory Bowel Disease).

             allowed at doses of ≤ 2g/day.

          -  Participation in a clinical study where the subject has received a drug or new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the

             the past 6 months and/or liver function tests (bilirubin, ALT, AST) above upper limit
             of normal at Screening.

          -  A known history of Gilbert's Syndrome.

          -  History of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.

          -  QTc interval &gt; 450msec.

          -  An unwillingness of male subjects to abstain from sexual intercourse with pregnant or
             lactating women; or an unwillingness of the male subject to use a condom/spermicide in
             addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception, such as: an
             intrauterine devise (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable
             progesterone, subdermal implants or a tubal ligation, if the woman could become
             pregnant from the first dose of study medication until completion of follow-up
             procedures.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within 56 days prior to dosing.
