  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observer blind study is to assess the safety in terms of fever &gt;39°C
      (rectal temperature) and the immunogenicity in terms of antibody response following a booster
      vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine GSK 1024850A at 12 to 18 months of age in children
      previously primed with the same vaccines including a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
      co-administered with a diphtheria, tetanus, whole cell pertussis (DTPw)-combined vaccine and
      OPV or IPV vaccines. Subjects participating in this study should have received three doses of
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the primary study.

      This protocol posting deals with objectives &amp; outcome measures of the booster phase. The
      objectives &amp; outcome measures of the primary phase are presented in a separate protocol
      posting (NCT number = NCT00344318)
