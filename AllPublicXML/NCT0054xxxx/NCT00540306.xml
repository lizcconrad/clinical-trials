  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to do determine the changes in physiological and optical
      properties in healthy pre-menopausal breast tissue during the menstrual cycle using Diffuse
      Optical Spectroscopy. The Researcher can determine 1) how large variations in breast tissue
      components are 2) how predictable and repeatable these variations are 3) the effects of
      endogenous hormones on breast tissue physiology.

      Variations in breast physiology due to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle can
      correlate to quantitative changes in Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy functional parameters such
      as hemoglobin, lipid and water concentration and tissue scattering. Diffuse Optical
      Spectroscopy imaging can show increase blood flow in breast tissue after ovulation with a
      concomitant increase in mitotic activity, changes in hemoglobin concentration and in tissue
      scattering. Increases in fibroglandular breast tissue after ovulation have also been
      observed. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy imaging can determine after time of ovulation has been
      detected during the two months of self-monitoring.
