      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and mechanisms of possible chemopreventive
      effects of synthetic genistein (BONISTEIN™) in patients with localized prostate cancer
      undergoing laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.

      In Norway prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in the male and represents
      the second most common cause of cancer death among men. Epidemiological studies have shown an
      association between decreased prostate cancer risk and increased soy consumption. Genistein
      is the dominating plasma and tissue isoflavone in soybean products, and it has been
      attributed several anti-cancer effects. BONISTEIN™ is a novel product, consisting of &gt;99,5 %
      synthetic Genistein aglycone. Chemoprevention is the ability of certain molecules to inhibit
      (partially or totally) induction or progression of the disease. Our study population consists
      of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer who have agreed to undergo radical
      prostatectomy. This provides adequate amount of benign, premalignant and malignant tissue for
      studying the effects of potential chemopreventive agents on biomarkers of cell growth and
      differentiation in the prostatic tissues with immunohistochemistry. Prostatic tissue cells
      will also be selected with Lacer Capture Microdissection (LCM) before analysis with
      semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
