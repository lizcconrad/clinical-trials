  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine whether a telephone-based counseling intervention can
      help survivors of breast and colorectal cancer increase their weekly physical activity.
      Observational evidence suggests that physical activity after breast and colorectal cancer
      diagnosis decreases recurrence rates. Unfortunately, many people become less active during
      cancer therapy, and a substantial proportion never return to pre-diagnosis levels of physical
      activity. This study looks to see if people who have recently finished chemotherapy for
      breast, colon or rectal cancer can be motivated to increase their exercise by talking to an
      exercise specialist over the phone. The study also looks at changes in mood, fatigue,
      fitness, fat distribution and weight.
