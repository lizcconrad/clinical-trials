      Conflicting results have been reported concerning the association of pseudoexfoliation
      syndrome (PXF) and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Schumacher et al. reported an
      association between AAA and PXF, with no consideration of grade. However, a later study did
      not confirm the association between AAA and PXF. The present study aimed at comparing the
      relative prevalence of PXF in patients suffering from AAA and in age-matched hypertensive
      patients.

        follow-up and hypertensive patients without abdominal aortic aneurism and that were more
        than 60 years old to have similar mean ages in both groups, as pseudoexfoliation and
        abdominal aortic aneurism are age-related disorders
