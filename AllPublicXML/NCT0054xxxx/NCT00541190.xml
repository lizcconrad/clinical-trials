  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this overall project is to develop a new aerosol-based technique for
      quantifying liquid absorption in the airways of subjects with cystic fibrosis(CF) that can be
      used to help develop new therapies. In CF, mutations in the CF gene result in dysfunction of
      the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) ion channel on the cells that
      line the airway epithelium, causing improper fluxes of ions such as sodium, chloride, and
      bicarbonate. The so called &quot;low volume&quot; hypothesis of CF pathogenesis contends that abnormal
      absorption of ions from the airways causes excessive absorption of liquid, resulting in an
      airway surface liquid layer that is dehydrated and difficult to clear. Here we are measuring
      the absorption rate of a radiolabeled small molecule (DTPA) from the lungs of cystic fibrosis
      patients and healthy controls. We hypothesize that the molecule will absorb more quickly in
      cystic fibrosis patients. Further studies will be performed to determine if DTPA absorption
      is related to liquid absorption in the airways.

    <time_frame>single measurement</time_frame>
    <description>The absorptive clearance rate is the percentage of the radiolabeled small molecule DTPA that is cleared through absorption over a 60 minute period. Total DTPA clearance includes absorptive and mucociliary components. The mucociliary component is determined by measuring the clearance of a radiolabeled particle over the same period (Technetium 99m sulfur colloid; Tc-SC), and subtracted from total DTPA clearance in order to determine the absorptive component. Here we specifically report absorption from the central lung zone to capture the behavior within the airways.</description>

    <measure>Mucociliary Clearance Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>single measurement</time_frame>
    <description>Mucociliary clearance rate represents the rate at which the lungs clear an inhaled particulate. Here it specifically represents the percentage of inhaled Technetium 99m sulfur colloid cleared from the lungs over a 60 minute period. This is reported based on &quot;whole lung&quot; areas to allow comparisons with previous studies.</description>

        <title>Mucociliary Clearance Rate</title>
        <description>Mucociliary clearance rate represents the rate at which the lungs clear an inhaled particulate. Here it specifically represents the percentage of inhaled Technetium 99m sulfur colloid cleared from the lungs over a 60 minute period. This is reported based on &quot;whole lung&quot; areas to allow comparisons with previous studies.</description>
        <time_frame>single measurement</time_frame>
        <population>No formal power analysis was performed for this pilot study. Two subjects (one CF, one control) were identified as obvious outliers with whole lung Tc-SC clearance rates more than two standard deviations above the average of the group. These outliers were excluded from further analyses.</population>
