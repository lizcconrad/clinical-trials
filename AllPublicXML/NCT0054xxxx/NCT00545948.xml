      This study assigned subjects to either cisplatin/vinorelbine or cisplatin/pemetrexed
      chemotherapy using a genomic based expression profile to determine chemotherapy sensitivity
      in completely resected early stage non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
      vinorelbine-sensitive tumors group received Vinorelbine followed by cisplatin, while the
      pemetrexed-sensitive tumors group received pemetrexed followed by cisplatin. The primary
      objective of this trial was to determine whether genomic-based adjuvant chemotherapy
      treatment increased the 2-year progression-free survival rate in completely resected patients
      with NSCLC compared to historic controls. Secondary objectives included: 1) estimation of the
      percentage of completely resected NSCLC tumors that can be adequately analyzed and used to
      direct specific adjuvant chemotherapy; 2) estimation of the proportion of patients who are
      assigned to treatment with vinorelbine and pemetrexed; 3) evaluation of drug sensitivity
      patterns of cisplatin and pemetrexed in both treatment arms; 4) description of the overall
      median survival experience of treated patients; and 5) assessment of patient understanding
      and perceptions of participating in a clinical trial evaluating cancer genomics for adjuvant
      treatment of early stage lung cancer.

      The proposed study is a multi-center open label phase II study of the chemotherapy doublets
      cisplatin/vinorelbine and cisplatin/pemetrexed as adjuvant therapy in early stage
      non-squamous NSCLC.

      Eligible patients had no previous treatment for the current diagnosis of NSCLC. The two
      treatment groups of patients will be determined by gene expression profile analysis of each
      patient's tumor: one group of vinorelbine-sensitive patients and one group of
      pemetrexed-sensitive patients. The genomic expression profiling that was utilized generated a
      percentage for likelihood of chemotherapy sensitivity. Patients were directed to receive the
      chemotherapy regimen for which the percentage of predicted sensitivity is highest. For
      instance, if the model predicted the likelihood of tumor sensitivity was 46% to vinorelbine
      and 48% to pemetrexed, then the adjuvant chemotherapy would be directed to
      cisplatin/pemetrexed. Patients whose tumors could not be adequately analyzed for gene
      expression were offered adjuvant therapy off protocol as deemed appropriate by their primary
      oncologist. Patients with either squamous or non-squamous cell histology were eligible to
      participate in this study as indicated in study protocols dated prior to January 25, 2010. An
      amendment to the protocol on January 25, 2010 indicated inclusion of only non-squamous
      histology. However, because of low accrual after January 25, 2010 (5 patients, including 2
      screen failures), this report reflects the original study outcomes that includes both
      squamous and non-squamous histologies.

      Thirty-one patients with stage IB (&gt; 4 cm), II or IIIA non-squamous NSCLC were enrolled, from
      which 24 were assigned treatment. The vinorelbine-sensitive tumors group received Vinorelbine
      25 mg/m2 days 1 and 8, followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 day 1, every 21 days for 4 cycles. The
      pemetrexed-sensitive tumors group received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 day 1 followed by cisplatin
      75 mg/m2 day 1, every 21 days for 4 cycles. Standard pre-medication regimens included
      dexamethasone, vitamin B12 and folate supplementation in the pemetrexed group. Patients in
      both groups will receive up to a maximum of 4 cycles of therapy.

      Subsequent reevaluation of the genomic signatures of chemotherapy sensitivity have shown that
      they were irreproducible, suggesting inaccurate patient assignments into the two treatment
      arms. As a result, it would be inappropriate to separately analyze outcomes for the different
      treatment groups. Instead, information from both arms will be combined to reflect the overall
      measure of two-year progression-free survival in this study. Similarly for secondary
      objectives, both arms will be combined to address endpoints.

      To assess patient understanding and perceptions of participating in a clinical trial
      evaluating cancer genomics for adjuvant treatment of early stage lung cancer, patients
      provided responses for the following questions at baseline:

        1. Did your doctor talk to you today about choosing chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer
           based on the genomics of your tumor?

        2. How well did you understand what you doctor told you about choosing chemotherapy based
           on the genomics of your tumor? (circle a number between 1 and 7, where 1 = very poorly
           and 7 = very well)

        3. Do you think the type of chemotherapy that you will get is based on the genomics of your
           tumor?

        4. Do you think you will get better medical care for the treatment of your lung cancer if
           it is based on the genomics of your tumor?

        5. To what extent do you think treating lung cancer based on the genomics of the tumor will
           lead to more successful treatment strategies? (circle a number between 1 and 7, where 1
           = definitely will not lead to a more successful treatment and 7 = definitely will lead
           to a more successful treatment)

        6. How effective do you think chemotherapy will be at stopping your cancer from coming
           back? (circle a number between 1 and 7, where 1 = not at all effective and 7 =
           completely effective)

        7. To what extent is YOUR lung cancer primarily caused by genetics? (circle a number
           between 1 and 7, where 1 = not at all caused by genetics and 7 = completely caused by
           genetics)

        8. To what extent to do you think your lung cancer is treatable? (circle a number between 1
           and 7, where 1 = definitely not treatable and 7 = definitely treatable)

        9. Did your doctor talk to you about your chance of your lung cancer coming back? (Yes - go
           to question 10, No - go to question 11, Do not know - go to question 11)

       10. What did your doctor say was your chance of your cancer coming back? (Low Risk, Moderate
           or intermediate risk, High risk, Do not know)

       11. What do you think is your chance of your lung cancer coming back in the next year on a
           scale from 1 to 7 where 1=definitely will not come back and 7=definitely will come back?

       12. How worried are you that your lung cancer will come back in the next year? (circle a
           number between 1 and 7, where 1=not at all worried and 7=extremely worried)

    <description>Progression-free survival time was defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first date of disease progression or death as a result of any cause. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Time was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for patients who were still alive and have not progressed. The two-year progression free survival rate is a percentage, representing the fraction of treated patients who, after two years, are disease free or alive.</description>

    <description>Using genomics-based prediction models previously developed separately for cisplatin and pemetrexed, the probability that each patient was sensitive or would respond to treatment was computed. Quartiles describe the patterns of drug sensitivity probabilities. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles are the sensitivity levels at which 25%, 50%, and 75% of patients have lower sensitivity. There is lack of integrity regarding the available data due to irreproducible genomic signatures. Therefore the results of this outcome are not presented.</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival time was defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the first date of disease progression or death as a result of any cause. Progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as references the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Time was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for patients who were still alive and have not progressed.

          <title>2-Year Overall Survival in Patients Treated for NSCLC</title>
          <description>Overall survival time was defined as the time from initiation of study treatment to the date of death as a result of any cause. Time was censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for patients who were still alive. The two-year overall survival rate is a percentage, representing the fraction of treated patients who, after two years, are alive</description>
          <population>Due to the irreproducible nature of the genomic signatures of chemotherapeutic sensitivity, analyses based on separate treatment groups were inappropriate. Therefore, all enrolled participants (initiated for treatment) from both treatment arms were analyzed together.</population>

        <title>Compare Drug Sensitivity Patterns of Cisplatin and Pemetrexed in Both Treatment Arms</title>
        <description>Using genomics-based prediction models previously developed separately for cisplatin and pemetrexed, the probability that each patient was sensitive or would respond to treatment was computed. Quartiles describe the patterns of drug sensitivity probabilities. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles are the sensitivity levels at which 25%, 50%, and 75% of patients have lower sensitivity. There is lack of integrity regarding the available data due to irreproducible genomic signatures. Therefore the results of this outcome are not presented.</description>
