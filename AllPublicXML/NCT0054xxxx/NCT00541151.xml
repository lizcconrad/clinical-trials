      Multi-center, prospective, single arm study. Qualify patients will receive treatment for
      stress urinary incontinence by implantation of an AMS Sling System. The study is a long-term
      evaluation of effectiveness and safety associated with AMS sling systems.

    <textblock>
      This study is a post market study to evaluate variables of the implantation, safety, and
      outcomes in a representative population (SUI) indicated for AMS sling systems at various time
      points. The study duration is 2 year with an estimated 200 enrollment. The outcomes of the
      treatment will be evaluated via pad weight test, cough stress test, QoLs,and other patient
      administered questionnaires.
