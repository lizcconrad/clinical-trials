  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial in a
      parallel-group design. Aim of the study is the evaluation of tumor-free survival after
      ablation (by APC, argon plasma coagulation) of Barrett's mucosa plus esomeprazole versus
      surveillance without ablation in patients cured from Barrett's cancer combined with
      randomization of esomeprazole vs placebo for symptomatic reflux control after successful
      ablation of Barrett's mucosa .

      There are two hypotheses: (1) Consecutive thermal ablation of metaplastic, non-neoplastic
      long segments of Barrett's esophagus (&gt;2cm)plus esomeprazole after successful endoscopic
      therapy of mucosal cancer by means of ER will decrease the incidence of secondary cancer
      (local recurrence and metachronous cancer) by a minimum of 50% compared to acid suppression
      alone without ablation within a 5-years follow-up (primary endpoint). (2) After successful
      ablation of Barrett's esophagus patients need ongoing acid suppression therapy for medical
      control of their underlying reflux disease (secondary aim of the study).

      Duration of the study:

      Patient recruitment period: 3 years. Follow-up period: 5 years. Total duration: 8 years. The
      study is already in the recruitment period.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Intermediate results have shown a significant difference in the outcome of ablation and
    non-ablation patients. Therefore, the study was stopped.
