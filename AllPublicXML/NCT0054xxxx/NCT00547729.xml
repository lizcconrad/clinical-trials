      Most people with heart failure take a number of medications that work in different ways.
      Patients and their families need to keep track of prescribed medications and follow
      instructions on how much to take and when to take them. Currently, doctors are guided
      primarily by symptoms. The device being studied in this trial (called the HeartPOD™ System)
      monitors heart function from inside your body and alerts the patient and physician of
      necessary changes to your medication.

      The Sponsor believes that direct measurements from your heart may provide an accurate,
      reliable and medically acceptable way of telling you and your doctor that your CHF is
      worsening hours to days before the above symptoms would develop and you would notice. This
      may enable you and your doctor to take preventative measures and avoid hospitalization.
