    <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were ecchymosis, pain, redness and swelling at injection site. Any = incidence of a particular symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal everyday activity. Grade 3 redness/swelling/ecchymosis = redness/swelling/ecchymosis spreading beyond 50 millimeters (mm) of the injection site. All solicited local symptoms assessed were considered by the investigator as related to study vaccination.</description>

    <description>Titers are presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/Solomon Islands (A/SOL), A/Wisconsin (A/WIS) and B/Malaysia (B/MAL). The seropositivity cut-off assay was 1:10.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Seroconverted Subjects Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/Solomon Islands (A/SOL), A/Wisconsin (A/WIS) and B/Malaysia (B/MAL).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Seroprotected Subjects Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and 21</time_frame>
    <description>A seroprotected subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had a serum HI titer ≥ 1:40. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/Solomon Islands (A/SOL), A/Wisconsin (A/WIS) and B/Malaysia (B/MAL).</description>

    <measure>Seroconversion Factor for HI Antibodies Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>

    <description>The seroconversion factor (SCF) was defined as the fold increase in serum Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) post vaccination compared to Day 0. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/Solomon Islands (A/SOL), A/Wisconsin (A/WIS) and B/Malaysia (B/MAL).</description>

        <description>Assessed solicited local symptoms were ecchymosis, pain, redness and swelling at injection site. Any = incidence of a particular symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal everyday activity. Grade 3 redness/swelling/ecchymosis = redness/swelling/ecchymosis spreading beyond 50 millimeters (mm) of the injection site. All solicited local symptoms assessed were considered by the investigator as related to study vaccination.</description>
