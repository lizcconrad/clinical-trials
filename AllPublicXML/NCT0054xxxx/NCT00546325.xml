    <textblock>
      Primary:

      To assess the effects of rimonabant on HbA1c in patients with Type 2 diabetes who are
      overweight or obese (Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 27 kg/m² and BMI &lt; 40 kg/m²), have uncontrolled
      HbA1c (7.0% - 9.0% inclusive) and are currently on maximal tolerated doses of two Oral Anti
      Diabetic medications - Metformin (Met) and Sulfonylurea (SU).

      Secondary:

      To assess the effects of rimonabant on Anthropometric measures, Glucose measures, Lipid
      measures, Other measures and changes in quality of life
