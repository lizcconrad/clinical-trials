  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there is a strong rationale to supplement gravid patients suffering intrauterine
      growth restriction (IUGR) or preeclampsia with Arginine or other nitric oxide donors,
      evidence in the literature has been inconclusive. The current study was designed to determine
      whether oral treatment with L-Arginine, a nitric oxide (NO) donor, would enhance birth weight
      and/or decrease neonatal morbidity in pregnancies with severe vascular intrauterine growth
      restriction (IUGR).

      Patients and Methods: 44 patients with a singleton pregnancy who had been referred for IUGR
      detected by ultrasonic examination were included. Vascular IUGR was defined by fetal
      abdominal circumference less than or equal to the third percentile, associated with abnormal
      uterine Doppler. After double blind randomization, patients received either 14 g/day of
      L-arginine (90 mL syrup, Veyron France Laboratories), or a placebo. Doppler ultrasound
      examination of the uterine, umbilical and cerebral circulation, and of ductus venosus was
      performed prior to inclusion, after 7 days of treatment, and the day before delivery.
      Ultrasound examination was performed upon randomization, and weekly until birth. Venous blood
      and urine samples were collected before initiation and after 7 days of treatment, and both
      maternal and umbilical venous samples were obtained at delivery for nitrate and nitrite
      (NO2-/ NO3-) determination.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Multicenter randomized trial.

          -  Patients with a singleton pregnancy with IUGR defined by fetal abdominal circumference
             less than or equal to the third percentile for gestational age, and abnormal uterine
             Doppler. Uterine Doppler was considered pathologic if Pourcelot's resistance index
             (S-D/S) was equal to or higher than 0.7, and/or if an obvious notch was present. If
             the placenta was not median, the side of the pathologic Doppler had to be on the same
             side as the placenta

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute fetal distress

          -  Non vascular and non severe IUGR (normal uterine doppler scans and/or abdominal
             circumference &gt; 3rd percentile)

          -  Maternal immune disorder

          -  IUGR from an infectious etiology

          -  IUGR associated with fetal malformation, multifetal pregnancy, and preeclampsia upon
             inclusion
