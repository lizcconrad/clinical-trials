  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the phytoestrogen genistein is effective in
      improving bone condition in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women suffering for
      osteopenia. Since, during the study the investigators realized that at least 70% of
      post-menopausal recruited women suffered for metabolic syndrome (MS), we have added only in
      these women, as secondary outcome measures, the evaluation of markers of cardiovascular risk.

    <textblock>
      MS prevalence increases after the onset of menopause, because of estrogen deficiency. It is
      still not clear if menopause itself increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in al women
      or only in those that develop MS. Many MS patients that show slight modification in
      cardiovascular and metabolic parameters are not generally pharmacologically treated since
      diabetes or alteration in the lipid profile are not evidenced. In this respect it is of
      importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat MS. Genistein
      (4,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), shown a potentially preventive role on the cardiovascular
      apparatus in post-menopausal women, may be termed as selective ER modulator (SERM), since it
      reveals both ER-alpha full agonist and ER-beta partial agonist activity.

      The investigators studied whether genistein may represent an efficacious and safe alternative
      for reducing vascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. The clinical
      study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 150 patients with
      metabolic syndrome. After a 4-week stabilization on a standard fat-reduced diet, participants
      were randomly assigned to receive either phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/day) or placebo for 6
      months. At baseline and following treatment fasting plasma glucose, insulin, insulin
      resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid concentrations, plasma total homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin
      and visfatin were measured. Bioimpedentiometric and nutritional analysis, as well as a safety
      assessment of the endometrium and vagina were also performed.

    <description>Participants were asked about symptoms at clinic visits every 6 months. Standard clinical evaluations and laboratory analyses, including hematologic, renal, and liver function tests, were done every 6 months. Endometrial thickness was evaluated by using ultrasonography at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. The endometrial thickness was measured in the sagittal plane from 1 basal layer to the other. If the endometrial thickness was 8 mm or greater or if uterine bleeding occurred, hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were performed. All unfavorable and unintended clinical effects were considered adverse effects and were evaluated for severity, duration, seriousness, and relation to the study drug and outcome.</description>
