    <measure>Number of participants with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to follow up (approximately 56 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (MO) in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP and can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with its use. The SAE was any untoward MO that, at any dose, results in death, life threatening, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, congenital abnormality or birth defect, that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention.</description>

    <description>The first occurrence of the maximum observed concentration determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. Cmax for GSK256066 is presented. As GSK614917 concentrations were generally non-quantifiable, no summary statistics were derived for GSK614917 pharmacokinetic parameters due to the large number of missing values resulting from non-quantifiable concentration-time data.
