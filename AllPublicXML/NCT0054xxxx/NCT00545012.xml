    <textblock>
      This long-term open label follow-up trial gave pediatric subjects suffering from typical
      absences in CAE or JAE the opportunity to continue levetiracetam treatment after
      participation in the pilot study (study N162) or the double-blind study (study N163). Safety
      and efficacy data were obtained.
