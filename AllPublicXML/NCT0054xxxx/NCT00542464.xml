  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 7 consecutive daily i.v. doses of Imprime PGG versus placebo when administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the frequency, type, and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (AE).</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>-To determine the pharmacodynamics of 7 consecutive daily intravenous doses of Imprime PGG by assessing the number of subjects who experience a 15% or more increase from baseline in the percentage of neutrophils with primed complement receptor (CR3).</measure>
    <time_frame>Prospective</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>-To derive the pharmacokinetic profile of 7 consecutive daily intravenous doses of Imprime PGG when administered to healthy adult subjects by assessing the plasma concentration of Imprime PGG versus time profiles.</measure>
