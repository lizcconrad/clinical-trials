    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a treatment of full thickness wounds by the
      dermal substitute Matriderm, split skin graft and VAC treatment will improve scar quality,
      demonstrated by a significant increase of skin elasticity parameters after 3 months.

      Additionally, an increase of the take of graft and improvement of scar assessment scale, scar
      colour/pigmentation and time to complete wound closure, is expected.

      The standard therapy for full thickness wounds is transplantation with a split thickness skin
      graft. However, scars usually develop as a result of this therapy. Previous research has
      demonstrated an improvement of scar quality if a dermal substitute was applied in combination
      with a split skin graft in reconstructive wounds, but not so much in burn wounds. One of the
      problems in burn wounds was the retarded outgrowth of the skin graft when a dermal substitute
      was applied in a one step procedure with the graft. Since then, application of topical
      negative pressure has demonstrated that the take and outgrowth of a skin graft can be
      improved by this technique. It now seems feasible to combine these two technologies in order
      to improve the quality of healing of burn wounds in the acute phase of healing.

      Aim of the study is to investigate if application of a dermal substitute in combination with
      topical negative pressure can improve the quality of the scar in burn wounds.
