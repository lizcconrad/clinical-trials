      Objective--- Benfluorex may have effects on the glucose control in type 2 diabetes while it
      improves hyperlipidemia. We sought to compare the impacts of benfluorex versus metformin on
      glucose control and insulin secretion in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients.

      Research design and methods—--a 16-week, double-blind, multiple centers, random parallel
      controlled study is designed to compare the impact of benfluorex (150-450mg/day, provided by
      Shandong Xinhua Pharmaceutical Company Limited in China) on glucose control, insulin
      secretion and its safety with metformin in type 2 diabetic patients. 240 type 2 diabetic
      patients are to be recruited to receive benfluorex or metformin(1:1). HbA1c, plasma lipid
      level, insulin and glucose at 0', 30', 120' after a standard meal will be measured before and
      after treatment, while fasting and postprandial glucose measured 4 times regularly. The
      change of HbA1c from baseline to the end of treatment will taken as main efficacy criterion,
      as the changes of fasting and after standard meal glucose and insulin level and plasma lipid
      level will be taken as secondary criteria. All patient will be given safety monitor at prior
      and post treatment. Data management and statistical analysis will adopt DAS for Clinical
      Trial 2.0.

      During the whole study, patients meet a physician on a regular basis. Safety is assessed by
      adverse event spontaneous reporting、physical examination、recording of vital signs、laboratory
      tests and electrocardiogram at baseline and 16 week . Blood samples are collected for
      centralized measure of HbA1C and fasting serum insulin(FSI)、PSI1/2、PSI2 after an overnight
      fast in all patients,Body weight, supine and standing blood pressures and heart rate are
      measured at each clinical visit. Adverse events are rated as mild, moderate or severe by the
      investigators and assessed for any causal relationship to the study drugs. Patients are
      entitled to interrupt the treatment at any time during the study, and investigators can
      withdraw patients, in particular if they are inadequately controlled.
