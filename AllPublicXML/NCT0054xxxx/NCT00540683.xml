  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researcher can use Diffuse Optical spectroscopy technique that uses harmless levels of
      near-infrared light to probe the concentrations and states of important physiological
      molecules such as hemoglobin water and lipids in human muscle,.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The researcher can monitor muscle physiology, for example during exercise or in response to
      external factors such as shock by Diffuse Optical spectroscopy technique.

      The Diffuse Optical spectroscopy technique can determine significant changes in muscle,
      muscle structure, muscle tissues metabolism and hemodynamics.
