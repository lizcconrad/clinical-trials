    <textblock>
      The trial is a Phase II, open-label trial in healthy subjects aged 18 to 60 years to support
      the immunogenicity data from previous clinical studies.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe the immune response 21 days after each vaccination.

        -  To describe the safety profiles following each vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Systemic hypersensitivity to any component of the vaccine or a life-threatening
             reaction after previous administration of a vaccine containing the same substances
             (egg proteins, chick proteins, thimerosal, aluminum, neomycin, formaldehyde, and
             octoxinol 9).

          -  Febrile illness (oral temperature &gt;= 37.5Â°C) on the day of inclusion.

          -  Previous vaccination with an avian flu vaccine.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial (drug, device, or medical procedure) within 4 weeks
             prior to the first vaccination.

          -  Planned participation in another clinical trial during the present trial period.

          -  Congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, or receipt of immunosuppressive therapy such

          -  Receipt of blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months, that might interfere
             with the assessment of immune response.

          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the first trial vaccination.

          -  Planned receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks following any trial vaccination.
