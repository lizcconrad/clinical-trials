      of a distal radius fracture in post-menopausal women and men in comparison to placebo to
      determine if healing time of the fracture can be decreased.

        immobilization device men (&gt;35 years &lt;80) post-menopausal women (&lt;80 yr)

        Full In/Ex crit. and EPs as per Amendment 1, dated 7 Feb 08 Subject is willing and able to
        provide written informed consent Unilateral, extra-articular distal radius fractures
        AO/ASIF types 23-A2 and 23-A3 are permissible. (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen
        [AO]/ Association for the Study of Internal Fixation [ASIF]). Multiple fractures of bones,
        other than the limb with the distal radius fracture, are permissible if the subject can
        perform the protocol-required procedures.

        Received conservative treatment of the distal radius fracture, including closed reduction
        and immobilization device (such as cast, splint, or brace) Ambulatory male and female
        subjects aged ≥35 to &lt;80 years of age who have sustained a closed, unilateral, fracture of
        the distal radius no more than 5 days prior to randomization.

        Females of non child-bearing potential defined as: &gt;1 year postmenopausal, which can be &gt;1
        year of spontaneous amenorrhea or &gt;1 year post surgical bilateral oophorectomy. Use
        follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] levels &gt;40mIU/mL to confirm surgical postmenopausal
        status, where bilateral oophorectomy status is uncertain. Females of child-bearing
        potential must have a negative urine bhCG pregnancy test at the Screening visit and agree
        to practice acceptable highly effective methods of birth control throughout the duration of
        the study. Highly effective birth control methods include those preventative measures taken
        to avoid pregnancy that have a failure rate of less than 1% per year.

        Subject who, in the opinion of the investigator, is willing and able to comply with the
        requirements of the protocol, including ability to understand patient reported outcomes
