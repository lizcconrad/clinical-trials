  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test an experimental drug called OROS® hydromorphone hydrochloride (HCl), a
      once daily opioid analgesic that can relieve pain. A large number of clinical studies have
      been conducted to test this drug. NMED-1077 is still being tested and is not approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for sale in the United States. OROS® hydromorphone HCl is
      currently approved in Europe to treat chronic pain.

      The purpose of this study is to compare NMED-1077 to placebo to see if NMED-1077 is safe and
      efficacious.

          6. Patients who require daily scheduled opioid analgesics for low back pain for at least
             2 months prior to the screening visit.

          7. Patients with a daily opioid requirement of ≥ 60 mg oral morphine equivalent (≥ 12 mg
             hydromorphone), but ≤ 320 mg morphine (≤ 64 mg hydromorphone) per day within the 2
             months prior to the screening visit.

          8. Patients who, in the Investigator's opinion, are on a stable dose (≥ 2 weeks) of all
             prior analgesics (both opioid and non-opioid) prior to the screening visit.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential including those who have had a tubal
             ligation surgery but excluding those who have not experienced a menstrual period for a
             minimum of 2 years, must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening visit, and
