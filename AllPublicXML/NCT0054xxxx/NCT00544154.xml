      The main purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of CDP870 in treating RA
      signs/symptoms in patients who were partial responders to MTX. Other purposes were to show
      additional efficacy without increased toxicity and the immunogenic response to CDP870 during
      combined CDP870 and MTX therapy.
