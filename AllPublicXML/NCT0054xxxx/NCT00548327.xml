  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether Atomoxetine improves cognition in healthy volunteers as well
      as patients with schizophrenia. Atomoxetine is a drug that has been Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved for Attention Deficit Disorder and allegedly increase the
      amount of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the frontal cortex of the brain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychopharmacological modulation of the catecholaminergic system can enhance some aspects of
      cognitive function. For example, catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors such as
      tolcapone can improve working memory/executive function. Similarly, modafinil, a
      catecholaminergic agonist with norepinephrine (NA) reuptake blocking properties, was also
      shown to improve delay-dependent working memory in mice. Differences in the response between
      individuals might be related to a number of factors, including variations in the genes. The
      recent finding that a polymorphism in the COMT gene, which produces a change in enzyme
      activity, accounts for 4% of the variance in performance of working memory tasks in humans
      suggest that COMT genotype may predict response to COMT inhibitors or to other dopaminergic
      agonists that increase catecholaminergic function in the frontal cortex. In the present
      investigation our goal is to examine, in normal controls and patients with schizophrenia, the
      effect of atomoxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor that increases
      extracellular levels of dopamine in the frontal cortex, on cognitive function. We predict
      that both normal controls and patients with schizophrenia with the val/val genotype, which
      present higher COMT activity and, thus, lower extracellular dopamine concentrations in the
      frontal cortex, will have a significant improvement in working memory. Furthermore, in
      conjunction with other National Institute of Mental Health imaging protocols, we would like
      to examine the neurophysiological correlates related to working memory. We predict improved
      measures in prefrontal efficiency in subjects and patients specifically with the val/val
      genotype. The present protocol will provide new insights on the importance of this genetic
      polymorphism in the regulation of aminergic-controlled cognitive function in normal
      individuals. Furthermore, this protocol will test whether atomoxetine offers a new treatment,
      based on genotype, for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. An Investigational New Drug
      (IND) waiver will be requested for the present study.

    <time_frame>2 hours after the first or the second dose of Atomoxetine or placebo on 14th day</time_frame>
    <description>Main outcome measures were BOLD fMRI response (activation) while performing a prefrontal cortex-dependent task such as N-Back Working Memory with increasing levels of task difficulty. It was expected to have a greater level of activation in BOLD fMRI in schizophrenic patients with respect to normal volunteers, and a greater activation in individuals (either normal volunteers or patients) who share the val/val genotype with respect to the met/met genotype.
Based on prior fMRI studies and on power analysis of neuropsychological variables, at least 28 and 26 subjects are respectively needed to achieve significant power in functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies.These sizes provide an 80% power to observe significant differences between drug conditions at the 0.05 level.</description>

    <description>Neuropsychological testing consists of a battery of 10-12 individual tests to measure cognitive function.

        <title>Changes in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (Bold) Activity</title>
        <description>Main outcome measures were BOLD fMRI response (activation) while performing a prefrontal cortex-dependent task such as N-Back Working Memory with increasing levels of task difficulty. It was expected to have a greater level of activation in BOLD fMRI in schizophrenic patients with respect to normal volunteers, and a greater activation in individuals (either normal volunteers or patients) who share the val/val genotype with respect to the met/met genotype.
Based on prior fMRI studies and on power analysis of neuropsychological variables, at least 28 and 26 subjects are respectively needed to achieve significant power in functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies.These sizes provide an 80% power to observe significant differences between drug conditions at the 0.05 level.</description>
