      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual outcomes and patient satisfaction after
      implantation of a toric IOL in patients with predicted residual corneal astigmatism between
      0.75 and 1.00 D.

      Cataract is prevalent throughout the world and IOLs are routinely implanted after the
      extraction of the cataractous lens. It is the most frequently performed surgery in the United
      States with an estimated 2-3 million procedures performed annually. With the aging population
      on the rise, as well as the increasing popularity of refractive intraocular lenses, the
      number of intraocular surgeries continues to rise. Over the years, the surgical technique has
      evolved from intracapsular extraction to modern phacoemulsification. This development has
      helped with the evolution of IOLs as well. The IOLs have advanced extensively: different
      materials and designs are available, permitting implantation through smaller, sutureless
      incisions. Traditional IOLs are of monofocal design providing vision at one distance,
      typically far; and correct mainly the spherical component of the refractive error. However,
      there are patients with corneal astigmatism that require additional surgical treatment such
      as laser correction (laser in situ leratomileusis, LASIK; photorefractive keratectomy, PRK)
      or limbal relaxing incisions, RLI). Another alternative is the use of a toric IOL, which has
      been especially designed to correct both the sphere and the astigmatism. The ACRYSOF Toric
      IOL is intended for primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for visual correction
      of aphakia and preexisting comeal astigmatism in adult patients with or without presbyopia,
      who desire improved uncorrected distance vision, reduction of residual refractive cylinder
      and increased spectacle independence for distance vision.

      The treatment selection of the corneal astigmatism depends on the amount of cylinder as
      follows, between 0.25 and 0.75 D creating the surgical incision on the steep axis; between
      0.75 and 1.75 D, RLI; between 1 and 2.25 D, toric IOLs; and between 1 and 3.00 D, LASIK/PRK.

           trial.

        3. STUDY ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES Subjects will be recruited from the corneal and anterior
           segment clinic at Storm Eye Institute and satellite offices. Once identified as a study
           candidate, the patient will be asked if he/she would like to participate. A study
           coordinator or one of the investigators will answer any and all questions and will
           obtain informed consent. The patient will understand that participation in the study
           will not affect their quality of care.

        4. STUDY INTERVENTION The Acrysof toric SN60T3 IOL is approved by the Food and Drug
           Administration (FDA).

           The examinations and treatments used in this protocol are similar to those used in
           routine practice. Therefore, the additional risks involved in this study are extremely
           low. Patients will undergo routine cataract extraction and intraocular implantation of
           the Acrysof toric lens in both eyes.

        5. STUDY VISIT SCHEDULE AND ASSESSMENTS (Table 1) 5.1. Visit Schedule

      Patients will be examined at the following intervals:

        1. Visit 1: Preoperative evaluation completed not more than four weeks before surgery

        2. Visit 2: Date of Surgery

        3. Visit 3: 14 ± 2 days postoperative

        4. Visit 4: 30 ±5 days postoperative

        5. Visit 5: 90 ±7 days postoperative

        6. Visit 6: 180 ±10 days postoperative Additional office visits as required for medical
           safety. On such visits an unscheduled patient visit case report should be completed.

      6. MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS

      6.1. Visit 1: Preoperative assessment included a thorough medical history and a complete eye
      examination. The latter will include ETDRS uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA),
      manifest refraction, ETDRS best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), slit-lamp exam,
      manual keratometry, Orbscan, and a quality of vision questionnaire will be evaluated as well.
      Informed consent is to be obtained prior to performing the procedures in this study. Patient
      must review and sign the documentation. Women of childbearing potential will undergo a
      pregnancy test and will only be entered into the trial if this is negative.

      6.2. Visit 2: Surgery will be performed by the surgeon under topical anesthesia. A standard
      phacoemulsification and posterior chamber lens insertion will be performed according to the
      investigator's preferred technique. If a major complication occurs during surgery (e.g.
      expulsive hemorrhage or vitreous loss requiring vitrectomy), the patient will be excluded
      from the trial. Subjects will be implanted with the Acrysof Toric SN60T3 IOL.
      Postoperatively, patients will be instructed to follow the standard of care routinely used
      after cataract extraction.

      6.3. Visits 3, 4 and 5: On postoperative days 30 ±5, 90 ±7 and 180 ±10, ophthalmic
      examination to include: UCDVA, BCDVA, manifest refraction, slit lamp biomicroscopy, IOL
      position from slit lamp evaluation, manual keratometry and Orbscan. Absolute residual
      cylinder will be evaluated as well as change in axis orientation (determined by the
      postoperative manifest refraction), and distance spectacle independence.

      7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      7.1. Sample size calculation: This is a pilot study.

      7.2. Statistical Method: All data will be collected by the study coordinators. Data will be
      entered into an Access database. The database will be password protected and access will be
      restricted to study personnel. Data analysis will be performed without patient
      identification. Comparisons and statistical analysis will be done to determine if any
      statistical differences exist between preoperative and postoperative visits. Statistical
      analysis will be done using standard descriptive statistics and other tests as deemed
      appropriate based on the distribution of the data. If data is normally distributed, test such
      as the t-test will be used, while non-normally distributed data will be analyzed using the
      Wilcoxon test for comparison between the groups. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests will be used
      for comparison between baseline and postoperative visits. A P less than 0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant.
