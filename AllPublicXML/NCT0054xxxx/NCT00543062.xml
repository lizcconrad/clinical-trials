      The planned study is a single dose, double-blind, double-dummy, active and placebo
      controlled, randomized, 4-period cross-over study investigating investigating 2 doses levels
      of Staccato Prochlorperazine, a positive control with known QT/QTc prolongation (oral
      moxifloxacin), and placebo.
