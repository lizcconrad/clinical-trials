  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effect the postoperative combination of
      therapies: trastuzumab (herceptin) and paclitaxel (taxol) will have on breast cancer
      recurrence. A combination of trastuzuamb and chemotherapy has been used in women with node
      positive and high risk node negative disease. This tests utilizes a well tolerated regimen of
      weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab in women with T1, node negative tumors that are HER2
      positive. We would like to determine how effective this drug combination is when used in
      women with early stage breast cancer, as well as to better define the side effects of this
      treatment.

      -  Participants will enroll in this study at the time they are starting their adjuvant
           therapy for breast cancer. Participants will receive chemotherapy with paclitaxel every
           week for 12 weeks. They will begin to receive trastuzumab at the same time they begin
           paclitaxel. Once they have completed the 12 weeks of paclitaxel and trastuzumab, they
           will receive trastuzumab every 3 weeks or weekly for 40 weeks.

        -  Participants will be followed with routine assessments such as physical exam and vital
           signs every 3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months for years 2-5. Then we
           would like to keep track of the participants medical condition by calling them on the
           telephone once per year.
