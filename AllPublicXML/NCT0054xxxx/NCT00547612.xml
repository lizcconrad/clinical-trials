      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography (PET) using
      [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier, may be effective in finding disease
      in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well a PET scan using [18F]-labeled substance P
      antagonist receptor quantifier works in finding disease in patients with pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier positron
           emission tomography can identify pancreatic cancer evident on multiphase CT scan.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo multiphase CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. No more than
      15 days later, patients receive [18F]-labeled substance P antagonist receptor quantifier IV
      and undergo positron emission tomography over 6 hours.

      Blood is collected periodically to measure the metabolism of the radiotracer by high
      performance liquid chromatography with radioactive detectors.
