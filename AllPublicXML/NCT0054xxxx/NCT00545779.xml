    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess participant preference for monthly Bonviva, versus daily or
      weekly alendronate or risedronate, in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
      Participants currently on a daily or weekly regimen of bisphosphonate therapy (alendronate or
      risedronate) will answer a questionnaire to identify participants who may benefit from a
      monthly Bonviva regimen. Eligible participants will then discontinue their present
      bisphosphonate treatment, and switch to monthly Bonviva 150mg per oral (po). At the beginning
      and end of Bonviva treatment, all participants will complete an Osteoporosis Patient
      Satisfaction Questionnaire. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the
      target sample size is 500+ individuals.

    <description>The CIQ was completed in Part A by all the participants. The information from the CIQ was used to determine the percentage of current daily or weekly bisphosphonate users for whom monthly ibandronate represented a potentially more satisfactory therapeutic option.
In the CIQ participants were asked to answer either 'yes' or 'no' to the following 3 questions:
I would prefer a monthly oral dosing schedule to my current (daily or weekly) dosing schedule.
More than once per month, I have experienced stomach upset within 48 hours of taking my osteoporosis medication.
Over the past 3 months, I have missed taking 3 or more doses of my current (daily or weekly) osteoporosis medication.</description>

    <description>Participants with a positive change from their baseline CSS at Month 6 are considered those participants who are satisfied with once-monthly dosing of ibandronate after 6 months of use were reported. The CSS is scaled from 0 to 100 and is an average of the 4 domain scores of the Osteoporosis Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (OPSAT-Q): Convenience (questions 1 to 6), Quality of Life (questions 7 and 8), Overall Satisfaction (questions 9 and 10) and Side Effects (questions 11 to 16). Higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants who report an improved satisfaction score after 6 months of monthly ibandronate therapy as compared to daily or weekly alendronate or risendronate at baseline based on responses to each individual question in the CIQ were reported. In the CIQ participants were asked to answer either 'yes' or 'no' to the following 3 questions:
I would prefer a monthly oral dosing schedule to my current (daily or weekly) dosing schedule
More than once per month, I have experienced stomach upset within 48 hours of taking my osteoporosis medication

    <description>The OPSAT-Q is a validated questionnaire designed to capture satisfaction with bisphosphonate treatment. It comprises four domains: convenience (questions 1-6), quality of life (questions 7 and 8), overall satisfaction (questions 9 and 10), and side effects (questions 11-16). Each domain (scale) ranges 0-100 scale. All items were scored such that higher scores represented greater satisfaction or less bother. Treatment satisfaction was measured with the OPSAT-Q composite satisfaction score (OPSAT-Q CSS), which was the average of the scores from the four domains of the OPSAT-Q converted to a 0-100-point scale, in which higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>

        <description>The CIQ was completed in Part A by all the participants. The information from the CIQ was used to determine the percentage of current daily or weekly bisphosphonate users for whom monthly ibandronate represented a potentially more satisfactory therapeutic option.
In the CIQ participants were asked to answer either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the following 3 questions:
I would prefer a monthly oral dosing schedule to my current (daily or weekly) dosing schedule.
More than once per month, I have experienced stomach upset within 48 hours of taking my osteoporosis medication.
Over the past 3 months, I have missed taking 3 or more doses of my current (daily or weekly) osteoporosis medication.</description>

        <title>Osteoporosis Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (OPSAT-Q) Domain Scores in Part B</title>
        <description>The OPSAT-Q is a validated questionnaire designed to capture satisfaction with bisphosphonate treatment. It comprises four domains: convenience (questions 1–6), quality of life (questions 7 and 8), overall satisfaction (questions 9 and 10), and side effects (questions 11–16). Each domain (scale) ranges 0-100 scale. All items were scored such that higher scores represented greater satisfaction or less bother. Treatment satisfaction was measured with the OPSAT-Q composite satisfaction score (OPSAT-Q CSS), which was the average of the scores from the four domains of the OPSAT-Q converted to a 0–100-point scale, in which higher scores indicate greater satisfaction.</description>
