      Primary: Evaluate the safety and onset of symptom relief using an acute I-PSS form (7 day
      form).

      Determine onset of urinary peak flow improvement after 7 days Secondary: Determine
      improvement in Bother Score after 7 &amp; 28 days; improvement in sexual function after 28 days;
      assess one-month efficacy and safety

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Men aged greater than or equal to 50 years with a history of lower urinary tract symptoms
        (LUTS) related to BPH for greater than or equal to 6 months, an International Prostate
        Symptom Score (I-PSS) (0 to 35 points scale) of at least 13 points, a maximum urinary flow
        rate (Qmax) between 5 and 12 mL/sec (with a voided volume of greater than or equal to 150
        mL), a residual urine volume of less than or equal to 350 mL, and a bothersomeness score (0
        to 6 points scale) of at least 3 points. All patients will undergo prostate size assessment
        by transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) if not done within past 12 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Include, but are not limited to: concomitant lower urinary tract disease; previous
        prostatic surgery; history of postural hypotension or syncope; concomitant use of
        medications that may alter the voiding pattern; and clinically relevant biochemical
        abnormalities. Patients with a serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &gt;10 ng/mL will be
        excluded, and those with an elevated serum PSA between 4 and 10 ng/mL must have prostate
        cancer excluded to the satisfaction of the investigator.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
