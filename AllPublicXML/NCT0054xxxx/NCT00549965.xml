      Compare subject satisfaction of once a week dosing of 35 mg Risedronate to once daily dosing
      of 5 mg Risedronate in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. Secondary objectives are to measure
      compliance (50 % drug taken), and persistence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Five (5) years or greater postmenopausal who present with a diagnosis of
             postmenopausal osteoporosis based on standard clinical practice criteria.

          -  Subjects must discontinue bisphosphonates, calcitonin, fluoride, glucocorticoids (&gt;
             than or = to 5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) and hormone replacement therapy
             including estrogen-related compounds at least 6 months prior to randomization. During
             the study, these drugs are not permitted other than the study medication, Risedronate.

          -  Other concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum, but if the drugs are
             considered necessary for the subject's welfare and are unlikely to interfere with
             study medication they may be given at the discretion of the Investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had a history of cancer within the past 5 years. Relatively benign skin malignancies,
             such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, are not an exclusion if the
             subject has been in remission for at least 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Diagnosis of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hyperthyroidism.

          -  History of alcohol and/or drug abuse.

          -  Subjects will be excluded for active gastrointestinal disease that may interfere with
             absorption or with ability to swallow an oral medication.

          -  Subjects will also be excluded for serious concurrent illness that would interfere
             with their ability to participate in the trial.

          -  Excluded medications: bisphosphonates, calcitonin or fluoride or hormone replacement
             therapy within the last 6 months.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to bisphosphonates and/or excipients.

          -  Abnormal laboratory parameters, which are clinically relevant according to the
             Investigator (including renal insufficiency; creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min)

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
