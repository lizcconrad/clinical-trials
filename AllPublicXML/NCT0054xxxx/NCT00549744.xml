    <measure>Change from Baseline (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) on Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1, pre-dose) and Day 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a lung function measure defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Mean FEV1 from the 3 acceptable spirometric efforts were recorded after withholding salbutamol used as bronchodilator at all visits for at least 6 hours (h) and at pre-dose. Baseline was defined as the mean of the 3 pre-dose measurements on Day 1 of each treatment period. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (Day 1, pre-dose) from the individual post-Baseline (pre-dose, Day 14) value. Adjusted mean was reported as least square (LS) mean.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) averaged over the 14-day period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Screening, 7 days prior to Day 1 of Treatment period 1) and Day 1 to 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is a measure of lung function and measures how fast a person can breathe out. It was measured using a peak flow meter by the participants and recorded on diary cards during Day 1 to Day 14 pre-dose am and pm of each treatment period. The efforts were recorded after withholding salbutamol used as bronchodilator for at least 6 hours. The averaged PEFR over the 14-day treatment period was calculated as the mean of the 14 pre-dose observations during each treatment period. Baseline was defined as the assessment done during Screening (the average of am and average of pm measurements over the last 7 days pre-dose prior to Day 1 of treatment period 1). The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (average of am and average of pm screening values) from the individual post-Baseline (average of am and average of pm values over 14 days) values. Adjusted mean was reported as LS mean.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose), Day 7 and Day 14 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The exhaled nitric oxide assessment is used as a marker for airway inflammation. The exhaled nitric oxide was assessed using breath test on Day 1 (pre-dose and 1 h post-dose on Day 1), Day 7 (pre-dose) and Day 14 (pre-dose, 1 h and 24 h post-dose). Baseline was defined as the assessment done pre-dose on Day 1. The change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (Day 1, pre-dose) from the individual post-Baseline (1 h post-dose Day 1, pre-dose Day 7 and Day 14 at pre-dose, 1 h post-dose and 24 h post-dose) values. Data was analyzed using repeated measures mixed effects model for the ratio of change from Baseline values, derived from dividing doses of GSK256066 by placebo, adjusted for period, treatment, Day (1, 7 or 14), time (pre-dose, 1 or 24 h), period-level Baseline of exhaled nitric oxide and participant-level Baseline exhaled nitric oxide as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. Adjusted geometric mean is reported as LS geometric mean.</description>

    <measure>Mean provocative concentration of methacholine resulting in a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PC20) on Day 15</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The PC20 was assessed using the methacholine challenge. This is a physiological measurement derived from repeated breathing maneuvers which measures airway reactivity. Participants were exposed to higher and higher concentrations of an airway irritant (in this case methacholine), and between each dose spirometry was performed. The test was stopped after the FEV1 fell 20% below the Baseline. The concentration of methacholine at which this occurred was called the PC20. The methacholine challenge was performed at 24 h post-dose on Day 14 (morning of Day 15) after exhaled nitric oxide assessment. Data was analyzed using mixed effect model, where the model was adjusted for period and treatment as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. Adjusted geometric mean is reported as LS geometric mean.</description>

    <measure>Mean phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) values</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>PDEs are a super family of enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and/or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) to their inactive form. PDE4 is the main selective cAMP-metabolizing enzyme in inflammatory and immune cells. Because PDE4 is highly expressed in leukocytes and other inflammatory cells involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, inhibition of PDE4 had been predicted to have an anti inflammatory effect for them. PDE4 was assessed in sputum samples, collected 2-3 h post-dose on Day 7 by transcriptomic analysis on sputum ribonucleic acid (RNA) samples. Data is reported for PDE4B.</description>

             airway disease, defined as an increase in FEV1 of 12.0% over the max of the three
             screening measures and an absolute change of 150 mL within 30 minutes following a
             single 400 mg salbutamol dose

          -  Male and females who are aged between 18 and 65 years of age.A female is eligible to
             enter and participate in the study if she is of:

               1. Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming
                  pregnant), including any female who is post menopausal. For the purposes of this
                  study, post menopausal is defined as 1 year without menses (FSH/LH will be also
                  tested to confirm menopausal status); or

               2. Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test (urine) at screening and
                  pre-dose Day 1, and agrees to one of the following acceptable contraceptive
                  methods when used consistently and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the
                  approved product label and the instructions of a physician for the duration of
                  the study - screening visit to follow-up contact):

        Complete abstinence from intercourse from the screening visit, throughout the trial and for
        7 (~5 half-lives of GSK256066) days after the completion of the trial; or Male partner was
        sterile prior to the female subject's entry into the study, or Implants of levonorgestrel
        inserted for at least 1 month prior to the study medication administration but not beyond
        the third successive year following insertion; or Injectable progestogen administered for
        at least 1 month prior to the study medication administration and administered for 1 month
        following study completion; or Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only)
        administered for a least one monthly cycle prior to study medication administration; or The
        contraceptive transdermal patch, Ortho Evra (if the subject is less than 89kg); or
        Double-barrier method - spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g., spermicide plus a male
        condom or a spermicide and female diaphragm.

        Recent data now shows that certain double-barrier methods have a failure rate below 1%
        [Trussell, 2003]. Specifically, these are a spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g.,
        spermicide plus a male condom or a female diaphragm). This provides validated confirmation
        of the failure rate of the double-barrier method. Thus this method now meets the stated
        criterion for acceptable contraception in the EMEA guidelines [CPMP/ICH/285/95, 2000]; or
        Condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
        foam/gel/film/cream/suppository; or An intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system
        (IUS), inserted by a qualified physician, with published data showing that the highest
        expected failure rate is less than 1% per year; (not all IUDs meet this criterion)
        Acceptable IUDs: Tcu-380A (Paragard), TCU-380 Slimline (Gyne T Slimline), Tcu-220C,
        MULTILOAD-250 (MLCu-250) and 375, NOVA T and CUNOVAT (Novagard), Levonorgesterol (LNG-20)
        Intra-uterine System (Mirena/Levonova), and FlexiGard 330/CuFix PP330 (Gynefix). The device
        must be inserted at least 2 weeks prior to the Screen visit, and remain throughout the
        study and through the follow-up phase of the study or Any other methods with published data
        showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year.
