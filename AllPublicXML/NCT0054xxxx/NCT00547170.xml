    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial comparing two regimens of
      doxycycline for the prevention of infection after surgical abortion. One thousand women
      undergoing surgical abortion in the first trimester will be enrolled from the clinic at Tu Du
      Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The standard regimen has been 100 mg twice daily for 5
      days after the abortion. Subjects will be randomized to the standard regimen or to take 200
      mg doxycycline pre-operatively. Subjects found to have a positive Chlamydia EIA test will
      receive a 7-day course of doxycycline regardless of study group. Subjects will complete
      questionnaires of symptoms, including nausea and emesis in the recovery room after the
      procedure and at a single follow-up visit two weeks later. The primary outcome will be
      infection after abortion, defined below. Analyses will be performed including and excluding
      Chlamydia-positive subjects. Secondary outcomes will be the proportion with nausea, emesis,
      and other side-effects.
