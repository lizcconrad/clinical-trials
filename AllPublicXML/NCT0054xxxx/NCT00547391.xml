    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if tonsillectomy reduces the short-term risk of
      having an objectively confirmed (sequential changes in serum crp and procalcitonin levels)
      delayed pharyngitis episode among patients suffering from recurrent pharyngitis episodes.
      Other aims are to find out the effect of tonsillectomy to reduce the number of pharyngitis
      episodes or symptoms. Still, the possible disadvantages of tonsillectomy and changes in the
      quality of life after tonsillectomy among these patients are examined.

      We will have a prospective randomized study. We allocated 87 consecutive patients referred
      for tonsillectomy randomly in two groups: tonsilectomy group or waiting list(control group).
      Patients in tonsillectomy group were operated as soon as possible and data on postoperative
      morbidity was collected. In the control group, patients were placed on our normal waiting
      list and they were operated on in normal time (about 5-6 months). The data on preoperative
      morbidity was collected. All the pharyngitis episodes were treated by a study investigator
      and laboratory tests (crp, procalcitonin) were taken at that time and after three days. In
      addition, the patients record their symptoms on a diary.
