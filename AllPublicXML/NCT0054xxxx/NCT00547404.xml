  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I/II clinical trial. It is done to determine the best doses
      that the investigational drug (P276-00) can be used safely. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the
      drug is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more information
      about it such as; the safest dose to use, the side effects it may cause and if it is
      effective for treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

      A majority of multiple myeloma patients overexpress a protein that plays a role in regulating
      the body's cell cycle called Cyclin D1. The study drug P276-00 is a Cyclin D1 inhibitor under
      investigation in the treatment of solid tumors. The researchers therefore believe that Cyclin
      D1 should be studied as a therapeutic target in myeloma. In this research study, we are
      looking for the highest dose of P276-00 that can be given safely and to see how well it works

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pre clinical data demonstrated that P276-00 is a selective Cdk4-D1 and Cdk1-B inhibitor
      with potent cytotoxic effects against MM cells including sensitive (MM1.S, RPMI 8226, OPM1,
      OPM2) and resistant (MM1.R, Dox-40, LR5) to conventional chemotherapy as well as in mouse
      xenograft models. The IC50 for this effect is between 300-1000 nM in vitro, and potential
      doses to be evaluated in the clinical study can achieve these concentrations. This evidence
      supports a rationale for evaluating the effects of P276-000 in patients with
      relapsed/refractory MM in order to determine safety and tolerability as well as
      pharmacokinetics and potential efficacy. The current study design allows for adequate
      assessment of patient safety in terms of the potential adverse effects of P276-00.
