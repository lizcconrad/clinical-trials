  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is most often recognized in advanced clinical state, the initial therapeutic
      strategies consist of a platinum containing chemotherapy subsequent to primary surgery.
      Although initially responsive to platinum-paclitaxel containing chemotherapy, a significant
      number of patients will show tumor progression during first line chemotherapy or relapse
      within six months after completion of first line chemotherapy, therefore being characterized
      as chemotherapy resistant. Any second line chemotherapy will result in approximately 10% of
      overall response, underlining the poor prognosis for these patients with an estimated median
      overall survival of 20 weeks.

      In addition to conventional chemotherapeutics, so called small molecules are of high interest
      to establish new strategies in chemotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer (and in the long run
      first line chemotherapy). SU11248 is a polytargeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

      SU11248 has demonstrated clinical efficacy in kidney cancer and GIST, further clinical trials
      have been initiated in other tumor entities. Growth pattern and biological targets present in
      ovarian cancer indicate that SU11248 might be a promising compound for the treatment of
      ovarian cancer. Especially, VEGFR, PDGFR and c-kit are specific targets for SU11248, which
      are expressed in ovarian cancer. The different targets of SU11248 provide a potential
      advantage of this compound compared to single-target molecules in chemotherapy-refractory
      ovarian cancer.

      This study in patients with ovarian cancer refractory to platinum based chemotherapy is
      designed as a randomized, 2-schedule and dose-level, open-label, multicenter phase II study
      to select the better dose and schedule arm for further investigation.

      72 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral SU11248 therapy either 37.5
      mg/day continuously or 50mg/day for 4 weeks followed by 14 days off.

      Patients will get outpatients treatment. At screening the patients' eligibility will be
      assessed, their baseline and demographic characteristics obtained, and the baseline values
      for the effect variables collected. Patients with measurable lesions as well as
      non-measurable disease will be included into this trial. Measurable lesion will be documented
      by CT or MRI scan and CA-125 values, non-measurable lesions will be monitored by analysis of
      CA°125 levels.

      The patients' safety will be monitored during and up to 30 days after termination of SU11248
      therapy.

      In patients with measurable lesions at baseline, the (post)-treatment values for effect
      according to the RECIST criteria will be collected as shown in table 6. In case of CR or PR,
      a confirmatory CT or MRI scan is required after an interval of at least four weeks. Antitumor
      effects according to CA°125 levels will be determined in the same time intervals and, in
      addition, 28 days after last SU11248 application in patients with CA°125 response according
      to GCIG guidelines during therapy.

      For post study follow-up, patients and/or their physicians will be contacted via phone for
      overall survival and TTP (including the method of diagnosis and additional treatment) every 2
      months for their life time.
