    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of type 2 diabetes patients switched from sulfonylurea
      co-administered with metformin to glyburide/metformin combination tablet. It is expected that
      safety and efficacy of GlucoMet® is not inferior to co-administration of sulfonylurea and
      metformin.
