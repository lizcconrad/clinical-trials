      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Specialized
      radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more
      tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Androgens can cause the growth of
      prostate cancer cells. Androgen deprivation therapy, such as goserelin, leuprolide, or
      bicalutamide, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Giving intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy together with androgen deprivation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well intensity-modulated radiation therapy works
      in treating patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for metastatic prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the time to PSA relapse in patients with oligometastatic (i.e., ≤ 5 lesions)
           hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with 36 weeks of androgen deprivation therapy
           and localized radiotherapy to all known tumor sites.

        -  To assess the PSA and objective tumor response rate in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility and toxicities of using helical tomotherapy image-guided
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy to treat oligometastatic sites in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to androgen-deprivation therapy status at time of
      study entry (currently receiving or planning to receive vs completed or almost completed).

      Patients who are not currently androgen deprivation therapy at the time of enrollment receive
      36 weeks of androgen deprivation therapy comprising goserelin subcutaneously or leuprolide
      acetate intramuscularly once every 4-12 weeks and oral bicalutamide once daily for 36 weeks.
      Patients who are already receiving androgen deprivation therapy at the time of enrollment
      will continue treatment until they have received a total of 36 weeks of therapy.

      All patients undergo helical tomotherapy image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy
      beginning at the time they achieve PSA normalization (i.e., stable or declining PSA level ≤ 4
      ng/mL or stable or declining PSA level ≤ pretreatment level, whichever is smaller) on two
      consecutive measurements taken after androgen deprivation therapy is initiated. All known
      metastatic sites are irradiated for 2-7 weeks during or after completion of androgen
      deprivation therapy.

      Patients remain off treatment until PSA relapse, defined as an increase in the PSA level to
      the pre-androgen deprivation therapy level or &gt; 10 ng/mL, whichever is smaller. Once the
      patient meets the criteria for re-treatment with androgen deprivation therapy, they are
      removed from study.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
