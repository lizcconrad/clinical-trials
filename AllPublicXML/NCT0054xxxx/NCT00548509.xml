  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of menatetrenone on bone turnover in postmenopausal patients with
      osteoporosis. One month of menatetrenone therapy enhanced the secretion and
      gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin. Moderate increases of bone resorption and formation
      markers were observed after 6 months. These changes may contribute to fracture prevention in
      patients with osteoporosis.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of osteoporosis was made according to the Year 2000 version of the
             Diagnostic Criteria for Osteoporosis proposed by the Japanese Society for Bone and
             Mineral Research.

          -  These criteria state that patients with a lumbar bone mineral density (BMD)&lt;70% of the
             young adult mean or patients with pre-existing osteoporotic fractures and a lumbar
             BMD&lt;80% of the young adult mean can be diagnosed as having osteoporosis.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with secondary osteoporosis (e.g., due to major gastrointestinal surgery,
             steroid therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy, renal
             dysfunction, and thyroid dysfunction ).

          -  Patients taking medications that could affect bone turnover (such as bisphosphonates,
             estrogen, calcitonin, SERM, active vitamin D3, or Warfarin) were excluded.
