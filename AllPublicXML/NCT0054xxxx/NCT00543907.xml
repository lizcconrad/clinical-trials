      The purpose of this study is to analyze an institution's experience with starting a
      subspecialized DIEP flap program and to determine whether other hospitals would benefit from
      instituting a similar program. Prior studies have compared the outcome from a DIEP flap
      program with that of TRAM flaps within the same center. Other studies have calculated the
      cost of a DIEP flap and its complication rate. However, no one has examined the overall
      effects of a subspecialized reconstruction program and its impact on a health center. In this
      study, we will determine if the institutionalization of a DIEP flap program has increased our
      center's rate of breast reconstruction, as well as evaluate its outcomes and overall
      financial viability.
