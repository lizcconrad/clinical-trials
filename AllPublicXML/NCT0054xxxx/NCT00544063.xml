      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin,
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of capecitabine when
      given together with irinotecan and oxaliplatin in treating patients with metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of capecitabine.

        -  Define the toxicity profile.

        -  Evaluate potential antitumor activity in terms of objective response, duration of
           response, and time to disease progression.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of capecitabine and irinotecan hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of capecitabine conducted in two parts.

        -  Part I: Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral
           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 6 months
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of up to 6 patients receive escalating doses (up to 5 dosages) of capecitabine. The
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose at which 50% of patients experience
      toxicity during the first 2 courses of therapy.

        -  Part II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and irinotecan hydrochloride IV
           over 90 minutes on day 1 and oral capecitabine on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 2
           weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of up to 6 patients receive escalating doses (up to 7 dosages) of capecitabine. The
      MTD is defined as in part I.
