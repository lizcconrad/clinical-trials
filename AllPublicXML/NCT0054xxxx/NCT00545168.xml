          1. Subjects must have an active head lice infestation present at Day 0.

          2. Subjects can be female or male, at least 6 months of age.

          3. Subjects must be in good general health based on medical history.

          4. Each subject must have an appropriately signed Informed Consent agreement. Subjects

             head lice infestation, they should also be enrolled in the study.

          7. Subjects must agree to not use any other form of lice treatment during the course of
             the study and must agree not to use any of the excluded concomitant medications.

             the initial treatment and the final visit.

          9. Subjects/caregiver must demonstrate a clear understanding of his/her requirements for

          4. Infested subjects who have been previously treated with a pediculicide within the 48
             hours prior to the study.

          5. Individuals with a condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             compromise the objective of the protocol.

          6. Individuals receiving systemic or topical drugs or medications, including systemic
             antibiotics, which in the opinion of the investigative personnel or study monitor may

             negative urine pregnancy test prior to treatment at Day 0. If a household has a
             pregnant female with an active case of head lice, the entire household is excluded
             from participation. If the pregnant household member does not have lice, this
             individual must NOT be the caregiver (one who provides treatment to other household
             members).

         11. Sexually active females not using effective contraception.
