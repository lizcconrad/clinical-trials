  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whiplash is the most common traffic injury, affecting 83% of people involved in motor vehicle
      collisions. People with whiplash injuries often experience pain and disability that can last
      for a long period. This may subsequently lead to an increased use of the health care system.
      Preventing chronic symptoms is a priority for clinicians, insurers, and policy makers.
      However, there are very few factors that can be changed by treatment to prevent prolonged
      symptoms. Providing effective care at the appropriate time is one aspect that can be changed
      and needs to be studied. To date, no randomized clinical trials have investigated the
      effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs for the management of patients
      with whiplash-associated disorders. Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest whether
      rehabilitation programs are superior to physician-based care at improving whiplash-associated
      symptoms. Thus, there is a need for a randomized trial to determine what program results in
      the best outcomes for patients.

      The purpose of this study is to compare three programs of care that are currently available
      in Ontario for the management of patients with Whiplash-associated disorders.

      The results of this study will demonstrate which of three programs of care is superior in
      improving the physical and mental health of patients with whiplash-associated disorders. The
      results will help guide the development and implementation of effective and cost-effective
      programs of care by informing clinicians, insurers and government on the best rehabilitation
      options for patients with whiplash injuries.

      Background: Whiplash is the most common traffic injury, affecting 83% of people involved in
      motor vehicle collisions. It results in a significant burden of pain, disability and health
      care utilization. Preventing chronic whiplash is a priority for clinicians, insurers, and
      policy makers. However, whiplash injuries are resistant to treatment and few of its
      prognostic factors are modifiable through intervention. One of the rare factors amenable to
      change is the provision of timely and effective clinical care. To date, no randomized trials
      that have investigated the effectiveness of a coordinated and staged multidisciplinary
      rehabilitation program aimed at improving the health outcomes of patients with
      whiplash-associated disorders. Moreover, it is not known whether rehabilitation programs are
      superior to physician care in promoting better health outcomes. Overall, there is a need for
      a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to investigate what program of care yields the best
      outcomes for patients.

      Purpose: To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the &quot;Soft Tissue Injury Care
      Model&quot; designed by AVIVA Canada, the &quot;Pre-approved Framework Guideline for Grade I and II
      Whiplash Associated Disorders&quot; recommended by the Financial Services Commission of Ontario
      and a physician-based &quot;Education and Activation&quot; intervention on the rate of self-rated
      recovery from whiplash-associated disorders.

      Methods: We designed a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants
      will be randomly allocated to receive one of three program of care: 1) the &quot;Soft Tissue
      Injury Care Model&quot; designed by AVIVA Canada;2) the &quot;Pre-approved Framework Guideline for
      Grade I and II Whiplash Associated Disorders&quot; recommended by the Financial Services
      Commission of Ontario ; or 3) a physician-based &quot;Education and Activation&quot; intervention.

      Significance: The results of this study will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of
      three commonly used management strategies for whiplash injuries in Ontario. The results will
      help guide the development of effective and cost-effective programs of care and inform
      insurance and government policy on the rehabilitation of whiplash injuries.
