  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient osteoporosis of pregnancy (TOoP) is uncommonly encountered in orthopedic and
      obstetric practice, with most reports consisting of single cases.

      This rare condition consists of significant osteoporosis affecting the hips and spine,
      causing significant morbidity, and putting young female patients at risk for vertebral and
      femoral neck fractures.

      The pathogenesis of transient osteoporosis of pregnancy is unknown, with various theories as
      to its etiology.

      Recently, a number of reports have described elevated levels of PTHrP in patients with
      transient osteoporosis in pregnancy and of the postpartum period Our goal in this study is to
      assess the role of PTHrP in transient osteoporosis of pregnancy
