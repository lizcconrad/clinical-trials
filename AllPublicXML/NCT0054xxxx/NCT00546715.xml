    <measure>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate to Day 7 or Discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 7 or Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in heart rate from baseline were measured after the participants were supine for at least 5 minutes. Baseline was defined as the Day 1 pre-dose measurement. The normal heart rate lies between 60-90 beats per minute (bpm), below 60 bpm and above 90 bpm were considered as bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Day 7 or Discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The ECG was recorded after the participant was in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. Baseline was defined as the Day 1 pre-dose measurement. The PR interval was defined as the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, and represents the time taken by electrical impulse to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The QRS complex represented the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. The QT interval was defined as the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave, and represents the time taken for ventricular depolarization and repolarization. QTc was defined as corrected QT interval at a heart rate of 60 bpm. QTc was estimated using Bazett's formula and Fredericia's formula.</description>

The normal heart rate lies between 60-90 beats per minute (bpm), below 60 bpm and above 90 bpm were considered as bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Electrocardiogram (ECG) Parameters (PR, QRS, QT, and QTc Intervals) to Day 7 or Discharge</title>
        <description>The ECG was recorded after the participant was in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. Baseline was defined as the Day 1 pre-dose measurement. The PR interval was defined as the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex, and represents the time taken by electrical impulse to travel from the sinus node through the atrioventricular (AV) node. The QRS complex represented the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. The QT interval was defined as the time from the start of the Q wave to the end of the T wave, and represents the time taken for ventricular depolarization and repolarization. QTc was defined as corrected QT interval at a heart rate of 60 bpm. QTc was estimated using Bazett’s formula and Fredericia’s formula.</description>
