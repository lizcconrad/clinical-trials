  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health literacy is an integral part of the pathway for the successful transfer of information
      between patients and providers. Parents of children with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity
      Disorder (ADHD) play an essential role in chronic care as they offer critical information to
      providers that drives appropriate education and disease management. We propose the
      development and evaluation of an electronic data entry tool that enables parents to
      communicate data essential to treatment of their children, regardless of their own literacy
      skills. The research plan addresses a question central to patient-centered information
      management: how does health literacy influence parents' report of data on ADHD and the
      process-level events that result from parent-provider communication? The following specific
      aims organize the clinical study: proposal: 1) To assess the effect of health literacy on
      successful completion of parent-reported ADHD health information in both paper-based and PCHR
      formats, and, 2): To determine the association between health literacy and process-level
      outcomes for ADHD that stem from parent-provider exchange of information. The formal
      evaluation will study a diverse cohort of parents in a randomized trial of data entry (paper
      versus PCHR) for ADHD-specific information. Primary care records for children of this cohort
      will be analyzed for the prior 12 month period. Both a retrospective examination of
      documented ADHD processes of care and a prospective evaluation of the utility of data from
      the PCHR will occur. Literacy level is a primary variable of interest throughout the
      evaluation.
