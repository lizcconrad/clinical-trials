      Whether a once-daily basal injection of insulin glargine with mealtime injections of insulin
      lispro achieves equivalent glycaemic control (HbA1c) to administration of insulin lispro by
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in Type 1 diabetic patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least one year.

          -  Subjects with no previous experience with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion
             (CSII) or insulin glargine,

          -  capable of managing a basal-bolus regimen and meeting glycaemic targets in accordance
             with the protocol.

          -  HbA1c &gt; than or = to 6.5 &lt; than or = to 9.0% at screening visit with evidence of lack
             of insulin secretion (e.g. fasting C-peptide concentration is &lt; 0.1 nmol/l with
             fasting blood glucose(FBG) &gt; 126 mg/dl).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous therapy using insulin glargine or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

          -  Lipodystrophy preventing adequate use of CSII.

          -  Unwilling or unlikely to be able to use MiniMedr insulin pump with insulin lispro for
             CSII.

          -  Unwilling or unlikely to be able to use an MDI regimen with insulin glargine and
             insulin lispro in accordance with the protocol (for instance, subjects who routinely
             use a twice-daily mixed insulin regimen should not be included).

          -  History of more than two severe hypoglycaemic episodes in the past 6 months.

          -  Acute infection which, in the opinion of the investigator, could lead to increased
             insulin resistance.

          -  Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis.

          -  Episode of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) within the last three months.

          -  Active, uncontrolled, advanced diabetic retinopathy.

          -  Impaired hepatic function, as shown by &gt; 2.5 times the upper limit of normal range for
             AST.

          -  Impaired renal function, as shown by serum creatinine &gt; 1.5mg/dl.

          -  History of gastroparesis. Congestive heart failure requiring ongoing pharmacological
             treatment.

          -  Stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), percutaneous
             transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or angina pectoris within the last 12 months.

          -  Treatment with a non-selective beta blocker.

          -  Treatment with inhaled or systemic steroids.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to insulin lispro or to any drug with a similar chemical
             structure to insulin glargine or insulin lispro or to any of the excipients of the
             insulin glargine and insulin lispro preparations used in the study.

          -  Any malignancy within the last five years, except adequately treated basal cell
             carcinoma.

          -  History within the last two years or current addiction to substances of abuse
             including ethanol.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
