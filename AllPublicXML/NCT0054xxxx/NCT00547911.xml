    <textblock>
      An experimental drug called L-DOPS increases production in the body of a messenger chemical
      called norepinephrine. Cells in the brain that make norepinephrine are often gone in
      Parkinson disease. The exact consequences of this loss are unknown, but they may be related
      to symptoms such as fatigue, depression, or decreased attention that occur commonly in
      Parkinson disease. This study will explore effects of L-DOPS in conjunction with carbidopa
      and entacapone, which are drugs used to treat Parkinson disease. We wish to find out what the
      effects are of increasing norepinephrine production in the brain and whether carbidopa and
      entacapone augment those effects.

      Volunteers for this study must be at least 18 years of age and able to give consent to
      participate in the study. To participate in the study, volunteers must discontinue use of
      alcohol, tobacco, and certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements, and must also taper or
      discontinue certain kinds of medications that might interfere with the results of the study.
      Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.

      Participants will be admitted to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center for two
      weeks of testing. The study will have three testing phases in a randomly chosen order for
      each participant:

        -  Single dose of L-DOPS

        -  Single dose of L-DOPS in conjunction with carbidopa

        -  Single dose of L-DOPS in conjunction with entacapone

      Each phase will last two days, with a washout day between each phase in which no drugs will
      be given and no testing will be performed. In each phase, participants will undergo a series
      of tests and measurements, including blood pressure and electrocardiogram tests. Participants
      who are healthy volunteers will also have blood drawn and will undergo a lumbar puncture
      (also known as a spinal tap) to obtain spinal fluid for chemical tests.

      Objective: L-DOPS is a synthetic chemical that can be converted to norepinephrine (NE). NE is
      a key messenger of the sympathetic nervous system. Failure of the sympathetic nervous system
      results in orthostatic hypotension (OH), a fall in blood pressure when the person stands up.
      Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) often have OH that is related to loss of sympathetic
      nerves and to NE deficiency. L-DOPS can help treat OH in these patients. Drugs used commonly
      to treat PD, however, probably influence effects of L-DOPS. Carbidopa, which combined with
      levodopa (brand name Sinemet) is a standard treatment for PD, might prevent L-DOPS from being
      turned into NE outside the brain and therefore interfere with effects of L-DOPS on blood
      pressure. Entacapone (brand name Comtan) might augment production of NE after a dose of
      L-DOPS, by decreasing metabolic breakdown of L-DOPS. The first goal of this study is to test
      these hypotheses in patients with neurogenic OH. NE is also a chemical messenger in the brain
      and is thought to participate in a variety of neuropsychiatric phenomena such as vigilance,
      mood, memory, and transmission of pain sensation. Patients with OH can have evidence of
      central NE deficiency. A second goal of this study is to determine whether depressed mood,
      apathy, fatigue, or pain improve with L-DOPS treatment in these patients. A third goal is to
      test whether carbidopa and entacapone, which both should enhance delivery of L-DOPS to the
      brain, augment L-DOPS effects on these symptoms. Finally, a fourth goal is to verify that
      carbidopa and entacapone augment neurochemical indices of central neural production of NE
      after a dose of L-DOPS.

      Study Population: The subjects are patients with PD+NOH, MSA+NOH, or pure autonomic failure
      (PAF); and healthy volunteers. A total of 55 patients and 15 healthy volunteers are to be
      enrolled.

      Design: Patients and healthy volunteers enter this Protocol after undergoing clinical
      laboratory evaluation under NIH Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004, to confirm the diagnosis,
      identify NOH, and provide data related to central or peripheral NE production. Each subject
      serves as his or her own control. Subjects are tested after taking a single oral dose of 400
      mg of L-DOPS in a randomized crossover design study of three treatment conditions L-DOPS
      alone, L-DOPS after carbidopa (200 mg), and L-DOPS after entacapone (200 mg). Healthy
      volunteers have CSF drawn by lumbar puncture under fluoroscopic guidance about 3 hours after
      administration of each drug combination.

      Outcome Measures:

      Primary: Hemodynamics, plasma catechols and their metabolites, non-motor symptom checklists

      Secondary: (In healthy volunteers) CSF catechols and their metabolites

      Other: (In patients with dysarthria) Speech

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All subjects in this Protocol will have already undergone clinical laboratory evaluations
        called for in Clinical Protocol 03-N-0004, &quot;Clinical Laboratory Evaluation of Primary
        Chronic Autonomic Failure.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Age: People younger than 18 years old are excluded.

        Risk: A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, Protocol participation would place the subject at substantially
        increased acute medical risk. This includes the risks associated with air travel to the
        NIH. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or
        Clinical Director, the medical risk outweighs the potential scientific benefit.

        Disqualifying Conditions: A candidate subject is excluded if there is a disqualifying
        condition. Examples of disqualifying conditions are hepatic or renal failure, symptomatic
        congestive heart failure, severe anemia, psychosis, refractory ventricular arrhythmias, and
        symptomatic coronary heart disease. Persons with dementia interfering with their ability to
        provide informed consent are excluded. If dementia is suspected, such as by score on the
        mini-mental examination of less than 24, then a bioethics consult will be obtained.

        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the
        patient continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results.
        Examples would be treatment with levodopa/carbidopa or a tricyclic antidepressant. Patients
        with known or suspected allergy or hypersensitivity to any test drug are excluded. Patients
        unable to discontinue nicotine or alcohol temporarily are excluded. Patients are not to
        discontinue any medications before the patient or the patient s doctor discusses this with
        Dr. Goldstein, the Principal Investigator, or Sandra Pechnik, the Research Nurse. If it is
        decided that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the patient is excluded from
        the study. Subjects must discontinue use of alcohol and tobacco throughout the period of
        testing. PD patients who have difficulty tolerating withdrawal of levodopa/carbidopa
        treatment may be treated with a dopamine receptor agonist during the study, with the dosing
        remaining the same.

        Tricyclic antidepressants, drugs that inhibit L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase or
        catechol-O-methyltransferase, levodopa, and carbidopa will be withdrawn throughout the
        period of study. Withdrawal of antiparkinsonian medications may worsen rigidity,
        bradykinesia, or tremor. These effects are not thought to adversely influence the long-term
        course of the disease. Withdrawal of tricyclic antidepressants may worsen depression. Drug
        withdrawal will be done only in inpatients. Alternative drugs, such as serotonin reuptake
        blockers, anti-anxiety agents, or dopamine receptor agonists, may be used at constant doses
        during the study.

        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.

        Practical Limitations: Subjects in whom we feel it would be difficult to insert a catheter
        into a vein are excluded. Subjects who are not expected clinically to tolerate lying still
        supine during the testing are excluded.

        Pregnancy: Pregnant or lactating women are excluded. Women of childbearing potential must
        have a negative urine or blood test for pregnancy done within 24 hours before any testing
        involving radioactivity or an experimental drug.

        Post-Lumbar Puncture Headache: Candidate Healthy Volunteers are excluded if they had a
        headache requiring a blood patch after lumbar puncture under fluoroscopic guidance.

          <description>There are three interventions that every subject orally received over the duration of the study; 400 mg of droxidopa (LDOPS) + 200 mg placebo, 400 mg of droxidopa (LDOPS) + 200 mg carbidopa (CAR), and 400 mg of droxidopa (LDOPS) + 200 mg entacapone (ENT). The order of the three interventions was randomly assigned prior to drug administration and each intervention was followed by a wash out period of at least two days to clear previous intervention from subject’s systems. This arm received the three interventions in the order of: LDOPS + Placebo, followed by LDOPS + CAR, and lastly LDOPS + ENT.</description>
