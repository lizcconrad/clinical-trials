      The proposed study is designed to test the following hypotheses:

        1. Mouse autosomal or X-linked genes which are exclusively expressed in mouse spermatogonia
           are also spermatogonia-specific in human.

        2. Severe spermatogenic defect, especially hypospermatogenesis or SCOS, is caused by an
           intrinsic defect in germ line stem cell or speramtogenia.

        3. Spermatogonia-specific genes are caudate genes for human spermatogenic defect,
           especially for hypospermatogenesis or SCOS.

        4. For a significant fraction of cases with severe spermatogenic defect, the sterile genes
           are transmitted via multifactorial inheritance mode.

        5. For some cases with severe spermatogenic defect, mutations of spermatogonia- specific
           genes may be transmitted in the X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal
           dominant mode.

      Between 2% and 12% of couples worldwide are affected by reduced fertility. Men who have
      defects in sperm production (spermatogenic defect) account for about half of these cases. In
      Drosophila and mouse, targeted disruptions of numerous sterility- associated genes have been
      created. Physiological studies in the Drosophila and in mouse also indicate that
      spermatogenesis is subjected to complex regulation, and male infertility may result from
      aberrant regulatory events. In the human being, deletions of the Y chromosome account for
      only 10% of cases with spermatogenic defect, and etiologies of remaining 90% of cases are
      still unknown. It is evident that multiple genes are involved in male infertility. For cases
      with severe spermatogenic defect , testicular histology shows either decreased number of germ
      cells in all developmental stages (hypospermatogenesis) or complete absence of germ cells
      (Sertoli cell only syndrome or SCOS). It appears that there is an intrinsic defect which
      causes depletion of germ-line stem cells (spermatogonia) for cases with hypospermatogenesis
      or SCOS. Of 25 genes exclusively expressed in mouse spermatogonia, 3 are Y-linked, 10 are
      X-linked, and only 12 are distributed on autosomes.
