      The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA-balloon
      dilation (SeQuent Please) followed by bare metal stent (Coroflex ) deployment in the main
      branch (reference diameter: ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 3.8 mm, reference diameter of side branch: ≥ 2.0
      mm and ≤ 3.5 mm, length of stenoses in either branch ≤ 20 mm) in the treatment of significant
      (&gt;70%) de-novo-bifurcation stenoses of any Medina classification type in the native left
      coronary artery as reflected by procedural success and to evaluate the preservation of vessel
      patency.

          -  Women of childbearing potential may not be pregnant nor have the desire to becoming
             pregnant during the first year following the study procedure. Hence, patients will be
             advised to use an adequate birth control method up to and including 6-month follow-up

          -  Patients who are mentally and linguistically able to understand the aim of the study
             and to show sufficient compliance in following the study protocol

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the 9-month angiographic follow-up

          -  Patients must agree to undergo the 3-year clinical follow-up

          -  Patient is able to verbally acknowledge and understand the associated risks, benefits,
             and treatment alternatives of this trial. The patients, by providing their informed
             consent, must agree to these risks and benefits as stated in the patient informed
             consent document.

        Inclusion Criteria: Lesion Related

          -  De-novo bifurcational native left coronary artery lesion (reference diameter LAD or

             OMS1/OMS2: 2.0 mm to 3.5 mm, length of stenosis: ≤ 20 mm)

          -  Diameter stenosis pre procedure must be either more then 70 % in either one or both
             branches of the lesion (i.e., bifurcational lesion of any type of the Medina
             classification) or more then 50 % if ischemia corresponding to the target lesion is
             documented either by exercise stress ECG, stress echocardiography, scintigraphy, MRT,
             or suspected based on angina pectoris

          -  Single or multi-vessel coronary artery disease

          -  Patients with another coronary stent implanted previously into the target vessel ≤ 15
             mm distant to the current lesion, drug eluting stents less than 9 months and bare
