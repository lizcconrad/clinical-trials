  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional supplementation in postoperative recovery is still debated. Functional impairment
      is known to develop both secondary to inflammatory processes or secondary to reduced
      nutritional intake (e.g. disease induced anorexia). Since major surgery represents a
      traumatic event, surgical patients are at increased risk of malnutrition due to starvation,
      activation of neuroendocrine stress axis, inflammation and the subsequent increase in
      metabolic rate. Gastrointestinal surgery in particular can create additional problems as it
      often directly affects and limits dietary intake postoperatively and these effects frequently
      continue after discharge. Whereas manifest malnutrition occurs in about 15% of general
      surgical patients and in about 40% of oncology patients, postoperative weight loss of 5 to 9%
      occur in all surgical patients during the first two months. Moreover studies have shown that
      the nutritional status generally declines in hospital and both functional and nutritional
      status deteriorate for two months after discharge in malnourished surgical patients.

      Most studies that have investigated nutritional support in the surgical setting have
      concentrated on perioperative or short term postoperative supplementation and focussed on
      in-hospital infection and complication rate.

      Hypothesis I:

      Nutritional intake is decreased after surgery which results in an impaired nutritional status
      which in turn is associated with a decreased functional status. Protein rich nutritional
      supplementation is able to reverse nutritional depletion and restore functionality.

      Hypothesis II:

      Surgical stress leads to inflammation; inflammation - in addition to reduced nutritional
      intake - impairs functional status and increases morbidity. Anti-inflammatory, protein rich
      nutritional supplementation aims to prevent inflammatory complications and therefore improves
      functional status and reduces morbidity. In patients with high risk for inflammation, a
      higher effect of anti-inflammatory oral nutrition on recovery of functional status is
      expected.

      This study aims to determine whether 4 week oral nutritional supplementation and/ or
      specialized nutrients is effective in restoring functional status and reducing morbidity in
      surgical patients.
