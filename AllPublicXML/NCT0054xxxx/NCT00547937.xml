  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous studies present contradictory data concerning obstructive sleep apnea
      syndrome (OSAS), lipid oxidation and nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. This study was aimed:
      (1) to compare the concentration of 8-isoprostane and total nitrate and nitrite (NOx) in
      plasma of middle aged males with OSAS and no other known comorbidity and carefully matched
      healthy controls of the same age and gender; and (2) to test the hypothesis that nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, might attenuate oxidative stress and
      nitrate deficiency.

  <detailed_description>

      We performed a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and
      cross-over clinical study, in which patients received CPAP and sham therapy for two 12-week
      periods. Baseline measurements in healthy controls matched for age and gender were also
      obtained. At recruitment, 24-h blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), an echocardiogram (to rule
      out any cardiac dysfunction) and a sleep study was obtained in all participants . After
      fasting overnight, a venous blood sample (anti-coagulated with dipotassium EDTA, for
      8-isoprostane and total nitrate and nitrite concentration (NOx) determinations) and a urine
      sample were collected in all of them between 08:00 and 10:00 hours. Within 30 minutes of
      blood collection, plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min. All plasma
      samples were stored at −60°C until analysis. Patients with OSAS underwent a full-night CPAP
      titration study using an automated pressure setting device (Auto Set; ResMed, Sydney,
      Australia). Compliance with therapy was obtained from a built-in run-time counter. After 12
      weeks, CPAP device was switched to the alternate mode of therapy and ABPM,, plasma and urine
      sampling were repeated in patients

    <description>The sham CPAP device consisted of a conventional CPAP device, in which the area of the exhalation port was amplified, thereby nearly cancelling nasal pressure; an orifice resistor was connected between the tubing and the CPAP unit that loads the blower with the same airflow resistance as in effective CPAP</description>
