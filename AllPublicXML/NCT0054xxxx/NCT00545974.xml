    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine whether memantine is effective in slowing
      the rate of behavioral decline in frontotemporal dementia.

      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of long-term
      treatment with memantine in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or semantic dementia
      (SD). To determine whether memantine is effective in slowing the rate of cognitive decline in
      frontotemporal dementia. To evaluate whether memantine delays or decreases the emergence of
      parkinsonism in frontotemporal dementia.

      The tertiary objective of the study is to determine whether treatment with memantine affects
      changes in weight

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of memantine 10 mg
      twice daily versus placebo, at a ratio of 1:1, to receive active drug or placebo. Screening
      and enrollment is planned to last approximately one year. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board,
      consisting of a clinical pharmacist and 3 neurologists will review all AE reports
      approximately every 3 months after study initiation. The DSMB will notify the principal
      investigator, the study sponsor and the CHR if significant concerns are raised by their
      review of the AE data. An interim analysis of efficacy data will be conducted after 50% of
      the targeted enrollment population has completed 26 weeks of drug treatment.

      Including screening and off-drug follow up, each subject will participate in the study for
      approximately 34 weeks.

      The entire study is anticipated to last 86 weeks if enrollment is completed within one year
      of study initiation.

      The targeted enrollment is 140.

A screening question is asked about each sub-domain. If the responses to these questions indicate that the patient has problems with a particular sub-domain of behavior, the caregiver is only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, their severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptom causes them on a 5-point scale. Severity(1=Mild to 3=Severe),frequency(1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score(range 0-144);higher score=greater behavioral disturbances;negative change score from baseline=improvement.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject must meet ALL of the following criteria to be considered for enrollment in this
        study:

          1. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the subject and the subject's
             caregiver in accordance with local IRB regulations.

          2. Must meet criteria Neary et al. criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or semantic
             dementia (SD)

          3. Age: 40-80

          4. CT or MRI of brain within 12 months consistent with a diagnosis of FTD or SD.

          5. MMSE ≥ 15 at screening visit.

          6. Judged by investigator to be able to comply with neuropsychological evaluation at
             baseline.

          7. Must have reliable caregiver accompany subject to all study visits. Caregiver must
             read, understand and speak English fluently in order to ensure comprehension of
             informed consent form and informant-based assessments of subject. Caregiver must also
             have frequent contact with subject (at least 3 times per week for one hour) and be
             willing to monitor study medication compliance and the subject's health and
             concomitant medications throughout the study.

          8. In the opinion of the investigator, the patient and the caregiver will be compliant
             with the protocol and have a high probability of completing the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any one of the following will exclude a subject from being enrolled into the study:

          1. Insufficient fluency in English to complete neuropsychological and functional
             assessments.

          2. Concurrent Motor Neuron Disease judged by investigator to have bulbar or upper
             extremity impairments at baseline that would interfere with neuropsychological
             assessment, or that are expected to lead to such impairments within one month.

          3. Exclusion criteria as listed in Neary criteria. Diagnosis of progressive nonfluent
             aphasia by Neary criteria.

          4. Use of memantine within 4 weeks prior to randomization.

          5. Evidence of other neurological or psychiatric disorders which preclude diagnosis of
             FTD (including, but not limited to, stroke, Parkinson's disease, any psychotic
             disorder, severe bipolar or unipolar depression, seizure disorder, or head injury with
             loss of consciousness) within the past year.

          6. Concurrent treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic agents, mood
             stabilizers (valproate or lithium) or benzodiazepines (other than temazepam or
             zolpidem), or use of any of these agents within 4 weeks prior to randomization.
             Atypical antipsychotic agents may be started after the baseline visit if felt to be
             medically necessary by the investigator and will be recorded as a secondary outcome
             measure.

          7. History of alcohol or substance abuse within 1 year prior to screening, if deemed
             clinically significant by investigator.

             cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal or neurological disease. If the
             condition has been stable for at least the past year and is judged by the investigator
             not to interfere with the patient's participation in the study, the patient may be
             included.

          9. Clinically significant lab abnormalities at screening, including Creatinine ≥ 1.7, B12
             below laboratory normal reference range or TSH above site's laboratory normal
             reference range. Subjects with abnormal B12 or TSH levels at screening may be included
             per investigator's discretion.

        9. CT or MRI evidence of any of the following: hydrocephalus, stroke, space-occupying
        lesion, cerebral infection or any clinically significant CNS disease other than FTD.

        10.Systolic blood pressure greater than 180 or less than 90 mm Hg. Diastolic blood pressure
        greater than 105 or less than 50 mm Hg.

        11. Abnormal ECG at screening judged to be clinically significant by the investigator.

        12. Use of investigational drugs or participation in investigational drug study within 60
        days of screening.

A screening question is asked about each sub-domain. If the responses to these questions indicate that the patient has problems with a particular sub-domain of behavior, the caregiver is only then asked all the questions about that domain, rating the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, their severity on a 3-point scale, and the distress the symptom causes them on a 5-point scale. Severity(1=Mild to 3=Severe),frequency(1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) scales recorded for each domain; frequency*severity=each domain score(range 0-12). Total score=sum of each domain score(range 0-144);higher score=greater behavioral disturbances;negative change score from baseline=improvement.</description>
