    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of Mentor Purified Toxin, Botulinum Toxin Type A, Purified
      Neurotoxin, injected intramuscularly into the neck, is being evaluated as a treatment for
      painful and non-painful spasmodic torticollis/cervical dystonia. It is hypothesized that
      treatment will decrease symptom severity and will not have any significant side effects.
