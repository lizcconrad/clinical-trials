  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacological effects of PDC-748 were tested in numerous in vitro and in vivo studies.
      The existing pharmacologic findings suggest that PDC-748 possesses certain inhibitory
      activity to the citric acid- and capsaicin-induced cough reflex in guinea pigs with a
      dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a previous Phase I/II uncontrolled, dose-escalating study
      has shown PDC-748 to be well tolerated and may help to alleviate daytime cough with a
      dose-responding manner.Hence, PhytoHealth Corporation intends to carry out a Phase II
      investigation to confirm the preliminary findings using placebo in the comparator group, and
      to further investigate PDC-748 with a dose escalating manner to establish the dose-response
      range for its antitussive effect, and if possible, to determine the maximal tolerable dose of
      PDC-748.

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalating study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the escalating dose levels of PDC-748 in patients with acute cough.
