      Background/Aim of the study: To further reduce the 6 months stroke morbidity and mortality in
      a high volume stroke hospital and to compare the results with national and international
      data.

      Methods: 204 consecutive stroke patients are analyzed in a prospective study in a single
      center teaching institution. The intervention consists of a structured therapeutic chain of
      290 collaborating GPs, a standardised acute hospital proceeding overlapping with an early
      integrated neurovascular rehabilitation within the same institution. Primary endpoints
      include death and dependence at 6 months, secondary endpoints are the length of hospital stay
      (LOS) and the quantitative analysis of physical and psychosocial impairments. The data are
      directly compared with the same endpoints of the Swiss subgroup of the international stroke
      trial (IST).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An acute cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke or intra-cerebral bleeding (ICB)) with
             the signs and symptoms of an acute stroke according to the World Health Organisation
             definition of acute stroke14 within the last 12 hours without the need or possibility
             of a neurosurgical intervention

          -  No thrombolytic therapy within the first 3 hours (in order to allow the correct
             comparison with the Swiss cohort of the IST trial

          -  The informed consent of the patient or, if not possible, of the relatives

          -  Living at home before the event

          -  Lack of participation in another trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Thrombolytic therapy within the first 3 hours (in order to allow the correct
             comparison with the Swiss cohort of the IST trial

          -  No informed consent of the patient or, if not possible, of the relatives

          -  Not living at home before the event

          -  Participation in another trial (26 patients were excluded because of TIA with full
             recovery within 24 hours after the event)
