    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the utility of Effexor® (venlafaxine) in achieving response,
      including time to response, maintaining remission, and time to remission as measured by the
      17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and to determine the utility of Effexor®
      (venlafxine) on the various cluster of symptom scales in the 17-item HAM-D.
