  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there are no established 2nd-line or salvage chemotherapy regimens for patients
      with HRPC, many of whom retain an excellent performance status. The antitumor characteristics
      and toxicity profile of vinflunine make it an ideal agent to be investigated in this setting.
      In this Phase II trial, we plan to evaluate the efficacy, toxicity, and feasibility of
      administering IV vinflunine at a dose of 320 mg/m2 q3w as salvage chemotherapy in patients
      with HRPC. The patients will be evaluated for response, survival, and toxicity. If
      significant antitumor activity is demonstrated, further evaluation of this agent either alone
      or combination regimens and at earlier stages of disease will be indicated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized (single-arm), open-label, multi-center, single-agent, Phase II study
      of vinflunine as second- or third-line treatment of subjects with HRPC. The primary objective
      of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of vinflunine in the salvage treatment, as measured
      by Protein-Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate endpoint.

      The primary objective of this study is as follows:

      To evaluate the efficacy (as measured by the PSA response rate) of IV vinflunine administered
      q3w in HRPC patients who have progressed after one or two previous chemotherapy regimens.

      Secondary Objectives

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of IV vinflunine administered q3w in HRPC patients who have
           previously received chemotherapy (one or two regimens), as measured by:

             -  Time to PSA progression

             -  Overall survival

             -  Palliative response in patients with an Analgesic Score (AS) ≥10 and stable
                baseline pain

             -  Health-Related Quality of Life

        -  To assess the efficacy (as measured by the PSA response rate) of IV vinflunine in HRPC
           patients based on their response to prior chemotherapy

        -  Chemotherapy responsive - previous response to most recent chemotherapy regimen lasting
           &gt;2 months after completion.

        -  Chemotherapy refractory - failure to respond to, or progression during or within three
           months of completing last chemotherapy.

        -  To assess the response rate to IV vinflunine in the subset of patients with measurable
           disease, as measured by traditional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
           (RECIST) criteria (Therasse et al. 2000).

        -  To evaluate the safety of IV vinflunine administered every three weeks in HRPC patients
           who have previously received chemotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Men age 18 years of age or older who have HRPC are eligible for this study based on the
        following inclusion criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          2. Progressive hormone refractory locally advanced or metastatic disease.

               -  (Definition of HRPC): Clinical or serological evidence of disease progression
                  despite adequate anti-androgen therapy, documented by castrate levels of serum
                  testosterone (&lt;50 ng/mL).

               -  Patients on medical castration therapy should continue on treatment to maintain
                  castrate levels of serum testosterone. Patients receiving anti-androgen or
                  estrogen therapy should either be maintained on it, or have documented
                  progression 4 weeks after withdrawal of all agents (except nilutamide and
                  bicalutamide), which requires 6 weeks.

          3. Disease Progression, documented by any of the following:

               -  PSA Progression, documented by an elevated PSA level (&gt;5 ng/mL), which has risen
                  serially from the baseline PSA value (PSA value #1) on two occasions, each at
                  least 1 week apart (these will be considered PSA values #2 and #3). (Note: if the
                  level of PSA value #3 is less than the level of PSA value #2, a subsequent PSA
                  value must be obtained (PSA value #4) at least 1 week after PSA value #3 was
                  measured. In order for this event to be considered a PSA progression, the level
                  of this final PSA value (PSA value #4) must be greater than the PSA level that
                  was observed for PSA value #2.

               -  Progressive metastatic prostate carcinoma, documented by computed tomography
                  (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or radiograph of non osseous lesions (see
                  Section 7.2).

               -  Bone Scan Progression, documented by the appearance of at least one or more new
                  lesions that are not believed to be secondary to tumor flare phenomenon.

          4. Patients with bone only disease must have a PSA level &gt;=5 ng/mL; patients with stable
             lesions must have evidence of PSA progression. Patients must have radiographically or
             clinically demonstrable metastatic disease.

          5. Receipt of either 1 or 2 previous chemotherapy regimens; one of these regimens must
             have included docetaxel.

          6. ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          7. Adequate bone marrow function, defined by: white blood cells &gt;=3,500/uL, hemoglobin
             &gt;=8 g/dL, platelet count &gt;=100,000/uL.

          8. Adequate renal function, defined by: serum creatinine &lt;1.8 mg/dL, or calculated or
             measured creatinine clearance (GFR) of &gt;=60 cc/min. Patients with a creatinine
             clearance of &gt;30 mL/min but &lt;60 mL/min may also be enrolled, but will require an
             initial adjusted dose (see Section 5.1)

          9. Adequate hepatic function, defined by: total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x the upper limit of
             normal, AST &lt;2 x the upper limit of normal.

         10. Patients must be able to comprehend the nature of the study and provide written
             informed consent.

         11. Partners of women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception while on
             treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter. Women of childbearing potential
             include females who have experienced menarche and have not undergone successful
             surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or are not post-menopausal (i.e., amenorrhea &gt;12 months).

         12. Patients on bisphosphonate therapy (at the discretion of the investigator).
