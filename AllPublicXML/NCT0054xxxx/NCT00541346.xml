  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of the efficacy of Daytrana (methylphenidate transdermal system)
      for the treatment of attention and behavioral symptoms in children with Autism Spectrum
      Disorders. Twenty patients will be enrolled and treated with 10-30 mg of Daytrana for a total
      of eight weeks. Changes in core hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention symptoms, autism
      spectrum symptoms and functional outcomes will be assessed. Acceptability of the transdermal
      route of administration in this population will also be assessed.

      The researchers hypothesize that Daytrana is a safe and effective medication for children
      with Autism Spectrum Disorders who have symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and
      impulsivity.

      The design will be an open-label trial of eight weeks duration with 20 children with Autism
      co-morbid for ADHD. The subjects will receive 7 days of 10 mg of Daytrana. The children will
      be seen weekly for assessment for 4 weeks then every two weeks until the eight week period is
      complete. After each week of treatment, response will be reassessed and the dose will be
      increased stepwise to 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg unless there are excessive side effects, in which
      case, the dose will be reduced to the previous dose or the patch wear time may be revised.

    <measure>Change in Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) Hyperactivity Scores From Baseline to 8-week Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC is a behavior rating scale administered by the clinician which is designed to measure behavior changes brought about by drug treatment effects. 16 of these items comprise the hyperactivity, noncompliance factor. Each item is scored on a 3 point scale where 0 indicates the behavior is not a problem and 3 indicates the behavior problem is severe in degree. The minimum score on this factor is 0 (no behavior problems) while the maximum score is 48 ( severe behavior problems).</description>

    <measure>Change in Lifetime Participation Scale (LPS) Total Scores From Baseline to 8-week Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The LPS was developed to capture treatment-related improvements in adaptive functioning including quality of life, social development, and emotion regulation. There are 24 items scored using a 4-point Likert frequency scale (0=Never or Seldom, 1=Sometimes, 2=Often, 3=Very Often). A summed scale score (possible range of 0 to 72) was used in the analyses described below. Higher scores indicate more adaptive functioning.</description>

    <measure>Change in Family III General Scale Summed Score From Baseline to 8-week Follow-up Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Assessment measure is a self-report instrument that provides quantitative indices of family strengths and weaknesses. Each items is rated 0 (strongly agree) to 3 (strongly disagree). The General scale produces seven subscales: task accomplishment, role performance, communication, affective expression, involvement, control and values and norms. The minimum score for each subscale is 0 while the maximum score is 15. Higher raw scores indicate a higher number of family problems reported. A total summed score of all scale scores was used in the analyses described below. The possible range of this total score was 0 to 105. Like the subscales, higher values for this total summed score indicate a higher number of family problems reported.</description>

        <title>Change in Family III General Scale Summed Score From Baseline to 8-week Follow-up Visit</title>
        <description>The Family Assessment measure is a self-report instrument that provides quantitative indices of family strengths and weaknesses. Each items is rated 0 (strongly agree) to 3 (strongly disagree). The General scale produces seven subscales: task accomplishment, role performance, communication, affective expression, involvement, control and values and norms. The minimum score for each subscale is 0 while the maximum score is 15. Higher raw scores indicate a higher number of family problems reported. A total summed score of all scale scores was used in the analyses described below. The possible range of this total score was 0 to 105. Like the subscales, higher values for this total summed score indicate a higher number of family problems reported.</description>

        <title>Change in Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory (PEDI) Caregiver Assistance: Self-Care From Baseline to 8-week Follow-up Visit</title>
        <description>The PEDI Caregiver Assistance measures rate the child's function in three domains: Self-care, Mobility, and Social Function. Items are scored 0 (total, where the child is completely dependent on assistance) to 5 (independent, where no assistance is given or required). Scale scores represent summed item scores within each domain. The Self-Care scale score ranges from 0 to 40. A higher score indicates a higher degree of independence in the self-care area.</description>
