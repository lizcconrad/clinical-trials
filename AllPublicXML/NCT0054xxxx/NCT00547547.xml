      RATIONALE: Brassica juncea that contains high amounts of selenium may slow the growth of
      cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan and capecitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving high-selenium Brassica juncea together with combination
      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of high-selenium
      Brassica juncea and capecitabine when given together with irinotecan in treating patients
      with advanced cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of high-selenium Brassica juncea (BJ-Se) and
           capecitabine when administered in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride in patients
           with advanced malignancies.

        -  To determine the effects of BJ-Se on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan hydrochloride
           and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effect of BJ-Se on the serum selenium and protein profile.

        -  To correlate response and tolerance to this regimen with expression of key enzymes
           involved as targets or with the metabolism of the components of treatment, including
           thymidylate synthase and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.

        -  To evaluate changes to potential selenium related parameters.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of high-selenium Brassica juncea
      (BJ-Se) and capecitabine. The dose of capecitabine is escalated first, followed by dose
      escalation of BJ-Se.

      Patients receive oral BJ-Se on days -7 to 21 in course 1 and on days 1-21 in all other
      courses. Patients also receive irinotecan IV on days 1 and 8 and oral capecitabine twice
      daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity
      or disease progression.

      After the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine and BJ-Se are determined, additional
      patients are accrued and receive treatment at the MTD. Blood is collected from these patients
      during course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.
