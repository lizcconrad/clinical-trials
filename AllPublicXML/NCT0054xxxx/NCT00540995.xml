      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy drugs, such as busulfan and etoposide, and intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
      It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When
      the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy together with busulfan and etoposide before a
      transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy when given together with busulfan and etoposide
      followed by a donor stem cell transplant and to see how well it works in treating patients
      with advanced myeloid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a large field image-guided IMRT, using
      helical tomotherapy, when given in combination with IV busulfan and VP-16 as a preparative
      regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from an HLA-identical
      sibling in patients with advanced myeloid malignancies. (Phase I) II. To describe the
      toxicities at each dose level studied. (Phase I) III. To estimate the radiation doses to the
      whole body, normal organs, and bone marrow through serial imaging studies following the
      administration of IMRT. (Phase I) IV. To estimate the overall survival probability,
      disease-free survival probability, and relapse rate associated with this preparative regimen.
      (Phase II) V. To characterize the treatment related mortality and toxicity profile
      (early/late) associated with this regimen. (Phase II) VI. To descriptively compare the
      outcomes of patients treated on this protocol to a comparable patient population conditioned
      with whole-body radiotherapy. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      followed by a phase II study.

      PREPARATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive busulfan IV once daily over 2 hours on days -15
      and -13 and then every 6 hours on days -12 to -9. Patients also receive etoposide IV on day
      -3. Patients undergo image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy using helical
      tomotherapy on days -8 to -5.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation or
      bone marrow transplantation on day 0.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive GVHD prophylaxis that excludes
      methotrexate.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 1 year and then
      annually for 2 years thereafter.

             risk/benefit information as part of the consenting process; alternative treatment
             modalities are also discussed at this meeting

        Exclusion

          -  Prior radiation therapy/exposure that prevents patient from receiving IMRT
             (Determination will be made by the Radiation Oncologist)

          -  Patients who have previously undergone a blood/marrow transplant and now have relapsed
             disease

          -  Patients with a psychological or medical condition that the treating physician deems
             unacceptable to proceed to allogeneic bone marrow transplant

          -  Pregnancy

          -  EKG showing ischemic changes or abnormal rhythm and echocardiogram showing ejection
             fraction &lt; 50 % or abnormal wall motion
