  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effects of anti-HIV drugs on hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) viral load in people infected with both HCV and HIV.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coinfection with HCV and HIV occurs in 20% to 30% of HIV infected people in the United
      States. Individuals with HCV/HIV coinfection tend to have higher HCV viral loads than
      individuals with HCV alone. However, current evidence suggests that initiation of effective
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be associated with increases in HCV viral load. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate changes in HCV viral load associated with the initiation of ART
      in HCV/HIV coinfected adults.

      All participants will receive ART consisting of efavirenz once daily and the co-formulation
      of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) once daily. If participants are
      unable to tolerate a different regimen would be prescribed.

      There will be at least 21 study visits. During the first week of the study, participants will
      undergo blood draws for viral kinetic sampling and initiation of study medications. Following
      the first week, there will be weekly visits for 96 weeks. At screening, participants will
      undergo vital signs measurements, a physical exam, medical history, blood collection, and
      liver biopsy. During Week 1, participants will be hospitalized for 24 hours for initiation of
      ART and viral kinetic sampling. Blood draws for viral kinetic sampling of HCV and HIV will be
      performed at Hours 0, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24. Participants will return to the clinic or
      hospital at Hours 48, 72, 96, and 167 for additional viral kinetic sampling. Blood collection
      will occur at all visits; physical exams, vital signs measurement, a side effects
      questionnaire, and urine and semen collection will occur at selected visits.
