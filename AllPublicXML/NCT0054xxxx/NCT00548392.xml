      The purpose of this study is to determine how long collagen based marker clips remain visible
      by ultrasound after placement in suspicious breast lesions and if collagen based marker clips
      can be reliably identified in the operating room and serve as effective guidance for surgical
      removal of high risk or malignant breast lesions.

    <textblock>
      Many breast cancers and other breast lesions are discovered as a palpable abnormality by
      patients or their providers during a breast exam. Diagnostic imaging and biopsy of these
      lesions may reveal high-risk or malignant findings. These palpable lesions can be removed in
      the operating room by the surgeon using touch as guidance. However, there are many lesions
      discovered by screening examinations that surgeons cannot palpate. When this occurs, a
      radiologist will percutaneously place a wire or wires at the site of the breast lesion using
      sonographic or mammographic guidance. The surgeon then uses the wires as a guide for complete
      and successful resection of the lesion.

      New marker devices have been developed that are sonographically visible. They consist of the
      standard mammographically visible metallic clip surrounded by a sonographically visible
      collagen plug. It is hypothesized that radiologists and surgeons can effectively localize the
      clip with intra-operative ultrasound and then resect the lesion. If so, the pre-operative
      wire localization procedure could be eliminated. This could improve the patient experience
      while saving time and money by reducing the number of invasive procedures from 3 (biopsy,
      wire-localization and operation) to 2 (biopsy and operation).

             consent.
