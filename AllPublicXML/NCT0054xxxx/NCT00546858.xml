  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is important in urologic nursing since many patients have interstitial cystitis
      (IC), a condition of frequency, urgency and pain affecting more than 1 million women in the
      United States. The vulva may actually be the site of some of the reported pain in women with
      IC, not the urethra or bladder. IC and vulvodynia can impact one's sexual functioning and
      diminish one's quality of life.

      The purpose of this two-part study is to identify and clinically confirm the presence of
      vulvodynia in women diagnosed with Interstitial Cystitis (IC).
