  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if multiple doses of two inhaled drugs
      will help Cystic Fibrosis patients whose lungs are infected with a bacteria called
      Burkholderia dolosa. The names of these drugs are tobramycin solution for inhalation and
      amiloride solution for inhalation. Currently, treating patients with Burkholderia dolosa
      infections is challenging because the bacteria is resistant to antibiotics. Therefore,
      researchers are looking for drugs which, when taken with an antibiotic, will help the
      antibiotic to work more effectively.
