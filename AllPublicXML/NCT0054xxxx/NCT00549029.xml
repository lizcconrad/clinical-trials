      To observe not only the distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism in genes related with
      pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetics alteration of statins but also to analyze the
      correlation between these SNPs and the incidence of statins-induced myopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Statins are widely prescribed for the patients with hypercholesterolemia.

      Though their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events has been shown by a large number of
      clinical trials, myotoxic side effects including myopathy or even more severe,rhabdomyolysis
      are associated with the use of statins.

      Because the incidence of myopathy is various among individuals,polymorphism in genes is
      supposed to be the main factor.

      Due to single nucleotide polymorphism in related genes,level of uptake, clearance and
      metabolism of statins can be seriously different among individuals resulting in various
      occurrence of myopathy.

      Therefore, analytical study in association between SNP of statins-related genes and the
      incidence of myopathy is such a critical research which can be applied into clinical fields.
