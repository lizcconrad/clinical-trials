  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single-dose, non-randomized, five-period crossover study in
      healthy volunteers. The duration of the study will last up to eleven weeks from screening to
      follow-up. PK samples will be taken.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteer Adult males and females of non-child bearing potential who are

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on the screening history, physical or
             laboratory examination, or any other medical condition or circumstance making the
             volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study.

          -  Subjects who metabolize carvedilol poorly based on CYP2D6 genotyping as determined at
             screening.

          -  Treatment with any prescription or non-prescription drugs (including vitamins, herbal
             and dietary supplements, as well as grapefruit-containing products) within 7 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to first dose of study medication and until the
             end of the study. Treatment with any CYP2D6 inhibitors such as but not limited to
             quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, duloxetine, and terbinofine at least 14 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to Day 1 of Session 1 and until the end of the
             study.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) preceding Day 1 of Session 1

             defined as a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more and/or a
             reduction in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more for standing vs. supine
             measurements.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period including the estimated
             550 mL of blood to be drawn during this study.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, or sensitivity to
             any of the study medications or components thereof.

          -  History of anaphylaxis or anaphalactoid reactions or severe allergic responses to
             drugs.
