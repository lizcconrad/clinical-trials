    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, parallel-group study with a total of 16 evaluable subjects. Subjects
      will be assigned to 1 of the following cohorts: Cohorts I (subjects with normal hepatic
      function; n+8 and Cohort II (subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, Child-Pugh
      classification Grade B; n=8). If, for any reason, the Genasense infusion is interrupted or
      discontinued prior to completion or the rate of administration of the Genasense infusion is
      changed, the subject will be replaced.
