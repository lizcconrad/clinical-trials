      Overall objective of this work is to identify optical properties of healthy, diseased,
      dysplastic and malignant oral tissues, to compare these with conventional diagnostic
      approaches such as standard of care clinical techniques as well as semi-quantitative
      histo-pathological assessment and potential biomarkers in oral tissues and fluids to (1) gain
      a better understanding of processes involved in oral pathology and (2) develop a combined
      patient specific, non-invasive method for the detection, diagnosis and screening of oral
      pathology. Thus our goal is to identify and evaluate microstructural, metabolic, vascular,
      protein, genomic and metabolomics biomarkers of oral pathology can be used to detect, predict
      and map oral pathology, especially neoplasia.

      We are recruiting patients with a wide range of oral conditions including plaque, dry mouth,
      toothache, root canal treatments, gum disease, oral sores, dysplasia and cancer, autoimmune
      conditions and others as well as healthy control subjects. We will use a range of
      non-invasive imaging modalities to obtain information on the ways in which the oral health
      status affects optical properties, and determine means of detecting and quantifying these
      factors.. Imaging modalities to be utilized include:

        1. Coherence and Doppler Tomography

        2. Laser Speckle Imaging

        3. Various forms of Spectroscopy

        4. Fluorescence

      Purpose of the research is to identify optical predictors and biomarkers of oral pathology
      Hypothesis: microstructural, metabolic, vascular, protein, genomic and metabolomics
      biomarkers of oral pathology can be used to detect, predict and map oral pathology,
      especially neoplasia.

      Researchers of the Beckman Laser Institute (BLI) have developed many non-invasive imaging
      modalities for assessment of oral tissue. This protocol will allow data acquisition with
      these multiple modalities to allow validation of data. Imaging modalities to be utilized
      include:

        1. Coherence and Doppler Tomography (OCT)

        2. Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI)

        3. Photon Migration Spectroscopy (PMS)

        4. Autofluorescence Imaging

      In addition, saliva samples from the patients will be analyzed and the resulting data
      regarding the dysregulation in the activities of genes, proteins and other molecules will be
      correlated with findings from different imaging systems with respect to the stage of oral
      carcinogenesis.
