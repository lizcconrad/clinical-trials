  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a painless and noninvasive procedure called
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with a method of physical therapy
      called constraint-induced movement therapy improves motor function in patients with chronic
      stroke. Research in healthy subjects has shown that when tDCS is combined with motor learning
      tasks, there is an increase in learning as compared to motor learning tasks only. The tDCS
      procedure sessions will be compared to sham (fake) procedure sessions, which is also called
      placebo stimulation. This study is double blind, which means neither the subjects nor
      researchers analyzing motor function will know if participants are receiving real tDCS
      stimulation or placebo. Only the person performing the procedure will know which one
      participants are receiving. Only by comparing the tDCS procedure to a sham (placebo)
      procedure can we understand if the tDCS actually improves motor function.

      We hypothesize that tDCS will enhance the effects of constraint-induced movement therapy on
      motor recovery in chronic stroke patients.

    <description>Each subject will receive 14 days (2 week period: 10 weekdays and 2 weekends) of constraint induced movement therapy. In addition, on the 10 weekdays during the treatment period, the subjects will come into the laboratory and receive up to 6 hours per day of training of the affected arm in a variety of tasks. At the beginning of each of the 10 weekday training sessions, participants will receive 40 minutes of active tDCS over the primary motor cortex.</description>

In addition, on the 10 weekdays during the treatment period, the subjects will come into the laboratory and receive up to 6 hours per day of training of the affected arm in a variety of tasks. At the beginning of each training day tDCS will be applied for 40 minutes with the current active for only 30 seconds over the primary motor cortex.</description>
