      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy with or without total-body irradiation before a donor
      umbilical cord blood transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells. It also
      helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil before and after transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well four different chemotherapy regimens given
      with or without total-body irradiation before umbilical cord blood transplant work in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the survival at day 100 of patients with relapsed, refractory, or poor-risk
           hematological malignancies treated with four different preparative regimens followed by
           allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using two unrelated umbilical
           cord blood (UCB) units.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the incidence and timing of neutrophil engraftment in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  To determine the incidence and timing of platelet engraftment in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  To determine the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease
           (GVHD) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine the survival at day 180 in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine the disease-free survival in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine the incidence of primary and secondary engraftment failure in patients
           treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine the incidence of transplantation-related complications (e.g., infection,
           veno-occlusive disease of the liver, or organ toxicity) in these patients.

        -  To determine the incidence of post-transplantation-related lymphoproliferative disease,
           secondary myelodysplastic syndromes, or other secondary malignancies in these patients.

        -  To determine the incidence of relapse in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine post-transplantation chimerism in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  To determine immune reconstitution in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Preparative regimens: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 preparative regimens.

             -  Regimen 1 (for patients &lt; 50 years of age and no contraindication to fractionated
                total-body irradiation (FTBI): Patients undergo FTBI 2-3 times a day on days -9 to
                -6 for a total of 11 fractions. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2
                hours on days -5 and -4 and fludarabine phosphate IV on days -5 to -2.

             -  Regimen 2 (for patients &lt; 50 years of age and unable to tolerate FTBI due to prior
                dose-limiting radiotherapy or significant cardiotoxicity): Patients receive a test
                dose of busulfan on day -10 and then dose adjusted busulfan IV 3-4 times daily on
                days -9 to -6, melphalan IV on days -5 and -4, and fludarabine phosphate IV on days
                -5 to -2.

             -  Regimen 3* (for patients unable to tolerate regimen 1 or 2; no age exclusion):
                Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV on days -8 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV
                over 2 hours on day -3 and undergo TBI (single dose) on day -2.

             -  Regimen 4* (for patients unable to tolerate regimen 1 or 2): Patients receive
                fludarabine phosphate IV on days -7 to -3 and melphalan IV on day -2.

      NOTE: *Treating physician decides the choice between regimen 3 and 4

        -  Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation: Patients receive 2 combined units of UCB IV
           on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF IV or subcutaneously beginning on day 5 (or later)
           and continuing until blood counts recover.

        -  Graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis: Patients receive cyclosporine IV twice daily
           beginning on day -1 followed by a taper according to institutional guidelines. Patients
           also receive mycophenolate mofetil orally or IV beginning on day 0 and continuing until
           day 27 (or as clinically indicated).

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
