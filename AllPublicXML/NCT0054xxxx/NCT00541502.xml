      This is a 24-week, observational, prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of
      improving cognitive function of aripiprazole in treating adolescents and young adults with
      psychotic disorder in Taiwan. Approximately 120 qualified patients who have clinical
      diagnosis of DSM-IV of psychotic symptom (e.g. schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders
      such as schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, shared
      psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder with psychotic feature or psychotic disorder not
      otherwise specified.) will be recruited to achieve at least 100 evaluable subjects. After
      signing the informed consent form, the demographics, medical history and concomitant
      medication will be recorded. Besides, physical examination, vital sign, BMI, DSM-IV
      multiaxial examination, CGI-S and menstrual history will be conducted. Laboratory tests and
      pregnancy test will be optionally conducted. After evaluating all variables obtained, the
      eligible patients will be enrolled into study. Patients who fulfill the inclusion / exclusion
      criteria will be performed the CPT, WCST, BPRS and WHOQOL. Afterwards, patients will be given
      their first medication at this visit (5 mg ~ 30 mg daily by subject). Besides, the switching
      period is maximum 8 weeks and is depended upon the clinical judgment of investigator.
      Efficacy will be evaluated by the change from baseline in Continuous Performance Test (CPT),
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), Brief Psychiatric
      Rating Scale (BPRS) and The World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL).
      Safety will be evaluated by the frequency of adverse events, abnormal laboratory results,
      physical examination, vital sign, BMI and menstrual history for female subgroup analysis.
