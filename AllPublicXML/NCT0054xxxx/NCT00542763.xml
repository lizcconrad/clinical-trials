  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by
      keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. In addition, various extraglandular manifestations
      may develop. Several immunomodulating agents have been attempted in the treatment of pSS
      without achieving satisfactory results. Currently, there is no approved systemic treatment
      for pSS.

      Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is a selective inhibitor of inosine-monophosphate-dehydrogenase which
      leads to inhibition of the de novo pathway of nucleotide synthesis. The antiproliferative
      effect of MPA mainly affects activated T- and B-lymphocytes because the proliferation of
      these cells is critically dependent on the de novo purine synthesis compared to other
      eukaryotic cells. Since these lymphocytes have been suggested to play a pivotal role in the
      inflammation and immunopathogenesis of pSS, mycophenolate-sodium might be a promising agent
      in the treatment of pSS.

      We perform a single-centre, open-label pilot trial with Mycophenolate sodium in pSS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolic acid containing compounds such as mycophenolate mofetil and enteric coated
      mycophenolate sodium are immunosuppressive drugs approved for the prevention of transplant
      rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an effective treatment in systemic lupus
      erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.

      MMF has been used as maintenance therapy after treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody)
      in a pSS patient. We have reported a case of successful treatment with MMF in pSS with
      vasculitis.

      The recent observations and the immunosuppressive effect of MPA in other autoimmune diseases
      led us to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MPA treatment in patients with pSS refractory
      to other immunosuppressive agents.

      The observation period will be 6 months. At baseline, after 3, and after 6 months we examine
      the clinical status including glandular function tests as well as different laboratory
      parameters associated with pSS. In addition subjective parameters will be determined on the
      basis of different questionnaires.

    <description>Medical treatment is initiated with one tablet of 360 mg mycophenolate sodium orally per day for eligible patient. The dosage will be increased weekly by 360 mg up to a maximum stable dose of 1440mg daily. In patients not well tolerating the drug the dosage can be reduced to 720 mg per day.</description>
