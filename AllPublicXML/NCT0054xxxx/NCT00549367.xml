      To evaluate the effectiveness of nutrition education and dietary counselling to improve the
      nutritional status, well-being and quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA)
      attending an HIV treatment facility in Bangkok Thailand. This will be achieved by determining
      if dietary counselling and nutrition education has an effect on nutritional status (weight,
      lean body mass and fat mass), dietary intake, food security, quality of life, biochemical
      parameters (including total cholesterol, LDL/ HDL cholesterol and Triglyceride), experience
      of symptoms and patient satisfaction
