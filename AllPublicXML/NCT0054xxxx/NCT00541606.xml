      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that pharmacists working collaboratively with
      physicians and other providers in an ambulatory care setting can improve glucose, blood
      pressure, and lipid control, as well as improve quality of life, adherence to screening and
      general preventative measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is evident that a multi-disciplinary approach is key to the success in controlling the
      disease of diabetes and its complications. The value of pharmacists' involvement in disease
      state management in producing positive outcomes for patients has been well documented in the
      literature. There have been several studies that have shown that pharmacists' involvement in
      diabetes care improves glycemic control. There are also studies that look at pharmacists'
      management of glycemic control and adherence to the ADA guidelines. Many of these studies are
      retrospective, lack a randomized control group, had a small study sample, or were short term.
      We undertook a prospective, randomized study to demonstrate that pharmacists working
      collaboratively with physicians and other providers in an ambulatory care setting can improve
      glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control, as well as improve quality of life, adherence to
      screening and general preventative measures.

    <description>Patients attended a minimum of 3 clinic visits (month 0, 6, 12) with one of the clinical pharmacists, where targeted physical assessment, education, and medication changes and follow up were recommended. Additional visits were arranged as clinically appropriate for drug monitoring. Referrals were facilitated to other clinicians where indicated, including ophthalmology, podiatry, CDEs, nutrition, and primary care. The pharmacists' recommendations for medication adjustment, laboratory monitoring and referrals were based upon the most recent guidelines and clinical trial evidence. Any therapy adjustment, lab testing or referrals required approval by the referring physician. A1c, lipid and BP values were collected prospectively at months 0, 6 and 12.</description>
