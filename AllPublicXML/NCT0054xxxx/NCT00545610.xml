      The purpose of this 12-month, observational, follow-up study is to collect additional data
      (by telephone contact) with which to assess the efficacy, safety, and effects of
      intramyocardial injections of adult autologous CD34+ cells on quality of life (QoL) in
      subjects with chronic refractory myocardial ischemia. No treatments will be administered
      during this study. However, the investigators and other study site personnel and the subjects
      will remain blinded to the treatment assignments from the core therapeutic study (# 24779) so
      as to provide a total of 24 months of blinded data.
