  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if OsseoSpeed™ implant 6 mm long is effective for
      rehabilitation of edentulism and if so, how it compares with OsseoSpeed™ implant 11 mm long.
      The primary hypothesis is that the alteration in bone level is equal in patients randomized
      to 6 mm as to patients randomized to 11 mm implants.
