  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uveal Melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adulthood. Eye preserving
      treatments can deliver equivalent life prognosis in the management of small and medium sized
      uveal melanomas, as compared to enucleation. Plaque radiotherapy has emerged as the most
      common eye-preserving treatment in the current management of uveal melanoma, but is
      complicated by visual loss in approximately 70% of patients at 10 years follow-up. Strategies
      for the prevention and early treatment of radiation retinopathy/maculopathy need to be
      developed to improve visual outcomes following plaque treatment. Ranibizumab (Lucentis) is
      the antigen binding fragment of a recombinant, humanized monoclonal antibody, which inhibits
      the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor A, a mediator in the development of
      choroidal neovascularization. Lucentis is commonly used in the eye for eye conditions such as
      age related macular degeneration. This study will investigate the possible benefit of
      Anti-VEGF therapy (Lucentis) in reducing the incidence of radiation complications following
      plaque radiation for uveal melanoma.
