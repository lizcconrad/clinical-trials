    <textblock>
      Previous research has demonstrated possible efficacy of Ephedrine in the treatment of
      congenital myasthenia caused by end-plate acetylcholinesterase deficiency.

      The aim of the current study is to test the hypothesis that Ephedrine may be beneficial to
      these patients.

      To test this hypothesis we will perform a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study
      clinical efficacy and safety study.

      Drug na√Øve patients who agree to participate will be randomized to two groups. Each group
      will be treated in a blinded manner for 5 weeks with either placebo or Ephedrine HCl in an
      escalating dose up to 100 mg per day divided in two doses. After five weeks the groups will
      cross over and continue treatment or placebo for a further five weeks.

      Evaluations of strength and fatiguability will be done at baseline, at the end of each five
      week period and after a further two weeks.

      Safety will be assessed weekly by the investigators using interview and physical examination.

      Outcome measures will include Barthel index, Quality of life questionnaire, Timed up and go,
      spirometry, timed elevation of limbs, and force measurements.

      All patients will report to the clinic as per study schedule (See Appendix A). Specifically,
      the 12 clinic visits will include: baseline (1), safety and efficacy assessments(10) and
      closeout (1).
