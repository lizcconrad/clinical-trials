      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to determine the effects of hesperidin on
      biochemical markers of bone in post-menopausal women.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To investigate changes in bone formation and bone resorption markers in response to
           hesperidin intake

        -  To compare the efficacy of hesperidin in a milk versus biscuit

        -  To collect safety information of hesperidin consumption in a human trial
