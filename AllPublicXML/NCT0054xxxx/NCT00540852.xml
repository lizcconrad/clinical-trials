  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal management of patients with locally advanced breast cancer remains a complex
      therapeutic problem. Newly diagnosed breast cancers in the United States with a higher
      incidence in medically underserved areas. The optimal intensity and duration of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy still remains controversial due to the difficulty of evaluating response to
      therapy. The goal would be to prevent over and under treatment of patients with neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.

      The Researcher developed a diagnostic device called Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging is a
      non-invasive optical technique that utilizes intensity-modulated, near-infrared light to
      quantitatively measure optical properties in thick tissues.

      Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging can images tissue hemoglobin , oxygen saturation, blood
      volume fraction, water content, fat content and cellular structure. The measurements provide
      quantitative optical property values that reflect changes in tissue perfusion, oxygen
      consumption, and cell/matrix development.

      There is no therapeutic benefit to the subject, especially none that might influence the
      indication for the diagnostic procedure as indicated. However, information obtained may lead
      to a new form of non-invasive imaging for the early detection of breast cancer.
