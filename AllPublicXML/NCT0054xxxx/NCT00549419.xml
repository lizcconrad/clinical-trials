  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the early identification and more precise
      intervention of goal-directed intraoperative plasma volume expansion and catecholamine
      therapy using arterial pressure based cardiac output (APCO) measurement in addition to normal
      vital signs will improve postoperative organ function, in particular renal function, in
      patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
