    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, dose escalation clinical study to evaluate the feasibility, safety,
      and tolerability of 3 different doses of immunoselected, culture-expanded, nucleated,
      allogeneic MPCs (NeoFuse) when combined with MasterGraft Resorbable Ceramic Granules
      (Medtronic Sofamor Danek USA, Inc.) compared to autograft in patients requiring posterior
      lumbar interbody fusion with NuVasive's radiolucent PEEK OPTIMA cage (to be used with
      autologous bone graft material) and 1 or 2 level posterolateral lumbar fusion surgery with
      instrumentation. The instrumentation used for this study will be the Monarch® 5.50 mm Spine
      System (DePuy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, randomized, open-label controlled Phase 1b/2a study
      designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of MPCs combined with MasterGraft
      Granules when compared to use of autologous bone graft in the posterolateral fusion site in
      subjects requiring interbody fusion in combination with instrumented 1 or 2 level PLF
      procedure. All subjects in this study will undergo a 1 or 2-level (2 or 3 vertebrae)
      interbody fusion without the use of the investigational product.

      In addition to the interbody fusion procedure, subjects will undergo an instrumented
      posterolateral fusion. NeoFuse plus MasterGraft Granules at one of three doses or autograft
      will be implanted in the posterolateral lumbar fusion site(s) only.

      After the screening and surgical visits, each subject will be evaluated clinically and
      radiographically within 3 days and 30 days after surgery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after
      surgery.

      Subjects will be evaluated at 24 and 36 months after surgery for safety.
