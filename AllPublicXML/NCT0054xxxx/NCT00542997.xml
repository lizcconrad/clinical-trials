    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy, tolerability, safety and
      pharmacokinetics of IgPro20 in patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency (PID).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of a 12-week wash-in/wash-out period followed by a 28-week efficacy
      period. During the 28-week efficacy period, subjects visited the study site at least every 4
      weeks for efficacy and safety evaluations and additionally recorded details regarding IgPro20
      dose and certain aspects of efficacy and safety in a diary. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters
      were assessed in a sub-group of subjects during 1 treatment interval at steady-state (Week 28
      ± 1).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Serum IgG Trough Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months prior to first IgPro20 treatment (Pre-study treatment) and Week 12 to 17 (IgPro20 treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Total IgG trough levels for IgPro20 treatment at steady state were compared with documented trough level data for IgG treatment received prior to enrolling in the study (either subcutaneous or intravenous IgG). For this purpose, 6 consecutive IgPro20 trough values (obtained prior to infusions 12 to 17) per subject were aggregated to the subject's median value and then median values across subjects were summarised using descriptive statistics. The same procedure was applied to pre-study treatment using the 3 most recent IgG trough values ≥ 5 g/L obtained prior to the first IgPro20 infusion.</description>

    <measure>Annual Rate of Clinically Documented Serious Bacterial Infections (ITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Efficacy period: week 12 to week 40 after study start or to the completion visit</time_frame>
    <description>Serious bacterial infections (SBIs) included bacterial pneumonia, bacteraemia/septicaemia, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial meningitis, and visceral abscess. Diagnosis of the SBIs was based on the presence of predefined clinical signs and symptoms as well as on laboratory parameters.
The annual rate was calculated based on the total number of SBIs and the total number of study days during the efficacy period for all subjects in the ITT population and adjusted to 365 days.</description>

    <description>IgPro20 is a liquid formulation of normal human IgG at a concentration of 20% administered as a SC infusion at weekly intervals. The initial weekly dose was determined based on subjects' previous treatment. Dose adjustments could be performed during the wash-in/wash-out period at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
