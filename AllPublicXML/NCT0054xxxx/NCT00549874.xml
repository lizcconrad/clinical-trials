  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis to be tested is that increased insulin resistance contributes to
      abnormal cardiac blood flow regulation in type 2 diabetic patients, which can be reversed by
      6 months treatment with rosiglitazone. The planned experimental approach will be to utilize
      nuclear medicine techniques to evaluate whether the administration of rosiglitazone for 6
      months can reverse regional deficits in myocardial blood flow and glucose utilization in type
      2 diabetes in a randomized double blind controlled study. These studies will help elucidate
      the potential of rosiglitazone to correct deficits of myocardial blood flow complicating
      diabetes with the overall aim being the eventual prevention of sudden cardiac death.
