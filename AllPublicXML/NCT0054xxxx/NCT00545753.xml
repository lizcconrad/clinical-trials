        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have an active head lice infestation present at Day 0.

          2. Subjects can be female or male, at least 6 months of age.

          3. Subjects must be in good general health based on medical history.

          4. Each subject must have an appropriately signed Informed Consent agreement. Subjects
             under the age of 12 must also provide written or oral assent.

          5. The subject/caregiver must be able to read English or Spanish at a 7th grade level.

          6. The parent or guardian within a household must be willing to allow other household
             members to be screened for head lice. If other household members are found to have a
             head lice infestation, they should also be enrolled in the study.

          7. Subjects must agree to not use any other form of lice treatment during the course of
             the study and must agree not to use any of the excluded concomitant medications.

          8. Subjects must agree not to cut or chemically treat their hair in the period between
             the initial treatment and the final visit.

          9. Subjects/caregiver must demonstrate a clear understanding of his/her requirements for
             study participation and agree to comply with study instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             products.

          2. Individuals with any visible skin/scalp condition at the treatment site which, in the
             opinion of the investigative personnel or Sponsor, will interfere with the evaluation.

             corticosteroids, anthralin, vitamin D analogs, retinoids, immunosuppressants, topical
             hair growth formulations, and topical dandruff treatments.

          4. Infested subjects who have been previously treated with a pediculicide within the 48
             hours prior to the study.

          5. Individuals with a condition or illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may
             compromise the objective of the protocol.

          6. Individuals receiving systemic or topical drugs or medications, including systemic
             antibiotics, which in the opinion of the investigative personnel or study monitor may
             interfere with the study results.

          8. Individuals (or individuals from households) who, in the opinion of the Investigator,

             unable to enroll in the study or to use the standard course of lice treatment.

         10. Females who are pregnant or nursing. Females of childbearing potential must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test prior to treatment at Day 0. If a household has a
             pregnant female with an active case of head lice, the entire household is excluded
             from participation. If the pregnant household member does not have lice, this
             individual must NOT be the caregiver (one who provides treatment to other household
             members).

         11. Sexually active females not using effective contraception.

        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of primary subjects in the enrolled households who were lice free (no live lice, adults or nymphs), as assessed by the trained evaluator, 14 days after the last treatment (i.e., Day 14 for subjects who treated once and Day 21 for subjects who treated twice).</description>

        <description>To evaluate the safety of NatrOVA® 1% Creme Rinse based upon reported adverse events and observed skin/scalp reactions. Additional safety assessments included cutaneous/ocular irritation.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were followed for a minimum of 14 days (1 treatment) and a maximum of 21 days (2 treatments)</time_frame>
        <population>558 subjects were randomized to treatment and 540 subjects used the study drug and returned for at least one post-baseline evaluation. At Day 0 the study drug was to be used within 24 hours. At Day 7 if subject presented with live lice they were provided a second treatment to be used within 24 hours. Thus subjects used 1 or 2 treatments.</population>
