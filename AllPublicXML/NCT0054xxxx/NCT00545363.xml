  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 2 arm study will assess the impact of bone marker feedback (BMF), using serum
      carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) and communication of results at 3 months, on
      adherence to once monthly ibandronate (150 milligrams [mg] per oral [po]) in women with
      post-menopausal osteoporosis supported by patient-relationship program (PRP). Participants
      will be randomized either to receive BMF or no BMF; both groups will be supported by PRP. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adherence to Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were considered adherent to treatment if they took at least 83 percent (%) of their assigned medications (5 of the 6 monthly ibandronate tablets) within the -1 to +21 days of their osteoporosis treatment date each month. Participant adherence was assessed by maintaining records of 'drug dispensed' and 'drug returned' on case report form (CRF) and participant's self-report on Visit 2 (Month 3) and final study visit (Month 6). A drug dispensing log was maintained by the investigator. Participants were instructed at the baseline visit and Visit 2 to save and return unused or partially used medication packages on Visit 2 and final study visit, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Osteoporosis Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (OPSAT-Q) Composite Satisfaction High Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The OPSAT-Q is a validated questionnaire designed to capture satisfaction with bisphosphonate treatment. It comprises four domains: convenience (questions 1 - 6), quality of life (questions 7 and 8), overall satisfaction (questions 9 and 10), and side effects (questions 11 - 16). Satisfaction with treatment was assessed using the OPSAT-Q composite satisfaction score, which was the average of the scores from the four domains of the OPSAT-Q converted to a 0 - 100-point scale. Higher scores indicated greater treatment satisfaction. A score of 80 or more was considered as high score.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Osteoporosis Patient Perception Survey (OPPS) and Osteoporosis Medical Care Satisfaction Questionnaire (OMSQ) Composite Satisfaction High Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>OPPS: A standardized 6-item satisfaction questionnaire for osteoporosis medical care and treatment received during the study. Individual item score was transformed and converted to a 0 to 100 scale where higher score indicated greater satisfaction. The composite score was the average of individual item scores (transformed) and ranged from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated greater satisfaction. OMSQ: A standardized 18-item satisfaction questionnaire for osteoporosis medical care, treatment received and blood test and their results during the study. Individual item score was transformed and converted to a 0 to 100 scale where higher score indicated greater satisfaction. The composite score was the average of individual item scores (transformed) and ranged from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated greater satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in CTX Based on Adherence to Ibandronate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Serum CTX, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, was assessed for all participants at baseline and at final visit (Month 6). The sampling was done at the same time of the day each time to overcome the effect of circadian fluctuations. Participants were considered adherent to treatment if they took at least 83% of their assigned medications (5 of the 6 monthly ibandronate tablets) within the -1 to +21 days of their osteoporosis treatment date each month. Participant adherence was assessed by maintaining records of 'drug dispensed' and 'drug returned' on CRF and participant's self-report on Visit 2 (Month 3) and final study visit (Month 6). A drug dispensing log was maintained by the investigator. Participants were instructed at the baseline visit and Visit 2 to save and return unused or partially used medication packages on Visit 2 and final study visit, respectively.</description>

    <description>Postmenopausal women will receive ibandronate 150 milligrams (mg) once monthly (QM) orally for 6 months. Participants, in this arm, will receive BMF at Month 3. BMF will be given in terms of providing serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) level at Month 3. A &quot;BMF-form&quot; will be provided to the physicians to allow offering the bone marker result in an easy way. Participants will be informed if their results are within or outside of the desired range. In addition, participants will also supported by PRP, to be carried out by supplying alarm devices, specifically designed to support the participant's regular drug intake.</description>

          <description>Postmenopausal women received ibandronate 150 milligrams (mg) once monthly (QM) orally for 6 months. Participants, in this arm, received bone marker feedback (BMF) at Month 3. BMF was given in terms of providing serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) level at Month 3. A &quot;BMF-form” was provided to the physicians to allow offering the bone marker result in an easy way. Participants were informed that their results were within or outside of the desired range. In addition, participants were also supported by patient relationship program (PRP), carried out by supplying alarm devices, specifically designed to support the participant’s regular drug intake.</description>

Participant adherence was assessed by maintaining records of ‘drug dispensed’ and ‘drug returned’ on case report form (CRF) and participant’s self-report on Visit 2 (Month 3) and final study visit (Month 6). A drug dispensing log was maintained by the investigator.

        <description>The OPSAT-Q is a validated questionnaire designed to capture satisfaction with bisphosphonate treatment. It comprises four domains: convenience (questions 1 - 6), quality of life (questions 7 and 8), overall satisfaction (questions 9 and 10), and side effects (questions 11 - 16). Satisfaction with treatment was assessed using the OPSAT-Q composite satisfaction score, which was the average of the scores from the four domains of the OPSAT-Q converted to a 0 - 100-point scale. Higher scores indicated greater treatment satisfaction. A score of 80 or more was considered as high score.</description>

Individual item score was transformed and converted to a 0 to 100 scale where higher score indicated greater satisfaction.

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in CTX Based on Adherence to Ibandronate</title>
        <description>Serum CTX, a biochemical marker of bone resorption, was assessed for all participants at baseline and at final visit (Month 6). The sampling was done at the same time of the day each time to overcome the effect of circadian fluctuations. Participants were considered adherent to treatment if they took at least 83% of their assigned medications (5 of the 6 monthly ibandronate tablets) within the -1 to +21 days of their osteoporosis treatment date each month. Participant adherence was assessed by maintaining records of ‘drug dispensed’ and ‘drug returned’ on CRF and participant’s self-report on Visit 2 (Month 3) and final study visit (Month 6). A drug dispensing log was maintained by the investigator. Participants were instructed at the baseline visit and Visit 2 to save and return unused or partially used medication packages on Visit 2 and final study visit, respectively.</description>
