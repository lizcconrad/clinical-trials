      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NK012 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of refractory solid tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose-escalation study of the intravenous administration of NK012 in
      patients with refractory solid tumors. Patients will receive NK012 as an intravenous infusion
      over 30 minutes on Day 1 followed by a 20-day observation period for a total of 21 days (3
      weeks) per cycle. Two patient populations will be evaluated separately: patients with
      UGT1A1*28 genotype homozygous wild type (wt/wt) and heterozygous (wt/*28) variants as one
      group, and patients with UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant (*28/*28) as another group.

    <description>Dose escalation starting at 9 mg/m2 in UGT1A1*28 (wt/wt and wt/*28) genotype patients, IV (in the vein) over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Number of Cycles: Up to 6 cycles, until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression develops: patients may continue treatment beyond 6 cycles if the Investigator determines that additional treatment would provide further benefit for the patient, as long as toxicity remains acceptable.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed malignant solid tumor for which there are no known regimens
             or protocol treatments of higher efficacy or priority

          -  Failed conventional therapy for the cancer or have a malignancy for which a
             conventional therapy does not exist

          -  Recovered from all acute adverse effects of prior therapies, excluding alopecia (hair
             loss)

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks and an EOCG performance status of 0 or 1

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Adequate kidney, liver, and bone marrow function

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or have not recovered from adverse effects
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent

          -  History of brain metastases or spinal cord compression, unless irradiated a minimum of
             4 weeks before study entry and stable without requirement for corticosteroids for &gt; 1
             week

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical composition
             to NK012

          -  Concurrent serious infections (i.e., requiring an intravenous antibiotic)

          -  Pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using methods to avoid
             pregnancy; a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be documented at baseline
             and before every NK012 administration for women of childbearing potential; no
             breast-feeding while on study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, unstable angina pectoris or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Significant cardiac disease

          -  History of serious ventricular arrhythmia

          -  Positive for anti-HbsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV, or anti-syphilis antibodies
