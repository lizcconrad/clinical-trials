      -  The primary objective of this clinical study is to demonstrate the efficacy of the fixed
           combination of pyronaridine artesunate granule formulation (60:20 mg; paediatric
           PYRAMAX®) by showing a PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological cure rate of
           more than 90%.

        -  Treatment success or failures will be classified according to WHO Guidelines 2005

    <textblock>
      The need for safe and efficacious anti-malarial treatments for infants and children is huge
      given that they are the major group affected by acute uncomplicated malaria. There are
      relatively few paediatric formulations of artemisinin combination therapies. In addition to
      the tablet formulation of pyronaridine artesunate (PA) (PYRAMAX), Shin Poong Pharm Co is
      developing a paediatric dosing form presented as a granule formulation, packed in appropriate
      aluminium sachets each containing 60mg pyronaridine tetraphosphate and 20mg artesunate.

      This Phase III study is designed to demonstrate that the efficacy of PA granule formulation,
      as assessed in terms of PCR-corrected APCR, is above 90% and subsequently to compare
      (non-inferiority) the efficacy and safety of PA granule formulation to Coartem® crushed
      tablets in infants and children.
