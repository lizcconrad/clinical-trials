  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to confirm efficacy and safety of NT 201 (Xeomin®, also known as
      IncobotulinumtoxinA) after one injection session and to determine the efficacy and safety
      profile and the duration of treatment effect of NT 201 in long-term treatment with repeated
      injection sessions.
