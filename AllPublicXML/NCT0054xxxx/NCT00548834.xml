      The purpose of this study was to confirm and extend the data from previous studies and to
      demonstrate the efficacy (in terms of signs and symptoms) and safety of monotherapy with
      CDP870 administered SC every 4 weeks compared to placebo in patients with active RA who had
      failed at least one DMARD.
