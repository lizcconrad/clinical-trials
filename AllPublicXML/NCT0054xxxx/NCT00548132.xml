  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We proposed to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial to study the effect of the
      use of a commercially-available chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge (Biopatch) as part of
      central venous catheter care on catheter-related bloodstream infections among patients in two
      Barnes-Jewish Hospital ICUs.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the time of the inception of this study, there were no published randomized controlled
      trial on the efficacy of the Biopatch in reducing bloodstream infections. Preliminary data
      has shown that the Biopatch decreases colonization of the catheter exit site and thereby
      decrease bloodstream infections but this was at that time only theoretical.

    <description>Patient's catheters were cleaned with chlorhexidine-alcohol solution at least weekly before application of the Biopatch.

Catheter dressing changes will only be done every 7 days unless there is visible blood, soiling underneath the dressing, or if the dressing comes off.</description>

        <description>This measure is a combination of patients with positive blood cultures (BSI) and patients who had signs and symptoms of sepsis but with negative blood cultures. These patients still required treatment with antibiotics.</description>

            <description>Patients in this group had the Biopatch applied on the catheter exit site after insertion of the catheter. Dressings were changed every 7 days along with the Biopatch after the skin was cleaned with a chlorhexidine-alcohol antiseptic solution. Dressings were assessed daily and changed if they were soiled, non-intact, or bloody before the 7-day period was up.</description>
