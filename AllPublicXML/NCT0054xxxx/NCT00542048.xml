  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of study CT 4003 is to assess the behavior of EndoTAG®-1 in the body
      (making a so-called pharmacokinetic profile). Therefore, the course of the drug in the body
      is examined, i.e. the amount and speed of the drug uptake as well as the distribution and the
      elimination of the drug is being investigated. Further objectives of the study are to assess
      the effect of EndoTAG®-1 on liver metastases concerning size and blood supply measured by
      imaging techniques (contrast-enhanced ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging as well as
      duplex sonography) and to assess the effect on blood markers which are indicators for the
      destruction and neoplasm of blood vessels (so-called markers of angiogenesis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver metastases are among the most frequent neoplasms of the liver and represent a quite
      uniform clinical entity regardless from which carcinoma they originate. The treatment is
      dependent on number and size of the hepatic lesions but still, none of the therapeutic
      options leads to satisfying results. The growth of tumors and metastases is dependent on
      blood vessels, which supply the tumors and metastases with nutrients. Liver metastases,
      independent from which original tumor they come from, are especially well supplied with
      blood. The aim of the treatment with the investigational medicinal product EndoTAG®-1 is to
      target the blood vessels, which supply the metastases, and destroy them. Consequently, the
      metastases themselves will be damaged.
