      The purpose of this study was to develop a nurse counseling intervention to increase physical
      activity behavior in people with type 2 diabetes and to improve their health

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects 20.8 million Americans and is the fifth leading cause of death in the United
      States. Although physical activity is a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes, it is
      difficult to change physical activity behaviors and up to 60% of individuals with diabetes do
      not participate in regular physical activity. The use of a nurse counseling intervention
      based on established behavior change theory with technology-derived graphical representations
      of glucose information created a unique opportunity to test the feasibility of motivating
      people with type 2 diabetes to change physical activity behaviors. The consent form described
      the study protocol, participant expectations, benefits, risks, and the process of maintaining
      participant confidentiality.
