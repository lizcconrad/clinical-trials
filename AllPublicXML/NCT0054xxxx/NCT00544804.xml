      RATIONALE: Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lapatinib in
      treating patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose lapatinib ditosylate in
           patients with HER2-overexpressing advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine whether tumor HER2 can be completely inactivated by lapatinib ditosylate at
           its MTD in the 5-day schedule.

        -  To determine whether the total inactivation of HER2 decreases cardiac ejection fraction.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to dose level.

      Patients receive escalating doses of oral lapatinib ditosylate twice daily on days 1-5 until
      the maximum tolerated dose is determined. Courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Some patients undergo tumor tissue and blood sample collection periodically for biological
      and correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for evidence of cardiac injury, tumor target
      lysis effects, and to determine if the lapatinib serum levels result in the inactivation of
      tumor HER2 and HER3 kinase and oncogenic signaling.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months.
