      Combination study of IPH2201 with Ibrutinib in relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (CLL) patients in 2 parts :

        -  phase 1b : a 3+3 design to assess the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)

        -  phase 2a: to evaluate the anti-leukemic activity of the combination

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designated to test the hypothesis that the combination of ibrutinib and IPH2201
      will result in a substantial complete response (CR) rate, especially CR without minimal
      residual disease (MRD), as this has been shown to be associated with long-term clinical
      benefit.

      Up to 45 patients are planned to be enrolled. During the phase 1b portion of the study, a 3+3
      design wil be employed. Four doses are planned to be assessed if the Maximum Tolerated Dose
      (MTD) is not previously reached: 1, 2, 4 and 10 mg/kg.

      During the phase 2a portion, patients will receive IPH2201 in combination with ibrutinib;
      IPH2201 will be given at the dose recommended upon completion of the phase Ib portion.

      The primary objective of the phase 1b is to assess the safety of IPH2201 given intravenously
      as a single agent and in combination with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia previously treated with at least one line of treatment.

      The primary objective of the phase 2a is to evaluate the anti-leukemic activity of the
      combination of IPH2201 and ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia previously treated with at least one line of treatment.

    <description>During phase 1b, patients receive IPH2201, IV, at the dose of 1, 2, 4 or 10 mg/kg, as a single agent during 4 weeks and thereafter combined with ibrutinib 420 mg, orally, once daily, during 52 weeks.
During phase 2a, patients receive IPH2201, IV, at the dose recommended upon completion of phase 1b portion, combined with ibrutinib 420 mg orally, once daily, from the first cycle, during 52 weeks. In both parts of the trial, the first 4 administrations of IPH2201 (from week 0 to week 6) occur every 2 weeks. From the 5th administration IPH2201 is administered every 4 weeks.</description>
