    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a brief clinic-based educational
      intervention on utilization of Double Up Food Bucks (DUFB)â€”a Michigan-wide Supplemental
      Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) healthy food incentive--among low income health center
      patients at a community health center in Southeast Michigan.

    <textblock>
      Study participants were provided a 3-5 minute explanation of DUFB, written program materials,
      and initial $10 market voucher. Participants were surveyed four times over five months, and a
      subset are also participating in post-intervention focus groups.

    <description>Use of DUFB at baseline assessed with yes/no response. At each of the the 3 follow-up surveys waves (1.5 months, 3 months, and 5 months), participants will be asked if they have used DUFB in the past month (yes/no), and if yes, how many times.</description>

    <description>Through an iterative process, three team members will independently conduct thematic analyses, compared codes, resolve discrepancies, and summarize key thematic findings.</description>
