  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men with advanced prostate cancer that may have spread to other
      parts of the body.

      Currently, once prostate cancer cells have spread from the prostate to other organs it is not
      treatable by surgery. The purpose of this study is to treat patients with an experimental
      antibody (i.e. that has not been FDA approved) called J591 that attaches itself to a special
      protein on cancer cells called PSMA to try to eliminate these cancer cells (called
      circulating tumor cells) from the circulation.

      In the initial phase of the study, 6 participants will receive the experimental J591
      treatment. Routine blood tests, research blood tests, physical exam will be performed at each
      visit. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire about how they are
      feeling. Participants will have a radiographic scan every 3 months to check the status of
      their disease.

      Participants who tolerate the treatment well may be re-treated at the same level every 3
      months, and may continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not
      experiencing unacceptable side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      J591 is a de-immunized monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of
      prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Background data demonstrate that mAb Hu-J591 doses
      as low as 20 mg may lead to a decrease in CTCs and that doses up to 300 mg are safe. With a
      goal of establishing less frequent, potentially more convenient and cost-effective future
      therapy, the investigators propose a single-center, open-label, dose de-escalation study to
      determine the effect of mAb Hu-J591 on circulating tumor cells in subjects with metastatic
      PC. Four dose levels are planned with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 24 subject enrollment
      starting with a single infusion of 300 mg of mAb Hu-J591.

      In the initial phase of the study a cohort of 6 subjects will receive 300 mg of mAb Hu-J591
      and blood samples will be collected pre and post-infusion for the detection of CTCs, PSA and
      to assess hematological toxicity at screening, baseline, week 1, week 4, week 8, and week 12.
      In addition, patients will receive a dose of 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 (5 mCi) 2-4 weeks prior to
      treatment and will undergo 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 PET imaging 1-3 weeks pre-treatment (optional) as
      well as repeat 89Zr-DFO-huJ591 infusion (5 mCi) at 11 weeks and PET/CT imaging at 12 weeks
      (optional).

      If less than four subjects respond by dropping their CTC counts from more than or equal to 5
      CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood to less than 5 CTCs/7.5 mL whole blood in the initial cohort, the
      trial will be ended at this dose. If four or more subjects respond, an additional 6 subjects
      will be accrued to the second dose level (200 mg). The same decision rule will be applied to
      evaluate two additional lower dose levels (100 mg, 50 mg) with 6 subjects enrolled in each
      cohort. Imaging studies will be performed prior to treatment at screening and at 3 months or
      as clinically indicated to assess disease response.

      Subjects who tolerate the initial infusion well (&lt; grade 2 toxicities) may be re-treated
      every 3 months (12 weeks) at the same dose-level until progression.

    <description>6 subjects will be treated at 300 mg dose. The decision about treating subjects at the lower dose will depend upon their response. If ≥4 of 6 subjects respond at the 300 mg level, then 6 more subjects will be recruited at the 200 mg level. If ≥4 of 6 subjects respond at the 200 mg level than 6 more subjects will be recruited at the next dose level of 100 mg. If ≥ 4/6 subjects respond at this level, then 6 subjects will be recruited at the last dose level of 50 mg. At any level, if the first four consecutive subjects respond, the next two subjects will be enrolled in the same dose-level cohort and further subjects will be recruited at the next dose level. Response at every dose level is defined by conversion from an unfavorable CTC count at baseline to a favorable CTC count.</description>
