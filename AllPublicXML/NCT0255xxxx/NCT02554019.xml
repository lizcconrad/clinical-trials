      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated intravenous
      infusions of the study drug BT063 in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
      compared with people who receive a placebo.

      Study 990 is a Phase IIa, proof-of-concept study of BT063 in subjects with SLE. This study is
      divided into 2 parts. After Part I an interim analysis will be performed. Each Part will
      enrol 18 subjects. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive BT063 or Placebo 8 times
      over 12 weeks and will be followed for 4 months after their last dose.
