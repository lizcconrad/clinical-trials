      The study aims to asses the ability of cell tests based on the analysis of the
      anti-Aspergillus cell responses and identify Aspergillus bronchitis with patients with cystic
      fibrosis.

      In addition, the study will evaluate the contribution of biological classification of
      aspergillosis according to criteria recently proposed by Baxter et al. compared to the
      classification used in clinical practice in the hospital of Montpellier.
