  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of study is to determine reactive oxygen products and antioxidant capacity with rosacea
      patients; to measure metalloproteinase level and inflammatory markers of immune response and
      investigate their corelation with demodex infestation and also investigate the role of
      photoaging and sebum secretion in rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rosacea is a common and chronic inflammatory disease characterized by facial erythema,
      papule, pustule and telangiectasia. Ultraviolet, Demodex mite, oxidative stress and
      antioxidant system disorders are emphasized in increased inflammation seen in rosacea.

      The aim of our study was to evaluate the status of oxidative stress, matrix metalloproteinase
      (MMP) and inflammatory markers in systemic circulation, their relationship with demodex
      density and investigate the role of photoaging and sebum secretion in rosacea.

      Forty patients with rosacea and age, gender and skin phenotype matched 40 healthy volunteers
      were enrolled in the study. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) was used to calculate
      facial demodex density. The number of demodex, follicle, the number of mite per follicle, the
      number of infested follicle and the number of mite per infested follicle were calculated with
      RCM.

      Photoaging severity and facial sebum levels were also assessed. Total oxidant capacity (TOC),
      total antioxidant capacity (TAC), oxidative stress index (OSI), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), aryl
      esterase (ARES), myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α),
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9
      (MMP-9) levels in venous blood were measured.
