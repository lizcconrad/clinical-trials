  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study designed to investigate the effects of aerobic dual belt
      treadmill walking versus traditional treadmill exercise on gait performance and functional
      capacity in older adults at risk for mobility disability. Identifying the relationship
      between aerobic treadmill exercise (dual belt or traditional) and the recovery of walking
      abilities will serve to optimize current rehabilitation approaches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be forty-eight older adults with pre-clinical mobility disability who will
      be randomized into one of three intervention groups: dual-belt treadmill exercise,
      traditional treadmill exercise, or non-contact control.

      Prior to and following 16 weeks of therapy, we will observe the participants' performing
      several functional movements (walking, standing from sitting, sitting from standing, walking
      up and down stairs) and measure their muscular activity. These performance-based measures
      will be obtained to determine whether their movement function improves as a result of
      therapeutic intervention. The participants' absolute performance on any of these tasks does
      not matter as much as that they make the very best effort on each of the tests. They are
      welcome to take a break at any point in the testing or training.

    <measure>Change in Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and up to 6 weeks following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability will be used. Includes 5 subscales: mobility, transferring, upper extremity, instrumental and basic activities of daily living.
Low scores indicate higher functioning and high independence. The Late-life function and Disability instrument will also be used. This has a 16-item disability component and a 32-item function component. Items are scored for 1-5 for function and 1-5 for frequency and extent of disability. Where high scores in frequency would represent more activity, and low scores in disability would represent less disabled.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and up to 6 weeks following the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by: electrocardiogram, blood pressure, spirometry tests, and ratings of perceived exertion.
The participant's maximal aerobic fitness, or oxygen consumption (VO2max) will be determined using a walking symptom-limited graded exercise test (GXT; modified walking incremental treadmill Naughton). All tests will follow the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) with electrocardiogram (ECG) heart monitoring and periodic blood pressure measures. Open-circuit spirometry will be used to determine VO2max and carbon dioxide production. Walking time until voluntary exhaustion or pain limitation will be recorded. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) values will be collected at rest, at each exercise stage and during recovery. The treadmill tests will be performed at baseline and following the interventions.</description>
