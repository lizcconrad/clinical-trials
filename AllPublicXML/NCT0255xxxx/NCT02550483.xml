    <textblock>
      The study (n = 36) will be a parallel design and will be 6 weeks in duration. Participants
      will start with a 2-week free-living wash-in period where they will be asked to avoid certain
      carotenoid-rich foods, followed by 4 weeks of a completely controlled diet. In addition to
      the controlled diet, participants will consume one of three beverages (300 mL/day; n =
      12/group): placebo beverage (control), high beta-carotene tomato juice, and high-lycopene
      tomato juice. Blood, urine and feces will be collected throughout the study.

    <description>Participants will receive high beta-carotene tomato juice daily in addition to the base diet. Meals will be prepared using traditional American foods with a macronutrient composition representative of a typical American diet. The base diet will be low in betacarotene and lycopene (no carrots, sweet potato, tomatoes, and dark greens). During the controlled diet period, participants will be instructed to eat all foods and only foods provided to them, with the exception of water, coffee, tea, and diet soda.</description>
