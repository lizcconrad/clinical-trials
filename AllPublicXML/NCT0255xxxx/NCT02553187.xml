      The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study. The planned sample size
      is 160 subjects. These subjects will be randomized (1:1) to treatment group (i.e., standard
      therapy plus Kanglaite Injection) or control group (i.e., standard therapy plus blank
      control). The study population includes the patients with non small cell lung cancer
      (adenocarcinoma), colorectal carcinoma and pancreatic carcinoma, who are complicated with
      cachexia.
