    <textblock>
      This pilot study is an open-label interventional study, prospective, non-comparative,
      sequential (two stages), national, multicenter study.

      Patients starting therapy with sunitinib or pazopanib as standard first line treatment for
      advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma will enter the study in one of the two cohorts
      (115 patients will be treated by sunitinib and 99 patients will be treated by pazopanib).

      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of sunitinib and pazopanib dose
      individualisation based on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and to assess the benefit of
      this approach in terms of tolerance and efficacy compared with the current empirical method
      based only on tolerance observation.
