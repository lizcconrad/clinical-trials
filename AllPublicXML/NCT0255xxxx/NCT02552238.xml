    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Lumason-enhanced dobutamine
      stress echo (DSE) in subjects having a suboptimal left ventricular endocardial border
      delineation (LV EBD) at rest and who are scheduled for coronary angiography.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitivity and Specificity of Lumason enhanced Dobutamine Stress Echo (DSE) for Detection and Exclusion of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed until they have coronary angiography or up to 6 months post dose to collect clinical information on cardiac events if no coronary angiography is performed</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnostic performance of the echocardiographic images will be compared to the truth standard to determine sensitivity and specificity. A diagnosis of CAD will be determined for both the echo images and truth standard (positive diagnosis for CAD is defined as &gt;/= 50% stenosis of any vessel on coronary angiography or if no coronary angiography is performed the occurence of a cardiac event based on clinical information for up to 6 months post dose; otherwise the diagnosis is negative).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Critical shift from suboptimal to optimal echocardiographic images</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed until they have coronary angiography or up to 6 months post dose to collect clinical information on cardiac events if no coronary angiography is performed</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects with suboptimal images (defined as &gt; 2 adjacent segments with inadequate LV EBD in any of the 3 apical views) at unenhanced stress echo converted to adequate (reduction of suboptimal segments in any of the 3 apical views) at contrast-enhanced stress echo</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in total LV EBD</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed until they have coronary angiography or up to 6 months post dose to collect clinical information on cardiac events if no coronary angiography is performed</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as the change in the total LV EBD score from peak stress unenhanced vs peak stress contrast-enhanced for each of the 17 segments (range 0-34)</description>

    <measure>Safety (adverse events, labs,vital signs, ECGs and pulse oxygen)</measure>

             unenhanced images at rest, defined as ≥ 2 suboptimal adjacent segments in any apical
             view.

        Exclusion Criteria:
