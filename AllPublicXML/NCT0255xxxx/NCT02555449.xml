    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the specially prepared study drug,
      LY3202626, containing radiolabeled carbon [¹⁴C] gets into the blood stream and how long it
      takes the body to get rid of it.

      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

      Participants will stay at a clinical research unit (CRU). The study will last about 28 days
      (check in to follow-up) for each participant.

      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
