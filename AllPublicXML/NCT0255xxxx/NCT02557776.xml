      The overall purpose of the study is to evaluate a method for offering mutation analysis of
      BRCA1 and BRCA2 to all patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, regardless of age at
      diagnosis and family history. Information about the study as well as pre-test genetic
      counseling will primarily be given in a written way. In addition to that, if a study
      participant wishes to, she can also receive pre-test telephone genetic counseling.

      Study population:

      All patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer in southern Sweden are offered inclusion in
      the SCAN-B study at the time of diagnosis pre-surgery. If they consent to that, a part of the
      tumor is sent to a lab in Lund, Sweden, for research purposes (RNA sequencing etc.). Patients
      that are included in the SCAN-B study are eligible for inclusion in BRCAsearch, see inclusion
      and exclusion criteria.

      Study procedure (summary):

        1. An envelope with written information is given to the patient at the visit to the surgeon
           the week after surgery. This envelope contains a written genetic counseling, information
           about the study, an informed consent form, psychosocial questionnaires and our contact
           information (telephone, e-mail). The patient can contact a genetic counselor for
           pre-test telephone genetic counseling if she wishes to.

        2. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are analyzed by full sequencing.

        3. Non-carriers are informed about the test result with a letter. Mutation carriers and VUS
           (variants of uncertain significance) are telephoned and given a time for an appointment
           at the Department of Clinical Genetics within a week.

        4. Psychosocial self-reported questionnaires (HAD scale, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-BR23) are
           delivered at 3 times: At invitation to the study, one month after information about test
           result, and one year after information about test result.
