  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brazil ranks 17th among the 22 countries responsible for 80% of tuberculosis (TB) cases in
      the world. In 2010, the number of new cases of tuberculosis in Brazil was 71,930 and in 4972
      RS. In 2010, Brazil had a disease incidence of 37.6 / 100,000 in 2011 fell to 36.0 / 100,000.
      The Rio Grande do Sul(RS)S showed an incidence rate of 46.1 / 100,000 in 2011. The mortality
      rate was 2.4 / 100,000 population per year in Brazil and RS.

      In Porto Alegre, the incidence rate of all clinical forms of tuberculosis has remained, in
      the last six years, around 100/100.000 inhabitants per year, while the coefficient of
      pulmonary tuberculosis remained on average 50/100.000 inhabitants to year. Thus, Porto Alegre
      holds the 2nd place in Brazil among the capitals with the highest incidence of TB,
      classifying the city as high risk 5th. Porto Alegre also has a co-infection TB / HIV from
      35.3% one of the highest in the country.

      The best strategy to prevent new cases of tuberculosis is to invest in early diagnosis and
      effective treatment of existing cases of the disease. As the treatment of the disease
      requires daily use of medications for an extended period of time (at least 6 months),
      adherence becomes the main determinant of the rate of healing of disease.

      There are several factors that contribute to poor adherence and treatment dropout:
      alcoholism, illicit drug use, infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV Human
      Immunodeficiency Virus), low education, unemployment, poor housing and prolonged the
      treatment. The irregular treatment and neglect are the major obstacles to the control and
      elimination of this disease.

      Study in Porto Alegre pointed alcoholism, TB / HIV, the fact that the patient does not reside
      with family and low education as predictors of dropout. The dropout rate in the general
      population of patients with active tuberculosis was 10.7% (8.0% - 17.0%). Abandonment
      occurred more often within the first three meses8.

      In Porto Alegre, 32.5% of new TB cases are diagnosed in hospitals. Twenty percent of these
      patients do not bind, after discharge, the Tuberculosis Control Program (TCP), ie, the
      patient egress from the hospital does not reach the basic health unit (BHU) reference for
      further monitoring and treatment, which is considered a serious flaw in the process control
      of the disease.

    <description>Interview with the patient and their contacts, even during hospitalization, Delivering educational material about TB distribution free; Advise the patient about the BHU nearest their home, where it will follow the treatment of tuberculosis. Provide the address and telephone contact BHU this writing.
During the time of TB treatment, contact the patient to see if it is adhering to treatment and answer questions about the disease and treatment, The contact will be performed weekly for the first month, biweekly for the other months.
During the treatment period, contact BHU to monitor the progress of the case. Monitoring will be terminated: when the patient is discharged after cure of BHU or when the patient is absent for more than 30 days from the last scheduled visit.</description>
