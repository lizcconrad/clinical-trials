  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies as yet specifically investigating the application of DRG stimulation in
      the treatment of chronic pain affecting the upper limbs. The investigators propose to
      investigate the effect of dorsal root stimulation in patients with chrionic hand or upper
      limb pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) stimulation is a form of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS), which has
      been available and used for the treatment of chronic pain in Europe since late 2011. Clinical
      practice and pre/post market studies have shown that stimulation of the DRG can significantly
      reduce chronic intractable pain of various aetiologies. However, there are no studies as yet
      specifically investigating the application of DRG stimulation in the treatment of chronic
      pain affecting the upper limbs. Furthermore, there are very few studies of SCS generally, in
      an upper limb pain population, despite this being a group often referred for and treated with
      SCS in tertiary, interventional pain practices. Due to several limitations of traditional SCS
      systems, chiefly concerning the stability of stimulation induced paraesthesia, DRG
      stimulation is being increasingly utilised in its place for this condition.

    <description>All patients referred with pain in the hand and/or upper limb will be evaluated. Patients will first be assessed for suitability for neurostimulation implantation and then included in the study. Patients wiil fill in questionnaires (pain scores, Quality of Life and satisfaction) at baseline and post-operatively at regular intervals (as per standard of care in the Netherlands.)</description>
