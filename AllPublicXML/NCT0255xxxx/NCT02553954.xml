  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data show that the incidence of carcinoma, the most common cancer, is
      strongly linked to the age. Non Melanoma Skin Carcinomas (NMSCs) (the most frequent cancers
      in the elderly population) derive from keratinocytes of the basal layer of the epidermis,
      from differentiated keratinocytes of the more superficial layers or from stem cells of hair
      follicles. Unlike NMSCs, soft-tissue sarcomas, including those deriving from dermal
      fibroblasts, are very rare (less than 1% of all cancers). Our overall purpose is to decipher
      the molecular pathways activated during the aging of these tissues that may explain why they
      have a so different propensity to undergo a malignant transformation. Given that senescent
      cells accumulate in the dermis and epidermis with age, we will constitute two groups : &quot;young
      skin&quot; that we arbitrarily limit to the range ≥ 18 and ≤ 40 and &quot;aged skin&quot; ≥ 55.

      Thus the main objective of our study is to search within 2 age groups (≥ 18 and ≤ 40 years
      and ≥ 55 years) the expression of senescence markers on healthy skin tissue.
