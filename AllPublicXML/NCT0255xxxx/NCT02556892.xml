  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of Ibrutinib in Japanese participants
      with treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

      This is a Phase 1, open-label and multicenter study. The study consists of a Screening Phase
      (28 days prior to the first administration of the study drug), Treatment Phase (time when the
      first dose of ibrutinib is administered until disease progression, the investigator no longer
      considers the treatment to be tolerable, or the participant meets any one of the
      discontinuation criteria) and Follow-up Phase (end of the last dose of study drug until 30
      days after the last dose of study drug or the start of subsequent anti-CLL/SLL therapy,
      whichever comes first). Participants will be instructed to take 3 capsules of ibrutinib (at a
      dose of 420 mg) orally once daily starting at Cycle 1, Day 1. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Intensity of Adverse Events will be assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE).</description>
