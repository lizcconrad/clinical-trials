  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gambling problem is characterized by a loss of control and an excessive focus on the
      gambling practice. Currently, the treatment of pathological gamblers is often complex and
      multidimensional, it notably includes psychological techniques including cognitive behavioral
      therapy and the use of psychotropic drugs.

      In pathological gambling and addictions, craving (or urge to play) and loss of control are
      two essential clinical elements. The neurobiological level, they are associated with a
      dysfunction of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (Goldstein et al, 2001, Volkow and
      Goldstein, 2002).

      One therapeutic avenues explored in addictions is repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS).

      Patients included in this study will have:

        -  An anatomical brain MRI (30 minutes).

        -  Two 20 minute sessions of rTMS (placebo and active) of the left DLPFC, at the frequency
           of 10 Hz.

        -  Visual Analogue Scale measuring their desire to gamble before and after a gambling video
           and test measuring their gambling behavior during the last 7 days (PG-YBOCS).

        -  Cognitive tests, to be carried out on a computer before and immediately after rTMS
           sessions.

        -  Recording heart rate variability (HRV) to measure the autonomic nervous system (ANS)
           activity

      As it is a pilot study, the investigators don't have sufficient data to calculate statistical
      power and number of participants. The investigators based on previous studies evaluating one
      rTMS session on craving in SUD and used a crossover design to generate greater power.
