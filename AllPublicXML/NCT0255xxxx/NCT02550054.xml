      The main goal of this trial is to investigate whether early administration of human
      erythropoietin (EPO) in preterm infants improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months
      corrected age. This study is designed as randomized, double-masked, placebo controlled
      multicenter study involving at least 312 patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EPO has been safely used for prevent preterm anemia and recent studies have shown the
      neuro-protective effect. Our hypothesis is that EPO could prevent preterm brain injury and
      reduce the rate of premature death and disability from encephalopathy. The aims of this study
      include: to investigate the safety and efficacy of EPO by using 1000u/kg higher than the dose
      of anemia treatment (250u/kg); to evaluate the effect of EPO on neurodevelopment in preterm
      infants; to detect biological and imaging indicators of EPO. Eligible premature infants will
      be enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial from the neonatal
      neurological intensive care unit (NNICU) at 7 Children's Hospital in 6 provinces of China.
      Subjects will be enrolled within the first 24 hours of life and randomly assigned to receive
      Epo or saline vehicle placebo. Standard NICU care will be provided to all subjects.
      Pharmacokinetic data, serial brain electrophysiologic and imaging exams, circulating
      inflammatory mediators, biomarkers and complications like polycythemia, neutropenia,
      thrombocytopenia, hypertension, sepsis, hemorrhage, seizure, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
      persistent ductus arterious (PDA), apnea of prematurity, pulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary
      hypertension, Prolonged blood coagulation time, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), cardiac
      arrhythmia, major venous thrombosis, Renal failure treated with dialysis, pneumonia,
      pulmonary airleak and chronic lung disease will be collected at established time points
      during the study period. At 18 months corrected age, subjects will undergo a
      neurodevelopmental evaluation assessing for cerebral palsy, Bayley Scores of Mental
      Development Index (MDI) use.
