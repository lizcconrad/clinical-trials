  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory choroidal neovascularization (InCNV) is the third cause of CNV after myopia and
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). InCNV is a rare but severe disease and its treatment
      should not be delayed.

      InCNV is treated at the moment with off-label anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)
      therapy and could also benefit from aflibercept (EYLEA), a new anti-VEGF currently indicated
      in AMD. Case reports suggest that such patients would not need as many injections as in AMD.

      ALINEA is an open-label, single arm, prospective, multicenter, phase II study. The main
      objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness in clinical terms after 52 weeks of treatment
      with aflibercept on the visual acuity of patients affected by InCNV. A specific dosage
      regimen is designed to achieve maximum efficiency. The patients are followed on a monthly
      basis until 52 weeks. The first injection is mandatory. The other ones are injected only in
      case of active InCNV.
