    <textblock>
      OBJECTIVES:

      To evaluate the effect and cost-utility of a combination therapy of SPT+MAD compared with
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with moderate positional obstructive
      sleep apnea (POSA).

      HYPOTHESIS:

      The SPT+MAD combination is more cost-effective and effective, in means of reduction of the
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), quality of life and compliance, compared with CPAP.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      A multicenter randomized clinical trial (RCT) will be performed with a follow-up of 12 months
      per patient. Patients will be randomized for CPAP or the combination SPT and MRA. All
      outcomes will be measured at baseline, month 3, 6 and 12.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Patients diagnosed with moderate POSA according to polysomnography (PSG) results.

      INTERVENTION / STANDARD INTERVENTION TO BE COMPARED TO:

      The SPT trains POSA patients to sleep in non-supine positions, CPAP uses positive airway
      pressure to open the airway; MRA is an intra-oral prosthesis, which holds the mandible in a
      protrusive position, all to prevent effectively apneic events.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      AHI, compliance, quality-adjusted life year (QALY), direct and indirect costs, cardiovascular
      parameters, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)

      SAMPLE SIZE / DATA ANALYSIS:

      100 subjects in each treatment group, total of 200 patients.

      COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS / BUDGET IMPACT ANALYSIS:

      The SPT is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of overall treatment of POSA patients,
      and will save annually approximately 35-150 million euros.

    <description>Sleep Position Trainer + Mandibular Advancement device combination The SPT is a sensor that measures the sleeping position, and gives the user feedback about wrong positions with a soft vibration. A user is then able to react to the signal and turn into a non-supine position. To stimulate compliance, information is provided about nightly behaviour, implicating a learning pattern by viewing the data on a home computer.
MRA or oral appliances (OA) works by advancing the mandible and its attached soft tissue structures forward they aim to increase upper airway size.</description>
