    <textblock>
      The Behaviour Change Institute (BCI) was created in 2008 within Capital Health to provide
      healthcare providers with evidence-based skills in helping patients change. In addition, the
      BCI has also become a resource within the organization to assist with other needed changes,
      such as helping healthcare providers use new or different procedures to provide better
      patient care. Through our work at the BCI we have identified the need to help healthcare
      providers to better cope with change. The purpose of this project is to implement and to
      evaluate an evidence-based professional resiliency training program for staff to help them
      better cope with change. This professional resiliency training program is based on an
      empirically supported form of therapy called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The training
      takes the form of a hands-on, applied workshop designed to increase resiliency and
      flexibility in a workplace setting.

      The Behaviour Change Institute (BCI) was created in 2008 within Capital Health to provide
      healthcare providers with behaviour change counselling skills. These skills are backed by
      evidence-based theory and competency training methods and are designed to be used by
      healthcare providers to help their patients change their behaviours. Acquiring these skills
      involves change for the healthcare provider. Through our work at the BCI we have come to
      identify the need to help healthcare providers effectively manage their emotions in such
      situations in order to learn behavior change counselling skills and to continue to use them
      effectively over time. The ability to effectively manage emotions, including discomfort and
      distress, may differentiate between individuals who are able to successfully adopt and
      maintain new behaviours over time from those who do not (Brown, Lejuez, Kahler, Strong, &amp;
      Zvolensky, 2005). That is, we have identified that there is a significant need to support
      healthcare providers to more effectively manage emotions in order to help them change.

      The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for the Workplace program (ACT-W) is an evidence-based
      program designed to help individuals manage emotions and stress by learning skills to accept
      negative feelings, thoughts, and sensations and to move toward valued behaviours (Flaxman,
      Bond, Livheim, Hayes, 2013). The ACT-W program has been shown to increase the ability to
      manage emotions and stress (Flaxman &amp; Bond, 2010) and to increase the ability to learn new
      behaviours (Bond &amp; Flaxman, 2006; Luoma et al., 2007; Varra, Hayes et al., 2008).

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the implementation of the ACT-W training program
      for healthcare providers through the BCI.
