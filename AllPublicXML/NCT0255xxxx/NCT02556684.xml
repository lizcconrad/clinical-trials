      A prospective cohort study design will be conducted. Patients with LABC who receive
      chemotherapy will undergo physical examination, ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI at baseline,
      midway, and at the completion of chemotherapy. Approximately 100 patients will be recruited
      over a 2-year period. This study will give clinicians further insight into the usefulness of
      ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI in monitoring treatment responses in patients with LABC. This could
      potentially lead to changes in clinical management of these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is usually treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      followed by surgery. At present, monitoring of tumor responses to chemotherapy is primarily
      carried out using physical examination at the beginning of each chemotherapy cycle.
      Differentiating viable tumor tissue from inflammation or fibrotic scar tissue can be
      difficult. There is a growing body of evidence that newer imaging techniques such as positron
      emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be better at determining
      whether or not the tumor is actually shrinking, but their sensitivity and specificity were
      not ideal. Breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) using 99mTcsestamibi is a relatively new
      nuclear medicine imaging technique for breast tumor detection. BSGI shows higher sensitivity
      than conventional scintimammography in the detection of small breast cancer lesions owing to
      its high resolution. BSGI is a useful complementary tool to ultrasound, mammography and MRI
      in breast cancer diagnosis, especially in dense breasts and multifocal or multicentric
      disease; however, little is known about the ability of BSGI to predict of clinical and
      pathological response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast
      cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of BSGI in
      evaluating tumor responses to chemotherapy in patients with LABC and compare this with
      physical examination, ultrasound, mammography and MRI, which is the current conventional
      standard of care. A prospective cohort study design will be conducted. Patients with LABC who
      receive chemotherapy will undergo physical examination, ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI at
      baseline, midway, and at the completion of chemotherapy. Approximately 100 patients will be
      recruited over a 2-year period. This study will give clinicians further insight into the
      usefulness of ultrasound, MRI, and BSGI in monitoring treatment responses in patients with
      LABC. This could potentially lead to changes in clinical management of these patients.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  18 Years and older, and histologic proof of breast cancer (invasive ductal or lobular
             carcinoma-not breast sarcoma or lymphoma)

          -  Patients having a clinical diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer (T3 or T4, or
             N2 according to TNM classification) including inflammatory breast cancer.

          -  Patients must be able to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 sufficient
             to undergo chemotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Previously treated cancer other than non melanotic skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix, unless disease-free for 5 years or greater.

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease (found on chest X-ray, liver ultrasound or bone scan).

          -  Previous chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for breast cancer.

          -  Active infection or other significant illnesses which could hamper their ability to
             tolerate chemotherapy

          -  Significant concurrent medical problems (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes, active cardiac
             disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) making the patient unfit for
             surgery.

          -  Any condition that could interfere with their ability to provide informed consent such
             as dementia or severe cognitive impairment.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  Inadequate hematologic, renal and liver function as measured by CBC (WBC&lt;4.0 x 109,
             Hb&lt;100 g/L, plt count&lt;100 x 109), and abnormal hepatic transaminases (AST, ALT, GGT,
             alkaline phosphatase&gt;2x normal), elevated total bilirubin, and elevated serum
             creatinine (Cr&gt;110 micromol/L).

          -  Any contraindication to undergoing MRI or BSGI.
