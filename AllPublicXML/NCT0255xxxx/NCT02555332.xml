    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to analyze the role of TSH level and TPOAb status in early pregnancy
      and use this information in assessment of the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus at
      different weeks of gestation when the FT4 level is normal.

      A total of 7,729 women with singleton pregnancies who were receiving antenatal care at
      Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine between
      December 2012 and March 2014 were included in the study. All these women underwent screening
      for thyroid function (TSH,FT4 and TPOAb) at the first antenatal visit and a 75 g oral glucose
      tolerance test at 24-28 weeks of gestation. The correlation between a combination of TSH
      level and TPOAb status and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus was analyzed.
