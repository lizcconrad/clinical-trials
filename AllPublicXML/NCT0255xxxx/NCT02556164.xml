  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait and balance disorders, key contributors to fall and poor quality of life, represent a
      major therapeutic challenge in Parkinson's disease (PD). Despite the widespread use of
      acupuncture in recent years in PD, its efficacy remains unclear, largely due to
      methodological flaws and lack of high quality studies using objective outcome measures. In a
      patient and assessor-blind pilot study, investigators objectively assess the efficacy of
      electroacupuncture (EA) for gait and balance disorders using body-worn sensor technology in
      patients with PD.

      In this study, investigators employee objective innovative body-worn sensor technologies to
      assess potential mobility-associated outcomes of PD. Investigators compare acute changes in
      gait and balance that occurred after repeated administration of two interventions: A specific
      real EA and a sham EA. The design of the experiments uses a control that accounts for both
      placebo and possible some active components of a generalized needle-insertion-based
      procedure. By using a sham control, the investigators were able to more fully test whether
      the specific EA intervention could lead to changes in objective gait and balance parameters,
      or subjective self-reported improvements that are beyond placebo induced effects and the
      natural course of the disease.

    <description>Acupuncture is an alternative medicine methodology that treats patient by various techniques including inserting small, thin needles at specific points of body. Electroacupuncture (EA), like the name implies, combines classical acupuncture and low electric current running through the needles, which are often used to enhance a treatment.</description>
