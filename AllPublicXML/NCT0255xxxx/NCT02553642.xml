    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have signed and dated an IRB approved written informed consent in
             accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before
             the performance of any protocol related procedures that are not part of normal subject
             care.

          2. Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule,
             laboratory tests, tumor biopsies, and other requirements of the study.

          3. Pathologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic disease per the treating
             institution's standard of care of the following tumor types

             Subjects with histologically confirmed locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic
             melanoma who meet all of the following criteria:

             i. Subjects have received any number of prior lines of therapy or may be treatment
             naïve ii. If the subject has been treated with a prior line of therapy, they must have
             had disease progression or be refractory to treatment

             OR

             b. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally
             advanced/unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (including mixed histologies
             of urothelial carcinoma with elements of other subtypes) of the renal pelvis, ureter,
             bladder or urethra (referred to broadly in this protocol as &quot;bladder cancer&quot;) who meet
             the following criteria: i. Subjects must have disease progression or refractory
             disease after their prior line of therapy. Subjects must have had at least 1 platinum
             based chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced
             unresectable disease. Subjects may have received any number of prior lines of therapy
             OR

             ii. Subjects with disease recurrence within 1 year of a platinum based neoadjuvant or
             adjuvant therapy for bladder cancer.

             OR

             iii. The subject actively refuses chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic or
             locally advanced disease considered as standard treatment for this disease stage (i.e.
             a patient who has relapsed &gt;1 year after treatment with neoadjuvant or adjuvant
             chemotherapy), despite being informed by the investigator about the treatment options.
             The subject's refusal must be documented.

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease by CT scans or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria.
             Radiographic tumor assessment must be performed within 28 days prior to first dose of
             study drug.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

          6. Age ≥ 18 years.

          7. Subjects must consent to allow for the acquisition of tumor sample prior to starting
             treatment on study (in most cases patients will require a tumor biopsy). This biopsy
             site may be the only site of measurable disease if the site is &gt; 2 cm. The biopsy site
             must, in the opinion of the investigator, be likely to yield acceptable tumor sample
             for core biopsies as described in Appendix 4. It is also acceptable if tumor sample is
             obtained by excision biopsy or during surgery (i.e. if procedure was previously
             planned), provided the tumor sample can be processed as described in Appendix 4. In
             the case that a patient had a tumor sample acquired prior to consenting to the study
             and this tumor sample is acceptable for processing as described in Appendix 4 (i.e.
             frozen sample stored) and the tumor sample was acquired within 60 days of starting
             treatment, this is acceptable and a new biopsy will not be required.

          8. Willingness to adhere to the study visit schedule and prohibitions as specified in
             this protocol.

          9. Expected survival of at least 4 months.

         10. At the time of day 1 of the study, patients must have completed chemotherapy, targeted
             therapy, investigational therapy, other immunotherapy, radiation therapy or major
             surgery (requiring general anesthesia) at least 28 days before administration of the
             first dose of nivolumab. Patients undergoing minor surgical procedures and biopsies
             that do not require general anesthesia may begin receiving study therapy if
             sufficiently recovered as determined by the treating investigator. Patients may have
             received prior focal radiotherapy for palliation of an isolated site of disease, which
             must be completed at least 14 days prior to day 1 of the study.

             Palliative (limited-field) radiation therapy is permitted during treatment with study
             drug (s), if all of the following criteria are met:

               1. The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion

               2. Radiation treatment is administered 12 weeks or greater after their first dose of
                  study drug.

         11. All baseline laboratory requirements will be assessed and should be obtained within 14
             days of the first dose of study drug. Screening laboratory values must meet the
             following criteria:

        White blood cells (WBCs) ≥ 2000/μL

        Neutrophils ≥ 1000/μL

        Platelets ≥ 100 x 103/μL

        Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

        Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN (or glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40mL/min)

        Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome who must have total
        bilirubin ≤ 3.0mg/dL)

        AST and ALT ≤ 3 x ULN

        Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with treated brain
             metastases are eligible if they meet all of the following criteria:

               1. Must be at least 28 days since craniotomy and resection, stereotactic
                  radiosurgery, or whole brain radiotherapy.

               2. Must have no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks after treatment is
                  complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration.

               3. Must have no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids
                  (&gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug
                  administration.

          2. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug
             administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy or
             interfere with the interpretation of study results.

          3. Other prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years except for local or organ
             confined early stage cancer that has been definitively treated with curative intent or
             does not require treatment, does not require ongoing treatment, has no evidence of
             active disease and has a negligible risk of recurrence and is therefore unlikely to
             interfere with the endpoints of the study.

          4. Subjects with active autoimmune disease, symptoms or conditions. Subjects with
             vitiligo, type I diabetes, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis only

             (e.g.: +ANA, +RF, antithyroglobulin antibodies), or conditions not expected to recur
             in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          5. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14
             days of first dose of study drug. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement
             steroid doses are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          6. Subjects who have received prior therapy with any T cell co-stimulation or checkpoint
             pathways such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4, anti-CD137; or other
             medicines specifically targeting T cells are prohibited. Prior therapy with BCG is
             permitted. Prior IL-2 is permitted.

          7. All toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy other than alopecia and fatigue
             must have resolved to grade 1 (CTCAE version 4) or baseline before administration of
             study drug. Subjects with toxicities attributed to prior anti-cancer therapy and which
             are not expected to resolve and result in long lasting sequelae such as neuropathy
             after platinum-based therapy, are permitted to enroll.

          8. Positive test for hepatitis B virus (HBV) using HBV surface antigen (HBV sAg) test or
             positive test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) using HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) or HCV

             ovulatory cycle).

             *WOCBP are defined as those who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Post-menopausal is defined as:
