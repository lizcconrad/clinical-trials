    <measure>Change from baseline in glycemic control</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The glycemic control will be quantified using blood samples. Fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and C-reactive protein will be measured with standard procedures at the clinical laboratory (N health Lab, Samitivej, Sriracha, Thailand). Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR will be calculated by using equation of [Fasting glucose (mg/dL) × Insulin level (uU/mL) / 405].</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in vascular reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vascular reactivity or brachial and popliteal artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) will be assessed with the ultrasound equipment (CX50, Philips, USA), using the blood occlusion technique on the right forearm and lower leg. The brachial artery and the popliteal artery will be imaged above the antecubital fossa in the longitudinal plane and proximal slightly above the popliteal fossa. Brachial FMD will be measured at baseline and the cuff placed around the right forearm will be inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure for 5 minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes of recovery. While popliteal FMD will be measured at baseline and the cuff will be positioned on the lower right leg below the knee will be inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then deflated for 5 minutes of recovery. FMD will be calculated from the formula FMD= (D2-D1)x100/D1 when D1 is the brachial or popliteal artery diameter at baseline, D2 is the maximal post-occlusion brachial or popliteal artery diameter.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in cutaneous blood flow</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cutaneous blood flow will be determined by laser Doppler Flowmetry (DRT4, Moore Instrument, UK). Laser Doppler Flowmetry probes will be attached to the dorsum of middle fingertip and the dorsum of the foot. The occlusion cuffs will be placed around left middle upper arm and calf were inflated to a pressure of 50 mmHg above the systolic pressure and will be remained inflated for 3 minutes, after which it will be rapidly released, producing a brief high-flow state resulting in artery dilation due to increase shear stress. The peak Laser Doppler Flux (peak LDF) and after 5 min occlusion period will be recorded.</description>

Initial work load was 50 watt and increased stepwise by 25 W every 2 minutes (as measured using respiratory gas analyzer: Metamax 3B, Germany) until the subjects were no longer able to continue exercising.</description>

    <description>Warm water based cycling exercise training program will be based on cycling in warm water (temperature 34◦C ). Warm water exercise will be conducted at moderate intensity (60-70% maximum heart rate). The three groups were exercise 15 minutes on the first month, second month will be increased to 20 minutes and the last month will be increased to 30 minutes. The training program will be performed 3 times per week for 12 weeks.</description>
