  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is an association between stroke or
      heart attack and reactivation of varicella zoster virus, measured by antibody levels, using
      linked data from the Health Survey for England and secondary care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a case control design to investigate whether adult participants in the
      Health Survey for England between 2009 and 2013 who were admitted to hospital with either a
      stroke or heart attack had higher preceding levels of varicella zoster virus antibodies
      measured in stored serum samples compared to matched controls with no history of heart attack
      or stroke, controlling for a range of potential demographic, lifestyle and clinical
      confounders.

      This study is funded by the University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre
      Fast Track grant scheme and has received ethics approval (ref 15/NW/0456).

        The study population will be drawn from adults who have already participated in the Health
        Survey for England between 2009 and 2013 and who have a stored serum sample available for
        analysis. No new participants will be recruited.
