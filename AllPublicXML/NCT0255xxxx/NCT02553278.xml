      Prospective, 2-arm, clinical study for the evaluation of the VelaShape device and Contour I
      V3 device for non-invasive fat reduction vs. control.

      All study subjects, who are scheduled for abdominoplasty, will undergo one treatment with
      VelaShape or Contour I V3 device.

      Each arm will be treated with a different device:

      Arm 1: subject will treated with VelaShape device Arm 2: subject will treated with Contour I
      V3 device

  <detailed_description>

      Eligible subjects will undergo one treatment on one abdominal subarea. Another abdominal
      subarea will remain without treatment and will serve as a control. Biopsies from treated and
      untreated areas will be harvested during abdominoplasty and cultured.. Treatment with
      VelaShape will be performed to arm 1, and treatment with Contour I V3 will be performed to
      arm 2, according to the study protocol.

      Each arm will be divided into 6 sub-groups, according to the following time interval between
      VelaShape or UltraShape treatment to surgery:

      Sub-group 1: Surgery immediately after treatment Sub-group 2: Surgery 10 days after treatment
      Sub-group 3: Surgery 20 days after treatment Sub-group 4: Surgery 30 days after treatment
      Sub-group 5: Surgery 60 days after treatment Sub-group 6: Surgery 90 days after treatment
      Each Sub-group contains up to 2 subjects.
