      Aim is to test the effect of ACCESS (&quot;Adaptive Computerized COPD Exacerbation Self-management
      Support&quot;), a software application designed to support patients with COPD in self-management
      of exacerbations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: COPD exacerbations considerably affect patients' health status and contribute to
      COPD related costs. Patients often have problems in recognizing and responding promptly to
      exacerbations. Tools that support patients in exacerbation self-management such as paper
      exacerbation action plans and telemonitoring systems have shown some positive results on
      exacerbation related outcomes. However, many patients appear not to adhere to their action
      plan instructions. Besides, existing telemonitoring tools rely heavily on the input of
      healthcare professionals which makes it difficult to assess the true effects and cost
      effectiveness of telemonitoring systems.

      Recently, the Radboud University has developed the &quot;Adaptive Computerized COPD Exacerbation
      Self-management Support&quot; (ACCESS) system. This software application integrates objective
      parameters, such as spirometry, pulse-oximetry, temperature, and self-reported symptom
      worsening into a Bayesian network model resulting in a weighted exacerbation risk prediction.
      Patients are able to monitor themselves at any given moment. The ACCESS system not only
      predicts whether an exacerbation is imminent, but also provides ad hoc tailored advice
      without interference of a healthcare professional.

      Objective: In this project the primary aim is to assess the (cost-)effectiveness of the
      ACCESS system in the support of exacerbation self-management in patients with COPD.

      Study design: A multicenter, pragmatic, two-arm, randomized controlled trial with a follow-up
      of 12 months per participant.

      Study population: Patients with COPD, &gt; 40 years old, with 2 or more self-reported symptom
      based exacerbations in the previous year.

      Intervention: After a short self-management educational session on exacerbations,
      participants are randomized to either 1) exacerbation self-management support through the use
      of a paper exacerbation action plan (control group); or 2) exacerbation self-management
      support through the use of the ACCESS system (intervention group).

      Participants in the intervention group are instructed to use ACCESS when they notice a change
      in COPD symptoms. Participants in the control group are instructed to use their paper action
      plan when they notice a change in COPD symptoms.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary aim: to increase the number of exacerbation-free weeks. Secondary aims: to improve
      exacerbation self-management, exacerbation-management related self-efficacy, and quality of
      life. To decrease ER visits, hospital admissions and COPD related costs.

    <description>The ACCESS system consists of a smartphone, a pulse-oximeter, a spirometer and a forehead thermometer. Questions concerning changes in symptoms, physical limitations and emotions are answered by touch screen on the smartphone, complemented by measurements of the pulse-oximeter, spirometer and thermometer. Based on this information, the system calculates the current risk of an exacerbation and, when applicable, the participant will receive personalized instructions about which actions to take in order to manage the exacerbation. Participants are instructed to use ACCESS in case of symptom worsening.</description>
