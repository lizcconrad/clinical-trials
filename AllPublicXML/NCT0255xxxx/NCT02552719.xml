      Purpose of the study is the validation of the German version of the Injustice Experience
      Questionnaire.

      Pretest: Participants were informed about the aims of the study and fill in a consent form.
      They filled in a paper version of the German translation of the Injustice Experience
      Questionnaire. In a structured interview patients were asked if there were any items
      difficult to understand, unacceptable or offending them. Subsequently they had to answer
      questions about the content and meaning of the IEQ-items.

      Validation Study: Participants were informed about the aims of the study and filled in a
      consent form. By e-mail they received an access link to the online survey. The questionnaires
      of the survey could be filled in at home. The survey could be interrupted and terminated
      later. About 20 minutes were needed to answer the 80 questions of the survey. All data was
      saved anonymously during the survey.

      Pretest: Participants were informed about the aims of the study and filled in a consent form.
      A paper version of the German translation of the Injustice Experience Questionnaire was
      completed in presence of the interviewer. The structure of the standardized interview
      followed the recommendations for pretesting transcultural translations of questionnaires.
      Patients were asked if there were any items difficult to understand, unacceptable or
      offending them. Subsequently they had to answer questions about the content and meaning of
      the IEQ-items. The interviewer asked all questions and entered the responses. All data were
      directly stored in a MySQL database at a Swiss commercial web-server
      (www.scientific-affairs.ch).

      Validation Study: Participants are informed about the aims of the study and fill in a consent
      sheet. By e-mail they receive an access link to the online survey which can be completed at
      home. The survey includes the following questionnaires: Injustice Experience Questionnaire
      (IEQ), Depression subscale of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), Tampa Scale
      for Kinesiophobia (TSK), McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),
      Pain Disability Index (PDI) and part concerning causes of pain of the German Pain
      Questionnaire (DSF). About 20 minutes is needed to answer the 80 questions of the survey.
      After completing the survey participant can choose if they would like to be informed about
      the results of the filled in questionnaires. All data is saved anonymously during the survey
      and stored in a MySQL database at a Swiss commercial web-server (www.scientific-affairs.ch).
