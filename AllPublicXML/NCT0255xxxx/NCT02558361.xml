    <textblock>
      Apremilast (Otezla®) is a Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for psoriatic
      arthritis and psoriasis. Although there are a lot of data demonstrating how apremilast works
      in the laboratory, there are very few demonstrating how it works in the actual target organ,
      i.e. the skin or synovial (joint) tissue in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

      Laboratory data has demonstrated that apremilast decreases inflammatory proteins and
      increases anti-inflammatory proteins. However, almost all of these data/studies have been
      performed on the blood of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, not the skin or
      synovial (joint) tissue. These studies that have been performed on the blood of patients with
      this condition may, or may not, reflect the true response to therapy in the synovial (joint)
      tissue and/or skin.

      Purpose of the study Apremilast (Otezla®) is a Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
      treatment for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. Although there are a lot of data
      demonstrating how apremilast works in the laboratory, there are very few demonstrating how it
      works in the actual target organ, i.e. the skin or synovial (joint) tissue in patients with
      psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.

      Laboratory data has demonstrated that apremilast decreases inflammatory proteins and
      increases anti-inflammatory proteins. However, almost all of these data/studies have been
      performed on the blood of patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, not the skin or
      synovial (joint) tissue. These studies that have been performed on the blood of patients with
      this condition may, or may not, reflect the true response to therapy in the synovial (joint)
      tissue and/or skin. They also provide no data regarding the timing of response in the target
      organs.

      Because of these limitations in the existing literature, a study assessing the response to
      apremilast in synovial (joint) tissue and skin is needed. This will be a small study
      assessing the inflammatory response in the synovial (joint) tissue and skin samples from
      patients with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis. These data will be very important in
      demonstrating the effect of apremilast on the target organ tissues; i.e. synovial (joint)
      tissue and skin.

      We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have both psoriasis and
      psoriatic arthritis. Both conditions are active and you are an appropriate candidate to be
      treated with apremilast, i.e. this same treatment would be offered to you if you were not to
      enroll in this study. You are also an appropriate candidate to receive skin and synovial
      (joint) tissue biopsies. We want to find out how specific proteins in your skin and synovial
      (joint) tissue that are responsible for the inflammation associated with psoriasis and
      psoriatic arthritis respond to treatment with apremilast.

      Study Procedures: What will happen during this study?

      This study will consist of three study visits over a period of three months. If appropriate,
      you will be started on apremilast at your first study visit. This is part of your standard of
      care. The dose of apremilast you will receive will be the normal FDA-approved dose. You will
      not receive a placebo (sugar) pill. Everyone who participates in the study will be treated
      with apremilast. The study procedures that will take place at each of the three visits are
      listed below:

      Baseline Visit:

      Review inclusion/exclusion criteria Medical history obtained by the study nurse A physical
      examination by the study doctor Obtain blood and urine samples with psoriatic arthritis and
      psoriasis. These data will be very important in demonstrating the effect of apremilast on the
      target organ tissues; i.e. synovial (joint) tissue and skin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Must be in general good health (except for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis) as
             judged by the Investigator, based on medical history, physical examination, clinical
             laboratories, and urinalysis. (NOTE: The definition of good health means a subject
             does not have uncontrolled significant co-morbid conditions).

          2. Patients at least 18 years of age with PsA (must meet CASPAR Criteria) and PsO.

          3. Active knee synovitis (target joint)

          4. Active psoriatic plaque (target skin lesion)

          5. Not currently taking or previously on Otezla

          6. Cannot be on concurrent biologics

          7. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative pregnancy test at
             Baseline. While on investigational product and for at least 28 days after taking the
             last dose of investigational product, FCBP who engage in activity in which conception
             is possible must use one of the approved contraceptive§ options described below:

        Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception (oral,
        injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device (IUD); tubal
        ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom (latex condom or
        nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]; PLUS
        one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with spermicide; (b) cervical cap with
        spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with spermicide.

        Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in which
        conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or nonlatex condom
        NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while on
        investigational product and for at least 28 days after the last dose of investigational
        product.

        † A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone a
        hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical
        removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive
        months (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive months).

        § The female subject's chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time the
        female subject is randomized into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should be
        initiated at least 28 days before randomization).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

               1. Other than psoriatic arthritis, any clinically significant (as determined by the
                  Investigator) cardiac, endocrinologic, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric,
                  hepatic, renal, hematologic, immunologic disease, or other major disease that is
                  currently uncontrolled.

               2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which would
                  place the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the
                  study.

               3. Prior history of suicide attempt at any time in the subject's life time prior to
                  screening or randomization, or major psychiatric illness requiring
                  hospitalization within the last 3 years.

               4. Pregnant or breast feeding.

               5. Active substance abuse or a history of substance abuse within 6 months prior to
                  Screening.

               6. Malignancy or history of malignancy, except for:

                  treated [ie, cured] basal cell or squamous cell in situ skin carcinomas; treated
                  [ie, cured] cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or carcinoma in situ of
                  cervix with no evidence of recurrence within the previous 5 years.

               7. Use of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or 5
                  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic half lives, if known (whichever is longer).

               8. Prior treatment with apremilast.

               9. Currently treated with a biologic (TNFi)

              10. Standard exclusions for treatment or biopsy
