    <textblock>
      The ASPIRE study is a clinical trial designed to examine the microbes (e.g., bacteria) within
      psoriasis skin lesions compared with normal skin. The investigators will also examine the
      effect of NB-UVB (narrow-band ultraviolet B) phototherapy (i.e., light therapy) on skin
      microbes.

    <description>NB-UVB phototherapy is a therapy which uses ultraviolet B (UVB) light directed at the skin. This type of light therapy is given through the use of phototherapy booths which contain fluorescent tubes that emit UVB light. Booths used for phototherapy look similar to commercial tanning booths. NB-UVB phototherapy affects psoriasis by causing changes to the cells of the skin and producing a local effect by reducing the number of certain types of skin cells which have an impact on psoriasis formation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females 18 years of age and older.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of psoriasis for at least 6 months as determined by subject
             interview of his/her medical history and confirmation of diagnosis through physical
             examination by Investigator.

          3. Stable plaque psoriasis for at least 2 months before Screening and at Baseline (Week
             1) as determined by subject interview of his/her medical history.

          4. Subject is a candidate for phototherapy.

          5. Subject has at least one psoriatic plaque measuring at least 6cm x 2cm located on
             either the arms or the legs (excluding intertriginous areas such as the axilla and
             inguinal folds)

          6. Able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with requirements of
             this study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has photosensitizing condition or other contraindication to phototherapy

          2. Diagnosis of erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized or localized pustular psoriasis,
             medication-induced or medication-exacerbated psoriasis, or new onset guttate
             psoriasis.

          3. Cannot discontinue or avoid topical therapies for psoriasis for at least 14 days prior
             to the Baseline (Week 1) visit and during the study other than on face, underarms, or
             groin.

          4. Cannot discontinue or avoid UVB phototherapy or Excimer laser for at least 14 days
             prior to the Baseline (Week 1) visit.

          5. Subject is receiving therapy for psoriasis that requires a wash out period of more
             than 14 days (e.g., psoralen-UVA phototherapy, oral systemic therapy, biologic
             therapy, or other investigational therapy).

          6. Other active inflammatory dermatologic conditions (e.g., eczema) or presence of
             pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis.

          7. Any history of acute or chronic bacterial, fungal, or viral infection (including HIV,
             hepatitis, tuberculosis, or other severe or recurrent infections) within 30 days of
             baseline sample collection.

          8. Subject has used systemic (oral or parenteral) antibiotic, antimycotic, or antiviral
             within 3 months or topical antibiotic, antimycotic, or antiviral within 14 days of
             baseline sample collection or requires use of any topical or systemic antibiotic,
             antimycotic, or antiviral during the study.

             beverages/milks, yogurts, and foods do not apply.

         10. Presence of comorbid medical condition (e.g., HIV, malignancy within past 5 years
             other than successfully treated basal cell carcinoma, non-metastatic cutaneous
             squamous cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in-situ) that significantly alters the
             immune system or results in immunosuppression.

         11. Subject is taking (within up to 180 days of baseline sample collection) or requires
             topical or systemic therapy during the study that significantly alters the immune
             system or results in immunosuppression (e.g., chemotherapy, oral or injectable
             corticosteroid). Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical conditions are allowed.

         12. Unstable dietary history as defined by major changes in diet within 30 days of
             baseline or during study, where the subject has or plans to eliminate or significantly
             increase major food group in the diet.

         13. Recent history of substance abuse or psychiatric illness that could preclude
             compliance with the protocol.

         14. History of any substance abuse within 365 days of screening visit.

         15. Female subject who is pregnant or breast-feeding or considering becoming pregnant
             during the study.

         16. Major surgery of the gastrointestinal tract, with the exception of cholecystectomy and
             appendectomy, in the past 5 years. Any major bowel resection at any time.

         17. History of active uncontrolled gastrointestinal disorders or diseases including:

               -  Inflammatory bowel disease including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or
                  indeterminate colitis;

               -  Irritable bowel syndrome;

               -  Persistent, infectious gastroenteritis, colitis, or gastritis, persistent or
                  chronic diarrhea or unknown etiology, Clostridium difficile infection (recurrent)
