  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine if patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) taking
      nintedanib will have improved exercise endurance, breathlessness and quality of life if
      breathing 60% oxygen compared to standard of care during an 8 week exercise training program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation is a structured evidence-based exercise and education intervention
      that is recommended for most patients with IPF. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves functional
      capacity (6-minute walk distance [6MWD]), breathlessness and quality of life in patients,
      however these benefits are often modest and only temporary. Nintedanib is an antifibrotic
      medication that has been shown to slow the decline of lung function. Use of antifibrotic
      medications in the pulmonary rehabilitation setting may therefore allow prolonged benefit of
      exercise training by preventing IPF progression and the resulting worsening symptoms and
      functional decline. Unpublished data suggest that breathing 60% oxygen in a pulmonary
      rehabilitation setting could enable patients to train at higher exercise intensities and thus
      derive greater physiological adaptations and clinical benefits compared with traditional
      pulmonary rehabilitation.

      This is a randomized, blinded study with two arms (standard of care or 60% oxygen). The
      decision to start or stop treatment with nintedanib will be made by the participants treating
      physician based on clinical findings. If the treating physician decides to discontinue
      nintedanib, the participant will be allowed to continue in the study.

      The exercise training program is 8 weeks long, with visits 3 times a week. In addition to the
      exercise training there are 13 visits occurring before, during and after the 8 week exercise
      training program. At study visits, participants will be required to conduct a 6 minute walk
      test and complete a quality of life questionnaire. Select study visits will also require lung
      function tests and exercise tests to be conducted.
