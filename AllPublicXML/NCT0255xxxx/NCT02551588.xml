  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is the most frequent valvular disease. The severity of the
      obstruction of the left ventricle (LV) is essentially analyzed today by echocardiography
      Doppler, which assesses two key markers that are aortic valve pressure gradient and the
      aortic valve area. however these marker are a poor reflect of the clinical severity of AVS.
      The aim of the study is to validate new markers assessing cardiac fibrosis that might best or
      complementary markers.

    <textblock>
      To validate new markers assessing cardiac fibrosis three groups of subjects were studied in
      controls subjects and patients with AVS in order to :

        1. Analyze myocardial fibrosis markers in MRI, the degree of hypertrophy, remodeling and
           wall shear stress in a control population and in three groups of subjects to RA
           progressively increasing risk: asymptomatic subjects without symptomatic subjects LV
           dysfunction, symptomatic patients with LV dysfunction. The factors favoring the
           appearance of fibrosis observed in MRI will be analyzed on all subjects.

        2. To validate these fibrosis markers estimated by MRI by histological analysis of biopsies
           performed in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.

        3. Monitoring compliance with the distribution of markers of fibrosis and wall stress
           estimated on Initial MRI are factors of aggravation or not improved function and / or
           remodeling remote myocardial. Public hospitals in Paris
