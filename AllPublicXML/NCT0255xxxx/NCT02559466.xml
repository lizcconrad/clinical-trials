  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an emergent non-invasive treatment for
      treatment resistant depression (TRD). The exact neuro-functional mechanisms related to TMS
      efficiency remains however unknown; besides local effect on the target, TMS may induce
      interaction changes between remote cerebral regions. On the other hand, few studies have been
      performed in comparison to sham placebo stimulation. The investigators recently showed that
      non-responder depressive patients to TMS exhibited deeper and wider brain functional
      abnormalities hardly reachable by standard coils. The H1-Coil is a novel TMS (H-TMS) device
      capable of inducing a magnetic field with a deeper and wider distribution than standard
      coils.

      The investigators design here a randomized controlled study in which the investigators will
      compare the clinical effects of H-coil TMS and standard TMS in patients with TRD, and their
      functional neuroanatomical correlates and changes in connectivity by Positron Emission
      Tomography (PET). The general objective is to better understand the mechanisms related to TMS
      efficiency in pharmacoresistant depression, in order to propose the best therapeutic approach
      for the patient.
