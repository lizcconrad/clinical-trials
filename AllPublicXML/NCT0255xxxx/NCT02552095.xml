      The Purpose of this study is to evaluate compatibility of the Triathlon Partial Knee
      Replacement (PKR) with the Japanese population. It is expected that patients who receive the
      Triathlon PKR will achieve excellent clinical results without adverse effects and that the
      device fits well with Japanese morphology.
