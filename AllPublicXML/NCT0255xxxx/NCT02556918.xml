  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin reduces the
      frequency and severity of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) after cardiac surgery and to
      determine whether treatment with sitagliptin is effective in maintaining blood sugar control
      in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin reduces the
      frequency and severity of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and the need for continuous
      intravenous insulin infusion (CII) in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with type 2
      diabetes (T2D) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In addition, the study
      seeks to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin is effective in maintaining glycemic
      control and in preventing the need for subcutaneous (SC) insulin therapy in patients with T2D
      during the transition from intensive care unit (ICU) to regular floor in cardiac surgery
      patients with T2D.

    <description>Patients that required continuous insulin infusion (CII) at a rate &gt;1U/h will be transitioned to basal insulin (glargine/detemir). Calculate total daily dose (TDD) of insulin from the average CII rate during the last four hours of infusion (example, if the average rate is 2 U/hr., the TDD is 48 U/day) Give 50% of calculated dose as basal (glargine/detemir) insulin every day. Basal insulin will be given approx. 4 hours before discontinuation of CII.
The total daily insulin dose will be adjusted as follow:
Fasting and pre-meal BG between 100-180 mg/dl without hypoglycemia the previous day: no change Fasting and pre-meal BG between &gt;180-240 mg/dl: increase basal dose by 10% every day Fasting and pre-meal BG &gt;241 mg/dl: increase basal dose by 20% every day Fasting and pre-meal BG &lt;100 mg/dl: stop basal</description>
