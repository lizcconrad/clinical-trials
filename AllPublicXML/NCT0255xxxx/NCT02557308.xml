      An Observational, Prospective Cohort Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of RemsimaTM in
      Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of Remsima™ in ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) patients, in comparison with patients receiving other anti-TNF drugs, by
      evaluation of events of special interest (ESI) for up to 5 years from the first visit of each
      patient.

      In order to assess the primary study outcomes, the following ESI will be evaluated:

      Identified risks:

        -  Hepatitis B virus reactivation

        -  Congestive heart failure

        -  Opportunistic infections (excluding tuberculosis)

        -  Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infection and tuberculosis)

        -  Tuberculosis

        -  Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions )

        -  Haematologic reactions

        -  Systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus-like syndrome

        -  Demyelinating disorders

        -  Lymphoma (not HSTCL)

        -  Hepatobiliary events

        -  Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL)

        -  Serious infusion reaction during a re-induction following disease flare

        -  Sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reactions

        -  Leukaemia

      Potential risks:

        -  Malignancy (excluding lymphoma)

        -  Skin cancer

        -  Pregnancy exposure†

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy and additional safety of
      Remsima™ in AS patients, in comparison with patients receiving other TNF blockers.

      Blood samples for immunogenicity should be retained at the central laboratory up to the End
      of the Study, in case additional analysis is required. If additional analysis is not required
      during the study or after the End of the Study, blood samples will be stored in a CELLTRION,
      Inc. or designated biobank for a further 5 years (from the date the sample is transferred to
      the CELLTRION, Inc. or biobank) unless a specific authorization is given by CELLTRION, Inc.
