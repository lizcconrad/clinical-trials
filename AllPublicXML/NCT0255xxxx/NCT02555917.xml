    <textblock>
      Anterior cruciate ligament injury is very common knee injury. Especially Anterior cruciate
      ligament complete rupture leads to knee joint instability and degenerative change of the
      knee. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is performed for resolving these problems and
      it gives excellent results. For leading to successful result of anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction, selecting of appropriate femoral tunnel and tibial tunnel is necessary. If
      selecting inappropriate tibial tunnel location makes pain, synovitis, impingement of
      transplanted tendon, loss of range of motion, instability, failure of transplantation and
      risk of arthritis. It is known that selection of inappropriate tibial tunnel location is the
      most common cause of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction failure.

      Recently many studies reconstructed at anatomical lesion instead of isometric point. And some
      cadaver studies reported that tibial insertion of anterior cruciate ligament has &quot;C&quot; shape.
      There are two methods for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. One is preserving
      remnant and the other is removing remnant.

      This study aims to compare the tibia and femoral tunnel location of remnant preserving and
      remnant resecting anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

      The study design is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Randomly, twenty patients
      planed to undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using autograft by remnant
      preserving and other twenty patients undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using
      autograft by resecting anterior cruciate ligament. The clinical outcome is comparative
      preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months, 6months and 1years. And clinical score consists
      of Visual Analog Score, lachman test, anterior laxity, Lysholm knee score, international knee
      documentation committee score. Femoral and tibial tunnel location will be analyzed by
      three-dimensional computed tomography using Bernard quadrant method after surgery.

      The present study aimed to determine and compare (1) the accuracy of tibia and femoral tunnel
      location and (2) postoperative functional outcome after anterior cruciate ligament
      reconstruction between remnant preserving group versus remnant resecting group.
