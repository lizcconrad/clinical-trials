    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of fentanyl during craniotomy in two groups of brain tumor
      patients. The control group will receive standard general anesthesia with the use of fentanyl
      for intraoperative pain control and the study group will receive scalp nerve block with 0.5%
      levobupivacaine (local anesthetic) and also fentanyl for intraoperative pain control. The
      scalp nerve block might reduce the dose of fentanyl and promote faster emergence from general
      anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fentanyl has widely been used for intraoperative analgesia for craniotomy. In craniotomy, the
      long and complex operation, the continuous infusion or repeated use of fentanyl can
      significantly delay emergence from general anesthesia. The scalp block with local anesthesia
      is widely used for awake craniotomy with great success but it is not routinely used in
      general craniotomy. In this study, the control group will receive standard general anesthesia
      with the use of fentanyl for intraoperative pain control and the study group will receive the
      addition of scalp nerve block with 0.5% levobupivacaine (local anesthetic). The scalp nerve
      block might reduce the total dose of fentanyl and promote faster emergence from general
      anesthesia.

    <description>Scalp nerve block with 0.5% Levobupivacaine adds up to intravenous fentanyl for intraoperative pain control during supratentorial craniotomy with brain tumor removal. The scalp block includes 4-6 nerves which give sensory supply to related location with the use of total 10-15 ml of 0.5% Levobupivacaine. Intravenous fentanyl is used for intraoperative analgesia in both groups with continuous infusion (1 mcg/kg/hr until opening of dura and then 0.5 mcg/kg/hr until finishing of dural closure) and increment doses (0.5 mcg/kg) also given. is used for intraoperative analgesia in both groups with continuous infusion (1 mcg/kg/hr until opening of dura and then 0.5 mcg/kg/hr until finishing of dural closure) and increment doses (0.5 mcg/kg) also given.</description>
