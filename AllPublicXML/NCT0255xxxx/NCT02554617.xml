      The purpose of this study is to determine fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level in
      healthy subjects among Thai populations.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were produced from epithelial cells of inflammatory
      airways and eosinophils and this gas was discovered since 1991.

      Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has direct association with severity of inflammation
      of bronchial trees and sputum eosinophils and use for additional investigation for diagnosis
      asthma or inflammatory airway diseases.

      There are many factors from previous studies that associate with level of fractional exhaled
      nitric oxide (FeNO), one of that factors is race therefore we can't use level from another
      studies with different race for use as reference and there is no study about level of
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide in Thai population.

      It is therefore desirable to examine level of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in
      healthy subjects among Thai population and will be the main objective of this research.
