  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the treatment effects of sequential combination of
      aerobic exercise and cognitive training on cognitive function, physiological markers, daily
      function, physical function, social participation and quality of life in stroke patients with
      cognitive decline. The investigators hypothesized that: (1) sequential training protocol can
      improve outcome measures compared to single mode of training; (2) these treatment effects
      will retain at 6-month follow-up.
