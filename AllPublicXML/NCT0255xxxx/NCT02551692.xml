      The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of varenicline versus nicotine replacement
      versus placebo on personal smoking environment cue (PSE) reactivity. The results of this
      study will inform whether first-line pharmacotherapies for nicotine dependence (e.g. nicotine
      patch, varenicline) alter reactivity to environment cues. The investigators propose to
      identify 120 regular cigarette smokers who will complete 10 visits (1 screening visit, 1
      training visit, 1 camera turn-in 2 cue exposure sessions and 4 post-quit medication check
      sessions). Smokers will be randomized to one of three medication conditions: placebo (PLAC;
      n=40), transdermal nicotine patch (NRT; n=40) or varenicline (VAR; n=40) in a double blind,
      double-dummy design. Reactivity variables (craving, latency to smoke, and smoke intake) will
      be entered into 3 (Medication: NRT, VAR, PLAC) x 2 (Environment: smoking, nonsmoking)
      repeated measures ANOVAs with random-effects. The investigators hypothesize that personal
      smoking, as compared to nonsmoking environments, will be associated with greater reactivity
      (i.e. increased craving and smoke intake; decreased latency to smoke). A Medication x
      Environment interaction will be characterized by decreased reactivity to smoking as compared
      to nonsmoking environments in the VAR and NRT groups as compared to the PLAC group.
