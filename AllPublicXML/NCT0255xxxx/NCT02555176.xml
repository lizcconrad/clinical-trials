  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the effects of a low carbohydrate diet on tumor metabolism
      in patients with head and neck cancer. A low carbohydrate diet may reduce the metabolic
      activity of cancer cells and of surrounding supportive tissues. Studying samples of tissue
      and blood from patients with head and neck cancer in the laboratory before and after a low
      carbohydrate diet may help determine any changes in tumor metabolism.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on transporter of the outer
      mitochondrial membrane subunit 20 (TOMM20) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in
      carcinoma cells and the impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on monocarboxylate
      transporter 4 (MCT4) expression in fibroblasts.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet treatment in head and neck
      carcinoma (HNC) patients.

      II. Assess the effect of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on the serum levels of insulin,
      and insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and -2.

      III. Assess the potential impact of a low-carbohydrate normocaloric diet on the following:
      disease-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, overall survival.

      IV. To evaluate the utility of cancer-derived exosomes to serve as prognostic biomarkers for
      real-time monitoring of therapeutic efficacy and identifying early recurrence using
      longitudinal samples from cancer patients undergoing treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients follow a normocaloric, low-carbohydrate diet for 10-28 days (from the time of cancer
      diagnosis to definitive surgical treatment).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month, 3 months, and then every 3
      months for 24 months.
