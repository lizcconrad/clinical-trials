      The primary objective of the study is to compare, in patients treated with methotrexate
      injection for rheumatoid arthritis, the compliance and the health assessment questionnaire
      evolution for the administration by auto-injector versus administration by conventional
      subcutaneous injection, after 6 months of treatment.

             biotherapies and justifying injection of methotrexate. For the patient treated by oral
             methotrexate, the switch decided by the rheumatologist is made for either safety,
             compliance or efficacy issues.

          -  Agreeing to participate in the study and having dated and signed the informed consent
             form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Pregnant or breast-feeding patients

               -  Male and female patients with reproductive potential who are not willing to use
