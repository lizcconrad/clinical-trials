    <textblock>
      The proposed project seeks to evaluate the influence of cervicothoracic (CT) manipulation and
      passive stretching to the upper trapezius on pressure pain thresholds and range of motion
      (ROM) in individuals without recent complain of neck pain.

    <description>Description of a Right C7/T1 manipulation. The subject will lie prone. The therapist will stand on the L side of the subject facing in a cephalic direction (towards the patient's head). The therapist's right hand makes contact with the thumb on the right side of the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra. The therapist left hand supports the head making contact on the temporal bone. The hand/neck is gently laterally flexed to the right, until slight tension is palpated in the tissues. A high-velocity low-amplitude thrust will be applied towards the subjects left side. If cavitation does not occur (an audible pop) the subject will be repositioned and the manipulation attempted a second time. A maximum of 2 attempts will be performed for each side of the neck.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Upper trapezius stretch</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The subjects will be in a supine position. A researcher will passively place the subject's head into flexion, side-bending away and rotation towards the side to be stretched until the muscle barrier is met. The researcher will depress the subject's shoulder with 100 Newtons of force measured with a Micro FET pressure dynamometer (Hoggan Health Industries, Salt Lake City, UT).) Once this pressure amount is achieved the stretch will be held for 30 seconds. This will be repeated two times on each side.
The subject will be asked to provide continuous feedback about the stretch felt and the degree of discomfort (if any) felt during the 30 second stretches.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. No current history or past history of neck pain; able to lie on back or stomach without
        difficulty

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. 'Red flag' items indicated in your Neck Medical Screening Questionnaire such as
             history of a tumor, bone fracture, metabolic diseases, Rheumatoid Arthritis,
             osteoporosis, severe atherosclerosis, prolonged history of steroid use, etc.

          2. History of neck whiplash injury

          3. Diagnosis from your physician of cervical spinal stenosis (narrowing of spinal canal)
             or presence of symptoms (pain, pins and needles, numbness) down both arms

          4. Presence of central nervous system involvement such as exaggerated reflexes, changes
             in sensation in the hands, muscle wasting in the hands, impaired sensation of the
             face, altered taste, and presence of abnormal reflexes

          5. Evidence of neurological signs consistent with nerve root entrapment (pinched nerve in
             the neck)

          6. Prior surgery to your neck or upper back

          7. A medical condition which may influence assessment of pain or pressure pain thresholds
             (i.e. taking analgesics, sedatives, history of substance abuse, or cognitive
             deficiency)

          8. Diagnosis from your physician of fibromyalgia syndrome

          9. Currently pregnant, or could be pregnant
