  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a frequent complication of HIV infection,
      affecting between 20 and 57% of infected individuals. The advent of better antiretroviral
      treatment for HIV has meant that mortality from HIV has decreased dramatically in the UK.
      This means however, that chronic, age-related conditions associated with HIV, such as HIV-SN
      and cognitive impairment, are increasing in prevalence and becoming a significant disease
      burden.

      The classification, diagnosis and treatment of HIV-SN remains poor. Currently, little is
      known about the genetic basis of the disorder and what risk factors mean that some patients
      with HIV develop neuropathy and pain, whilst others do not. It is hoped that by further
      characterising or 'phenotyping' the disorder, it will be easier to identify which patients
      are at risk of developing neuropathy and chronic pain. It may also mean that treatment can be
      more individualised as currently patients often undergo a frustrating 'trial and error'
      protocol of treatment, as clinicians can not yet predict who will respond to which treatment.

      It has also been suggested that there is a link between HIV-SN and HIV associated
      neurocognitive disorder (HAND), which is another common, age-related complication of HIV
      infection. It may be that the existence of one pathology could predict the development of the
      other, or that the presence of HAND may impair the diagnosis or treatment of chronic pain
      associated with HIV-SN.

      This study aims to recruit a cohort of HIV patients with and without HIV-SN and to identify
      genetic risk factors for the development of HIV-SN and neuropathic pain. It also aims to more
      deeply phenotype the condition, using well validated questionnaires, and to identify any
      influence that early neurocognitive dysfunction may have on the reporting, diagnosis and
      treatment of neuropathic pain in the HIV population.
