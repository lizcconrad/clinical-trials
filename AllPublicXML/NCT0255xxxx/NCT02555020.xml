  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrate loading is an important component of enhanced recovery pathways. Preoperative
      carbohydrate treatments have been widely adopted as part of enhanced recovery after surgery
      (ERAS) or fast-track surgery protocols. Although fast-track surgery protocols have been
      widely investigated and have been shown to be associated with improved postoperative
      outcomes, some individual constituents of these protocols, including preoperative
      carbohydrate treatment, have not been subject to such robust analysis.To assess the effects
      of preoperative carbohydrate treatment, compared with placebo or preoperative fasting, on
      postoperative recovery and insulin resistance in adult patients undergoing elective surgery.

      Patients received 400 mL of oral isotonic glucose (No NPO®, Daesang, Korea) 12 hours before
      anesthesia and 400 mL 2 hours before. CHL composition was standard: 12.5 g of carbohydrate
      per 100 mL, 12% monosaccharide, 12% disaccharide, 76% polysaccharide, 250 mOsm/kg and 50
      kcal.
