  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare physical activity levels between patients with
      bronchiectasis and healthy subjects.

      We hypothesize that patients with bronchiectasis will have lower levels of physical activity,
      since physical activity levels is affected by reduced exercise tolerance, severity of disease
      and other disease related symptoms and conditions.

    <textblock>
      Physical activity limitation in chronic respiratory diseases is caused by many factors
      including respiratory, hemodynamic, and peripheral muscle weakness. Bronchiectasis is
      characterized by irreversible widening of the medium-sized airways, with inflammation,
      chronic bacterial infection and destruction of the bronchial walls. In addition to pulmonary
      function worsening, extra pulmonary features such as reduced peripheral muscle endurance can
      be a significant physical problem which causing a decrease in physical activity levels.

      Despite physical activity is considered to be essential for the management of chronic
      respiratory diseases, there is a lack of scientific study, which compares physical activity
      levels between patients with bronchiectasis and healthy subjects.

      This study will assess physical activity level, exercise capacity, quality of life and
      peripheral muscle strength in patients with bronchiectasis compared to healthy subjects.

    <description>6-minute walk test will be performed in a long, straight, enclosed corridor 30 meters in length. Patients are required to walk in their walking speed with standardized instructions. The distance walked by subjects during 6 minutes will be recorded.
The incremental shuttle walk test will be performed in an enclosed corridor. Patients are required to walk back and forth, turning around two cones placed 9 meters apart making the shuttle distance 10 meters long. Patients will follow the rhythm dictated by the audio signal.</description>
