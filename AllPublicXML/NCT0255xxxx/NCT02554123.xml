      A prospective ranfomized clinical study of patients undergoing Milligan Morgan´s
      haemorrhoidectomy at Hospital Universitario Rey Juan Carlos (Móstoles-Spain) will be
      performed. The patients will be randomized into 2 groups:

        -  Experimental group (EG): Patients undergoing Milligan Morgan´s procedure and application
           of Vitamin E ointment on the surgical bed.

        -  Control group (CG): Patients undergoing Milligan Morgan´s procedure and application of
           Vaseline on the surgical bed.

      Postoperative pain determined by VAS at the 1st, 3rd and 7th postoperative days, and need for
      morphine rescue will be investigated.
