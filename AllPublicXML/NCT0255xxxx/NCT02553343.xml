  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations of the
      high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine compared to the licensed high-dose trivalent
      influenza vaccine control in healthy elderly subjects aged 65 years of age and above.

      Primary objectives:

        -  To describe the safety profile of all subjects in each study group.

        -  To demonstrate that the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine induces an immune
           response (as assessed by HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) that is non-inferior to
           responses induced by the licensed high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine for the 3 common
           virus strains at 28 days post-vaccination.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe post-vaccination immunogenicity for the 4 virus strains (as assessed by
           seroconversion and seroprotection) for subjects who receive the high-dose quadrivalent
           influenza vaccine and the licensed high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine.

        -  To describe post-vaccination immunogenicity for the 4 virus strains (as assessed by
           GMTs, seroconversion, and seroprotection) for subjects who receive the high-dose
           quadrivalent influenza vaccine and the investigational high-dose trivalent influenza
           vaccine.

      All eligible participants will be randomized to receive a single injection of either one of
      the high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine formulations or one of the high-dose trivalent
      influenza vaccines at Day 0. They will provide blood samples for hemagglutination inhibition
      (HAI) testing. Safety information as solicited, unsolicited reactions, serious adverse
      events, including adverse events of special interest will be collected in the trial.
