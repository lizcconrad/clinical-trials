  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2011, 38.6 million hospital stays occurred in the United States at a cost of $387.2
      billion. 47.9 percent involved hospitalizations during which surgical procedures were
      performed. Orthopedic procedures constituted the most frequently performed and most costly of
      operating room procedures. As the healthcare climate in the United States continues to
      change, there is a trend towards providing effective care in a fiscally conservative manner.
      Central to this strategy is the shift towards increasing ambulatory surgical procedures from
      surgeries requiring post-operative admission for patients. While savings to hospitals and
      third-party payers are implied, there may be an unrecognized increase in financial, physical,
      and psychosocial post-operative costs to patients undergoing ambulatory surgery and to their
      caregivers. Rawal et al., and McGarth and colleagues have found that patients undergoing
      orthopedic procedures had moderate to severe post-operative pain. We propose to present a
      survey to patients and their caregivers before surgery and at multiple timepoints
      post-operatively to acquire information on the impacts of ambulatory orthopedic surgery. In
      addition to assessing post-operative pain, this study serves to examine various other
      possible burdens to patients that have not been previously evaluated in this patient
      population.
