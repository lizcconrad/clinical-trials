      The purpose of this study is to determine if pelvic floor muscle training with a physical
      therapist before and after surgery will improve health-related quality of life following
      robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.

      Goals of the present study will be to determine whether initiating pelvic floor muscle
      training preoperatively improves quality of life symptoms related specifically to urinary
      health following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Drawing definitive conclusions from
      past studies is challenging secondary to various inconsistencies including: variability of
      physical therapy intervention, poorly defined definitions of continence, as well as poorly
      defined quality of life measurements. Additionally, the vast majority of studies combined
      open and robotic prostatectomy increasing cohort heterogeneity and further blurring
      interpretation of results. The investigators' study will focus exclusively on patients
      undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Standardized pelvic floor muscle therapy as
      well as clearly defined patient outcomes (ie: validated questionnaires) will be utilized to
      determine whether preoperative initiation of formal pelvic floor physical therapy can improve
      health-related quality of life following surgery.

      In the era of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy does physical therapist initiated
      preoperative pelvic floor muscle training lessen the expected postoperative drop off in
      urinary related quality of life and/or improve patient's recovery of continence following
      surgery?

    <description>Written and verbal information on performing Kegel exercises (exercises that aim to strengthen pelvic floor muscles) will be provided at the pre-op clinic visit. The treatment group will receive pelvic floor muscle training through a course of three one-hour sessions with a trained pelvic floor physical therapist in addition to the current standard information from their surgeon. The physical therapy sessions will be conducted at 1-6 weeks preoperative, 7-10 days postoperative, and 4-8 weeks postoperative .</description>
