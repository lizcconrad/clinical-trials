      BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) treat problems such as gastroesophageal reflux
      disease (GERD). In many patients with mild or moderate GERD, PPIs should be used for 1-2
      months but are often continued longer unnecessarily. This is a problem because PPIs may cause
      harm when used long-term. PPI use is associated with severe C. difficile infections,
      fractures and pneumonia. Canada's public drug programs spent $247 million on PPIs in 2012
      (not including Quebec or PEI). Due to concerns with long-term PPI use, patients may face the
      decision to continue their PPI, use a lower dose or stop and use on-demand (only when
      symptoms return). This decision should be made collaboratively between patients and
      clinicians, though patients tend to have a poor understanding of when reducing a drug is
      appropriate. Using a lower dose or using on-demand may be viewed as difficult because of the
      chance of symptoms returning. Patient decision aids (PDAs) inform patients on benefits and
      risks of treatment options and improve ability to make informed decisions and clarify values.
      OBJECTIVES: Develop a PDA to help patients with the decision to continue PPI or stop and use
      on-demand/use a lower dose. Evaluate whether: 1) the PDA changes patient preference to
      continue or stop and use on-demand/use a lower dose of PPI 2) the PDA improves patient
      knowledge and realistic expectations 3) patients and pharmacists feel they made a shared
      decision 4) there is a change in PPI prescribing 8 weeks post-PDA and 5) patients' choices
      match up with their values. METHODOLOGY: The PDA will be developed by a team of doctors,
      pharmacists and patients. It will be delivered during a visit with a pharmacist. Patients
      (n=54) will indicate which choice they prefer (continue PPI/stop or use lower dose) before
      and after going through the PDA. We will use Mcnemar's test to compare the number of patients
      preferring to continue their PPI before and after. We will evaluate whether there is a
      difference in knowledge test scores and expectations test scores before and after the PDA.
      After the PDA, we will ask patients and pharmacists to rate the extent to which shared
      decision making occurred and measure the agreement. Values/choice congruence will be
      evaluated using logistic regression. Eight weeks after patients have received the PDA, we
      will look at whether there is any reduction in PPI use.

    <description>Difference in proportion of patients preferring to continue PPI therapy before and after PDA assessed using Mcnemar's test. The choice to continue will be the composite of patients wishing to continue and those unsure (since patients who are unsure would continue on PPI). We plan to conduct subgroup analysis based on decisional conflict at baseline for the primary outcome and secondary outcomes. Our subgroups will be (i) patients who are confident in their choice at baseline (SURE test score of 4) and (ii) patients who are not confident in their choice at baseline (SURE test score &lt;4). The decision preference will be assessed at a single visit (before the PDA is delivered and right after).</description>
