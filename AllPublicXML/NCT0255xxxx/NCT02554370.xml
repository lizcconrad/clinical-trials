  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bilateral subthalamic deep-brain stimulation is a well-established therapeutic option to
      improve motor signs and reduce dopaminergic treatment and related motor complications in
      patients with severe forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, psychological disorders and
      socio-familial maladjustment are less clearly improved with subthalamic stimulation with an
      aggravation of the social adjustment described in about 1/3 of cases, with work disruption,
      divorce or familial conflict. The caregivers have also been reported to present negative
      well-being after surgery with an aggravation of the quality of life. In the present study,
      the investigators evaluate the effects of a perioperative psychoeducational programme to
      avoid postoperative socio-familial maladjustment in PD patients candidate for subthalamic
      stimulation, and their caregivers, in a randomized controlled study.

      After inclusion, patients (and their caregivers) are randomized into two groups stratified on
      their preoperative social adjustment scale couple domain score : usual treatment and
      psychoeducational programme or usual treatment alone (Figure). The psychoeducational
      programme focuses on 3 domains: 1) neurosurgical procedure and neurological outcome, 2)
      social life including work, social and familial relationship, 3) couple relationship. The
      programme consists of 7 sessions with 3 to 4 couples at the same session, except for the
      'couple relationship' domain. Each domain is tackled in a two-way manner with
      information/education proved by the investigator and discussion of the patients' and
      caregivers' expectations during one session. The following session started with a 'Questions
      and Answers' on the previous domain and then information on another domain. Four sessions
      were carried out prior to surgery and 3 after.
