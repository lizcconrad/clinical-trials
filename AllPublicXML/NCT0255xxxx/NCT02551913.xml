  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep education has been used as a method of primary and secondary prevention of sleep
      problems in all age groups. An especially vulnerable age group are adolescents who frequently
      have poor sleep habits and suffer from sleep deprivation. In adolescents, insufficient sleep,
      inadequate sleep quality, and irregular sleep patterns are associated with daytime
      sleepiness, negative moods, increased likelihood of stimulant use, higher levels of
      risk-taking behavior, poor school performance, and increased risk of unintentional injuries.
      As an US study has shown, sleepiness was the major causal factor in many traffic accidents
      and more than 50% of sleep-related crashes involved drivers aged 25 or younger. The study was
      aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a theory-based sleep hygiene intervention in improving
      sleep quality in adolescents.

    <description>Sleep duration will be measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSIQ). The PSQI is a self-administered questionnaire to assess subjective sleep quality during the previous month (Buysse et al., 1989). The self-rated items of the PSQI generate seven component scores (range of subscale scores, 0-3): sleep quality; sleep latency; sleep duration; habitual sleep efficiency; sleep disturbance; use of sleeping medication; and daytime dysfunction.</description>
