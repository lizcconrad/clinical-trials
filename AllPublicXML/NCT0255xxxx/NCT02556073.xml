  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor adherence to asthma controller medication may link to poor asthma outcome. A metered
      dose device with built-in dose counter helps physicians to monitor drug compliance in asthma
      patients. Mobile-phone based self management opens a window for better asthma control. The
      present study aims to investigate the relationship between the adherence to controller
      medication of combined inhaled corticosteroid/long acting beta2-agonists, assessing by
      integrated dose counter, and the level of airway inflammation and asthma control. Moreover,
      the investigators also use a new asthma self-management Apps to enhance drug compliance. With
      the application of the new, easily available tools, the investigator expect to increase
      adherence rates, and hence, to reduce airway inflammation and improve the level of asthma
      control.

      The study will be conducted as a prospective, observational, open labeled, randomized trial
      in a single center (Taipei Veterans General Hospital). After screening, the enrolled patients
      will be randomized to either routine care or Smartphone self management group. In the routine
      care group, the patient will be treated as routine practice as a real-world setting. No
      additional intervention will be done. In the Smartphone self management group, an asthma self
      management Apps (My asthma App, GlaxoSmithKline, Chinese version, or Line), which provides
      multiple function, including health information (real-time weather condition, air pollution
      index) at the point-of-living, personalized health assessments (asthma control test, peak
      flow rate) and interactive action plans (green, yellow, and red light), and regular reminding
      for controller administration, will be downloaded to the participant's Smartphone. The
      participant will be educated to operate the Apps to improve asthma control. Participants in
      both groups will use identical controller (Sal/flu 2 inhalations twice daily plus as-needed
      rescue ventolin) and will be scheduled to follow up for 24 weeks.
