      This study aims to identify and validate the gene expression differentials of peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells and differential inflammation profiles and other aspects in classic
      asthma, cough-variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a common and heterogeneous respiratory disorder affecting millions of people,
      posing a considerable burden on health care systems globally. The disease is characterized by
      inflammation of the airways with eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, airway
      epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and other cells, by airflow obstruction and by
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The disease is triggered by multiple gene-environment
      interactions. Asthma heterogeneity is recognized in terms of clinical phenotypes of asthma
      whereby classic asthma (CA) and cough variant asthma (CVA) are identified. classic asthma is
      a common phenotype of asthma that presents episodic dyspnoea and wheezing with or without
      cough. Cough variant asthma is a phenotype of asthma that presents solely cause of chronic
      cough.

      Eosinophilic bronchitis (EB) is a common cause of chronic cough, which like eosinophils
      asthma is characterized by airway eosinophilic inflammation, but unlike asthma there is no
      airway hyperresponsiveness or variable airflow obstruction.

      Improvement of disease diagnosis and management require a better understanding of disease
      heterogeneity. A useful biomarker for phenotype recognition will represent underlying
      pathologic mechanisms of disease, marking heterogeneity and guiding personalized treatment
      approaches. Our hypothesis was that the different clinical manifestos in patients with
      eosinophilic bronchitis, classic asthma, and cough-variant asthma could be caused by
      differential gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and
      differential inflammation profiles and other aspects.

    <measure>Difference in Gene Expression Profile of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Classic Asthma,Cough Variant Asthma and Eosinophilic Bronchitis Compared with Healthy Controls</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Five milliliters of venous blood was collected. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMC) were isolated by the Ficoll-Paque plus(GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp, NJ ) according to the manufacture's recommendations. RNA from PBMC was extracted. RNA-seq, a high throughput RNA sequencing technology, would characterize the transcriptome by sequencing complementary cDNAs followed by mapping of the sequence reads to the genome.</description>

    <measure>Induced sputum cytology</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Before sputum induction, subjects were instructed to rinse their mouth to remove any cellular debris. Nebulization was conducted using 3% saline via an ultrasonic nebulizer. Following expectoration into the clear sterile plastic pot, the sputum plugs were weighed and treated with 4 aliquots of dithiothreitol to completely dissolve the mucus. The mixture was subsequently vortexed, shaked and centrifuged. The supernatant was stored at -80℃ for inflammation profile analysis. The cell pallets were mounted on a glass slide for fixation with polyaldehyde and Haematoxylin-eosin staining. Samples with 5% or fewer epithelial cells of the total cell count were deemed eligible. This entailed counting of 400 non-squamous cells for cytology assessment. Inflammation phenotype was assigned based on a sputum eosinophil cutoff of greater than 3% and a sputum neutrophil cutoff of greater than 61%.</description>

    <measure>Cumulative provocative dose causing 20% fall in FEV1 measured through the Methacholine bronchial challenge test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 months</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometric values at the baseline are referred to as FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and MMEF. Spirometry tests are carried out using a spirometer (Jaeger, Germany). All operation procedures meet the joint recommendation by ATS and ERS.The predicted values are selected based on the reference regression model established by Jinping Zheng and nanshan Zhong.Methacholine bronchial challenge test was performed only in subjects with a baseline FEV1 greater than 60% predicted using hand-squeeze nebulizers.The bronchial challenge was ceased in case of FEV1 fall being 20% or greater, or the maximal cumulative dose of methacholine (2.50mg) had been given. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was defined as 20% or greater fall in FEV1.The cumulative provocative dose causing 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20FEV1-MCh) was reported in subjects with AHR. Relationship between FENO,serum IgE,airway and systematic inflammation and AHR was assessed.</description>
