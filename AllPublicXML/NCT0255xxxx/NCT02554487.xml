      Investigating the interrelation of stroke and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is of major
      importance. First because of the high occurrence rate of stroke and the fact that it is a
      frequent cause of long-term disability in adulthood. Second because SDB (obstructive, central
      and mixed forms) affects more than 50% of stroke survivors and has a detrimental effect on
      clinical stroke outcome. Third, spontaneous and learning-dependent sleep-associated
      neuroplasticity may be affected by SDB following stroke worsening stroke rehabilitation.
      Therefore, it is crucial to investigate whether early treatment of SDB with Adaptive
      Servo-Ventilation (ASV), the treatment device of choice to treat obstructive, central and
      mixed forms of SDB, has a beneficial effect on the evolution of the lesion volume and on
      clinical stroke outcome.

      To this end, the investigators recruit and prospectively follow 3 groups of patients with
      ischemic stroke over 1 year. During the first night after hospital admission due to acute
      stroke, nocturnal breathing is assessed by means of a respiratory polygraphy. Patients with
      significant sleep disordered breathing, defined as an Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI) &gt; 20/h, are
      randomized to ASV treatment or no treatment (sSDB ASV+ or sSDB ASV-). ASV treatment starts
      the second night following hospital admission and ends 90 days later. Stroke patients without
      SDB (AHI &lt; 5 / h) serve as a control group (no SDB) to observe the evolution of the lesion
      volume and stroke outcome without the additional burden of SDB.

      Lesion volume one day after hospital admission due to acute stroke (after potential lysis
      therapy) measured by Diffusion Weighted Imaging will be subtracted from lesion volume
      measured by T2-weighted volumetry assessed 90(+/-7) days following stroke and compared
      between patients with and without ASV treatment (sSDB ASV+ and sSDB ASV-) as well as patients
      without SDB (no SDB). Short- and long-term clinical stroke outcomes are assessed by clinical
      scales and questionnaires 4 to 7 days, 3 months and 1 year following stroke. Cognitive
      outcome is assessed during hospitalization (within the first week following stroke) and after
      the treatment period of 90 days by neuropsychological tests assessing attention and memory.
      In addition, baseline assessment of physiological parameters such as blood pressure and
      endothelial function/arterial stiffness are assessed during the first weeks following stroke
      and at the end of the treatment period, i.e. approximately 90 days following stroke.

      Background

      Investigating the interrelation of stroke and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is of major
      importance. Stroke affects 2-3 individuals per 1000 a year and is the most common
      neurological cause of hospitalization and long-term disability in adulthood. SDB, i.e.,
      obstructive, central and mixed forms of sleep apnea syndrome, is highly prevalent after acute
      stroke, affecting approximately over 50% of stroke patients. It is also a significant risk
      factor for stroke. Beside the high prevalence, SDB negatively influences stroke outcome. SDB
      after stroke has been found to be associated with a faster progression of stroke severity,
      higher blood pressure levels and longer hospitalization in the acute phase. Chronically,
      stroke patients with SDB exhibit worse functional outcome and a higher mortality. The
      mechanisms leading to the detrimental effects of SDB on stroke outcome are multiple and
      include changes of cerebral hemodynamics and brain oxygenation as well as a number of humoral
      and systemic changes. Frequent arousals during sleep and interruptions of deep sleep and
      sleep continuity may also negatively influence sleep-associated neuroplasticity.

      Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) is the treatment of choice in mixed and complex sleep apnea
      syndrome, consisting of the coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea and central
      events. Pressure support is adjusted based on the patient's recent minute ventilation and
      respiratory rate, which means that ventilation can vary gradually and naturally over the
      course of the night and is continuously adjusted to the patient's need.

      Due to the high prevalence of SDB following stroke and its detrimental effects on stroke
      outcome, it is crucial to investigate whether early treatment of central, obstructive and
      mixed forms of SDB with Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) has a beneficial effect on the
      evolution of the lesion volume and on clinical stroke outcome.

      Objective

      The primary objective of the present trial is to assess whether an immediate onset of ASV
      treatment in ischemic stroke patients with significant SDB (sSDB, Apnea-Hypopnea-Index (AHI)
      &gt; 20/h) has a favorable effect on infarct growth assessed as the difference in lesion volume
      before and 90 days after treatment start. The potential reduction in infarct growth should
      also result in a better clinical stroke outcome.

      One of the secondary objectives of the trial is therefore to assess whether an immediate
      onset of ASV treatment in stroke patients with SDB improves clinical outcome and is tolerated
      and associated with good treatment compliance. Moreover, it will be investigated whether it
      improves cognitive outcome as well as short and long-term cortical reorganization assess by
      functional resting state imaging. The investigators are also interested whether ASV treatment
      improves physiological parameters such as blood pressure and endothelial function/arterial
      stiffness.

      Methods

      3 groups of patients are prospectively followed over 1 year. ASV treatment starts the second
      night following hospital admission due to acute ischemic stroke and ends 90 days later. Group
      assignment takes place the day following stroke after the assessment of SDB by respiratory
      polygraphy. Patients with an AHI &gt; 20/h are randomized to ASV treatment or no treatment (sSDB
      ASV+ or sSDB ASV-). Stroke patients without SDB (AHI &lt; 5 / h) serve as a control group (no
      SDB) to observe the evolution of the lesion volume and stroke outcome without the additional
      burden of SDB.

      Evolution of lesion volume from the first to the 90st day following stroke and clinical
      (including cognitive) outcome 90 days after stroke will be compared between stroke patients
      with sSDB that receive ASV treatment (sSDB ASV+) versus no treatment (sSDB ASV-) and stroke
      patients without SBD (no SDB, AHI &lt; 5 / h).

    <description>Adaptive Servo-Ventilation (ASV) is a ventilator mode used to treat central and obstructive forms of sleep disordered breathing. It is authorized in Switzerland, bears a conformity marking (CE 0123) and it is used according to the approved indications. Stroke patients with an AHI &gt; 20/h assessed within the first night following stroke that are randomized to ASV treatment, starting in the second night after stroke, are part of this group. The other half of patients are randomized to no treatment and patients without sleep disordered breathing (AHI &lt; 5) following stroke serve as a control group</description>
