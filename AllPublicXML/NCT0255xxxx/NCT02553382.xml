  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of multiple medications for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes,
      patients often continue to have difficulty attaining blood glucose targets and managing
      cardiovascular disease risk factors. Recent trends in non-pharmacological therapy have
      created a growing public interest in dietary supplements.

      Research by this group and others support the benefits of whole grains, viscous dietary fibre
      and ginseng in the management of diabetes. The current study investigates whether the
      co-administration of a viscous dietary fibre blend, Salba (a grain rich in omega-3 fatty
      acids), and 2 varieties of ginseng roots will further improve blood sugar control and
      cardiovascular disease risk outcomes in individuals with Type 2 diabetes already receiving
      conventional treatments.

      Patients with Type 2 diabetes receiving the recommended intervention in accordance with the
      Canadian Diabetes Association guidelines will be enrolled in a 6-month clinical study. Half
      of the participants will be randomly assigned to a 4-component intervention that comprises
      the co-administration of these four dietary/herbal supplements in addition to their usual
      treatment regimen; the other half will continue their usual treatment regimen in addition to
      taking high-oat fiber and wheat bran supplements.

      The investigators hypothesize that an intensified, multi-targeted intervention with the
      addition of these dietary and herb components will further improve long-term blood glucose
      control and cardiovascular disease risk factors beyond conventional therapy. If this
      combination of viscous fiber, Salba and ginseng is shown to be beneficial, these remedies
      could complement current conventional therapy for Type 2 diabetes with the goal to further
      improve health outcomes.
