      Hypothesis is that the presence of a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms could be
      predictive factor for post-operative delirium. During 72hrs after spine surgery, investigator
      will observe occurrence of post-operative delirium, and analysis difference of
      a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms between 2 groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium appear approximately 10-70% of patients older than 65 yrs undergoing
      surgery and it is strongly associated with poor surgical outcome. The clinical
      characteristics of postoperative delirium are fluctuating attention, visual hallucination,
      disorganized thought and alter sleep-wake cycles. This is quite similar to core features of
      Î±-synuclein-related cognitive disorders such as parkinson`s disease dementia and dementia
      with lewy body. At that point, investigator thought that postoperative delirium is
      preclinical stage of a-synucleinopathy. In other words, a-synuclein related disorders and
      postoperative delirium may share an underlying neurochemical change in their pathogenesis.

      investigator will recruit age 65 and older patients scheduled to perform spine surgery. The
      pre-operative evaluation include neurologic exam, baseline cognitive function and
      a-synucleinopathy related non motor symptoms through Questionnaires.

    <description>During 72hrs after spine surgery, investigator will observe occurrence of post-operative delirium, and analysis difference of anosmia symptoms before operation between 2 groups. The cross-cultural smell identification test will be used for measure of anosmia. investigator define anosmia as less than 4 score on the cross-cultural smell identification test. This study is not interventional study, because measure of anosmia by smell kit will not develop post-operation delirium more. (investigator will classify our patients into normosmia if the CCSIT score is 9 or higher, and hyposmia if the CCSIT score is 6 or less. Patients whose CCSIT scores are 7 or 8 will be regarded as borderline.).</description>
