    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort observational study of inhaler adherence in a community care
      setting (ie. general practice clinics and pharmacies in the community).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a 2-4 week period, consecutive patients with a history of respiratory illness already
      prescribed a salmeterol/fluticasone Diskus inhaler will be asked to participate in this
      study. Patients will give informed consent to participate in this study of adherence, which
      will be assessed with the INCA device. Both clinicians and patients will be fully aware that
      the device is an acoustic recording device and that both time and technique of inhaler use
      will be assessed. Once consented, patients will be given an INCA enabled inhaler for 1 month
      and asked to use it as they normally would and then to return it at the end of one month. The
      days used and the number of doses used in the study period, as per the dose counter, will
      also be recorded.
