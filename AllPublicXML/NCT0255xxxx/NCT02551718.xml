  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of choosing treatment based on a high
      throughput ex vivo drug sensitivity assay in combination with mutation analysis for patients
      with acute leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to
      treatment. A high throughput screening assay tests many different drugs individually or in
      combination that kill leukemia cells in tiny chambers at the same time. High throughput drug
      sensitivity assay and mutation analysis may help guide the choice most effective for an
      individual's acute leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test patient cells in a high throughput assay against individual drugs and drug
      combinations within 21 days to enable optimal choice of drug combinations for therapy.

      II. To test gene expression that reveals activation of druggable pathways or mutations in
      genes that confer susceptibility to specific agents may also be considered in choice of
      treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the response to the chosen therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Leukemia cells obtained from blood or bone marrow are analyzed for sensitivity to both
      individual drugs and drug combinations via high throughput chemotherapy sensitivity assay and
      next generation sequencing assays. Doctors will then recommend chemotherapy regimens based on
      the results.

      After completion of the chemotherapy regimen, patients are followed up at 2-4 weeks for
      response, and then every 3 months for 2 years for duration of response and survival.
