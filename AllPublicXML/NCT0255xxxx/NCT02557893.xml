    <textblock>
      Pregnant women at increased risk for back pain were studied during the second trimester and
      randomized to12-weeks of resistance exercise, education or waitlist. Several outcomes were
      assessed including physical function, quality of life and mood.

    <textblock>
      A parallel group trial was completed at a single site. Second trimester women (n=134) were
      randomly assigned (in blocks of 3) to 12-weeks of wait list, bi-monthly pregnancy education
      classes or twice weekly low-to-moderate intensity resistance training. Resistance training
      involved one abdominal exercise with no external load and five exercises with an external
      load that gradually progressed (leg extension, leg press, arm lat pull, leg curl, and lumbar
      extension). Several outcomes were assessed including physical function, quality of life and
      mood.

    <description>Maternity nurses taught six bimonthly pregnancy education classes (~20 per class) which covered several topics including information about what to expect during normal labor and delivery, common interventions during delivery (medications, induction, Cesarean delivery), parenting skills needed for baby care, breastfeeding, baby and child cardiopulmonary resuscitation, typical child development and communicating with infants. No physical activity education was included in the curriculum. The pregnancy education participants formed an attention control group.</description>
