      The aim of this study is to evaluate Image-defined Risk Factors (IDRF) in patients with
      neuroblastoma, at the time of their initial presentation, as a prognostic factor for
      prediction of subsequent outcome &amp; complications related to surgery, in the accordance with
      the experience of South Egypt Cancer Institute (SECI), which is the largest referral site in
      Upper Egypt.

      Background:

      Neuroblastoma is the third most common childhood cancer, after leukemia and brain tumors, and
      is the most common solid extracranial tumor in children.

      The concept of surgical risk factors in neuroblastoma surgery was introduced with the
      European multicenter study (LNESG1) study.

      In 2005 the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) Task Force, representing all major
      co-operative pediatric cancer groups, adopted the principle of surgical risk factors and
      incorporated it in the INRG Staging System. The INRG Task Force preferred the term
      Image-Defined Risk Factors (IDRF) to surgical risk factors, and agreed upon a list of IDRF.

      Patients &amp; Methods:

      This retrospective study will be carried out by reviewing the medical records of patients
      with neuroblastoma seen at the pediatric oncology department, in the period from 2001 January
      till 2015 December.

      Data from Patients' medical records will be gathered, Pathologic diagnosis of neuroblastoma
      will be verified before the enrollment into the study. As an initial imaging was done for all
      patients at presentation, as a routine for diagnosis &amp; staging, the reports of the computed
      tomography scans will be reviewed for verification of the presence or absence of the IDRF.
      This historical cohort will be followed forward with time for ascertainment of the role of
      surgery in treatment, and treatment outcomes of these patients. Any complications occurred
      due to surgery will be reported, as collected from surgical reports of these patients.
