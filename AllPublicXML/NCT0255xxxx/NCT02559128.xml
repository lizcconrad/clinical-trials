  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this cross-sectional comparative 2x2 trial study is to compare the degree of
      insulin resistance, myocardial function and selected metabolic parameters and to explore the
      pathophysiological mechanisms by which insulin resistance is implicated in development of
      chronic heart failure (HF) in patients with type 2 diabetes and prediabetes (T2D).

      Investigators hypothesize that patients with heart failure will be insulin-resistant and will
      display metabolic abnormalities as patients with diabetes.

      100 subjects in total, divided into four groups will be included: 40 patients with type 2
      diabetes or prediabetes and chronic HF without previous pharmacological treatment (T2D+HF+),
      20 subjects with HF without T2D (HF+T2D-), 20 subjects with T2D alone (HF-T2D+) and 20
      healthy control volunteers (HF-T2D-).

      All examinations will be done during a short admission at Diabetes Center (CD) in Institute
      for Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKEM), always under comparable circumstances. All
      participants will undergo standardized selection of metabolic and cardiovascular tests.

      Oxidative stress markers, selected cytokines, peptides and metabolites in blood and
      subcutaneous adipose tissue will be analyzed. Investigators assume that this project will
      bring new knowledge which will contribute to discovery of the mechanisms implicated in the
      development of heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes.
