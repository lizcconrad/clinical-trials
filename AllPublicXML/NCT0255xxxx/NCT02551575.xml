    <textblock>
      This is prospective randomized, controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Qingre Huoxue comprehensive therapy in treating of patients with early Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (RA). The major outcome index is the change from baseline to week 24 in Disease Activity
      Score (DAS28), and minor outcome indexes include American College of Rheumatology
      (ACR)20/50/70, PRO score, Sharp score and OMERACT RAMRIS score. The adverse events at any
      time were recorded to evaluate the safety.

      Three arms were included in this study, and treatment with MTX and HCQ is defined as active
      comparator. Treatment of TCM，including Qingre Huoxue granule, Qingre Huoxue external
      preparation, MTX placebo and HCQ placebo, is defined as one experimental arm. Treatment of
      integrative medicine，including Qingre Huoxue granule, Qingre Huoxue external preparation, MTX
      and HCQ, is defined as another experimental arm.
