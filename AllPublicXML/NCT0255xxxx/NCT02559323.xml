    <textblock>
      Cancer survivors face unique health challenges as a result of their cancer diagnosis and
      treatment. OncoLink created an Internet based program for survivors to learn about their
      risks. A follow up survey will allow us to continue to develop the program in ways that will
      benefit users. This survey will need to be conducted via email, which will require the
      collection of the users email address and a secure method of linking the users care plan
      questionnaire answers to their survey answers.
