  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 18-month study, which aims to identify imaging and biofluid biomarkers
      in people with ALS to expand the understanding of ALS pathology, treatment targets, disease
      progression, and anatomical differences between different disease phenotypes. This pilot
      project is tailored to produce imaging tools that will allow researchers to conduct future
      ALS clinical trials more efficiently which may in turn impact the pace for ALS drug
      discovery.

      In this trial, approximately 200 subjects will participate in this study from 2 Northeast ALS
      Consortium (NEALS) centers in the United States. Fifty (50) ALS participants will be age and
      gender matched to 50 participants with no known neurological disorder (healthy controls). Of
      these, twenty five (25) ALS participants will be age (Â±5 years) gender and binding affinity
      (TSPO) matched to 25 healthy controls.

      During the enrollment period 200 participants will be screened and 100 participants will
      ultimately be scanned. There will be a maximum allowed time of 45 days between the screening
      and baseline visits (1st scan). All 100 subjects will undergo MRI scanning and clinical
      assessment at the Baseline Visit. Healthy control participants will have no further follow-up
      visits once they have completed their participation in the screening and baseline visits.
      Only 50 subjects from this sample will undergo PET scanning. The ALS participants will return
      for follow-up MRI scanning and clinical assessments every three months and follow-up PET
      scanning every 6 months over a 12-month period.
