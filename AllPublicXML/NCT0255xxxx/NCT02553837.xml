      This clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, non-comparative, open-label clinical
      trial. This trial was conducted, written informed consent form by voluntary agreement, the
      subjects who have not had the hantavax vaccination history at the time of screening.
      Investigator product was administrated 0, 1, 2, 13 months.

      For antibody test, Sampling was conducted pre-dose(T0), 28 days after the 2nd
      vaccination(before the 3rd vaccination, T1), 28 days after the 3rd vaccination(T2) and 11
      months after the 3rd vaccination(before booster vaccination, T3), 28 days after the booster
      vaccination(T4), 2 months after the booster vaccination(T5) and 4 months after the booster
      vaccination(T6). Also, after the completion of booster vaccination for antibody retention
      duration observed for subjects with antibody to conduct a five-year follow-up survey was
      conducted, and the antibody test every year. In conclusion, sampling was conducted 12
      months(T7), 24 months(T8), 36months(T9), 48 months(T10), 60 months(T11) after the booster
      vaccination.

      However, follow-up survey was terminated when the antibody titer was determined as a negative
      by neutralizing antibody test and fluorescent antibody technique.
