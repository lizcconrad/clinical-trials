    <textblock>
      The ECHO Study is an open-label randomized clinical trial that will compare three highly
      effective, reversible methods of contraception (including a non-hormonal method) to evaluate
      whether there is a link between use of any of these methods and increased risk of acquiring
      HIV infection. A randomized clinical trial among about 7,800 women in four countries, ECHO
      will deliver evidence to support and guide individual, policy and programmatic decisions on
      contraception for women at risk of acquiring HIV infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 7800 sexually active, HIV-negative women, 16-35 years old, seeking effective
      contraception, willing to be randomized to any of the study arms, and not desiring pregnancy
      for the duration of study participation will be randomly allocated to one of three study arms
      in a 1:1:1 ratio: depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), levonorgestrel (LNG) implant,
      copper intrauterine device (IUD).

      Enrollment will require an estimated 18 months and the total duration of the clinical portion
      of the study is estimated to be 36 months.

      The primary objective is to compare the risks of HIV acquisition between women randomized to
      DMPA, levonorgestrel (LNG) implant, and copper IUDs. Secondary objectives are to compare: 1)
      pregnancy rates among women randomized to DMPA, LNG implant, and copper IUDs, 2) rates of
      serious adverse events among women randomized to DMPA, LNG implant, and copper IUDs, 3) rates
      of adverse events that lead to method discontinuation among women randomized to DMPA, LNG
      implant, and copper IUDs, and 4) contraceptive method continuation rates among women
      randomized to DMPA, LNG implant, and copper IUDs. Tertiary objectives are to evaluate: 1)
      whether age modifies the relationship between the three contraceptive methods and HIV
      acquisition, 2) whether HSV-2 status modifies the relationship between the three
      contraceptive methods and HIV acquisition, and 3) early HIV disease progression among
      sero-converters randomized to DMPA, LNG implant, and copper IUDs.
