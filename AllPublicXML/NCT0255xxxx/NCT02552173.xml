    <textblock>
      Investigators prospectively evaluate the accuracy of intraoperative stem anteversion in
      40consecutive total hip arthroplasties.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In all hips, investigators measure femoral stem anteversion postoperatively with
      three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction of the femur, using both the distal
      femoral epicondyles and the posterior femoral condyles to determine the femoral diaphyseal
      plane. And investigators compare the surgeon's estimate of intraoperative stem version and
      stem version of CT scan.

        Between October 2015 and December 2015, 40 consecutive patients who underwent primary
        cementless total hip arthroplasty agreed to undergo a postoperative computed tomography
        scan.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators recruited 40 consecutive patients who underwent THR between October 2015
             and December 2015

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who could not extend the hip because of a residual flexion contracture.

        who had a flexion contracture of the knee or who could not flex the hip to 90Â° even after
        THR were excluded because participants could not adopt the posture required for the
        particular radiographs and CT scans.
