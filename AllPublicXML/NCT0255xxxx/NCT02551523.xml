  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Long term toxicity of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is a substantial contributor
      to morbidity and mortality in chronically infected HIV positive individuals. To date it is
      still debated, whether long term nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI's)
      -sparing regimens are practicable or even superior compared to standard of care cART in terms
      of efficacy, safety and tolerability. In addition, data about efficacy of integrase inhibitor
      (INSTI) based monotherapy is lacking. We aim at investigating the efficacy of standard of
      care combination antiretroviral therapy with a simplified dolutegravir monotherapy in
      patients with a primary HIV-1 infection under suppressive early standard of care
      antiretroviral therapy. Briefly, hundred-thirty-eight patients with a documented primary
      HIV1- infection (PHI) will be recruited from the Zurich Primary HIV-1 Infection Study (ZHPI),
      which is an open label, non-randomized, observational, single-center study
      (http://clinicaltrials.gov, ID 5 NCT00537966). All subjects formerly underwent early cART
      consisting of either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor (NNRTI) or a INSTI in combination with two NRTIs at the time point of enrolment in
      the ZPHI and must be under a fully suppressive ART (i.e., &lt;50 copies/ml) for at least 48
      weeks at the time point of randomisation. The primary end point is the proportion of
      individuals with a viral failure at week 48 or before.
