  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this translational research study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of
      balance recovery training as an on-site fall prevention exercise intervention for older
      adults living in retirement communities. Falls are the leading cause of injuries and
      injury-related deaths among older adults over the age of 65 in the United States. While it is
      generally accepted that exercise helps prevent falls, exercise does not always reduce the
      number of falls, and it remains unclear which types of exercise are most effective at
      preventing falls. Balance recovery training (BRT) is a novel exercise intervention that has
      that has the potential to decrease the number of falls among older adults by improving their
      balance recovery ability after common balance perturbations such as tripping. BRT involves
      repeatedly exposing individuals to postural perturbations in a safe, controlled setting that
      allows reactive balance recovery to be practiced and improved. The investigators will
      administer BRT on-site at continuing care retirement communities over four weeks to older
      adult fallers and determine its effects on balance recovery ability over the following six
      months compared to another group of older adult fallers performing Tai Chi as an alternative
      exercise intervention. To further address the potential for BRT to be translated into typical
      practice within retirement communities, the investigators will also collect data on
      facilitators and barriers to the long-term sustainability of BRT in retirement communities
      using qualitative methods. These quantitative (balance recovery ability) and qualitative
      (implementation process) measures will provide the basis for a subsequent large practical
      clinical trial to test the effectiveness of BRT on reducing the number of falls among older
      adults.
