    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) activities ,safety and
      tolerability of rhRIG vs. HRIG in combination with rabies vaccine for human use (Vero cells)
      in healthy adult subjects.The study has 7 groups.Subjects will receive rhRIG（20 IU/kg）only,
      rhRIG（40 IU/kg）only,HRIG（20 IU/kg）only, rhRIG（20 IU/kg）in combination with rabies vaccine for
      human use, rhRIG（40 IU/kg）in combination with rabies vaccine for human use,HRIG（20 IU/kg）in
      combination with rabies vaccine for human use,and placebo in combination with rabies vaccine
      for human use,respectively.
