  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended Part
      2 dose, safety and efficacy of MLN1117 (TAK-117) in combination with docetaxel, paclitaxel,
      investigational TAK-659 or investigational alisertib in adult participants with advanced and
      metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. The study consists of a dose
      escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose expansion phase (Part 2).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the dose-limiting toxicity and response to treatment in participants
      who take MLN1117 in combination with TAK-659, paclitaxel or docetaxel or investigational
      TAK-659 or investigational alisertib.

      The study will enroll approximately 60 participants in the dose escalation phase (Part 1) and
      118 participants in the dose expansion phase (Part 2). Participants will be randomly assigned
      to 1 of the 4 treatment groups:

        -  MLN1117 + TAK-659

        -  MLN1117 + alisertib

        -  MLN1117 + paclitaxel

        -  MLN1117 + docetaxel

      In Part 1, dose of MLN1117 will be increased step by step. All participants will be asked to
      take tablets of MLN1117 for 3 days on and 4 days off per week in 28-day treatment cycles or
      21-day treatment cycles when given in combination with the other companion drugs.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide.

    <time_frame>From first dose up to 30 days after last dose</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. As per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE), Grade 3 = AE with severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living. Grade 4 = AE with life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated and Grade 5 = Death related to AE.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or congenital anomaly; or a medically important event. TEAE is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

                  required is 180 days), or for as long as mandated by local labeling for docetaxel
                  and paclitaxel, OR
