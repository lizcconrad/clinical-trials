    <textblock>
      To expand knowledge on the application and tolerability of immunotherapy with LAIS® 2-tree
      allergoid tablets as well as knowledge on the alleviation of symptoms during sublingual
      therapy in special consideration of the chosen titration schedule in everyday practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until now, results from controlled studies with their specific requirements (patient
      selection, defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, close patient management and monitoring,
      randomisation) are available for LAIS® 2-tree allergoid tablets only for a small patient
      population. In addition, an open-label, controlled study and an observational study have been
      carried out investigating the clinical efficacy and tolerability of the preparation. Owing to
      the differences in the study designs, the allergen dose administered and the frequency with
      which the preparation was applied varied among the individual studies, making it necessary to
      gather further data on the safety and tolerability of the preparation in a larger patient
      population.

      The observation schedule of this NIS (NIS in accordance with Article 67 Paragraph 6 of the
      German Medicinal Products Act (AMG)), which takes into account the recommendations made by
      the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and by the Paul Ehrlich
      Institute for planning, implementing and evaluating an NIS, is geared to the routine
      procedure carried out for patients with allergies to tree pollen.

      The aim of this observational study is to observe and document the tolerability and
      improvement of symptoms after treatment with LAIS® 2-tree allergoid tablets under normal
      application conditions and in consideration of the chosen titration schedule in therapeutic
      practice - in accordance with the patient information leaflet - in a large patient
      population:

        -  Retrospective survey of rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms induced by tree pollen

        -  Overall symptomatology

        -  Documentation of restrictions caused by allergy/asthma

        -  Tolerability of the treatment by means of AE documentation

        -  Patient compliance

      Additional requirements extending beyond the specifications listed in the patient information
      leaflet on product use, patient groups, dosage, contraindications, etc., will not be made.
