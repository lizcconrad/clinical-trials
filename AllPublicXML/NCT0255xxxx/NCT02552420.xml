    <description>① Different levels of pseudocode (white, red, pink, yellow, green, blue, black) representing related IRTI that corresponds to a color scale bar of low to high temperatures, so we can know disease's position, extent and severity by comparing with the difference of color distribution and shape in the thermal imaging.
②The intensity of thermal distribution is higher than normals (great than or equal 0.5 Celsius degree is unnoraml), the symmetry of thermal range is relatively increased (pixels over 0.5 ~ 1.0-fold), the difference of spatial distribution of the thermal field and the difference of statistically analyze are related to the disease.</description>

        DVT patients included in this study had been definitively diagnosed as having DVT with CPUS
        and/or angiography. Included non-DVT volunteers were confirmed to be without DVT with CPUS.
        The healthy volunteer group matched the DVT group in number, age, and gender.
