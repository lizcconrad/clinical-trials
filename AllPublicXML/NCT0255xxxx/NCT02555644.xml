  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the safety of prexasertib in combination
      with other anti-cancer drugs (cisplatin or cetuximab) and radiation therapy in participants
      with locally advanced head and neck cancer. The study has two parts (A and B). Participants
      will only enroll in one part.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of Parts A and B of this study is to determine a recommended dose level
      of prexasertib (an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1[Chk-1]) in combination with cisplatin and
      radiation therapy (Part A) or cetuximab and radiation therapy (Part B) in participants with
      locally advanced head and neck cancer.
