  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 comparative study to assess the safety, tolerability, and
      efficacy of nal-IRI in combination with other anticancer therapies, compared to
      nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine, in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have
      not received prior chemotherapy. This study will assess the following regimens:

        -  nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin

        -  nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV

        -  nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine

      The study will be conducted in two parts:

        1. Part 1: a safety run-in (initial dose exploration followed by dose expansion) of the
           nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin regimen, and

        2. Part 2: a randomized, efficacy study of nal-IRI + 5-FU/LV + oxaliplatin, and nal-IRI +
           5-FU/LV, versus nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.
