  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NP202 is an experimental drug being developed by Armaron Bio Pty Ltd for potential use as a
      treatment for people after they have had a heart attack (MI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After someone has a MI, their heart 'remodels', which means that it changes in size and
      shape. This damage can lead to it being weaker and less efficient, and ultimately to major
      heart problems. There are some drugs currently available which help prevent remodelling and
      are used for treatment post-MI. However, there is still a high rate of remodelling and major
      heart problems in people post-MI. NP202 works in a different way to the drugs that are
      currently approved, and has been shown in animal studies to prevent post-MI remodelling.

      This study will assess NP202 versus placebo on remodelling over a 3 month treatment period,
      with 1 month follow up
