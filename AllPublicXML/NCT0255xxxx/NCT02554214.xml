  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, descriptive, mono-center, non-comparative study. A sample of 30
      patients who satisfy entry criteria is estimated to be appropriate to provide safety and
      performance data for this study.

      The objectives of the study are to verify the performance and safety of the Glafkos
      adjustable glaucoma drainage device system. Performance will be measured assessing the
      possibility to adjust the intra-ocular pressure post-operatively. Safety will be measured by
      the incidence and severity of adverse events.

      The Glafkos device will be implanted in combination with a seton tube. The implant is placed
      under a scleral flap, in a manner analogous to the ex-Press device (Alcon). The distal end of
      the draining tube is linked to a seton draining tube, which is linked to a plate placed under
      the extraocular muscles, creating a filtering space at the orbit (filtering bleb).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be 18 years of age or older.

          2. Patient shall suffer from primary open angle glaucoma, pseudo-exfoliative glaucoma, or
             refractory glaucoma after failed previous filtering surgery, in the study eye.
             Diagnosis is based on glaucomatous optic neuropathy, Shaffer angle greater than 2 as
             seen on gonioscopy, and visual field defect attributed to glaucoma.

          3. Eye to be treated shall be phakic or pseudophakic with no other active ocular disease
             or disorder except for incipiens cataract. Prior ophthalmic surgery in the study eye

             be obtained on 2 consecutive measurements (not taken on the same day) prior to
