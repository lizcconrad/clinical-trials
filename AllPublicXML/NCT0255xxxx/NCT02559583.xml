    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to quantify participants' demographic parameters, country
      standard therapies, treatment patterns and outcomes among participants with chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in
      oncology concentration hospitals in Latin America.

      This is a retrospective (take a look back at events that already have taken place),
      non-interventional, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) study to review medical records of adult participants with a
      diagnosis of CLL, MM or NHL anytime since 01 January 2006. Only data available from clinical
      practice will be collected. All eligible participants at participating centers will be
      included regardless of participant's demographics, prior or current treatments for disease,
      or clinical outcome. The period of observation will span from 01 January 2006 through
      present, but all eligible participants must be followed for a minimum of 1 year, unless the
      participant died within that first year. Participant demographic parameters, standard
      therapies, treatment patterns and outcomes will be primarily quantified.
