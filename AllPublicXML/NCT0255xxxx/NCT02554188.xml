  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test a Fasting-Mimicking Diet (FMD) for its efficacy on
      improving immune response to flu vaccination in an older adult population (50-75 years of
      age).

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of the fasting-mimicking
      diet (FMD) in an elderly population (50-75 years of age) receiving their annual influenza
      vaccination. The study will include two arms: Control (normal diet) and FMD (2 cycles of
      5-day fasting-mimicking diet within two months). Participants both arms will receive the
      standard influenza vaccine.The primary endpoint is anti-influenza antibody titers measured 4
      weeks after flu vaccination. Secondary endpoints include: (1) body composition changes,
      measured as BMI, waist to hip ratio; (2) physiological changes, measured as blood chemistry
      and motor performance; (3) health outcomes, measured by SF-36 Health survey, dry eye surveys
      and flu incidents within 12 months of vaccination.
