      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the range of motion (ROM), mid-flexion stability
      (gap balance), and implant position (size and angle) for the Scorpio NRG device. Relationship
      between these parameters and clinical outcomes will be evaluated as well as the importance of
      rotational tolerance. It is expected that the Scorpio NRG will have good clinical outcomes
      and perform the same or better than other total knee implants.

          3. Patient who is age 20 or over.

          4. Patient who signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved, study specific
             Informed Patient Consent Form.

          5. Patient who is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient who has a bacterial infectious disease or has a risk high of a bacterial
             infection.

          2. Patient who requires revision surgery.

          3. Patient who is morbidly obese, defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40.

          4. Patient who is or may be pregnant female.

          5. Patient who has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits ability to
