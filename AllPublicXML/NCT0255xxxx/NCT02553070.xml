      Inaccurate perceptions of the severity of an exposure may result in unnecessary visits to the
      Emergency Department or Health Care Facility which can result in crowding of Emergency
      Departments, unnecessary utilization of valuable health care resources, unnecessary
      treatments, and or mistakes / errors resulting in harm to the patient.

      Inaccurate perceptions about the severity of an exposure can result in delays in proper
      evaluation and treatment resulting in harm or in some cases death of the patient.

      Consumers and health professionals are often surprised about the toxicity (or lack of
      toxicity) after exposure to a number of pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical agents. Past
      experience with the survey used in this study has indicated that consumers and health
      professional perform about the same. Most individuals answer less than 50% of questions
      incorrectly.

      Pharmacy students will be asked to participate in a short (5-7 minutes) survey (see below)
      that contains 21-short cases involving an exposure to a pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical
      agent. All cases involve children less than 19 years of age. Participants will be asked to
      indicate their year in pharmacy school (1st or 2nd) and their gender (f/m). The survey will
      be given after a scheduled examination or other classroom activity and will not involve class
      time. Students will be provided a link to an online version of the survey.

      Conclusions will be derived through the analysis of the data. At a later date, all students
      in the class (whether they participated in the survey or not)students will be provided a link
      to video that describes the correct answers to each of the cases and an explanation.
