      In patients with a walnut allergy double blind placebo controlled food challenge with walnut
      will be combined with the intake of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or with placebo to assess the
      impact of PPI on threshold level and on clinical manifestation.

      1. detailed case history, blood sampling and prick testing with different foods will
           performed.

        2. double blind food provocation with with three meals containing either placebo or walnut
           in walnut allergic patients will be performed.

        3. the provocation will be combined with the intake of drug (omeprazole) or placebo
           (mannitol) blinded in capsules.
