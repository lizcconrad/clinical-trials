    <textblock>
      Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) results from a deficiency of a key enzyme in the
      biosynthesis of cortisol, mainly 21-hydroxylase, resulting in its classic form a neonatal
      salt loss syndrome and / or a virilization syndrome in girls. The treatment of the disorder
      in adulthood involves administering steroidal compounds with the aim to substitute the gluco-
      and mineralocorticoid deficit on the one hand, and effectively curb the adrenal hyperplasia
      and adrenal androgen pathway in girls . The terms of glucocorticoid treatment are not clearly
      codified and are based on several steroidal compounds and various protocols. The advantages
      in terms of adrenal suppression and disadvantages - including bone and metabolic - different
      treatments have not been clearly established in the literature. The main objective of this
      study is to compare among adults with HCS in its classical form the impact on hormonal
      parameters adrenal suppression glucocorticoid of 3 types of treatment administered to
      equivalent dose and according to the usual procedures. The secondary objective is to compare
      in the same patients the impact of different drugs and treatments on several metabolic bone
      parameters. The study will include 40 adult patients bearing a HCS in its classical form and
      will include 3 treatment sequences of eight weeks each, during which they will be
      administered sequentially in random order at random and according to the known equivalences
      hydrocortisone, prednisone (CORTANCYL) and dexamethasone (DECTANCYL).

      Randomization will be stratified based on previous DMARDs in the investigation that may be
      different for different patients, knowing that France hydrocortisone and dexamethasone are
      used mainly for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The judging criteria will
      be: i) the criteria of adrenal hormone suppression: plasma levels of testosterone,
      androstenedione, 17 OHP, ACTH and diurnal variations of the 17 OH progesterone salivary ii)
      the criteria of the metabolic impact of glucocorticoids: plasma glucose levels , blood
      lipids, and insulin sensitivity index HOMA-R calculated from glucose and insulin, iii) the
      criteria of bone impact of glucocorticoids: plasma for CTX bone resorption and bone alkaline
      phosphatase P1NP for bone formation iv) the living quality criteria evaluated by the PGWB
      Questionnaire (Psychological General Well-Being). The duration of the study period will be 24
      months.
