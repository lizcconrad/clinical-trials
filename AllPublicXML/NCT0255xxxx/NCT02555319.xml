    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and short-term effectiveness of
      implantation of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve (TPV) for the treatment of congenital heart
      disease with pulmonary valve disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diverse congenital heart diseases involving the pulmonary artery, such as Tetralogy of Fallot
      (TOF) with or without pulmonary atresia, or transposition of the great arteries with
      pulmonary stenosis, require implantation of an artificial conduit between the right ventricle
      and the pulmonary artery(PA). Because these conduits finally degenerate and result in
      pulmonary regurgitation and/or stenosis and progressive right ventricle (RV) dilation and
      eventual failure, patients need repetitive surgery for conduit revision. Transcatheter
      pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) is a less invasive alternative to surgery in patients
      with dysfunctional right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). TPV is a large-diameter (up to 28
      mm) self-expandable stent with a relatively low profile from a nitinol wire backbone with
      valve leaflets made from porcine pericardial tissue. The TPV is indicated for use in patients
      with previous undergone replacement of bioprosthetic valve or conduit due to either pulmonary
      valve atresia, stenosis, regurgitation or a combination of them and present with
      dysfunctional RVOT requiring treatment for severe pulmonary regurgitation and/or RVOT conduit
      obstruction. Consecutive subject data should be collected at discharge, 1, 3, 6 month, and
      1-5 years post TPV implantation.
