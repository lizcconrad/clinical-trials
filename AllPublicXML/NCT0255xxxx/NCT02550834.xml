    <textblock>
      This study investigates if, patients with diagnosed chronic spinal cord injury will benefit
      from an Indoor Curling Exercise program on their control capabilities of trunk movements and
      on their intrinsic motivation for physical activity. Half of participants will receive 8
      training-sessions during 4 weeks, while the other will receive usual care.

    <textblock>
      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a catastrophic event that can be devastating and costly in human
      and social terms. These patients require multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary treatment.
      Physiotherapy is important factor in SCI rehabilitation.

      The objectives of physiotherapists are manifold and include the development of the force of
      healthy muscles, the teaching of transfer techniques, the maintenance of joint motion and of
      the body map, and the reestablishment of sitting balance in order for the patients to regain
      their autonomy.

      Maintaining postural stability when seated is a challenge for people with a SCI as their
      sensory and motor systems in their trunk, lower and upper extremities have been damaged to
      different degrees. To train this postural stability, physiotherapists include many
      interventions. Physical activities in sport therapy are some of them. In addition to usual
      physical activities (basketball, tennis, wheelchair running,…) the investigators propose to
      practice wheelchair Indoors Curling Exercise with wooden Curling Stones.
