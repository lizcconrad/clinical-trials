      Introduction: Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) are characterized by
      inflammation of muscles, tendons, fascia and nerves of upper limbs, shoulder girdle and neck.
      Its incidence is increasing and there is evidence of its association with the pace of work.
      As WMSDs, another major public health problem is back pain, which also negatively influence
      the quality of life of patients. These diseases affect many workers, among them, workers in
      the health area, including surgeons. Studies show that many surgeons are suffering from
      fatigue and musculoskeletal pain after undergoing surgery, especially laparoscopy. Regarding
      the quality of life of doctors, a study indicates that surgeons have commitment of domains
      &quot;Vitality&quot; and &quot;Pain&quot;. For these reasons it is important to develop strategies for prevention
      of occupational risks (WMSDs) in this class of workers.

      Objectives: To evaluate the influence of a Preventive Program (educational and gymnastics)
      for prevention of WMSDs, in the quality of life, in limitation of the work, in intensity and
      frequency of musculoskeletal pain in surgeons of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.
      There will also be evaluated the effects of the program on muscular strength and flexibility
      of medics participating in the Preventive Program.

      Methodology: Randomized clinical trial with a sample of 54 surgeons, divided into two groups:
      A (&quot;Intervention&quot;: will participate in eight meetings consisting of exercise and guidelines
      on care and prevention of WMSDs in activities of daily living, especially those relating work
      activities) and B (&quot;Control&quot;: will receive a manual-brochure - containing information about
      general health). Participants will sign a Letter of Consent.

      Clinical Trial Study with 54 surgeons allocated in two groups: A and B. They received two
      protocols in accordance with the groups they have been allocated.

      Group A: participated in eight meetings supervised by physical education professionals, with
      15 minutes duration, individually administered, twice a week, during the surgeons working
      hours, at times and places combined with them. The meetings were composed of endurance
      exercise, mobility and muscle stretching. They were also given guidance on care and
      prevention of Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in activities fo daily life, especially
      those related to work activities.

      Group B: received a manual (brochure ) containing information on general health care,
      especially designed for this study. With food guide, sleep, physical activity and smoking.

      Were measured the quality of life, muscle force, muscle stretching and pain. The dates were
      collected at the beginning of the procedures, 4 weeks after the protocols and 26 after the
      protocols.
