  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic progressive fatal neurodegenerative disorder. In the
      western world it affects 5-10 persons per 100000. The main brain changes include the loss of
      brain cells in subcortical structures. The symptoms of HD include involuntary movements,
      cognitive deterioration and behavioural disturbances. It has been shown that changes in
      emotion comprehension occur before the onset of the motor symptoms (preHD). This deficit in
      perception of emotions has been primarily investigated by means of facial expressions.
      However, emotions can also be expressed through body language. Here, the investigators
      propose to investigate whether the emotion comprehension deficit in preHD also includes body
      language comprehension.

      The investigators will perform a detailed evaluation of body language comprehension abilities
      in persons that carry the genetic mutation causing HD, but who do not show any movement
      symptoms yet. In addition, the associated changes in brain structure and function will be
      studied. The aim is to perform the study with the same group of participants who participated
      in a recent study carried on by this research group, in which the functional brain changes
      associated with increased irritability were investigated. This will allow to relate emotion
      experience with emotion perception. The results of the study may provide a target to further
      develop therapeutic interventions and aid caregivers of preHD subjects.
