  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the recent approval of Nivolumab for second-line treatment of stage IIIb/IV non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), immune checkpoint inhibitors are entering the standard of care for
      lung cancer. Other immune checkpoint inhibitors are under evaluation, both in resectable and
      non-resectable NSCLC. In order to refine our use of these molecules, comprehensive data on
      the immune contexture of NSCLC are needed. Moreover,a blood marker of this contexture would
      allow physicians to monitor the immune status of their patient's tumor and though to evaluate
      the rightful place of immunotherapy in the multimodal treatment of NSCLC. No such blood
      marker has been validated so far. The LYMPHOLUNG study investigate the concordance between
      blood and intratumoral counts of immune cells in resectable stage I to IIIA NSCLC. By the use
      of 30-marker cytometry, a precise immune profile of NSCLC will be depicted. The prognostic
      value of the circulating and intra-tumoral T regulator over total lymphocytes ratio for
      2-year recurrence-free survival will also be addressed.

             PETscan

          -  Subjects for whom a surgical resection is indicated

          -  Signed written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - previous, ongoing or planned neo-adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
             immunotherapy or radiotherapy)

          -  contraindications to general anesthesia

          -  contraindication to the planned surgical resection

          -  history of immunosuppressive disorder

          -  known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus

          -  subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids or
             other immunosuppressive medications within 30 days of randomization.

          -  clinical suspicion of active infection (either acute or chronic)

          -  severe (hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dL) or symptomatic anemia

          -  women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test

          -  women must not be breastfeeding

          -  prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated

          -  subjects under guardianship
