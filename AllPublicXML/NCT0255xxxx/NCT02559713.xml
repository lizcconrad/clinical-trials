    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the concentration of vedolizumab in breast milk of
      lactating women with active ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) who are receiving
      vedolizumab therapeutically.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. This post-marketing milk-only
      lactation study will assess concentrations of vedolizumab in breast milk of lactating women
      with active UC or CD who are receiving vedolizumab therapeutically.

      The study will enroll approximately 12 participants. All participants who received an
      established vedolizumab maintenance regimen or has completed induction therapy for the
      treatment of active UC or CD.

      30-minute IV infusion of 300 mg vedolizumab. This multi-center trial will be conducted in the
      United States. The overall time to participate in this study is 3 months. Participants will
      make visits to clinic, study site or HCP office at Screening, Check-in (Day -1). Visits on
      Days 4, 8, 15, or 29 may be completed at the participant's home setting in the presence of a
      qualified nurse, or at a clinic, study site or other HCP office. The study exit/follow-up
      safety assessment will occur on Day 57(Â±3).
