    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in a single centre, as an open single dose two parallel cohorts
      design with oral doses of MMV390048 administered in healthy male and female subjects between
      18 to 55 years of age. Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to entering the study.
      On Day 1 of the study each subject will receive one of the two MMV390048 prototype
      formulations, at a dose of 40 mg with 240 mL of water. Subjects will be discharged on Day 3
      after 48h post-dose and they will attend the unit for follow-up visits on Days 5, 7, 10, 14,
      19, 26 and 29.

    <textblock>
      A Phase 1 exploratory study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of selected oral formulations of
      MMV390048 administered in healthy volunteers. It is anticipated that eighteen (18) healthy
      male and female subjects are to be included in the study, however there is an option to
      include an additional cohort of 9 subjects. The optional cohort would receive a single dose
      of the formulation considered to have the least pharmacokinetic variability with a suitable
      safety and tolerability profile with food or milk. Timing of PK samples may be adjusted in
      accordance with evolving data and dosing schedule. Additional or fewer PK samples may be
      taken in accordance with evolving data and dosing schedule to establish full protocol
      specific PK profile. The study specific maximum blood volume taken will not be exceeded.
