  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to further develop an imaging platform for the assessment of
      whole lung neutrophil retention. The primary objective of the study is to quantify and
      compare neutrophil retention in the lungs of lipopolysaccharide-challenged healthy subjects,
      saline-challenged healthy subjects and subjects with stable COPD. There will be two treatment
      groups, one with healthy subjects and the other with subjects with stable COPD. The total
      duration of this study for healthy subjects will be approximately 1 week, in addition to the
      screening window of 28 days. The total duration of this study for subjects with COPD will be
      approximately 1 week for those that complete Visit 1 only, and approximately 2 weeks for
      those subjects with COPD that return to the unit for Visit 2 7-10 days later, in addition to
      the screening window of 28 days.
