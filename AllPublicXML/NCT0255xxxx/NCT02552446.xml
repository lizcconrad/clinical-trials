  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indirect calorimetry is the gold standard to measure energy expenditure. In fact it is not
      always available and inconstantly feasible. Various equations for predicting energy
      expenditure based on body weights have been created. This study aims at determining the best
      suitable predictive strategy unless indirect calorimetry is available.

    <textblock>
      Several clinical studies have shown that energy deficit as well as overfeeding lead to an
      increased risk of complications, especially infections, and increased mortality. The gold
      standard for determining energy expenditure in intensive care patients is indirect
      calorimetry. This method is expensive and requires a trained team for its use. In addition
      the reliability of the measurements depends on the clinical situation and may not be feasible
      (e.g. inspiratory O2 fraction &gt;60%, end expiratory pressure &gt; 9cmH2O, presence of bronchial
      gap, etc.). Moreover, there is no longer on the market valid indirect calorimeter for
      clinical use in mechanically ventilated patients, and the maintenance of the old valid one
      (Deltatrac IIÂ®) becomes increasingly problematic because the lack of spare parts.
      Intensivists have no more choice and use prediction equations for energy expenditure which
      are based on imprecise anthropometric data (height, weight). Especially for obese or
      malnourished patients in the intensive care the body weight represents not a reliable data.
      Similarly, secondary water inflation due to metabolic stress and resuscitation complicates
      the determination of the real body weight. The difficulty is to know which weight to use in
      predictive equations. Due to the paucity in literature on this subject, there is currently no
      consensus on the reference weight to use in the determination of nutritional needs and
      medication doses. So each prescriber calculates the energy target by taking a reference
      weight based on his own convictions. This study is part of a quality process of care and
      practices harmonization, aiming to identify the reference weight to be used and the best
      suited predictive equation, to predict energy expenditure for patients who cannot benefit
      from an indirect calorimetry.

    <description>Find the best energy expenditure prediction, by comparing results from an indirect calorimetry measurement using the Deltatrac II (considered the reference method), and various predictive equations based on body weight. The ideal body weights (calculated for a body mass index at 22.5 and 25 kg/m2, calculated with the Brocca and Lorentz equations and calculated with the Metropolitan Life Insurance tables), the anamnestic body weight (recorded from the patient/his family members or the electronical medical file), the actual body weight (using a built- in bed scale), and adjusted body weight (determined by correcting the measured body weight according to the cumulative fluid balance) will be recorded and used to calculate various predictive energy expenditure.</description>
