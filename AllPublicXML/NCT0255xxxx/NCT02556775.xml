      The purpose of this registry is to acquire safety data (including assessment of anti-rHuPH20
      antibodies), regarding the course and outcome of pregnancy in women ever treated with HYQVIA.
      Development of the fetus/infant at birth and for the first 2 years will also be followed.

      Blood samples (plasma) for anti-recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) antibodies that
      remain after study testing is done may be stored and used for additional testing (eg, further
      evaluation of an abnormal test or an adverse event). Samples will be stored in a coded form
      for a maximum of 2 years after the final study report has been completed and, subsequently,
      will be destroyed.
