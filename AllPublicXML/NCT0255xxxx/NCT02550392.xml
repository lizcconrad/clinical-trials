  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA), also called 'ministroke' is characterised by shortlasting
      symptoms that generally do not cause permanent damage. 'Minor stroke' is a term used to
      describe a stroke with mild and nondisabling symptoms. TIA and minor stroke patients account
      for more than half of all cases of stroke and they are at a higher risk to suffer a major
      stroke. Currently, management of TIA/minor stroke patients is mainly focused on identifying
      and reducing risk factors for a later stroke. However, people after a TIA often have limited
      access for further specialist support from stroke-specific rehabilitation services. Although
      there is variability in the level of recovery and severity of symptoms after TIA and minor
      stroke, there is evidence that these patients may experience difficulties that affect their
      quality of life including anxiety and depression.

      This study aims to develop, tailor and target the delivery of a time-limited group
      intervention that offers educational, psychological and social support for people following
      TIA and minor stroke. A qualitative study (Phase 1) will be conducted with service users and
      experts working with people with TIA/minor stroke to develop the psychoeducational
      intervention. Following this, we will conduct a feasibility randomised controlled trial in
      one centre (Phase 2) to explore whether this group psychoeducational intervention for people
      after TIA and minor stroke carers is acceptable and to determine the feasibility of the
      proposed evaluation and the sample size needed in a definite trial.

      Participants will complete measures at baseline and then randomly allocated to receive the
      intervention or usual care. The intervention group will receive a group psychoeducational
      intervention (designed in Phase 1: Qualitative study) in addition to self-help leaflets and
      usual care. It is anticipated that the intervention will be offered in 6 two-hour sessions
      over 3 months by an assistant psychologist. The control group will receive usual care plus
      self-help leaflets on relevant topics. All participants will complete outcome measures at 3
      and 6 months after randomisation. We will test the feasibility, tolerability and
      acceptability of delivering the intervention and will record data on study completion and
      attrition. Findings will inform the development of a larger trial and will determine if the
      content and delivery of the intervention meets the needs of people after TIA and minor
      stroke.
