    <textblock>
      Background: Metronomic oral Vinorelbine has efficacy in metastatic NSCLC and malignant
      Pleural Mesothelioma, but all the studies published thus far were based upon a variety of
      empirical and possibly suboptimal schedules, with inconsistent results. Mathematical modeling
      showed by simulation that a new metronomic protocol could lead to a better safety and
      efficacy profile.

      Design: This phase Ia/Ib trial was designed to confirm safety (phase Ia) and evaluate
      efficacy (phase Ib) of a new metronomic oral vinorelbine schedule. Patient with metastatic
      NSCLC or malignant Pleural Mesothelioma, after failure of standard treatments, ECOG 0-2 and
      an adequate organ functions, will be eligible. Our mathematical PK-PD model suggested an
      alternative weekly D1, D2 and D4 innovative schedule (named Vinorelbine Theoretical Protocol)
      with a dynamic intake of 60, 30 and 60 mg, respectively. Trial recruitment is two-staged as
      12 patients are planned to participate in the phase Ia, to confirm safety and consolidate the
      calibration of the average parameters of the model. Depending the phase Ia result, and after
      favorable decision of a consultative committee, the extension phase (phase Ib) will be an
      efficacy study and will include a number of 20 patients receiving the Optimal Vinorelbine
      Theoretical Protocol. The primary endpoint is the tolerance (assessed by CTC v4.0) for the
      phase Ia and the objective response according to RECIST 1.1 for the phase Ib.

      An ancillary study on circulating angiogenesis biomarkers will be a subproject of the trial.

      Discussion: this ongoing trial is the first to prospectively test a mathematical optimized
      schedule in metronomic chemotherapy. As such, this trial can be considered as a
      proof-of-concept study demonstrating the feasibility to run a computational-driven protocol
      to ensure an optimal efficacy/toxicity balance in patients with cancer.
