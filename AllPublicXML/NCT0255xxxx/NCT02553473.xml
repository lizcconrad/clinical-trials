      Comparison of Doxycycline 200 mg once daily for six weeks versus Doxycycline 200 mg once
      daily for two weeks + placebo for four weeks. Primary objective is to answer the question &quot;is
      two weeks doxycycline treatment (currently suggested treatment) at least as effective as six
      weeks doxycycline treatment in Lyme Neuroborreliosis?&quot;.Key secondary objectives are to
      provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis and long‐term complaints, and to search
      for new biomarkers in Lyme Neuroborreliosis (LNB) by collecting clinical data, blood, and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a biobank for future research

      Endpoints:

      Primary endpoint: Improvement on a composite clinical score from inclusion to six months
      after ended treatment defined as clinical score at inclusion minus clinical score at six
      months.

      Secondary endpoints: Improvment on a composite clinical score 12 months after ended
      treatment. Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS),Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15), Short Form 36
      (SF-36) and blood and CSF findings at inclusion, after 6 and 12 months.

      The study design is a multicenter, non-inferiority, randomized, penta-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. 120 patients will be included from Sørlandet Hospital and 5-10
      other Norwegian hospitals.

      Main inclusion criteria are neurological symptoms suggestive of LNB without other obvious
      reasons, one or both of a) Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (&gt;5 leukocytes/mm3) b) intrathecal
      Bb antibody Production and signed informed consent. Safety assessments during the trial:
      Comparison of clinical outcome six months after end of treatment between the two treatment
      groups. Subjective experiences and blood tests including hematology and biochemistry for four
      weeks after ended treatment.
