  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle alterations and modifications passive biomechanical properties that occur on a spastic
      muscle contribute to functional disorders involved in spasticity. Botulinum toxin (TB) A is
      the reference treatment of the focused spasticity, and muscle source structural and
      biomechanical changes, very little studied in humans, especially since it is not one
      possibility of easily and reliably paraclinical assessment injections consequences.
