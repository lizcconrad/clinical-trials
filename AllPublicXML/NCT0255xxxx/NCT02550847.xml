  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate MR/PET with both functional and molecular imaging on
      the prediction of prognosis in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The results of MR/PET will be compared prospectively to dedicated MDCT or MR imaging,
      pathologic results, and clinical outcomes to assess the value of MR/PET in pancreatic
      cancers.
