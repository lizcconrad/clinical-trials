  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal to treat early NLUTS is to relieve lower urinary tract syndrome and prevent
      from late complications. The present study is to evaluate the efficacy of electrical pudendal
      nerve stimulation (EPNS) and transanal/transvaginal electrical stimulation (TES) in NLUTD.The
      study design consists of a non-randomized, parallel controlled trial. A total of 60 eligible
      patients will be involved and divided into EPNS or TES group according to their location of
      medical treatment. The primary endpoint is lower urinary tract syndromes (ICIQ-FLUTS/MLUTS).
      The second endpoint is assessment of daily life Qol (ICIQ-LUTSqol), and residual urine
      volume.

    <description>Four sacral points are selected. The two upper points are located about 1 cm bilateral to the sacrococcygeal joint. Needles of 0.40 Х 100 mm are inserted perpendicularly to the upper points to a depth of 80 to 90 mm to produce a sensation referred to the urethra or the anus. The two lower points are about 1 cm bilateral to the tip of the coccyx. Needles of 0.40 Х 100 or 125 mm are inserted obliquely to the lower points towards the ischiorectal fossa to a depth of 90 to 110 mm to produce a sensation referred to the urethra. After the sensation referred to the above regions is produced, each of two pairs of electrodes from a G6805-2 Multi-Purpose Health Device is connected with the two ipsilaterally needles.</description>
