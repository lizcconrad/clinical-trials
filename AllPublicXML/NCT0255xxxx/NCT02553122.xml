      Total knee arthroplasty is a surgical procedure that involves a significant amount of blood
      loss and it has always been the surgeons' goal to try to minimize blood loss. In the current
      study, we will investigate the effect of blood loss after total knee arthroplasty with the
      combination of Evicel, a fibrin sealant and Tranexamic Acid.

      Introduction and Background: Total knee arthroplasty is characterized by a large amount of
      postoperative blood loss and frequent need for blood transfusions.1 Also of concern is the
      risk of hematomas which can potentially lead to infection or wound complications and delay
      the overall rehabilitation process.2 By reducing postoperative bleeding, the outcomes of
      total knee arthroplasty would be improved by better range of motion, less frequency of blood
      transfusion and decreased incidence of arthrofibrosis.3 Several studies have looked at
      different blood conservation strategies including reinfusion of drains, tourniquets,
      autologous blood transfusions, topical and intravenous antifibrinolytic alone, topical fibrin
      sealant alone, and monopolar and bipolar electrocautery. The combined use of a topical fibrin
      sealant (Evicel®) with an antifibrinolytic (Tranexamic acid) represents another approach to
      reducing blood loss in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Evicel® is a fibrin
      sealant consisting of human-derived thrombin and fibrinogen that work in combination to form
      a stable blood clot at the bleeding site. Evicel® is regularly used in orthopaedic and other
      sub-specialty surgeries. One investigation has reported on the use of a topical hemostatic
      agent in total knee arthroplasty.4 It compared the use of a fibrin sealant for hemostasis
      with standard hemostasis protocols and found that the topical hemostatic agent decreased post
      operative blood loss, increased post operative hemoglobin levels, and resulted in a decrease
      in the need for post operative blood transfusion. Tranexamic Acid is given topically or
      intravenously to occlude the fibrin cleavage sites on plasminogen and inhibit the breakdown
      of fibrin clots. Tranexamic acid is also regularly used in orthopaedic and other
      sub-specialty surgeries. Studies have found that intravenous dosing of tranexamic acid prior
      to incision, and again after tourniquet release reduces the need for the blood transfusion
      versus standard hemostasis.5, 6

      Research Questions/Objectives: Does the combination use of a fibrin sealant and an
      antifibrinolytic in our institutional total knee arthroplasty protocol decrease postoperative
      drain output/hematocrit drop/hemoglobin drop or the need for post operative blood
      transfusions compared to standard hemostasis technique? Secondary objectives will be
      measuring differences in postoperative pain, postoperative range of motion, and rates of
      postoperative complications including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and wound
      complications requiring a return to the operating room between treatment and control groups.

      Study Design: The null hypothesis states that the combined use of a topical fibrin sealant
      and an antifibrinolytic in total knee arthroplasty will show no difference in the amount of
      postoperative blood loss compared to the standard means of hemostasis (tourniquet and
      electrocauterization). The study will be a prospective randomized trial with patients that
      are undergoing elective primary, unilateral, cemented total knee arthroplasty. Patients will
      be randomly divided into two groups. A control group, in which the standard means of
      hemostasis will be applied and a treatment group, in which the standard means of hemostasis
      will be applied with the additional use of Evicel® (a fibrin sealant) and Tranexamic acid (an
      antifibrinolytic). All operations will be standardized between four surgeons.

      Subjects: The target population is patients seen in the outpatient office who are indicated
      for primary total knee arthroplasty. Patients will be asked if they would like to participate
      in the study; only patients capable of consenting to surgery will be enrolled. Patients
      undergoing total knee arthroplasty revisions and patients with blood disorders, on chronic
      anti-thrombotic medication such as Coumadin and any patients with a history of deep vein
      thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism will be excluded. Despite that Evicel® contains
      human-derived blood products, Jehovah's Witnesses will not be excluded and these patients
      will be given an opportunity whether they would like to participate or not. As tranexamic
      acid is renally cleared, renally impaired individuals will be excluded.

      Study Procedures: All participating surgeons will adhere to the same protocol. Upon enrolling
      in the study, patient demographics including age, gender, height, weight will be recorded and
      stored in an encrypted, protected database. Eligible / consenting patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either treatment or non-treatment. The randomization will be
      stratified by surgeon to ensure balanced assignment of treatment / non-treatment in each of
      participating surgeons. Randomization schemes will be generated and maintained by Dr. David
      Leibelt, the study statistician. Dr. Leibelt will provide Mr. Bharat Tiwari with a set of
      randomization envelopes to be stored and used in the study clinic. Mr. Tiwari will assign
      these envelopes in sequential order, by envelope number and surgeon, to eligible /consenting
      patients. . During the process, Dr. Jason Wong and Mr. Andrew Schwartz will be blinded and
      will have no access to the randomization assignment. Preoperative blood work including
      hematocrit and hemoglobin will be performed, a standard for patients undergoing joint
      arthroplasty. On the day of surgery, the patients will be seen in the preoperative holding
      area, and again be asked if they consent to take part in the study. Total knee arthroplasty
      will then be performed with a standard medial parapatellar approach using a 350 mm Hg
      pneumatic tourniquet on the operative leg. All surgeons will use Zimmer implants. After
      patient is put to sleep, attending surgeon will inform the operating team that whether the
      patient is randomized into the treatment or control group. If the patient is part of the
      treatment group, they will receive a 10 mg/kg dose of tranexamic acid prior to tourniquet
      inflation. After removal of trial implants and irrigation/thorough drying, 2 mL of Evicel®
      will be sprayed (under 15-25 psi of CO2) into the posterior joint capsule (via the gap
      between femur and tibia). Once the implants are in place and the methylmethacrylate cement is
      cured, the joints will be irrigated copiously and dried thoroughly for the final time. 2 mL
      of Evicel® will be dripped into pinholes, another 2 mL of Evicel® will be dripped along the
      exposed edges of bony tissue, and an additional 2 mL of Evicel® will be sprayed on all
      remaining soft tissue. After 2 minutes, the tourniquet will be released and a second dose of
      10 mg/kg tranexamic acid will be given as electrocautery is being performed. After joint
      capsule closure, a final 2 mL of Evicel® will be sprayed along the arthrotomy incision and on
      subcutaneous soft tissue. On top of the treatment protocol mentioned above, patient will also
      receive the standard tourniquet protocol and electrocautery. If the patient is in the control
      group, the standard tourniquet protocol and electrocautery alone will be used for hemostasis.
      In both groups, an auto transfusion drain will then be placed within the deep layer of the
      knee. The joint will then be closed and dressed in standard fashion. The patient will then be
      taken to the postoperative anesthesia care unit. Immediate postoperative hemoglobin and
      hematocrit levels will be recorded, a standard practice at our institution. The drain output
      will be recorded over a 24-hour period. As is standard, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will
      be recorded for the three days postoperatively. Any transfusions and/or complications
      (pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and wound complications requiring a return to the
      operating room) and length of stay will be monitored (according to standard protocol) and
      recorded. Pain scores utilizing the WOMAC, SF-36, and VAS scales will be recorded during
      postoperative follow up in the clinic. Range of motion will be compared to preoperative
      values at two and six weeks postoperatively.

      Safety outcomes to be monitored

      Potential complications associated with the study such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein
      thrombosis, and wound complications that require a return to the operating room will be
      monitored by the surgical team.

      Risks and Benefits

      Potential benefits include decreased perioperative blood loss, which would sequentially
      decrease the chance of blood transfusion (lower costs, fewer infections and errors, and less
      frequent seroconversion) and decreased pain secondary to joint hematoma. This study also aims
      to eliminate the need for post-operative drain usage (lower cost, fewer infections, fewer
      drain complications and less time in the operating room).

      Evicel consists of human-derived thrombin and fibrinogen. Patients with known allergies to
      human blood products should not participate in this study. Also, the human-derived blood
      products carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents such as viruses and theoretically,
      the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. This risk is theoretically equal to the risk of a
      blood transfusion; however, there have been NO known incidents of infectious agent being
      transmitted from the use of Evicel. Evicel is FDA approved and routinely used in orthopaedic
      surgery.

      Tranexamic acid is a pro-coagulant molecule that should not be used in patients with a past
      medical history of intravascular clotting. Dosing of tranexamic acid should be reduced in a
      renally impaired patient. The compound also should be avoided in those with known allergies
      to tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid is FDA approved and routinely used in a variety of
      surgeries, including orthopaedics

      Data Safety Monitoring Plan

      A data safety monitoring board consists of an independent physician, Dr. Tony Wanich, Mr.
      Bharat Tiwari and Dr.Yungtai Lo. At the 50 and 100 patient mark, the board will decide based
      on the following criteria and decide on whether or not the study should be continued:

        1. whether or not the complications rates (includes deep vein thrombosis, cerebrovascular
           accidents) between the treatment group and the control group is significantly different

        2. whether or not the transfusion rates between the treatment group and control group is
           significantly different

        3. whether or not the drain output between the treatment group and the control group is
           significant different If any of the above criteria is met, the board will inform the
           principle investigator and decide on whether or not the study should be terminated
           early.

      Data Management and Analysis:

      Measures: The primary outcome measured will be 24-hour drain output that will be measured
      from the time it is introduced. Secondary measures will be the serum hemoglobin and
      hematocrit levels measured approximately 2 weeks prior to surgery and each of the first three
      days after surgery. Transfusions throughout the duration of stay and the length of hospital
      stay will also be recorded. Scores obtained from 3 pain scales will be recorded: WOMAC
      (Pre-op and Post-op at 6 months), SF-36 (Pre-op and Post-op at 6 months), and VAS (Pre-op,
      Post-op day # 1, 2, 3, Post-op visit #1 and 2). Range of motion at two and six weeks
      postoperatively will be compared to the preoperative range. All measurements will be recorded
      in an encrypted and protected database.

      Statistical Analysis: The primary (drain output) and secondary (hemoglobin/hematocrit)
      outcomes are continuous variables. Values for the intervention (Evicel®/Tranexamic acid) and
      the standard of care control groups will be compared with the Mann-Whitney test. Results for
      individual day measures and the summary measures (total drainage and average
      hemoglobin/hematocrit) will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons. However, if any
      statistically significant results from different days of the same measure and the composite
      measure are not consistent, the possibility of type I error will be emphasized. We will
      assume the data will not be normally distributed and therefore a non-parametric test, Mann
      Whitney test, will be performed. We expect our randomization to result in balanced study
      groups in regards to characteristics like age, sex, race, and BMI. Therefore stratified
      randomization is unnecessary. However, if the two study arms are not reasonably balanced,
      additional analyses using linear regression adjusting for any unbalanced variables will be
      performed. Intention to treat analyses will be performed. Statistical analyses will be
      completed by Dr. Jason Wong and medical student, Andrew Schwartz. Both Dr. Wong and Mr.
      Schwartz will be blinded about the randomization.

      Sample Size: Based on previous studies looking at similar outcomes and using a conservative
      estimate for true difference of means of drain output, we need 50 patients per group for 90%
      power and 150 patients per group for 97% power to detect a difference in 24 hour drain
      output.

      Implementation Plan/Timetable: Patients will be seen in the office and, if indicated for
      total knee arthroplasty, we will request consent for the study. The attending surgeons will
      answer any question at that time. A physician assistant who is blinded will collect data
      daily. An average of 15-20 total knee arthroplasties are done each week. The data collection
      will likely take 3-6 months. The data collected will be kept on an encrypted and protected
      database accessible only to the physicians caring for the patients enrolled in the study.
