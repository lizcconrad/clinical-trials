    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effect of early palliative care
      consultation on quality of life, use of hospital resources, end-of-life care and survival
      among Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients with advanced End Stage Live Disease not
      eligible for potentially curative or local area therapy. Half of patients will receive early
      palliative care at diagnosis of HCC and other half will receive palliative care when all
      standard therapy treatments have been exhausted.

      Intro:

      Hypothesis Methods Analysis Anticipated Results

      Palliative care will focus on providing relief from the symptoms and stress associated from
      cancer. This helps improve quality of life for cancer patients and their family. This care is
      usually offered to patients when all standard therapy treatments have been exhausted.

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the change in the patient's primary need based upon HRQoL survey. These scores range from 0-100 for the role functioning scale, physical function scale and the other QLQ-C30 scales and HCC18 symptom complexes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Resource Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years after diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will determine if the intervention decreases resource utilization (ICU days and length of stay). The unit of measure will be days.</description>

    <measure>Cost Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years after diagnosis</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will determine if the intervention decreases cost between groups. To do this, the investigators will track cost per group from time of study enrollment to either death, withdrawal or study completion. Cost will be estimated in US dollars.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo palliative care services at time of Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis.
Palliative care and symptom control services are adapted from the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care.
Early referral, patients meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled and referred to palliative care within 3 weeks of the index consultation with Medical-Oncology, Surgical-Oncology or Gastroenterology.

Symptom Assessment and Control
Pain-treatment with opioid and non-opioid medications

Nutrition-appetite stimulated with Megace, review low sodium diet
Ascites/edema- optimize ascites management with Lasix or Aldactone. In refractory cases intermittent paracentesis can be performed
Nausea- treated with anti-emetics
Jaundice and Body Image- counselling regarding symptoms
End-of-Life Care
Discuss religious preferences
