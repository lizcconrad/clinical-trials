  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To see if it is possible to use short-duration tacrolimus after a peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant in certain malignancies that are considered difficult to engraft.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal is to learn whether a drug called tacrolimus, which is an immune-lowering drug
      (an immunosuppressant) given after transplant to help prevent certain complications, can be
      given safely for a shorter period of time than it has been in the past. The experiences with
      immunosuppression duration with other allogeneic HSCT platforms cannot be directly
      extrapolated to the high-dose posttransplantation cyclophosphamide platform (another type of
      immunosuppressant given after transplant to help prevent GVHD). There are presently no
      published data on the minimum required duration of tacrolimus after nonmyeloablative HSCT
      that includes high-dose Cy as part of postgrafting immunosuppression. The effectiveness of
      high-dose posttransplantation Cy in GVHD prevention, however, permits the investigation of
      this question. At the present time there are few or no cures for diseases studied on this
      trial outside of a bone marrow or peripheral blood transplant. The peripheral blood for this
      transplant comes from a relative who is a half-match or &quot;haplo&quot; match to the participant.
      Possible donors include parents, siblings, and children. In order to help the bone marrow
      grow, or &quot;take&quot;, inside the body, participants will receive chemotherapy and radiation before
      the transplant. After the transplant participants will receive high doses of cyclophosphamide
      (CytoxanÂ®) along with other medications to lower the immune system, such as tacrolimus. These
      medications may lower the risk of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and of rejection of the
      peripheral blood graft.
