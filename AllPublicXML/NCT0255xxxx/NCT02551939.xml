    <textblock>
      A total of 38 Chinese healthy women underwent autologous fat grafting for cosmetic breast
      augmentation. Breast volumes were measured by magnetic resonance imaging preoperatively and 1
      year after the procedure. Furthermore, BREAST-Q was used to analyze the satisfaction and
      well-being of patients during the preoperative and 1 year post operation.

      Autologous fat was obtained from thighs, waist or abdomen using resonance liposuction
      instrument. Fat was injected into the tissues in a multitunnel and multilayer way until they
      were firm and appeared fully tumesced according to the Coleman method.All MRI volume analyses
      were blindly performed by examiner independently preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively.
      Object marking was done using avanto 1.5T superconducting magnetic resonance scanner.Volume
      analysis was done by counting pixels within the frames of the MRI using ImageChecker CAD
      software.The Chinese version of BREAST-Q augmentation module was obtained from the Memorial
      Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the University of British Columbia. 38 patients were given
      the BREAST-Q questionnaire to express their thoughts preoperatively and 1 year
      postoperatively. Data were calculated using the Q-score program, which converts raw BREAST-Q
      scores of 1 through 4 or 5 to scores of 0 to 100.
