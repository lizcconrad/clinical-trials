    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the global quality of life of foreign born adopted children, one to
      seven years following their arrival in France. Investigators will assess global health,
      behavior, school integration for each child who arrived in France between 2008 and 2013,
      through an online anonymous survey. Investigators, then, will identify variables associated
      with a lower quality of life in order to improve the support offered to the children.

      Investigators will use a known and official quality of life score: the PedsQL®. This score
      has never been used in this population so investigators will first have to test its internal
      validity, so that investigators cannot use it in their global evaluation. The second stage
      will consist of identifying variables associated with a lower quality of life, as previously
      determined. Investigators will send letters to each family through the adoption department of
      each area enrolled in our study, to ensure data. Parents and children will be required to
      login to a safe, anonymous, controlled website in order to input their data. The data will be
      recorded on the internal server of Nantes University Hospital. This study has been accepted
      by both the Computing and Liberties Commission (CNIL) and Nantes University Hospital's Ethics
      group in the field of Health (GNEDS) comities.
