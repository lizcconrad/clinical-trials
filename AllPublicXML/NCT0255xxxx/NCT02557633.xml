  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that the effectiveness of allergy immunotherapy to control
      symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis is related to the cumulative dose of allergen or allergoid
      administered during a single regimen of subcutaneous (SC) injections or of sublingual
      administration.

      Two new cumulative doses of the Grass MATA MPL 10200 and 18200 SU (Standardized Units) are
      being developed to compare with the current dose of 5100 SU. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the tolerability and safety of these two new cumulative dose regimens of Grass MATA
      MPL compared with placebo in patients with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (SAR) due to
      grass pollen, to enable selection of the best dose to go into a larger scale study to assess
      the efficacy and safety of the higher cumulative doses.

      Structure: Single center, parallel group, single-blind, randomized study There will be three
      treatment groups, two groups receiving a different, cumulative dose of Grass MATA MPL and the
      third group receiving placebo only.

      Duration: The duration of the study from screening to final visit after treatment is expected
      to be approximately 7 weeks. There will be a telephone follow up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months
      after treatment.
