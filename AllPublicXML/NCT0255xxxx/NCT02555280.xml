      A 2 and 5 year comparative evaluation of clinical outcomes in the treatment of degenerative
      spinal stenosis with concomitant low back pain by decompression with and without additional
      stabilization using the coflex® Interlaminar Technology for FDA Real Conditions of Use Study.

    <textblock>
      The first objective of this trial is to evaluate 5-year clinical status of patients implanted
      with the coflex® device in conjunction with surgical decompression relative to decompression
      alone. The composite primary endpoint for this objective is in three parts: 1) At least a 15
      point improvement relative to pretreatment baseline in the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI,
      range 0-100); 2) No reoperations, revisions, removals, or supplemental fixation at the index
      level(s); 3) No ≥2 injections or series of injections for the treated level, or nerve block
      procedures performed to treat spinal stenosis for the index level(s) or a single injection
      within 12 months of the 5 year endpoint.

      The second objective of this study is to compare clinical status of patients implanted with
      the coflex® device in conjunction with surgical decompression relative to surgical
      decompression alone at two years post-operatively by confirming clinical non-inferiority in
      terms of Month 24 composite clinical success (CCS) defined similarly to the investigational
      device exemption (IDE) study endpoint.

      Objective 3: If non-inferiority is shown at two-years, to evaluate evidence supporting
      superiority at two-years in terms of Month 24 CCS using the same informative prior
      distribution for the coflex® group.

      Finally, the fourth objective of this trial is to evaluate coflex® device performance in a
      'real conditions of use' study and to confirm that coflex® device performance is not
      clinically inferior in the PAS population compared to the pivotal IDE trial population. The
      same Month 24 composite clinical success (CCS) endpoint used in the IDE trial will be used in
      these analyses to facilitate this comparison.

             dimension compared to the next adjacent normal level, with nerve root crowding
             compared to the normal level, as determined by the investigator on computerized
             tomography (CT) Scan or MRI. The patient may have, but is not required to have for
             inclusion in the study:

             determined on flexion/extension films by the investigator. Patients with up to stable
             Grade I spondylolisthesis at two contiguous levels are excluded, but patients with up
             to Grade I stable spondylolisthesis at the adjacent level may be included.

             least 6 months of prior conservative care without adequate and sustained symptom
             relief.

          6. Age between 40 to 80 years.

          7. Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire score of at least 20/50 (40%).

          3. More than one surgical procedure at any combination of lumbar levels.

          4. Prior fusion, implantation of a total disc replacement, complete laminectomy, or

             or past trauma or tumor (e.g., compression fracture).

             (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) bone mineral density measurement. If DEXA is
             required*, exclusion will be defined as a DEXA bone density measured T score of ≤ -1.0
