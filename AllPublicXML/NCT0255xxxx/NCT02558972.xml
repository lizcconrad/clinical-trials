  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vasovagal syncope (VVS, simple faint) is the most common cause of transient loss of
      consciousness and represents the acute episodic form of orthostatic intolerance (OI).
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the common chronic form of OI. Both are defined by
      debilitating symptoms and signs while upright relieved by recumbency. Northera should
      therefore improve both sympathetic splanchnic arterial vasoconstriction and sympathetic
      splanchnic venoconstriction in POTS and VVS, and may represent an ideal drug to improve the
      orthostatic response in POTS and VVS.

      Vasovagal syncope (VVS, simple faint) is the most common cause of transient loss of
      consciousness and represents the acute episodic form of orthostatic intolerance (OI).
      Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the common chronic form of OI. Both are defined by
      debilitating symptoms and signs while upright relieved by recumbency. Pathophysiological
      mechanisms have remained elusive. Most POTS patients and all VVS patients have normal supine
      resting hemodynamics but excessively redistribute blood flow and blood volume from the
      central pool to the splanchnic vasculature because of defective splanchnic arterial
      vasoconstriction and venoconstriction. While peripheral and splanchnic arterial
      vasoconstriction depend primarily on post-junctional alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, splanchnic
      venoconstriction also depends on post-junctional alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. Consequently,
      selective alpha-1 agonists such as midodrine may not produce sufficient splanchnic
      venoconstriction to compensate for splanchnic pooling in POTS and VVS. Such alpha adrenergic
      subtype restrictions do not apply to Northera (droxidopa) because it is a norepinephrine (NE)
      prodrug and therefore increases the amount of synaptic NE that can then bind to both alpha-2
      and alpha-1 receptors. Northera should therefore improve both sympathetic splanchnic arterial
      vasoconstriction and sympathetic splanchnic venoconstriction in POTS and VVS, and may
      represent an ideal drug to improve the orthostatic response in POTS and VVS. We will test the
      hypothesis that Northera, in appropriate dose, improves the splanchnic adrenergic deficits
      that initiate POTS and postural VVS and in sufficient daily dose improves quality of life in
      these patients. To accomplish this, the investigator will recruit 10 POTS patients aged 18-30
      years, 10 similarly aged patients with 2 or more episodes of VVS in the past year (thus
      defining recurrent VVS) and 10 age and gender matched healthy volunteer control subjects with
      the following specific aims:

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Splanchnic and lower extremity pooling will be measured before, during, and after upright tilt. The investigators will use both venous occlusion plethysmography and impedance plethysmography. Venous occlusion plethysmography are made in ml/min by rapidly inflating cuffs to a pressure of 45mmHg and then computing the slope of the time dependent increase in cross limb section. During impedance plethysmography, a Tetrapolar High Resolution Impedance monitor 4-channel digital IPG is used to detect changes in regional blood volume and blood flow in ml/min</description>

    <measure>Study #2 -Quality of Life measured by self reporting questionnaire (RAND-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will test whether chronic administration of Northera (Droxidopa) in escalating dose improves quality of life. Quality of life will be measured by the RAND-36 questionnaire. The RAND-36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures. These measures rely upon patient self-reporting. The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. (2-4)</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will test whether chronic administration of Northera (Droxidopa) in escalating dose improves quality of life. Quality of life will be measured by the RAND-36 questionnaire (as shown in the above primary outcome) as well as the COMPASS 31 questionnaire. The COMPASS 31 &quot;was developed as a self-assessment instrument of autonomic symptoms and function that is up-to-date, broadly applicable, easy to administer in a short amount of time, and based on a scientific approach. It was designed to provide a global autonomic severity score and domain scores that are both clinically and scientifically meaningful.&quot; &quot;COMPASS 31 is based on the well-established ASP [Autonomic Symptom Profile], a comprehensive questionnaire assessing autonomic symptoms across multiple domains.&quot; (1)</description>
