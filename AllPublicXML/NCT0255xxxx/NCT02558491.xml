      The overall aim of this proposed research is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of a
      decision support system aimed at reducing glucose variability in T1DM patient using an
      insulin pump. The system will be deployed on our portable medical application platform (DiAs)
      and will include insulin pump treatment parameters optimization and an exercise risk warning
      system, capable of predicting hypoglycemia at the onset of physical activity and advising on
      mitigating alteration of treatment.

      A second phase of the trial will enroll additional users of insulin pumps, and subjects who
      treat their T1DM with the use of multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin. MDI users should
      be administering the Lantus (glargine) dose at approximately the same time each day and use
      only one basal rate per day. MDI users will also use MySugr app to count carbohydrates for
      all meals that require insulin treatment.
