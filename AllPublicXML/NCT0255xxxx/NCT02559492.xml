  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1b, platform study in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid
      tumors. The study will be divided into 3 parts (Part 1a, Part 1b, and Part 2). Part 1a will
      evaluate a JAK inhibitor with JAK1 selectivity (Itacitinib) in combination with an IDO1
      inhibitor (epacadostat; INCB024360; Group A) and Itacitinib in combination with a PI3K-delta
      inhibitor (INCB050465; Group B) to determine the MTD or PAD and the recommended Part 1b doses
      for each combination. Once the recommended dose has been identified for each treatment group
      in Part 1a, subjects with advanced solid tumors will be enrolled into expansion cohorts based
      upon prior treatment history with a PD-1 pathway-targeted agent (Part 1b). In Part 2,
      additional expansion cohorts will be enrolled to further evaluate lower doses of itacitinib
      and INCB050465 in subjects with select tumor types.
