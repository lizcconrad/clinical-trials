      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the CARESTREAM Vue PACS 12.1.5 Computed
      Tomography (CT) Perfusion (&quot;investigational device&quot;) imaging performance. Evaluation of CT
      Perfusion (CTP) imaging will compare CTP with the predicate device, the Olea Sphere PACS with
      CT Perfusion Module.

      This study will demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of CTP by an assessment of 30 CTP
      de-identified patient cases collected retrospectively. The maps include the following:

        -  Mean Transfer Time (MTT) - the time that the contrast material stays in the tissue

        -  Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) - the volume of blood that is in a known volume of the
           tissue based on the concentration of contrast material that is in the tissue over the
           time

        -  Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) - describes the flow of the blood to the affected tissue

        -  Time To Peak (TTP) - the time that maximum enhancement is achieved at each volume of the
           tissue The retrospective data collected for each patient will include a non-contrast
           head CT exam completed on the same day as CTP image, and a follow-up head CT at least
           1-2 days after the initial imaging study (initial non-contrast head CT) if available.
