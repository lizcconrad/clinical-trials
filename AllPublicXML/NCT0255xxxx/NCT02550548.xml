  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to advance understanding of the incretin effect in health and
      disease. This system of gut-islet linkage is essential for normal glucose tolerance, impaired
      in T2DM, and amenable to therapeutic intervention. However, there are important gaps in
      understanding incretin function that limit application of this system; this project will
      address several of these. A secondary, but critical aspect of this research is focus on
      inter-individual variation in the physiology of the incretin system. This is a novel
      direction for research in this field and is critical to advancing the concept of
      individualized medical care in diabetes by establishing whether there is a physiologic basis
      for predicting the existence of responders and non-responders to incretin therapies.

      Currently, we have described only Aim 1 from this grant in this protocol registration. While
      Aim 2 and 3 are described in the grant, Aim 1 will be conducted first and the results from
      this Aim and / or the publication of other results in the field may affect the approach to
      Aims 2 and 3.

    <description>During a 240 minute hyperglycemic clamp, subjects will have (after 90 minutes of the clamp) GIP infused at 4 incremental dosages, (initial dose will be 2.0 ng/kg/min, followed by 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 ng/kg/min). Each dose will be infused continuously for 30 minutes, followed immediately by the next higher dose. The total time of this procedure is 240 minutes.</description>

    <description>During a 240 minute hyperglycemic clamp, subjects will have (after 90 minutes of the clamp) GIP + GLP-1 infused simultaneously at 4 incremental dosages (doses will be half the amounts described above). These doses will be infused continuously for 30 minutes, followed immediately by the next higher doses. The total time of this procedure is 240 minutes.</description>

    <description>During a 240 minute hyperglycemic clamp, subjects will have (after 90 minutes of the clamp) GIP infused at 4 incremental dosages (as described above) with Ex-9 infused at a steady dose of 2.5 mcg/kg/min starting 90 minutes before the GIP infusion and maintained throughout the clamp experiment. The total time of this procedure is 240 minutes.</description>
