  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After curative surgical resection, detection of metastatic lymph node remains the main
      prognostic validated criteria on which is based the decision of adjuvant therapy. To date,
      none of the molecular alterations, identified as potentially predictive factor, are used in
      routine for therapeutic decision. The circulating markers, either in the form of free
      circulating DNA or in the form of circulating tumoral cells seems important potential
      candidates. To investigators knowledge, only one study estimated with several interesting
      results the prognostic interest of a coupled detection of the free circulating mutant DNA
      (gene KRAS) and by the hypermethylation of the p16 gene. Definitive conclusions remain
      however difficult to achieve because of the small number of patient included (n=58) and the
      fact that this study included different stages. For colorectal cancer a Chinese team
      presented a series of results suggesting that the presence of CTC during the postoperative
      course is a factor significantly related to the risk of recurrence. In multivariate analysis
      integrating the lymph node status and the vascular invasion, the presence of CTC appeared as
      an independent factor for recurrence with a hazard ratio of 29.5.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the prognostic value of two circulating tumoral
      markers KRAS point mutations and RASSF2A methylation (free tumoral DNA) and Circulating
      tumoral cells (CTC). The primary objective is to compare sensibility and specificity of two
      circulating markers (free tumoral DNA and tumoral cells) on 2 years disease free survival
      rate. Secondary objective is to confirm the prognostic value of circulating free tumoral DNA
      and circulating tumoral cells in localised colorectal cancer.
