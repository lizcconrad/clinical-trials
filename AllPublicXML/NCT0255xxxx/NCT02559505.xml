    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how different methods of early exposure to influenza (natural infection,
      live attenuated influenza vaccination, inactivated influenza vaccination) initially stimulate
      immunity and poise the immune system to respond to a future challenge with the inactivated
      influenza vaccine.

    <textblock>
      The proposed research addresses the fact that, despite high childhood morbidity from
      influenza and broad recommendations for vaccination, very little is known about how
      anti-influenza immunity is shaped by the method of initial exposure. The objective of this
      research is to understand how CD4 T cell and B cell responses are altered by the method of
      initial influenza priming, with the long-term goal of determining how a child's initial
      influenza encounter poises the immune system to respond to subsequent influenza challenges.
      The investigators central hypothesis is that differences in the mode of influenza antigen
      exposure in early childhood will generate long lasting, detectable changes in memory CD4 T
      cell specificity and function that influence the response to future influenza vaccinations
      and infections. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing 1) CD4 T cell and 2) antibody
      responses in cohorts of children initially exposed to influenza through either natural
      infection or inactivated or live attenuated vaccination. A combination of multiparameter
      assays will be used to determine the phenotype and functional potential of hemagglutinin
      (HA)- and nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD4 T cells. The breadth and avidity of the
      neutralizing antibody response and its distribution against head and stalk epitopes will also
      be evaluated. By determining how initial priming shapes the specificity and functional
      potential of the anti-influenza CD4 T cell and antibody responses, the investigators will
      gain the knowledge necessary to optimize current influenza vaccination strategies and develop
      novel influenza vaccines able to provide highly efficacious universal protection against both
      seasonal and potentially pandemic viral strains.
