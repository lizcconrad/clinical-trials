    <textblock>
      The ACE trial is a multicentre, randomized controlled trial comparing axillary vs. innominate
      artery cannulation for established antegrade cerebral perfusion in patients having aortic
      surgery (thoracic and aortic arch) requiring deep hypothermic circulatory arrest using a
      non-inferiority trial design.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgery on the thoracic aorta often requires a brief period of deep hypothermic circulatory
      arrest (DHCA). The most feared complication of aortic surgery is neurological injury, which
      can range from mild cognitive impairment to more severe injuries such as stroke. Due to the
      significant morbidity and mortality associated with post-operative stroke and neurological
      dysfunction, cerebral protection techniques have evolved extensively. A recommended approach
      to cerebral protection during DHCA is to deliver blood to the brain in an antegrade fashion
      via the arterial system, so called antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP). Axillary artery
      cannulation, a form of ACP, has become the preferred method of neuroprotection for aortic
      operations requiring DHCA. However, axillary artery cannulation requires more surgical time
      and presents potential complications such as brachial plexus injury, seromas, and limb
      ischemia. The present study aims to determine whether a less common alternative strategy,
      innominate artery cannulation, offers similar neuroprotection compared to axillary artery
      cannulation and reduces operative times. A total of 110 patients undergoing elective aortic
      surgery from two centres will be randomly assigned to one of the two strategies. The primary
      outcome will be the number of patients with new ischemic lesions found on post-operative
      diffusion weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and total operative time.

    <description>The right axillary artery will be exposed via an infraclavicular incision and a Dacron graft sewn to it in an end to side fashion after 5000 units of IV heparin. Following median sternotomy and full systemic heparinization, CPB will be initiated and the patient cooled. The base of the innominate artery will be clamped, and antegrade cerebral perfusion will be provided via the axillary artery. Following completion of the distal open aortic anastomosis, the clamp on the innominate artery will be removed, CPB via the aorta will be resumed and the patient will be rewarmed. After completion of surgery and weaning from CPB, the axillary artery graft will then be removed, the artery repaired and the skin will be closed.</description>

    <description>After median sternotomy, systemic heparinization, cannulation of the ascending aorta and right atrium, CPB and systemic cooling will be initiated. The ascending aorta, proximal arch and the base of the innominate artery will be mobilized. Purse-string sutures are placed on the anterior wall of the proximal innominate artery and a pediatric venous cannula inserted using a J wire and sequential dilatation. Circulatory arrest with ACP is provided by clamping the base of the innominate artery and connecting the afferent limb of the CPB circuit to the innominate cannula. Once the distal aortic anastomosis is completed, ACP is discontinued, and full CPB via the aortic graft is resumed. Rewarming and the remaining surgery are then completed.</description>
