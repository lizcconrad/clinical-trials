    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study to describe the sociodemographic and clinical
      characteristics of patients diagnosed with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) at risk of
      stroke or systemic embolism, who at least three months ago changed their anticoagulant
      therapy, due to any clinical situation, and are currently on treatment with a direct oral
      anticoagulant (DOAC)
