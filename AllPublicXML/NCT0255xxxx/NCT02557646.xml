  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, non-randomized, single-arm, multicentre observational study
      is to investigate the influence of the cumulative dose (total administered dose/ planned
      dose) of ribavirin on the sustained virologic response (SVR) in participants who have been
      receiving combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys) and ribavirin
      (Copegus).

    <time_frame>24 weeks after EOT (maximum up to 96 Weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) titers was performed using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV technique, upon decision of the treating physician and respecting the therapeutic protocol for the treatment of hepatitis C, at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 of the treatment period (and, optionally, at the end of treatment [EOT] visit), and at the end of the 24-week follow-up period. Negative HCV titers measured at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and at EOT were interpreted as virological response, and negative HCV titers measured at the end of the 24-week follow-up period were interpreted as SVR. Percentage of participants achieving SVR in each cumulative dose group is presented. Cumulative dose was calculated as: (administered dose divided by planned dose) multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>Determination of hepatitis C virus (HCV) titers was performed using COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HCV technique, upon decision of the treating physician and respecting the therapeutic protocol for the treatment of hepatitis C, at Weeks 4, 12 and 24 of the treatment period (and, optionally, at the end of treatment [EOT] visit), and at the end of the 24-week follow-up period. Negative HCV titers measured at Weeks 4, 12, 24, and at EOT were interpreted as virological response, and negative HCV titers measured at the end of the 24-week follow-up period were interpreted as SVR. Percentage of participants achieving SVR in each cumulative dose group is presented. Cumulative dose was calculated as: (administered dose divided by planned dose) multiplied by 100.</description>
