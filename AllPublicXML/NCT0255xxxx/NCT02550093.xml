  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is neurohypophysial peptide that acts mainly as a neuromodulator in the brain.The
      vast majority of basic science studies suggested a large effect of oxytocin in minimizing
      acute pain.Few studies have demonstrated an association between plasma levels of oxytocin and
      pain in humans. Since addictive properties of oxytocin have not been described, the drug may
      have important application in the management of acute and chronic pain. No studies have
      examined the effect of intranasal oxytocin on pain sensitivity and threshold.
