  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will compare the effectiveness of
      amitriptyline versus placebo (inactive medication) in treating chronic laryngitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic laryngitis commonly manifests through symptoms including cough, hoarseness, throat
      clearing, foreign body sensation, throat pain, sensation of excessive phlegm, and difficulty
      swallowing. A significant minority also present with GERD, rhinosinusitis-induced post-nasal
      drainage, direct allergic effect, and smoking issues.

      Amitriptyline is commonly used for mental/mood problems, but is also prescribed to treat
      chronic laryngitis because some investigators suggest a neuropathic etiology for idiopathic
      chronic laryngitis. No trials have compared any treatment for chronic laryngitis to placebo
      and it is unknown if currently used therapies for chronic laryngitis are effective.

      At the baseline visit, subjects will be assigned at random to amitriptyline or placebo, which
      they will take for 8 weeks. Subjects will be seen in the clinic at baseline and at 8 weeks.
      Improvement will be measured using standardized symptom scales, and a self-reported
      subjective improvement percentage.

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) is a validated questionnaire consisting of 9 statements to be ranked on a scale of 0-5 (0=no problem, 5=severe problem). The RSI has been modified with the addition of two statements (&quot;throat pain or burning&quot; and &quot;pain with swallowing&quot;) since those may be relevant to chronic laryngeal neuropathy. Patients will answer the questionnaire based on any symptoms they have been experiencing within the last month.</description>

    <description>The Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10) is a 10-question scale rated from 0-4 that addresses effects on quality of life from voice disorders (0=never, 1=almost never, 2=sometimes, 3=almost always, 4=always).</description>
