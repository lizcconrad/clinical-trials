      This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, single arm, open label, dose escalation study to determine
      the MTD and evaluate the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of orally (PO)
      administered ACY 241 in combination with intravenously (IV) administered paclitaxel in
      eligible patients with advanced solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive ACY 241 with dose escalation according to a 3 + 3 design in combination
      with paclitaxel at the dose and schedule used in clinical practice for the patient population
      treated in this protocol.

      Patients will undergo screening assessments for protocol eligibility within 28 days of study
      start (Cycle 1 Day 1).

      Patients will receive ACY 241 by oral administration once daily (QD) or, if supported by PK
      and safety data, twice daily on 21 consecutive days of a 28 day treatment cycle. Paclitaxel
      will be administered to patients at 80 mg/m2 IV over 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of the 28
      day treatment cycle. Patients who experience a DLT or other unacceptable toxicity in Cycle 1
      will be removed from study treatment. Patients will receive study treatment until documented
      progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.

      Each cohort will consist of at least 3 patients. Patients who withdraw consent in Cycle 1
      will be replaced. An assessment of safety will be made by the Safety Review Committee (SRC)
      before dose escalation. The SRC will be composed of the Study Investigators, the Sponsor's
      Medical Monitor and Clinical Project Lead, and the Contract Research Organization's Safety
      Monitor, Project Manager, and Biometrician. Ad hoc members may be invited by the Sponsor as
      needed.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be able to understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form (ICF).

          2. Must be ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF.

          3. Must be able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          4. Patients must have a histologically confirmed nonhematological, metastatic or locally
             advanced, incurable malignancy for which paclitaxel is clinically appropriate.
             Patients must have received and failed standard treatment for their malignancy;
             patients for whom no standard treatment is available will also be eligible.

          5. Evaluable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version
             1.1.

          6. Life expectancy &gt; 12 weeks.

          7. Must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0, 1,
             or 2.

          8. Patients with the potential for pregnancy or impregnating their partner must agree to
             follow acceptable birth control methods to avoid conception. Females of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test. It is not known if the antideacetylase
             activity of this experimental drug may be harmful to the developing fetus or nursing
             infant.
