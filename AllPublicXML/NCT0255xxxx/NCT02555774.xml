    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of cognitive training in subjects with subjective memory
      impairment. The first group will receive cognitive training and lifestyle modification in
      combination, the second group will receive only lifestyle modification, and the third group
      will receive no intervention.

    <textblock>
      Subjective memory impairment is currently thought to be a risky state of progression to
      Alzheimer's disease. This study aims to confirm whether cognitive training in subjective
      memory impairment would show improvement in the subjective and objective cognition. We
      include subjects with normal cognition but complained subjective feeling of memory decline
      and conduct cognitive training programs combined with lifestyle modifications for 3 months.
      We evaluate the neuropsychological tests and questionnaires about subjective improvement
      after 3 months of interventions.
