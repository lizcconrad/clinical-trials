  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The major adverse health consequences of obesity occur only when non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease (NAFLD) also develops. NAFLD is characterized by abnormal hepatic accumulation of
      triglycerides and other lipids. The first-line approach to NAFLD management is caloric
      restriction and weight loss, but these remain difficult to achieve. Little attention has been
      given to dietary carbohydrate restriction, despite recent reports showing that hepatic de
      novo lipogenesis, a process that converts dietary carbohydrates into fatty acids in the
      postprandial state, accounts for approximately 25% of liver triglyceride content in
      hyperinsulinemic subjects with NAFLD. For comparison, only 15% of the liver triglycerides
      were derived from dietary fatty acids in patients with NAFLD who had consumed a standardized
      30% fat diet for four days before being assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish the time-course of hepatic fat loss in NAFLD subjects on a
      carbohydrate-restricted diet (&lt;20 g/day), a serial assessments of liver fat during two week
      diet will be performed. Also, markers of lipid and insulin metabolism, liver function test
      and changes in gut microbiota during rapid metabolic improvement will be assessed.

      The overall aim is to exploit this unique set of human material to determine the specific
      cellular and molecular pathways that are modified in the early stages of metabolic
      improvement and fatty liver regression.
