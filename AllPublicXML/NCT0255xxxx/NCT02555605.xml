  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to determine the feasibility of dexmedetomidine in children with respiratory
      morbidities who required deep sedation for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electronic medical records of children with at least 3 characteristics of respiratory
      morbidities were retrospectively reviewed. All study patients received dexmedetomidine bolus
      over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion to achieve a minimum Ramsay Sedation Score of
      5. Patients were monitored for hemodynamics, total dose of dexmedetomidine received, adverse
      events experienced and sedation characteristics.

    <description>Children up to the age of 16 years requiring MRI under deep sedation with at least 3 characteristics of respiratory morbidities were identified as having increased risk for adverse respiratory events. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a first bolus of 1 mcg•kg−1 over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion at 1.0 mcg•kg−1•h−1. Sedation level was assessed by Ramsay Sedation Scale and it was initially recorded at 1-min interval. If the child failed to achieve a minimum RSS of 5, this bolus was repeated once again and the continuous infusion was subsequently increased to 2 mcg•kg−1•h−1. In addition, propofol 0.5 mg.kg−1 iv. was allowed to be administered, in patients still exhibiting movement that could interfere with image acquisition.</description>
