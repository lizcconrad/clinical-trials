    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, two-arm, parallel-group, stratified for gender, randomised,
      controlled study in participants aged 7-10 years (yrs). The aim of the study is to test the
      hypothesis that MMN fortified beverage may help improve immunity outcomes as assessed through
      vaccine response in 7-10 yrs old school participants.
