  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for the brain damaging complication of neonatal seizures are
      unsatisfactory. A multi-centre Chinese clinical trials with the aim to using oral
      Levetiracetam to develop new treatment strategies for the treatment of neonatal seizures. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the correct oral dosing, safety and efficacy for oral
      Levetiracetam as first line treatment in term new born babies with seizures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Current treatments are
      poorly effective and have significant side effects. Levetiracetam has great potential as a
      treatment for neonatal seizures but is not approved for use in children less than 1 years of
      age by oral. This study aims to obtain essential data regarding the efficacy and safety of
      oral Levetiracetam in neonatal population and simultaneously to use EEG monitoring systems
      that facilitate seizure detection and research.

      Specific aims are:

        1. To determine the efficacy of oral Levetiracetam in terminating neonatal seizures by EEG
           in the Neonatal Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NNICU).

        2. To determine dose escalation data by studying the additional efficacy of a further dose
           in non responders.

        3. To determine additional pharmacokinetic data to confirm findings from our previous
           pharmacokinetic study.

        4. To determine further safety data of oral Levetiracetam in neonates.
