  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic cardiovascular disease. Outflow-tract
      gradient of 30 mmHg or more under resting conditions is an independent determinant of
      symptoms of progressive heart failure and death.

      The investigators hypothesize that the electrical approach by dual chamber pacing could
      improve symptoms and reduce outflow-tract obstruction in a specific sub-group of selected
      patients with a mechanical hyper-synchronicity. The aim of the study is to identify and
      describe this phenomenon in HCM with (O-HCM) and without (NO-HCM) outflow-tract obstruction
      thanks to innovative multi-imaging approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The concept of physiological ventricular desynchrony was described recently with technics of
      myocardial deformation analysis applied in animal models. Authors confirmed the existence of
      a time delay in the contraction of the apical walls before basal walls. In O-HCM, the
      outflow-tract obstruction could be explained by a mechanical hyper-synchronicity between
      apical and basal walls. This study aims to describe the possible hyper-synchronized
      contraction in O-HCM and NO-HCM patients unlike the physiological desynchrony observed in
      healthy volunteers (HV) For this purpose, three imaging tests will be used at baseline:
      echocardiography (TEE), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement only in
      HCM, and 3-dimensional electrocardiographic mapping (ECM) combined with computed
      tomography-scan. No follow-up is planned for this study.
