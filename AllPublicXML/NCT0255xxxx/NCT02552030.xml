  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this Trial we compare a new application (App) running on an iPhone (Apple inc., Model 4S)
      to determine systolic blood pressure (RR) and compare it to conventional oscillometric
      measurements using an Omron HBP-1300-E Pro device. We will include 1000 participants and
      perform seven repetitive blood pressure measurements (3 iPhone, 4 Omron) in each person.
      Primary parameter will be the absolute difference (Delta) between the correlating blood
      pressure measurements in mmHg.

      Participants will be asked for consent at the University Hospital Basel at random based on
      availability. Recruitment is not limited to patients. After consenting patients will
      accompanied to a RR-measurement unit, positioned in a chair and kept at rest for 4 minutes.
      Then 7 blood pressure measurements at the same arm will be performed
      (Cuff/iPhone/Cuff/iPhone/Cuff/iPhone/Cuff). The Cuff measurement results will be documented
      in the source documents (mmHg) and transferred to a trial database. The iPhone data will be
      transferred with patient ID to &quot;Preventicus&quot; for calculation of the systolic blood pressure
      values (mmHg) based on the pulse waves recorded by transillumination of the index fingers of
      the participants. &quot;Preventicus&quot; will have NO access to the Cuff-measurement data. Then this
      data will be retransferred to the trial site and merged with help of the patient ID. Absolute
      and relative differences of the measured (Omron) and calculated (iPhone) systolic blood
      pressure values (mmHg) for will be calculated and published.

      A subgroup of 40 participants will be evaluated in a highly standardized fashion according
      the ESH (European Society Hypertension) guidelines for validation studies. These data will
      then be published separately for validation purposes.

Starting with a conventional cuff measurement followed by an iPhone measurement, followed by a conventional cuff measurement and so on. Then the absolute difference between each pair of successive measurements will be calculated. These differences will then be averaged and documented as primary result.</description>
