    <textblock>
      Visceral hypersensitivity, low grade inflammation and increased intestinal permeability are
      three main pathophysiological mechanisms involved in irritable bowel syndrome. The connexion
      between these abnormalities is not known. We hypothesis there is a link between them in IBS
      with diarrhoea.

      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder which affect around 10% of the
      general population. Abdominal pain and discomfort are associated with transit disorders
      (diarrhea, constipation, alternating). IBS is defined by Rome III criteria.

      For clinicians, IBS remains difficult to treat while its pathophysiology remains not
      completely understood. Visceral hypersensitivity, low grade inflammation and increased
      intestinal permeability are three abnormalities found in IBS patients. Visceral
      hypersensitivity is present in 60% of the patients, while intestinal permeability is
      increased in a subgroup of IBS with diarrhea. Low grade inflammation could be identify with
      faecal calprotectin dosage. The link between this three abnormalities is not clear.

      The goal of our study is to describe the prevalence of these three abnormalities in
      IBS-Diarrhea population and to look for a correlation between low grade inflammation,
      visceral hypersensitivity, increased intestinal permeability and clinical phenotypes.
