  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidermal barrier efficacy is determined by the physicochemical properties of the
      epidermal lipid matrix, among which ω-6 essential fatty acids (EFAs) play a key role.
      Inversely, the ω-3 EFAs are not found in the epidermis. For patients receiving
      lipid-containing parenteral nutrition (LCPN), the improvement of the epidermal barrier
      through the infusion of most appropriate intravenous fat emulsions (IVFE) could have many
      applications in clinical nutrition, mainly limiting water loss in patients receiving
      long-term LCPN and help in electrolyte and water balance.

      The objective of this interventional clinical trial is to evaluate the epidermal barrier
      function in patients receiving long-term LCPN comparing two compositions of IVFE: (i) soybean
      oil (SO)-based IVFE (Medialipide) or (ii) fish oil (FO)-containing IVFE (Lipidem). Epidermal
      barrier function will be assessed through the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurement on
      the skin surface, a validated marker of the epidermal barrier efficacy. The two IVFE
      (SO-based or FO-containing) will be compared using a randomized double blind crossover
      design, using patients as their own control. Each IVFE will be allocated for a 3-month
      period, allowing sufficient timeframe for epidermal complete renewal. Patient's epidermal and
      red blood cell EFA profile will be determinate in order to facilitate result interpretation.

    <description>Measurement will be performed in a horizontal plane on the dominant volar forearm, which is the reference site for TEWL measurement because of its low content of sebaceous glands and pilosity.
