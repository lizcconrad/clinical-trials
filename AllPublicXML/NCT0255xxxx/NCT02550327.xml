  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to improve survival by the addition of anakinra to the
      chemotherapy combination of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin in patients with
      resectable or potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The primary endpoint
      of the study is to determine whether the combination of abraxane, gemcitabine, cisplatin, and
      anakinra will improve disease-free survival (DFS) and to determine the number of patients who
      meet or surpass 11.5 months of DFS.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of anakinra when combined
      with the three-drug regimen of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and cisplatin on response rate
      and overall survival after diagnosis and adverse events of patients with resectable or
      potentially resectable PDAC. The investigators will use the benchmark of 24 months overall
      survival (OS) to determine how many patients meet or exceed this goal. The investigators will
      monitor, by survey, patients' health related quality of life while on treatment to determine
      if the addition of anakinra improves this measure.

        Inclusion Criteria: A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study if he or she
        meets all of the following criteria:

          1. Male or female ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Suspected PDAC prior to diagnosis or histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the
             pancreas confirmed by pathology. Mixed subtypes of adenocarcinoma are acceptable as
             long as majority of cells are ductal adenocarcinoma. Subjects with suspected PDAC are
             those without a biopsy and a pancreas mass which appears to be metastatic disease.
             These subjects will be enrolled prior to biopsy and then excluded if a diagnosis of
             pancreas cancer is not confirmed by histology.

          3. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Stage I-III Pancreatic carcinoma.

                  limit of normal (ULN).

          9. Adequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN, or creatinine
             clearance ≥50 mL/min

         10. All females of child bearing potential must agree to use contraception to avoid
             pregnancy throughout the study and for one month after the last dose.

         11. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up.

         12. Patients must have the ability to understand the study, its inherent risks, side
             effects and potential benefits and be able to give written informed consent to
             participate. Patients may not be consented by a medical power of attorney.

             information.

          4. Current, active immunosuppressive therapy such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus

          5. Significant or uncontrolled congestive heart failure (CHF), myocardial infarction or
             significant ventricular arrhythmias within the last 6 months.

          6. Active infection or antibiotics within 48 hours prior to study enrollment, including
             unexplained fever (temp &gt; 38°C).

          7. Other severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that in the
             opinion of the investigator could affect the participation of the patient on the
