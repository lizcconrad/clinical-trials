      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Orbera Intragastric Balloon is a safe
      and effective means for weight loss and improved metabolic disease in patients with cirrhosis
      requiring liver transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the general population
      is increasing. More and more patients with underlying NASH-related cirrhosis are now being
      referred to transplant centers but are not candidates for a potentially lifesaving liver
      transplantation due to their obesity and comorbidities related to the obesity.

      The investigators proposed a clinical pilot study using the new FDA approved intragastric
      balloon in obese patients (BMI &gt;35) with cirrhosis in need of liver transplantation, to
      assess weight loss and metabolic improvement.

      The ORBERA™ Intragastric Balloon is an elastic spherical balloon made of silicone, filled
      with 650ml of saline solution. The deflated balloon comes preloaded on a catheter, which is
      advanced transorally into the stomach. An endoscope is then advanced alongside it to ensure
      accurate placement of the balloon in the fundus. Under direct visualization, the balloon is
      then inflated by injecting saline solution mixed with methylene blue through the external
      portion of the catheter. The ORBERA™ Intragastric Balloon is implanted for 6 months and then
      retrieved endoscopically by puncturing the balloon with a needle, emptying the fluid content,
      and removing it through the mouth. Both placement and removal of the ORBERA™ Balloon are done
      as an outpatient procedure with monitored or general anesthesia.
