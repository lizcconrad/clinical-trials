      The Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) Child Study is a prospective
      longitudinal population-based study with a life course approach to health and disease.

      The LIFE Child Study focuses on two main research objectives:

        -  monitoring of normal growth, development and health

        -  non-communicable diseases such as childhood obesity and its co-morbidities, atopy and
           mental health problems

      Detailed assessments will be conducted alongside long-term storage of biological samples in
      2,000 pregnant women and more than 10,000 children and their families.

      -  The LIFE Child study is part of LIFE, a life sciences research program of the University
           of Leipzig (Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases - LIFE). The measurements
           are performed in a well-equipped research centre located on the premises of the
           University Hospital of Leipzig.

        -  The study collects detailed information from clinical examinations, questionnaires and
           interviews and includes a collection of several types of biological materials at various
           time points (urine, hair, blood for direct analyses, genomic DNA, dried blood spots,
           paxgenes (for RNA isolation and expression/eQTL studies), immortalized lymphocytes and
           storage). Children and adolescents from 0-18 years at baseline and their families are
           included.Participants will be followed annually over a period of ten years irrespective
           of the age at the first participation in the study.

        -  Prenatal examinations are conducted during the 24th to 26th and 34th to 36th week of
           gestation and postnatal examinations in 3., 6. and 12. month in the offspring. The birth
           cohort study collects detailed information from clinical examinations, questionnaires
           and interviews and biological materials (blood, cord blood, placental tissue, breast
           milk, hair, urine)

        -  In addition, the LIFE Child study focuses in certain disease cohorts and disease free
           controls in more detail. The aim of these subgroups is to examine aetiological
           associations and comorbidities with more in-depth methods. There are three disease
           cohorts: LIFE Child OBESITY, LIFE Child DEPRESSION, LIFE Child ATOPY.

    <description>The LIFE Child HEALTH cohort is a sample of 10.000 children and adolescents. A basic program that will be carried out annually at each study centre visit. This program includes clinical history (perinatal and past medical history, medications, allergies, immunizations, developmental history and family history) clinical examination, collection of blood, hair and urine samples, anthropometry and different age-dependent questionnaires. Questionnaires are completed by the parents and starting at the age of eight years also by the child itself.</description>

    <description>The LIFE Child OBESITY cohort is a sample of 1,500 obese children and adolescents that will be assessed and compared to a lean control group (N=1,500) with equally detailed phenotyping including metabolic and cardiovascular evaluation. The LIFE Child OBESITY cohort (including the control group) performs the basic program of the LIFE Child HEALTH cohort plus additional parameters such as electrical bioimpedance, assessment of basal metabolic rate, oral glucose tolerance test, spiroergometry and measurement of endothelial function using EndoPAT.</description>
