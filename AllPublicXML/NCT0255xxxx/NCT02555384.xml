  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amblyopia, affects 4% of the population. In the presence of a normal retina and optic nerve,
      the visual cortex does not develop normally secondary to the amblyopic eye being at a
      disadvantage in the sensitive period such as in strabismus. Amblyopia is associated with
      visuospatial disorders, and poor to absent stereopsis. Amblyopia is treated by occlusion of
      the non- amblyopic eye in childhood. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of
      perceptual learning (PL), that is a training of visual drawing tasks (12 sessions of 30
      Minutes duration) with crowding (c) for children with amblyopia compared to an amblyopic
      control group with a placebo drawing task.

      Arm 1: Crowded (PLc)- Training with small spacing Arm 2: Uncrowded (PLu)- Training with large
      spacing Prior to this, a small group will help optimize parameters such as contrast and
      distance of visual objects presented
