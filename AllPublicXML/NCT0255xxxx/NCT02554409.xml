    <textblock>
      The Sanofi Pasteur Fluzone Intradermal Quadrivalent vaccine (Fluzone QIV-ID) Pregnancy
      Registry will be a prospectively recruited pregnancy surveillance program designed to collect
      to collect and analyze information on vaccine exposures, pregnancy outcomes, and fetal and
      offspring outcomes on pregnant women exposed to Fluzone QIV-ID vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sanofi Pasteur will encourage registration of pregnant women exposed to Fluzone QIV-ID in the
      Sanofi Pasteur Pregnancy Registry by providing the registry's toll-free number, 1-800-VACCINE
      (1-800-822-2463), in the USPI. The toll-free number will also be available through the Sanofi
      Pasteur-sponsored Website for the Pregnancy Registry. Both the United States product insert
      (USPI) and Website will advise health care providers to register women who are pregnant or
      became aware they were pregnant at the time of Fluzone QIV-ID immunization.

      Descriptive statistical methods will be the primary approach for summarizing data from the
      Fluzone QIV-ID Pregnancy Registry. No vaccine products will be provided or administered as
      part of this registry protocol.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Pregnant women will be enrolled in the registry prospectively (after exposure to a product
        but before the conduct of any prenatal tests that could provide knowledge of the outcome of
        pregnancy). If the condition of the fetus has already been assessed through prenatal
        testing (e.g., targeted ultrasound, amniocentesis, etc.), such reports will be considered
        retrospective reports. Retrospective reports are also eligible for the registry, but they
        will be analyzed separately from prospective reports.
