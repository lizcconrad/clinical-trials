  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain imaging has shown abnormal brain activations in response to visceral stimulation in
      patients with the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). To investigate the possible role of the
      Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS), the primary relay station in the brainstem for vagal
      afferents, its activation in IBS and functional dyspepsia patients will be evaluated. Prior
      to this, an exploratory study in healthy volunteers will be conducted. This will be the first
      high magnetic field fMRI study evaluating the possible role of NTS activation in visceral
      abdominal pain. Moreover, this will be the first fMRI study using duodenal capsaicin infusion
      as a chemical stimulus, which is more physiological than mechano-stimulation.
