      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new device, called the Endocuff Vision (a
      small plastic device attached to the end of the colonoscope which helps by holding the folds
      of the bowel back to give a clear view of the inside of the bowel) will significantly improve
      the detection of adenomas when used in all patients referred for colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bowel cancer is common in the United Kingdom, with around 1 in 16 men and 1 in 20 women
      developing it at some point in their lives. Most bowel cancers happen when a type of polyp (a
      growth in the bowel) called an adenoma becomes cancerous. Doctors use a camera test, known as
      a colonoscopy, to look inside the bowel and find these polyps and remove them. Removing
      precancerous polyps is known to reduce the chances of a person developing bowel cancer in the
      future. How good colonoscopists are at finding these polyps varies, and there is a lot of
      research into how to improve &quot;adenoma detection rates&quot;.

      A new device, called the Endocuff Vision (a small plastic device attached to the end of the
      colonoscope which helps by holding the folds of the bowel back to give a clear view of the
      inside of the bowel) has been shown to improve the rate of polyp detection at colonoscopy,
      and to make polyp removal easier. Previous small studies have shown that there is a
      significant improvement in detection of adenomas when an Endocuff Vision is used (with the
      rate of detection of adenomas rising from 49% to 66%). Colonoscopists who have used the
      Endocuff Vision before also feel that polyp removal is easier when it is on the colonoscope.
      This study will randomise patients coming for colonoscopy to have their procedure performed
      as usual (i.e. without the Endocuff Vision attached) or as an Endocuff Vision-assisted
      colonoscopy. The investigators will record polyp and adenoma detection rates, duration of
      procedure, participant comfort levels, and complications. All patients referred for
      colonoscopy (via the symptomatic service, surveillance procedures, and the Bowel Cancer
      Screening Programme) will be invited in 7 centres (a mixture of specialist centres and
      district general hospitals), recruiting a total of 1772 participants.

    <description>Endocuff Vision is a new device made of soft plastic material with a unique dynamic shape. It is manufactured by ARC Medical Design Limited and Diagmed in the United Kingdom. It has European Conformity in United Kingdom. The core is made of polypropylene and the 'finger like' projections are made of a thermoplastic elastomer. It comes in four colour coded sizes (purple, blue, green and orange) to fit a range of paediatric and adult colonoscopes. Endocuff Vision is the more updated version of device that has only one proximal row of more rounded finger-like projections. It is mounted at the tip of the colonoscope and held on by friction (pull-off force is a minimum of 10 Newtons).</description>
