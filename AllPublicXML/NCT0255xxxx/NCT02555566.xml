  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial lesions within the transplanted kidney are a major determinant of chronic
      allograft nephropathy. Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are endothelium-derived
      hyperpolarizing factors with anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative and vasodilator properties.

      The main goal of the investigators' study is to evaluate whether genetic polymorphisms of
      specific enzymes responsible for the bioavailability of EETs are associated with
      post-transplant kidney function.

      To this end, 80 kidney transplant recipients will be included. Prespecified genetic
      polymorphisms of CYP 2J2, CYP 2C8, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and EPHX2 will be determined.
      Kidney function will be recorded 3, 6, 12 and 36 months after transplantation. Flow-mediated
      dilatation, EETs and circulating biomarkers of endothelial function will be measured in the
      radial artery.

      The expected results of this study to provide preliminary evidence supporting a beneficial
      role of an increase in the bioavailability of EETs in kidney transplant recipients.
