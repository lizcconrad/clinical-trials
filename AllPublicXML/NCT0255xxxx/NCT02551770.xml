  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this controlled study is to assess the clinical outcomes and patient reported
      outcomes of using minimally invasive surgical procedure with Straumann Emdogain as an adjunct
      (test treatment) or without Straumann Emdogain (control treatment).

      The aim of the study will be achieved through the following primary and secondary objectives.
      The primary objective is to evaluate the regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain by
      comparing the change in clinical attachment level from baseline to 12 months between the test
      and control arms. The regenerative potential of Straumann Emdogain will also be assessed by
      comparing the changes in gingival margins, changes in average probing pocket depth, changes
      in full mouth plaque score, changes in bleeding on probing, and changes in root dentin
      hypersensitivity from baseline to 12 months between the test and control arms.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinical attachment levels (CAL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>CAL will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth at 6 locations. Outcome is mean change of CAL from baseline measurements at surgery to 12-months post-surgery, taken from the deepest pocket of a patient's test and control teeth measured at baseline. Analysis will compare the mean change of CAL for test and control treatment arms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gingival margin (GM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>GM will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth at 6 locations. Outcome is mean change of GM from baseline at surgery to 12-months-post surgery, taken from the deepest pocket of a patient's test and control teeth measured at baseline. Analysis will compare the mean change of GM for test and control treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pocket probing depth (PPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>PPD will be measured in millimeters on the study teeth in 6 locations. Outcome is mean change of PPD from baseline at surgery to 12-months post-surgery, taken from the deepest pocket of a patient's test and control teeth at baseline. Analysis will compare the mean change of PPD for test and control treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in full mouth plaque score (FMPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>FMPS will be calculated based on the number of tooth surfaces with plaque over the total number of tooth surfaces x 100. The value is presented as a percent. The difference in FMPS between 12 months and baseline will be determined.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in bleeding on probing (BoP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>For the categorical variable BoP, the frequency of bleeding (present or absent) will be counted (absolute and in percent) over all measured sites around the identified study teeth for each treatment group. The results will be compared between the 12-month follow-up and baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in root dentin hypersensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 Month Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Presence of root dentin hypersensitivity will be recorded as &quot;none&quot;, &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, or &quot;severe&quot; after a conventional air blast is applied to the study tooth. Changes in the frequency of categories will be determined and compared between the two treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in post-surgical pain</measure>
    <time_frame>1-2 days post surgery, 1 week post surgery, and 2 weeks post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Post-surgical pain will be measured on a visual analog scale and reported in millimeters. The subjects will be instructed to mark their level of pain on a line for both the test quadrant and the control quadrant. The average change in pain level will be determined and compared between the two arms.</description>
