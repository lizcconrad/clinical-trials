    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find associations between asthma symptoms and sleep patterns and
      physical activity among adolescent patients with persistent asthma. The Investigators will
      collect Fitbit® sensor data and survey data from each adolescent enrolled in the study.

    <textblock>
      Investigators from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (Pediatrics), the
      University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the University of Florida will work together to
      conduct a research study to find associations between asthma symptoms, sleep patterns, and
      physical activity over an 8-week period among adolescent patients with persistent asthma.

      The goal of this research study is to find new ways for teenagers to manage their asthma.
      Full understanding of the connection and interference of sleep patterns and physical activity
      with asthma symptoms will be very helpful for teenagers with asthma to better manage their
      daily routine and asthma care. This research study will use wrist-worn devices (i.e. Fitbit®
      wristbands) to collect participants' sleep and physical activity data.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 14 and ≤ 17 years;

          2. Teen access to a mobile smartphone device with a data plan or a computer with reliable
             internet connection, compatible with the Fitbit® application during the study period;

          3. Diagnosis of mild, moderate or severe persistent asthma per National Heart Lung Blood
             Institute (NHLBI).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current smokers and adolescents with significant underlying respiratory disease other
             than asthma (such as cystic fibrosis) that could potentially interfere with
             asthma-related outcome measures;

          2. Prior diagnosis of sleep disorder;

          3. Patients with significant co-morbid conditions (such as moderate to severe
             developmental delay) that could interfere with the adolescent's ability to
             self-monitor asthma;

          4. Inability to speak or understand English (child or parent).
