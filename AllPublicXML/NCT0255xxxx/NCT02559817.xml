  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of linaclotide for the
      treatment of Irritable Bowel syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C), in children age 7-17 years.

      This study includes up to a 4-week Screening Period, and a 2 to 3-week Pretreatment Period.
      Patients age 7-11 will receive oral liquid or oral solid capsule and patients 12-17 will
      receive solid oral capsule formulation. Children ages 7-11 years meeting the entry criteria
      will be randomized to 1 of 3 doses of linaclotide or placebo for 4 weeks. Children ages 12-17
      years meeting the entry criteria will be randomized to 1 of 4 doses of linaclotide or placebo
      for 4 weeks.

      This 4-week study will assess the effects of linaclotide on bowel movement frequency, as well
      as other bowel symptoms of IBS-C.

             stool (eDiary-recorded stool consistency of 7 on the p-BSFS) with any SBM that
             occurred in the absence of laxative use on the calendar day of the BM or the calendar
