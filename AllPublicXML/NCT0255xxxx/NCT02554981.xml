    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Total Corneal Staining Score With Fluorescein in the Worse Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Total corneal staining with fluorescein was measured in the worse eye using the Ora Calibra™ (Scale 1.0) 5-point scale where 0= none (best), no staining to 4=severe staining (worst). The sum of the total includes 3 regions of the cornea, resulting in a maximum possible score of 12 (severe staining score of 4 in all three regions). The worse eye is defined as the worst eye at Baseline. A negative change from Baseline represents a decrease in staining (improvement).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Total Corneal Staining Score With Fluorescein in the Worse Eye</title>
        <description>Total corneal staining with fluorescein was measured in the worse eye using the Ora Calibra™ (Scale 1.0) 5-point scale where 0= none (best), no staining to 4=severe staining (worst). The sum of the total includes 3 regions of the cornea, resulting in a maximum possible score of 12 (severe staining score of 4 in all three regions). The worse eye is defined as the worst eye at Baseline. A negative change from Baseline represents a decrease in staining (improvement).</description>

The Working with a Computer or Bank Machine question was assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time to 4=all of the time). Higher OSDI© scores are associated with greater severity. A negative number change from Baseline indicates improvement and a positive number change from Baseline indicates worsening.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Reading on the OSDI©</title>
        <description>The OSDI© consists of 12 questions measuring the presence of ocular symptoms. The Reading question was assessed using a 5-point scale (0=none of the time to 4=all of the time). Higher OSDI© scores are associated with greater severity. A negative number change from Baseline indicates improvement and a positive number change from Baseline indicates worsening.</description>
