      This clinical investigation evaluates the safety of cryoablation (sclerotherapy of muscle
      tissue of the heart by freezing) in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with the newly developed
      CoolLoop® cryoablation catheter.

      A further aim of the investigation is the evaluation of the efficacy and average duration of
      the applied procedure.
