             an additional barrier method used at least by one of the partners) from the first
             study treatment administration until 3 months after the end-of-study visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological or psychiatric disease
             or cancer (except local non-melanoma skin cancer) within the previous 2 years.

          -  Family history (parents, siblings) of clinically significant cardiac conduction
             disease.

          -  Any condition requiring regular concomitant treatment (including vitamins and herbal

             hormone replacement therapy are allowed.

          -  Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or physical finding (including
             ECG and vital signs) that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the
             interpretation of study results or cause a health risk for the subject if he/she takes
             part in the study.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the active substances or the excipients of the drugs.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  History of vasovagal collapses or vagal reactions with unexplained reason within the
             previous 2 years or a tendency for vasovagal reactions during blood sampling.

          -  HR &lt; 40 bpm or &gt; 90 bpm in the supine position after 10 min rest at the screening
             visit.

          -  At the screening visit:

        systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 150 mmHg in the supine position after 10 min rest diastolic BP &lt;
        50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg in the supine position after 10 min rest

          -  Strong tendency to motion sickness.

          -  Recent or current (suspected) drug abuse.

          -  Recent or current alcohol abuse; regular drinking of more than 21 units per week
             (males) or 16 units per week (females) (1 unit = 4 cl spirits or equivalent).

          -  Current use of nicotine containing products more than 5 cigarettes (or equivalent)/day
             and/or inability to refrain from the use of nicotine containing products during the
             study (from the screening visit to the end-of-study visit).

        Use of caffeine containing beverages more than 600 mg of caffeine/day and/or inability to
        refrain from using caffeine containing beverages 24 h before the first levodopa
        administration on the PK day (day 7) until collection of the 24 h PK sample in the morning
        of day 8.

          -  Blood donation or loss of a significant amount of blood within 90 days before the
             first study treatment administration.

          -  Participation in an investigational drug study or administration of an investigational
             drug within 90 days before the first study treatment administration.

          -  Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture or cannulation.
