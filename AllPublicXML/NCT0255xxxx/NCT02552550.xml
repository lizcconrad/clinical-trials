  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The curative treatment and organ preservation in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
      oropharynx is multimodal. It involves induction chemotherapy and depending on the response
      radio-chemotherapy or surgery. The combination of these methods has important functional
      consequences.

      The aim of this prospective pilot study is to describe swallowing, speech, but also patients'
      quality of life before and after therapeutic management (existing studies measuring these
      functions after treatment but not before).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will not change the patient's treatment. This will just be an evaluation, before
      any treatment, his ability to swallow, speak then, as in normal practice, after 3, 6 and 12
      months after treatment.
