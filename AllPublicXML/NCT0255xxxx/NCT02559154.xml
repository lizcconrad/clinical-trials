    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common hematological malignancy in Chinese elderly population. The
      application of novel drugs improved the clinical outcome and survival of MM patients,even
      though MM remains an incurable hematological malignancy. Bortezomib is a typical one among
      these novel agents, its application resulted in great success, but its adverse events and
      high expense restricted its widely usage. Investigators modified the dose and frequency of
      bortezomib administration in combination therapy: Patients in the modified group received
      regimen with bortezomib (1.6mg/㎡) as an intravenous bolus once weekly on day 1, 8 in a 3
      weeks cycle, in combination with dexamethasone,with or without doxorubicin/
      cyclophosphamide/mitoxsnteone/thalidomide，while patients in the control group received
      similar combination therapy except with conventional bortezomib (1.3mg/㎡) administration
      twice weekly on day 1,4, 8,11.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the modified bortezomib-based therapy may
      attain a similar efficacy as the conventional ones.
