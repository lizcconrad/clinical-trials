        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide signed written informed consent

          -  Diagnosis of subretinal or intraretinal fluid secondary to exudative age-related
             macular degeneration

          -  Prior treatment in the study eye with any intravitreal anti-VEGF medication

          -  At least one lesion in the study eye that meets minimal pathology criteria

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 65 to 20 ETDRS letters in the study eye

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or better in the fellow eye

          -  Reasonably clear media and some fixation in the study eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ocular

          -  Use or anticipated use of any intravitreal, periocular or photodynamic therapy in the
             study eye for the treatment of AMD within a specified timeframe prior to Visit 1

          -  Uncontrolled or advanced glaucoma, chronic hypotony or vitrectomy in the study eye

          -  Evidence of any other ocular disease other than exudative age-related macular
             degeneration in the study eye that may confound the outcome of the study

          -  Need for ocular surgery in the study eye during the course of the study

          -  Presence or history of certain ocular or periocular pathology or conditions that could
             limit the ability to perform required study assessments in either eye and/or confound
             study results

        Non-Ocular

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug product, fluorescein dye or other
             study-related procedures and medications

          -  Current or history of certain systemic conditions, abnormalities or therapies that
             would render a subject a poor candidate for the study

          -  Participation in other investigational drug or device clinical trials within 30 days
             prior to randomization or planning to participate in other investigational drug or
