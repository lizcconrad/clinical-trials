      The prevalence of food allergy seems to be increasing, which might explain the increased
      demand for reliable evaluation of patients with suspected food-related gastrointestinal
      symptoms. Little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of atopy patch tests(APT) in the
      clinical practice. APT seems to have a better specificity than the IgE methods and seems to
      reflect late-phase clinical reactions.The aims of this study were to evaluate:

      (i) The prevalence of positive reaction of APTs for atopic dermatitis (ii)Positive reaction
      of APT compare with skin prick test. (iii)Positive reaction of APT using lyophilized food vs
      commercially available food extracts. (iv)Side effect or adverse
