  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, randomized controlled trial to provide feasibility and conduct
      preliminary analyses on physical (strength and stretch) mechanisms associated with a yoga
      intervention for non-specific chronic low back pain (cLBP). Recent large-scale trials have
      demonstrated the efficacy of a yoga intervention for cLBP however, many types of yoga classes
      are available to the public and a specialized yoga protocol for individuals with cLBP is
      needed. This study's goal is to quantify trunk strength and flexibility to better understand
      how these potential physical mechanisms specifically lead to improvement in pain-related
      outcomes including pain and disability. This knowledge will be used to design a large scale
      trial of mechanisms of yoga for cLBP. For this pilot study, 40 participants will be
      randomized to either a yoga intervention (N=20) or to a usual care group (N=20) that will
      receive The Back Pain Helpbook, a mind-body self-care program for better living. The yoga
      intervention will be offered weekly yoga classes and instructional materials will be provided
      for home practice.
