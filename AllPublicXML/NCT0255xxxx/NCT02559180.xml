      Treatment of diabetic macular edema with intravitreal aflibercept in subjects previously
      treated with intravitreal anti-Vegf agents (ranibizumab or bevacizumab)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an investigator initiated interventional study for subjects with diabetic
      macular edema that have been previously treated with bevacizumab or ranibizumab. Intravitreal
      aflibercept 2mg will be given until OCT (ocular coherence tomography) demonstrates an absence
      of fluid. Continued intravitreal aflibercept 2mg will then take place every 2 months for a
      total of 24 months of treatment.

      This study is an interventional, single arm, investigator initiated study. Subjects will be
      given 2 mg (0.05 mL or 50 microliters) of IAI injection administered monthly until OCT
      demonstrates no evidence of fluid as defined by the protocol, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) once
      every 2 months. Each subject will be evaluated for 24 months. Thus, the study duration will
      be 24 months plus the recruitment period.

      Subjects will be evaluated for safety, efficacy as measured by SDOCT and best corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA) using the Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
      (E-ETDRS) protocol. In additional, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and OCT
      angiography will be performed at baseline, month 6, month 12 and at the final visit.

      Only one eye per subject may be enrolled in the study. If a subject's fellow (non-study) eye
      requires treatment for at study entry, or during the subject's participation in the study,
      the fellow eye can receive IAI injection for DME.
