  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if using peripheral nerve stimulation in conjunction with
      pulse oximetry as an adjunct to traditional monitoring in the PACU reduces the frequency and
      severity of sedation related apnea and hypoxic events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary effectiveness objective is to determine if transcutaneous stimulation will
      generate a respiratory response capable of reducing the extent and duration of oxygen
      desaturations in patients with presumed risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) who have
      received some form of anesthesia or sedation. The primary safety objective is the
      demonstration that the peripheral nerve stimulation is safe for the use of preventing or
      reducing the sedation related hypoxemic events.
