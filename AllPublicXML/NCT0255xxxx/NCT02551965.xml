  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In geriatric oncology, caregivers are submitted to a risk of exhaustion. To investigate the
      clinical risk factor of exhaustion, the researchers propose to conduct a prospective
      observational study during 6 months phone follow up of the caregivers. The recruitment will
      take place during the oncogeriatric assessment consultation.

      The primary purpose aim to describe the caregiver of patient with 70 years old or more,
      suffered from cancer and for which a treatment is planned, along with their long term
      evolution.

      The secondary purposes are to :

        -  Assess the exhaustion level felt by this caregiver

        -  Assess the medium delay of caregiver exhaustion apparition

        -  Relate factors associated to the medium delay of caregiver exhaustion apparition during
           patient chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy treatment
