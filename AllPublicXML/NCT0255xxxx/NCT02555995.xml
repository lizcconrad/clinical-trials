      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an established non-invasive medical imaging technique
      ophthalmologists use to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases such as age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD).

      This study assesses the scanning performance of a newly developed sparse OCT retina scanner
      that is smaller and more compact than most commercially available medical OCT systems. The
      prototype device was developed at Artorg Center Bern and Berner Fachhochschule Biel.

      In this study the device is first tested on human eyes. The scanning performance is compared
      to a reference device. Additionally patient feedback during the examination is acquired.

      The findings of this study are used to improve the software and the ergonomics of the
      investigational device.

      Background

      Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an established non-invasive medical imaging technique
      ophthalmologists use to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases such as age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD).

      This study assesses the scanning performance of a newly developed sparse OCT retina scanner
      that is smaller and more compact than most commercially available medical OCT systems. The
      prototype device was developed at Artorg Center Bern and Berner Fachhochschule Biel.

      In this study the device is first tested on human eyes. The scanning performance is compared
      to a reference device. Additionally patient feedback during the examination is acquired.

      The findings of this study are used to improve the software and the ergonomics of the
      investigational device.

      Objective

        -  Comparing scan quality of investigational device to scan quality of reference device.

        -  Obtaining patient feedback on the examination with investigational device.

      Methods

      Comparison of OCT scans made with standard device and investigational device.
