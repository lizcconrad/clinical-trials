    <textblock>
      This will be an up to six months, subject-masked, contralateral, parallel-group, randomised,
      daily wear study. All subjects will wear the Test lens in one eye and the Control lens in the
      other eye. Data from the first four weeks of Test and Control lens exposure will be used for
      the FDA 510 (k) submission.

          -  Currently enrolled in an ophthalmic clinical trial

          -  Evidence of systemic or ocular abnormality, infection or disease which is likely to
             affect successful wear of contact lenses or use of the accessory solutions, as
             determined by the investigator

          -  Any use of medications for which contact lens wear could be contradicted, as

          -  Current wearers of astigmatic contact lenses (posterior surface design)

          -  Has a reported &quot;Strong&quot; comfort or vision preference between each eye with their
             habitual RGP lenses

          -  Unacceptable fit of habitual lenses
