  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how the investigators can better educate pregnant
      patients about the options open to them for pain relief during labor. Patients will receive
      educational pamphlet during prenatal clinic visit and again on admission to labor and
      delivery. The options for analgesia will be discussed by anesthesia care provider. Patient
      will be asked to complete a survey on the post partum unit.

    <textblock>
      Many analgesic options exist for laboring parturients, but labor may not be the best time to
      start informing patients of their options. Many patients begin the labor process with a plan
      in place for their analgesia. Unfortunately, internet resources regarding labor analgesia
      that are available to the lay parturient are poor and often lead to misconceptions about the
      options and their risks. A significant number of patients refuse neuraxial analgesia based on
      misunderstandings, concerns about the procedure, or a lack of faith in the provider. Some
      women want a &quot;natural childbirth&quot; and/or control over their labor experience. Forty-seven
      percent of minority women feel inadequately educated about anesthesia, are less likely to
      trust physicians, and are less likely to receive epidurals. However, greater than 10% of
      obese women changed their preference toward epidural analgesia following antenatal
      consultation. Also, 50% of patients planning for analgesia-free labor request neuraxial
      analgesia after experiencing labor pain.3 Additionally, the question exists as to the quality
      of informed consent from a patient undergoing contraction pain and possible sedation from
      analgesic medications. The consensus is that parturients can provide informed consent.
      However, the process of informed consent for labor analgesia is not standardized; the options
      and risks presented to patients are dependent upon the individual practitioner obtaining the
      consent. Regarding epidurals, patients want to be informed of all risks and complications
      associated with the procedure. The patient's recall of the risks and benefits of the epidural
      procedure improved by 50% with written material in addition to verbal discussion, and recall
      improved by more than a factor of five when consent during labor was preceded by antenatal
      education. Parturients want a &quot;pre-operative&quot; visit with an anesthesiologist and have a
      strong desire for pre-labor education of anesthesia/analgesia options. Early antenatal
      education allows for time to teach, relieves anxiety, develops rapport, and provides
      opportunities for additional testing, if needed. Finally, the timing of epidural placement
      has not been shown to change outcomes, but when initiated late in the labor process, often
      other analgesia modalities were used that confounded the analysis of outcomes. Therefore,
      earlier request, which may come with prior knowledge and avoidance of misconceptions, and
      earlier placement of epidurals may lead to fewer analgesic interventions in the parturient
      and possibly less morbidity for the patient and fetus. The investigators will provide
      information of available labor analgesia options (epidural, combined spinal/epidural, spinal,
      remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia, and intravenous opioids) to expecting mothers.
      Using a pamphlet written in English or Spanish disseminated to pregnant women in clinic and
      upon arrival in the labor and delivery unit, the procedures and their risks and benefits will
      be explained in simple terms. In the Labor and Delivery Unit the patients will have an
      opportunity to ask questions of the anesthesia care giver regarding the options for
      analgesia. After delivery while on F Green, patients will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire addressing their thoughts about the pamphlets and their overall satisfaction
      with their labor analgesia. The analysis will focus on the utility and effect of education
      materials on maternal informed consent for labor analgesia, on maternal choice of analgesia
      modality, and on maternal anxiety regarding their labor analgesia plan.

          <description>All English or Spanish speaking patients were provided with a pamphlet during their prenatal visits and then again when entering the labor and delivery floor. The pamphlet contained information regarding labor analgesia alternatives (i.e Epidural, remifentanil PCA, morphine bolus, etc). After delivery, the patients were approached and asked to respond to a brief questionnaire.</description>
