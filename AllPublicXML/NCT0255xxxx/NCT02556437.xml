  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HyQvia (Immunoglobulin
      10% with recombinant hyaluronidase) with conventional subcutaneous immunoglobulin treatment
      in patients with Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) therapy for MMN is equally efficacious to intravenous
      immunoglobulin (IGIV), may be self-induced and may induce fewer systemic adverse reactions.
      Limited SC infusion volumes and reduced bioavailability, however, necessitate multiple
      infusion sites, more frequent treatment, and dose adjustment to achieve pharmacokinetic
      equivalence. This is an issue in particular in MMN where relatively high and frequent doses
      are necessary to maintain long-term improvement of muscle strength. Recombinant human
      hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) increases subcutaneous tissue permeability and facilitates dispersion
      and absorption, enabling subcutaneous administration of higher (monthly) doses of Ig. If
      treatment with HyQvia is at least equally effective and safe as compared with conventional Ig
      treatment, HyQvia could become the preferred treatment option for patients with MMN as it may
      have attractive benefits for patients by its mode of administration.
