      The aim of this study is to identify demographic &amp; disease characteristics in pediatric
      oncology patients diagnosed with soft tissue &amp; bone tumors involving the extremities &amp;
      treatment outcomes in these patients.

      Background:

      Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors that arise predominantly from the embryonic
      mesoderm. The various sarcomas include bone sarcomas (osteosarcomas and chondrosarcomas),
      Ewing's sarcomas, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and soft tissue sarcomas.

      Soft tissue sarcomas account for approximately 1% of adult malignancies and 7% to 15% of
      pediatric malignancies. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood.

      There is some confusion within segments of the medical community as to the precise meaning of
      &quot;soft tissue.&quot; The soft tissue of the human body includes all extraskeletal tissue that is
      neither epithelial, hematopoietic (marrow derived blood elements), nor parenchymal
      (constituent of a visceral organ). The nervous system is divided such that neither the glial
      nor the central neuronal elements are considered to be soft tissue, though by convention the
      peripheral nervous system is. In sum, the soft tissues consist of adipose tissue, fibrous
      tissue, musculature, vascular structures, and peripheral nerves.

      About 50% to 60% of sarcomas occur in the extremities, and although they are rare, they are
      responsible for more deaths than testicular cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and thyroid cancer
      combined.

      Patients &amp; Methods:

      From January 2000 till December 2015, retrieval &amp; analysis of the medical records of
      pediatric patients with soft tissue &amp; bone tumors involving the extremities will be made at
      the pediatric oncology department, South Egypt Cancer Institute which represents the largest
      referral center in Upper Egypt. These data will be categorized according to demographic
      characteristics, clinico-pathologic features, treatment modalities received, and outcomes of
      treatments in these patients.
