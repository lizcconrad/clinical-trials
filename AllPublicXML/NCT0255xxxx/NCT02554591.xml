  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a retrospective study of single agent ceritinib in
      patients with previously untreated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearranged adenocarcinoma
      of the lung with the sole purpose of characterizing the genomic landscape before ceritinib
      and at the time of disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Further improvements in therapy can only be achieved with a better understanding of the
      genomic landscape of ALK rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), specifically at the
      time of disease progression following treatment with ALK inhibitors. Recently, secondary ALK
      mutations, L1196M and G1269A have been described in patients with acquired resistance to
      crizotinib. A small subset of ALK positive lung cancer patients who progressed after
      treatment with ceritinib had tumors available for molecular analysis. Secondary mutations
      found included G1202R, F1174C, and F1174V. While this is interesting, an unbiased genomic
      study (exome or whole genome sequencing) using massively parallel sequencing at the time of
      disease progression is critical to fully understand the clonal evolution and the molecular
      mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance. To the best of the investigators' knowledge,
      such a study has not yet been reported.

      The investigators believe the time is ripe now to comprehensively characterize genomic
      alterations using massively parallel sequencing technology of ALK driven adenocarcinoma of
      the lung to fully understand the clonal heterogeneity before therapy and fully understand the
      clonal evolution and the molecular mechanisms underpinning treatment resistance. A better
      understanding of genomic alterations through an unbiased comprehensive approach likely would
      lead to rationally designed therapy to augment response to ALK inhibitors.

    <measure>Genetic changes associated with disease progression following treatment with ceritinib</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare tumor sequencing prior to ceritinib treatment to the time of disease progression to see if the genetic sequencing changed between pre-treatment and progression.
The investigators plan to conduct exome and transcriptome sequencing of tumor before therapy with certitinib and at the time of relapse. In addition, exome sequencing of peripheral blood DNA will be done (for germline). Given the complexities of genomic analyses of paired samples in the face of limited data, the investigators will not be able to do any formal power calculations in this feasibility study.
Disease progression is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study or appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Types of mutations in signaling kinases associated with therapeutic response</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will look at tumor tissue associated with a therapeutic response and compare with tumor tissue associated with disease progression and see if there are any mutation differences.
Therapeutic Response
Complete response is disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions.
Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Allelic ratio of wild type ALT to ALK gene rearrangement (roughly corrected for intrinsic difference in tumor cellularity) with duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Estimated to be 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A variant is considered to have mutant biased expression if the variant is expressed and the variant allele frequency is greater than 20% higher in the RNA-seq data compared to the exome sequencing data. A variant is considered to have wild type biased expression if the gene is expressed, the region of the variant is covered at 5X or greater depth, and the VAF is at least 20% lower in the RNA-seq data compared to the exome sequencing data.
Duration of response is the duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response or partial response (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).</description>
