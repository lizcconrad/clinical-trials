  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to
      and within the lungs. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a focal adhesion-associated protein
      kinase involved in cellular adhesion and spreading processes which leads to stiffening and
      thickening of blood vessels in lungs. This further increases the blood pressure within the
      lungs and impairs their blood flow. This study aims to demonstrate biodistribution of FAK
      inhibitor, GSK2256098, in cardiopulmonary sites i.e. heart and lung tissues. The uptake of
      11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within the lung and / or heart of healthy subjects and
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) patients will be assessed using Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET). Based on study results the decision as to whether a follow-on
      phase 2 trial should be initiated to investigate the therapeutic utility of GSK2256098 in
      iPAH will be decided. Sufficient number of subjects will be screened (up to 30 days prior to
      scan) to enrol 12 healthy subjects and 12 PAH patients in the study. Enrolled subjects will
      receive a microdose of [11C]-GSK2256098 on a scanning day which will be followed by the
      follow-up visit (2-4 weeks post-last dose).

    <description>VT is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. PET scan is used to assess drug occupancy at heart and lungs which will be inferred indirectly by assessing binding of radiolabelled GSK2256098 with specificity to the site.</description>

    <description>SUV is a technique of determining activity in PET imaging. It is a ratio of tissue radioactivity concentration at a point in time and the injected dose of radioactivity per kilogram (kg) of the patient's body weight. PET scan is used to assess drug occupancy at heart and lungs which will be inferred indirectly by assessing binding of radiolabelled GSK2256098 with specificity to the site.</description>
