      The investigators would like to determine if remote ischemic leg preconditioning in healthy
      volunteers improves cerebral vasomotor reactivity as measured by breath holding and
      transcranial doppler vasomotor reactivity.

      This study is to determine if remote ischemic leg preconditioning improves short and long
      term cerebral vasomotor reactivity in healthy volunteers as measured by breath holding and
      transcranial doppler vasomotor reactivity. Previous studies on brachial vasomotor reactivity
      have shown a beneficial effect of remote ischemic preconditioning. It remains uncertain if a
      similar beneficial effect can be reproduced with cerebral vasomotor testing. Many biological
      mechanisms and effector pathways triggered by preconditioning have demonstrated endothelial
      protection and beneficial vascular effects.

    <description>A blood pressure cuff is placed over the upper thigh of the participant(s) and inflated to 30 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) above systolic blood pressure. The loss of pedal pulses is confirmed by palpation. The cuff remains inflated for 5min and is followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion/rest. This will be repeated 4 times.</description>

    <description>A blood pressure cuff is placed over the upper thigh of the participant(s) and inflated to 40 mmHg, sufficient to apply pressure but not affect blood flow. The presence of pedal pulses is confirmed by palpation. The cuff remains inflated for 10min and is followed by 5 minutes of rest. This will be repeated 3 times.</description>
