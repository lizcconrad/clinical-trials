  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants with advanced solid tumors will be assigned to receive either
      MK-1248 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). This study will use an adaptive
      design to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD, or maximum administered dose
      [MAD]) for MK-1248 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab.

      Enrollment into this study has been prematurely discontinued due to program prioritization
      and not related to any safety concerns.
