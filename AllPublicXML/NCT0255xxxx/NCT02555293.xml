  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is in almost all cases the only potentially curative treatment option for patients
      with primary or secondary malignancies of the liver. However, in most cases oncological
      resections (&quot;R0-resections&quot;) can only be achieved by performing major liver resections (4 or
      more liver segments), which is related to considerable postoperative complications such as
      systemic infections and postoperative liver insufficiency (postresectional liver failure
      (PRLF)). Despite optimized preoperative and postoperative strategies of care presently, up to
      32-55% of patients display severs postoperative complications (Clavien score ≥ 3a) and 5%
      even suffer from a severe PRLF. Recent observations in murine disease models as well as human
      patients suggested that postoperative alterations of hemodynamics within the portal vein
      tract as well as postoperative modulations of the immune response facilitates the
      translocation of gut bacteria in the blood, leading to systemic infections and sepsis.
      Moreover it became apparent that inflammatory mediators, released by the gut microbiota might
      negatively affect postoperative liver regeneration. Rifaximin (Xifaxan®) is a novel and
      potent, semisynthetic antibiotic that efficiently acts against most enteric bacteria and
      significantly reduced liver inflammation and liver fibrosis in animal studies. Moreover,
      Rifaximin is very well tolerated, even in patients with liver insufficiency.

    <description>The evaluation of time to functional recovery will start on POD 0 and will be scored daily until discharge from the hospital with the following criteria
Adequate pain control on oral analgesics only
Eating and drinking properly without the need of IV fluids
Independently mobile or mobile at preoperative level
Standard laboratory tests and liver function returning to normal level When all of these criteria are met, we consider a patient functional recovered.</description>

Preoperative Rifaximin treatment in case of a PVE will start the day after PVE and will last for 14-21 days. In case patients are not pre-treated with a PVE they will receive Rifaximin for 7-10 days prior to surgery. Regardless of PVE, patients will receive additional Rifaximin treatment the first 7 days postoperatively.</description>
