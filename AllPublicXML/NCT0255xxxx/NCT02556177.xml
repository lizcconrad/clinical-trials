    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, prospective, multi-site, parallel group (segment),
      hypothesis-generating study designed to collect data that will aid in future scientific and
      engineering exploration of correlations between clinical neuropsychological assessments and
      GE Research Pack II advanced MR imaging in mTBI patients. The results are primarily intended
      for scientific inquiry and engineering development purposes, and may be used in future
      regulatory submissions.

      This data-driven study is being conducted for hypothesis generation in population of mild
      traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients using advanced applications for magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) developed by the Sponsor, GE Healthcare (GEHC), and corresponding clinical
      neuropsychological assessments. This data is intended for future use in development of
      specialized MR acquisition, reconstruction, and processing software intended to identify mTBI
      biomarkers.
