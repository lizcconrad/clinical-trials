  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the feasibility of using health coaching sessions in cancer
      patients. The investigators are investigating whether health coaching sessions can be
      delivered to this group of participants in a semi structured way. The investigators hope that
      the study will allow us to see whether such sessions can be delivered in a timely manner that
      is acceptable to patients and staff. The longer term aim for this work, should it prove
      feasible, is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess health coaching.

      The participants for the study will be selected using purposive sampling. The investigators
      will select a sample of 10 patients. The participants will be patients at the Oxford
      University Hospitals NHS Trust who are prescribed oral anticancer therapy. The sample will
      include male and female patients and try to cover a range of ages from 18 upwards. It will
      cover patients taking a range of oral anticancer agents, for a range of different cancer
      indications. The sample will look at patients who are newly prescribed oral anticancer
      therapy through to patients who have been taking therapy for years.

      Participants will be identified for the study by multidisciplinary staff members who are
      running oral education sessions or by non-medical prescribers who are seeing patients in
      clinic. These members of the MDT will be given lists of the types of participants the
      investigators are looking for in the study and where appropriate offer patients the
      opportunity to take part. Patients will be contacted prior to the end of their subsequent
      cycle of treatment about whether they wish to participate. Patients wishing to take part will
      be consented at their next clinic visit.

      All participants will attend for their usual clinic visits throughout the study. Participants
      will additionally be offered up to 3 health coaching sessions for a maximum of three cycles
      or until treatment with their oral anticancer agent ends, whichever comes first.

      At the end of study visit participants will be asked to attend a qualitative based interview
      to discuss the intervention.

    <time_frame>up to 4months (depending on length of each cycle of treatment). Patients will be seen at up to 4 concetutive clinic visits.</time_frame>
    <description>To assess whether a 10 minute semi standardised health coaching session can be conducted with NHS cancer patients by pharmacists trained in health coaching and to gather the opinions of the patients and the health coaches as to whether the intervention is of benefit and warrants further investigation.
Measures of feasibility include: Recruitment figures, logistics of conducting health coaching sessions, review of the recorded coaching sessions, attendance rates, qualitative analysis of reflection notes and end of study interview with patients, Patient activation measure at baseline and end of study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.

          -  Patient is willing and able to give written (signed and dated) informed consent for
             participation in the study.

          -  Male or Female, aged 18 years or above.

          -  Diagnosed with cancer.

          -  Patient prescribed an oral anticancer agent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unable to complete 1 cycle of oral anticancer therapy from the time
             of being approached about the trial.

          -  Patients who would be unable to participate in a health coaching session with a health
             coach for any reasons, including, difficulty understanding or speaking English, other
             communication difficulties or hearing problems.

          -  Other psychological, social or medical condition, that the Investigator considers
             would make the patient a poor trial candidate, could interfere with protocol
             compliance, could affect the patient's ability to give informed consent or may affect
             the interpretation of trial results.
