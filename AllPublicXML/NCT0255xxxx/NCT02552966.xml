  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is postulated that the incompetence of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) to restrict
      passage of esophageal refluxate is fundamental to the development of LPR. The UES Assist
      Device (UESAD) is a novel device that applies relatively modest external cricoid pressure,
      which results in a 20 to 30 mmHg intraluminal UES pressure increase. Pepsin, a proteolytic
      enzyme produced in the stomach, has been detected in the laryngeal epithelium of patients
      with reflux associated laryngeal symptoms and implicated in the pathogenesis of
      laryngopharyngeal reflux. This study will asses the effectiveness of a UESAD worn for 2 weeks
      on LPR symptoms and salivary pepsin levels.

      A cost-effective and care appropriate algorithm to streamline the diagnosis and management of
      patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) has not been described. It is postulated that
      the incompetence of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) to restrict passage of esophageal
      refluxate is fundamental to the development of LPR. The UES Assist Device (UESAD) is a novel
      device that applies relatively modest external cricoid pressure, which results in a 20 to 30
      mmHg intraluminal UES pressure increase. Pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme produced in the
      stomach, has been detected in the laryngeal epithelium of patients with reflux associated
      laryngeal symptoms and implicated in the pathogenesis of laryngopharyngeal reflux. A study
      examining salivary pepsin levels for patients pre- and post-fundoplication for LPR found that
      all patients with positive preoperative pepsin levels and postoperative elimination had
      symptom improvement, suggesting that changes in pepsin level may be reflective of surgical
      responsiveness. This study seeks to explore the therapeutic role of the UESAD in patients
      with LPR symptoms, and measure its effectiveness by objective criteria (salivary pepsin) and
      symptomatic improvement. In this study, 25 patients seen in GI clinic with laryngeal
      complaints will complete validated symptom questionnaires - the RSI, GerdQ and N-GSSIQ
      scores. Those with an RSI &gt; 13 and GerdQ &gt; 8 will be included. They will submit 3 baseline
      sputum samples for pepsin analysis, taken upon awaking. They will then be advised to use the
      UESAD nightly for 2 weeks. 3 follow-up sputum samples for pepsin analysis will be taken and
      symptom scores reevaluated after the 2 week period.
