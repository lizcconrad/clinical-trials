    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in France (36,000 new cases / year)
      and nearly 16,000 people die each year from this disease. The lymph node involvement of the
      surgical specimen is today the main tool on which is based the adjuvant treatment decision
      after curative surgical resection. The study of new predictive factors to identify patients
      at risk for developing a local or metastatic recurrence is therefore a major challenge.

      It is now clear that the immune system plays a role in the control of tumor's development,
      and it was shown that there was a correlation between the presence of a CD3+ T-lymphocyte
      infiltrate in colorectal cancers and patient survival. Preliminary studies suggest an
      important role of regulatory T-lymphocyte in the modulation of the antitumor immune response.
      The aim of our study is to follow a cohort of patients operated for colon cancer with
      curative intent to highlight the prognostic characteristics of the tumoral infiltrate by
      various lymphocyte populations (particularly T-lymphocytes but also B-lymphocytes and
      regulatory lymphocytes). It will be performed a preoperative analysis of blood circulating
      lymphocytes with antibodies specific for different cell populations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56,
      CD16, CD19, CD2) and stage of activation (CD25, CD69, HLA-DR ) or differentiation (CD24,
      CD38, CD27, CD103, CD62L, CCR7, CD45RA / RO, IgD). The presence of regulatory T-lymphocytes
      will also be analyzed. It will be performed on tumor sample a Tissue Microarrays for
      immunohistochemical study to determine the presence of different lymphocyte populations. We
      systematically study the markers CD68 (monocytes / macrophages), CD56 (NK cells), CD20 and
      CD79a (B cells / plasma cells), CD3 (T cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T), CD4 (helper T) FoxP3
      (regulatory T), cytotoxicity of CD8 markers (Fas ligand, perforin and granzyme) and MHC I
      (antigen presentation) to explore the innate and adaptive immune responses. For each section,
      the different zones will be analyzed (center and invasive margin and healthy tissue). The
      main objective of the study is the influence of the tumor infiltration rate by CD3 + T cells
      on disease free survival at 2-years in patients with non-metastatic colon cancer resection.
      The secondary objective is to search a correlation between the rate of T-lymphocytes on
      preoperative blood sample and on tumor sample.
