      The BioGene bank: Is a centralized collection of human blood samples along with de-identified
      (coded) health information, environmental factors, family disease histories and information
      from DNA. Limited to the NSLIJHS catchment area.

      The purpose of the BioGene Bank Cohort is to collect blood and store DNA from blood, along
      with health information to study how genetic variation in the population is associated with
      particular diseases, treatments and medical outcomes. Investigators may study the entire
      range of diseases and medical problems that exist within the NSLIJHS, including medical,
      surgical, psychiatric, pediatric and obstetric conditions. The specimens and medical
      information will be kept at a central Biorepository. This research study does not involve any
      treatment and individual research results are not provided.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone receiving care at the NS LIJ Health System would be eligible to join the
             BioGene Bank Cohort.

          -  Participants' family members who may or may not have medical records at NSLIJHS.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to give consent because they are decisionally impaired or have a
             language barrier that cannot be overcome.

          -  Patients unable to provide a blood sample because it would adversely affect their
             health or who refuse to provide blood sample or share future discarded biological
             samples.

          -  Patients &lt;10kg in weight
