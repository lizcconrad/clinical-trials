  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2000, annual numbers of malaria cases in South Africa have sharply declined to about
      5,000, with case numbers fairly stable since 2007. The principal malaria prevention strategy
      has consisted of generalised Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) of all houses in malaria endemic
      districts. As recent case data indicate that the levels of transmission in many districts
      have been reduced to very low levels, the continuation of untargeted IRS in areas where there
      is little or no evidence of recent transmission may be unwarranted. Efforts to eliminate
      malaria will only be sustainable if mass prevention efforts can be scaled down in an
      evidence-based manner, whilst maintaining or enhancing high sensitivity of the surveillance
      system of the disease. This trial will provide scientific evidence for targeted malaria
      prevention responding to localised transmission in pre-elimination settings, compared to
      continuation of generalised IRS of all houses.

      Two methods of IRS delivery for community malaria prevention will be compared through an
      open-label cluster-randomised trial consisting of two study arms with 30 clusters per arm of
      approximately 8,000 inhabitants per cluster.

      Comparison is on the basis of non-inferiority by showing that malaria incidence in the
      targeted IRS arm is no higher than malaria incidence in the generalised IRS arm within a
      specified margin of difference, and on the basis of superiority showing that the proportion
      of houses targeted for spraying is higher in the intervention than the reference arm.
      Neighbourhood investigation in response to two cases in the intervention arm, and comparison
      neighbourhoods in the reference arm, will include testing for antibody sero-conversion to
      malarial antigens to assess whether cases arise in communities with long term exposure to
      malaria parasites.

      The trial will be carried out in the South African provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, in
      localities which have average reported incidence of malaria of &lt;5 cases per 1000 per annum
      over the past five years.

    <textblock>
      Two methods of IRS delivery for malaria prevention, targeted spraying versus annual
      generalised spraying, will be compared through an open-label cluster randomised trial
      consisting of two trial arms with 30 clusters per arm. Clusters will be artificial constructs
      made up of groups of spray localities or complete wards to comprise populations of about
      5,000 to 10,000 persons. The unit of randomisation will be the cluster.

      The intervention arm of the trial will receive IRS delivery through targeted reactive
      spraying in the neighbourhood of recent local cases only; the reference (control) arm of the
      trial will receive IRS through generalised annual spraying of all structures as per standard
      current practice.

      Comparison will be on the basis of non-inferiority by showing that malaria incidence in the
      targeted IRS arm is no higher than malaria incidence in the generalised IRS arm within a
      specified margin of difference, and on the basis of superiority showing that the proportion
      of houses sprayed, of those targeted for spraying, is higher in the intervention than the
      reference arm. Neighbourhood investigation in response to two cases in the intervention arm,
      and comparison neighbourhoods in the reference arm will include testing for antibody
      sero-conversion to malarial antigens to assess whether cases arise in communities with long
      term exposure to malarial parasites.
