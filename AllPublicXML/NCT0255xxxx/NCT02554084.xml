    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new instrument that takes digital images of tear
      film (a thin film that coats the eye that is made up of oil and water). The investigators are
      interested in measuring how the thickness of the tear film varies through time. The goal is
      to develop a technique that may enable non-invasive evaluation of Dry Eye Disease for future
      clinical diagnosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically diagnosed Dry Eye Disease

          -  Normal individuals (those without a dry eye diagnosis and without eye abnormalities)

          -  Good general health (defined by medication use that has not changed within the last
             month and the absence of medical conditions that are deemed confounding to the data as
             determined by the PI)

          -  Ability to give informed consent

          -  Willing to spend time for the study

          -  Either gender

          -  Any racial or ethnic origin

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any prescription ocular medication (such as but not limited to, glaucoma
             medications and Restasis) used within 14 days of the study visit

          -  Current eye disease, infection or inflammation that affects the surface of the eye
             such as, but not limited to blepharitis and ocular allergy

          -  Past eye surgery, such as, but not limited to, refractive surgery. Subjects who have
             had cataract surgery less than one year ago

          -  Use of soft or hard contact lenses 6 hours prior to visit

          -  Female subjects may not be pregnant or lactating (subjects will be asked to
             self-report these conditions)

          -  Infectious diseases (for example, hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immuno-suppressive
             disease (for example, HIV) (subjects will be asked to self-report these conditions)
