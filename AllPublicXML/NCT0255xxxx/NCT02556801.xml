    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess safety, tolerability and demonstrate a dose response
      signal using Total Symptom Score (TSS), based on challenges with grass pollen in an
      Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC), followed by estimation of the minimum effective dose of
      SUBLIVAC FIX Phleum (SP) after 10 months of treatment compared to placebo.

      The study has 4 treatment groups: 3 different doses of SP and placebo will be tested.
