      Its usefulness in implementing magnetic resonance angiography for postoperative follow-up of
      lymph lymphedema should try to evaluate and compare lymphoscintigraphy.

      Surgical methods include &quot; surgical procedure to make a good lymphatic drain 'and' surgical
      resection with lymph tissue swelling , significant that two of lymphedema .In recent years,
      began receiving the spotlight this former method using micro-surgery , inde essential that in
      order to increase the success rate of these micro-surgery accurately assess the structural
      abnormalities of preoperative lymphatic and establishing the surgical plan , the primary
      diagnostic imaging examination of existing lymphedema Since the nuclear medicine examination
      as to obtain an accurate anatomical information it is also ideal for imaging in the
      preoperative assessment of lymphedema is precisely that you can not .

      In contrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography recently developed a new magnetic resonance
      imaging techniques that many advantages in precision assessment of lymphedema patients.

      First, there are high spatial resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography through the
      lymphatic vessels to obtain the correct anatomical information .

      Second, magnetic resonance lymphangiography is provide not only information about the
      functional status of the lymphatic anatomical information .

      Third, the magnetic resonance lymphangiography minimally invasive techniques , without
      exposure to radiation , is relatively easy and safe , that there is a great advantage of
      being able to diagnose the structural and functional at the same time or later in lymphatic
      vessels.

      The magnetic resonance lymphangiography via the lymphatic advantage given also helps to
      establish a specific treatment plan , as well as accurate preoperative diagnosis of
      lymphedema that may contribute to enhance the success of micro-surgery.
