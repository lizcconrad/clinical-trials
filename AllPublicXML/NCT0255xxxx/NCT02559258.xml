  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, dose-
      escalation study in otherwise healthy cat-, dust mite-, or Bermuda grass-allergic male and
      female subjects. There will be five dosing cohorts (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg), with
      eight subjects in each cohort, randomized to either epsi-gam (6 subjects) or placebo (2
      subjects) for a total of 40 subjects. The first cohort will receive the starting dose of 0.1
      mg/kg epsi-gam or placebo and subsequent cohorts will be recruited sequentially to receive
      escalating doses of epsi-gam or placebo.

             18 years of age and no more than 65 years of age, inclusively, OR

          4. Be a healthy non-pregnant, non-lactating female of any race or ethnicity of

             expressed by allergic symptoms including rhinitis.

          7. Standardized cat allergenic extract (10,000 BAU/mL, ALK- Abello), dust mite allergenic
             extract (10,000 AU/mL, ALK- Abello), dust mite allergenic extract (10,000 AU/mL, ALK-
             Abello), or Bermuda grass allergenic extract (10,000 BAU/mL, ALK- Abello) elicits a
             wheal at least 5 mm up to approximately 10-15 mm in diameter that exceeds two diluent
             controls by at least 4 mm.

          8. Have allergen-specific IgE for cat, dust mite, or Bermuda grass as measured by
             ImmunoCAP® with a Class rating of 1 or greater.

          9. Histamine reactivity of 3 mm or greater, with surrounding erythema, on testing using a
