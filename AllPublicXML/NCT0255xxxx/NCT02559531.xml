      The Swiss Emergency Triage Scale (SETS) in used for triage in emergency departments in
      Switzerland, France and Belgium. No validated triage scale is actually used by Emergency
      Medical Service (EMS) providers. The objective of this project is to evaluate the reliability
      and performance of triage by EMS providers with the SETS.

      The Swiss Emergency Triage Scale (SETS) in used for triage in emergency departments in
      Switzerland, France and Belgium. No validated triage scale is actually used by EMS providers.
      The objective of this project is to evaluate the reliability and performance of triage by EMS
      providers with the SETS.

      In order to perform this evaluation a cohort of 22 EMS providers will evaluate 28
      standardized clinical scenarios using a computer simulator.
