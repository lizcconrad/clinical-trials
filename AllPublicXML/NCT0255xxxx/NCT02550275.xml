  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease is a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease. It is accompanied by
      movement disorders, cognitive and behavioral. The social behavior of patients are changed,
      affecting interpersonal relationships. Patients with Huntington's disease are described as
      self-centered, lacking sympathy and empathy and mentally inflexible. These behavioral
      problems can be a major source of anxiety for patients and their families. These disorders
      also have a negative impact cognitive and motor symptoms as well as the functional abilities
      and the quality of life of patients and their entourage. Authors have suggested that these
      problems could be related inter alia to social cognition disorders. This concept refers to a
      set of skills and emotional and social experiences that regulate relations between
      individuals and can explain the behavior of individuals and groups. The objective is to
      evaluate disorders of social cognition, which may account for behavioral changes in
      Huntington's disease.
