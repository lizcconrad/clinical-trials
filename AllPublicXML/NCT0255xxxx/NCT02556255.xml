    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the use of the Eximo's CathiTM
      hybrid catheter in subjects affected with Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) in lower extremity
      arteries.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center, international, open-label, non-randomized
      clinical study.

      All enrolled subjects will undergo atherectomy procedure, during which the CathiTM catheter
      will be used to perform atherectomy in target lesion, followed by any other adjunctive
      therapy (balloon and/or stent etc.). The procedure will be done according to standard
      hospital procedure for atherectomy. The steps of the operation before and after the operating
      of the CathiTM device are routinely used practice and will be done according to local
      practice at each hospital. For the post-atherectomy stage, as an adjunctive therapy in the
      procedure, any approved device may be used (balloon and/or stent etc.).

      Subjects will then be followed for 12 months after the procedure.
