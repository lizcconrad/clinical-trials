  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a observational study in a real-world setting, not requiring determining a dosage
      regimen, dose reduction criteria, rest period criteria and withdrawal criteria. The purpose
      of the study is to investigate the efficacy of eribulin as the first or second line
      chemotherapy to prolong overall survival and to explore factors affecting the survival in
      patients with HER2-negative hormone-resistant inoperable or recurrent metastatic breast
      cancer who scheduled to receive the first or second line chemotherapy in clinical practice in
      Japan. The total duration of the study will be a maximum of 5 years, consisting of 2-year
      enrollment period and 3-year observational period; the duration of patient participation will
      be 3 years. All patients will receive adequate treatment for breast cancer which selected by
      the primary physician after enrollment using the Japanese Breast Cancer Society Clinical
      Practice Guideline of Breast Cancer and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
      Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology. Investigators at the investigational sites will
      enter patient data into an electronic data capture (EDC) system up to the third chemotherapy
      in the study. The end of the study is defined as the time the last patient completes
      observational period. Patients will primarily be assessed by overall survival (OS) of the
      first line chemotherapy.
