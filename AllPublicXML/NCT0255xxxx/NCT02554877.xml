      The purpose of this study is to determine whether PF-06291874 is effective in the treatment
      T2DM

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double blind, stratified, placebo controlled, parallel group study
      conducted in T2DM subjects receiving background metformin therapy. Subjects will complete
      screening procedures to determine eligibility, followed by an 8 week metformin stabilization
      period prior to randomization. In addition, subjects taking other OADs, in combination with
      metformin, will undergo a washout during this period, in which non metformin OAD medications
      will be temporarily discontinued for the duration of the trial. Following confirmation of
      study eligibility criteria at randomization, subjects will be stratified into 2 groups based
      on the use of concomitant statin therapy. Each stratum will be randomized across treatment
      groups, such that the number of subjects taking concomitant statin therapy and those not
      taking statin therapy will be approximately balanced across treatment groups.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 119</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reasons: death; life threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. An HAE was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. Any events occurring following start of treatment (defined as blinded therapy, including single blind placebo administration on Day 14) or increasing in severity were counted as treatment emergent AE.</description>

    <description>Triglycerides percent change from baseline (defined as the mean of Day 14 and Day 1 pre-dose) at Weeks 2,4,8 and 12. n represented the available number of participants for analysis at post-baseline days. Triglycerides MMRM was not appropriate as the data were very skewed and not normally distributed, therefore per SAP non-parametric analysis were reported, presenting medians and CIs for medians, instead. If the data had many outliers even after the log transformation the following non parametric analysis was presented instead of the MMRM. An outlier was defined as any data point falling outside of 3.5 x standard deviations the median.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a study drug; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reasons: death; life threatening (immediate risk of death); initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect. An HAE was identified by characteristic symptoms or blood glucose levels. Any events occurring following start of treatment (defined as blinded therapy, including single blind placebo administration on Day 14) or increasing in severity were counted as treatment emergent AE.</description>

        <title>Percent Changes From Baseline for Triglycerides at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
        <description>Triglycerides percent change from baseline (defined as the mean of Day 14 and Day 1 pre-dose) at Weeks 2,4,8 and 12. n represented the available number of participants for analysis at post-baseline days. Triglycerides MMRM was not appropriate as the data were very skewed and not normally distributed, therefore per SAP non-parametric analysis were reported, presenting medians and CIs for medians, instead. If the data had many outliers even after the log transformation the following non parametric analysis was presented instead of the MMRM. An outlier was defined as any data point falling outside of 3.5 x standard deviations the median.</description>

        <population>All participants randomized and who received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment, participants were assigned to the randomized treatment regardless of what treatment was received. n represented the available number of participants for analysis at post-baseline days.</population>

          <title>Percent Changes From Baseline for Triglycerides at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12</title>
          <description>Triglycerides percent change from baseline (defined as the mean of Day 14 and Day 1 pre-dose) at Weeks 2,4,8 and 12. n represented the available number of participants for analysis at post-baseline days. Triglycerides MMRM was not appropriate as the data were very skewed and not normally distributed, therefore per SAP non-parametric analysis were reported, presenting medians and CIs for medians, instead. If the data had many outliers even after the log transformation the following non parametric analysis was presented instead of the MMRM. An outlier was defined as any data point falling outside of 3.5 x standard deviations the median.</description>
          <population>All participants randomized and who received at least 1 dose of randomized treatment, participants were assigned to the randomized treatment regardless of what treatment was received. n represented the available number of participants for analysis at post-baseline days.</population>
