    <textblock>
      A 200 mg tablet formulation of KD025 is being developed at Quotient Clinical to replace the
      capsule formulation. This Phase I study will evaluate the clinical performance of the tablet
      formulation in the fasted and fed states, in comparison to the capsule formulation in the fed
      state.
