      An Observational, Prospective Cohort Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of RemsimaTM in
      Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the long-term safety of Remsima™ in
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients by evaluation of events of special interest (ESI) up to 5
      years and to exploratory compare patients receiving Remsima™ with patients receiving
      non-biologic treatments or other anti-TNF drugs.

      In order to assess the primary study outcomes, the following ESI will be evaluated:

        -  Hepatitis B virus reactivation

        -  Congestive heart failure

        -  Opportunistic infection (excluding tuberculosis)

        -  Serious infections including sepsis (excluding opportunistic infections and
           tuberculosis)

        -  Tuberculosis (TB)

        -  Serum sickness (delayed hypersensitivity reactions)

        -  Haematologic reactions

        -  Systemic lupus erythematosus/lupus like syndrome

        -  Demyelinating disorders

        -  Lymphoma (not HSTCL)

        -  Hepatobiliary events

        -  Hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL)

        -  Serious infusion reactions during a re-induction regimen following disease flare

        -  Sarcoidosis/sarcoid-like reactions

        -  Leukaemia

        -  Malignancy (excluding lymphoma)

        -  Skin cancer

        -  Pregnancy exposure†

        -  Infusion reaction associated with shortened infusion duration

        -  Others

      The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate efficacy. Further, additional safety
      of Remsima™ in RA patients, in comparison with patients receiving non-biologic treatments or
      other anti-TNF drugs. Health-economics parameters will also be assessed.

      Blood samples for immunogenicity should be retained at the central laboratory up to the End
      of the Study, in case additional analysis is required. If additional analysis is not required
      during the study or after the End of the Study, blood samples will be stored in a CELLTRION,
      Inc. or designated biobank for a further 5 years (from the date the sample is transferred to
      the CELLTRION, Inc. or biobank) unless a specific authorization is given by CELLTRION, Inc.
