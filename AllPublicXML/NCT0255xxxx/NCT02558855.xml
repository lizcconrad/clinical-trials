  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine how different physical therapy interventions
      affect the resting state and contraction state of a certain abdominal muscle in patients with
      low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with low back pain (LBP) will undergo ultrasound imaging of the transversus
      abdominis to measure the muscle thickness at rest and at the contracted state prior to
      intervention and again immediately after intervention. In this randomized controlled trial,
      patients will be randomized into one of two groups. One group will receive the intervention
      of thrust joint manipulation of the lumbar spine and the other group will receive the
      intervention of non-thrust joint manipulation of the lumbar spine.
