    <textblock>
      The subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a relatively severe disease whose prognosis is
      particularly related to the early onset of arterial vasospasm, maximum between the 5th and
      14th day after SAH. Many obstacles make it difficult screening and monitoring of such
      complication. The challenge is to be able to demonstrate a reduction in regional cerebral
      blood flow before the onset of irreversible parenchymal sequelae, responsible for the
      majority of long-term morbidity among survivors. In clinical routine, screening vasospasm is
      achieved by Doppler intracranial arteries (DTC). However, its sensitivity is poor with regard
      to the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. The gold standard for diagnosis is cerebral
      arteriography. However, vasospasm in arteriography or trans-cranial Doppler does not
      prejudice the appearance of a delayed ischemic deficit.
