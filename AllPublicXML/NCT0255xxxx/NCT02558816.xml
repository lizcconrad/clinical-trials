      This is an open label, multicenter, fixed dose and dose escalation, phase I/II study.

      The study will be conducted into 3 steps. The first one will be to ensure the safety of the
      combination of Obinutuzumab (GA101) and Ibrutinib at fixed doses in patients with relapsed or
      refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

      A total of 9 patients will be included in this first step (step A) with grouped inclusions of
      three patients (a safety evaluation will be performed at each inclusion of 3 patients).

      The second step (step B) will be conducted if no unacceptable toxicity is observed during the
      first step and 24 new patients will be included in the step B. The aim of the second step is
      to determine the MTD of the GDC-0199 in combination of GA101 and Ibrutinib (both respecting
      the previous doses) by using a Continual Reassessment Method.

      The third step (step C) will be conducted if no unacceptable toxicity is observed during the
      second step. The aim of the third step is to confirm the safety profile of the combination of
      GA101 + Ibrutininb + GDC-199 at dose determined according to step B result in patients with
      untreated Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). 15 patients will be included in this step.

      The study will be conducted into 3 steps for respecting the optimal safety of the OASIS
      trial:

      Step A :

      The primary objective of step A is to evaluate the safety of the combination of GA101 +
      Ibrutinib at fixed doses (560 mg per day of Ibrutinib + 1000 mg of GA101), in patients with
      relapsed or refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination of GA101 and Ibrutinib in terms of clinical
           benefits response (overall response rate, complete response rate, partial response rate
           Cheson 99 and 07 criteria and Working Group Revised Response Criteria for Malignant
           Lymphomas 14), overall survival, progression free survival.

        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of GA101 and Ibrutinib

        -  To establish a bio-bank to explore biomarkers and mechanisms of action including
           resistance

      Step B :

      This study will be performed conditionally to the observation of no unacceptable toxicity in
      patients included in the step A.

      The primary objective of this step is to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      GDC-0199 in addition to the GA101 and Ibrutinib in relapsed refractory MCL patients by using
      a Continual Reassessment Method (CRM).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination GA101, Ibrutinib and GDC-0199 in terms of
           clinical benefits response (overall response rate, complete response rate, partial
           response rate Cheson 99 and 07 criteria and Working Group Revised Response Criteria for
           Malignant Lymphomas 14), overall survival, progression-free survival.

        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of the novel combination of GDC-0199, GA101 and
           Ibrutinib

        -  To establish a bio-bank to explore biomarkers and mechanism of action including
           resistance

      Step C :

      This step will be conducted if no unacceptable toxicity is observed during the second step.

      The primary objective of this step is to confirm the safety of the combination of GA101 +
      Ibrutinib + GDC-199 at fixed doses (560 mg/d of Ibrutinib + 1000 mg of GA101, GDC-199 doses
      will be determinated according to step B result), in patients with untreated Mantle Cell
      Lymphoma (MCL), at end of Cycle 2.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  To describe the efficacy of the combination GA101, Ibrutinib and GDC-0199 in terms of
           clinical benefits response (overall response rate, complete response rate, partial
           response rate cheson 99 and 07 criteria and Working Group Revised Response Criteria for
           Malignant Lymphomas 14), overall survival, progression-free survival.

        -  To describe the safety and tolerability of the novel combination of GDC-0199, GA101 and
           Ibrutinib

        -  To establish a bio-bank to explore biomarkers and mechanism of action including
           resistance
