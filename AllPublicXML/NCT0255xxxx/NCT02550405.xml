      This project aims to (1) investigate behavioral and neural factors (e.g., emotional factors
      such as craving and cognitive factors such as decision-making)) associated with Internet
      addiction (mainly Internet gaming disorder ;IGD); (2) develop an tailored intervention (named
      craving behavioral intervention; CBI) for IGD based previous evidence; (3) evaluate the
      behavioral and neural effects of CBI on individuals with IGD. This project in implemented in
      Beijing, China, based on a relatively large sample of young adults with IGD. It will advance
      the investigators' understanding of the characters associated with IGD and the mechanisms
      underlying the psychological-based interventions in the field of IGD, as well as other
      addictive disorder. Moreover, this study will also shed new light on the development of more
      effective interventions.

    <description>The CBI was given once a week for 6 weeks, conducted by four therapists. A pair of therapists was randomly assigned to a CBI+ group. Each session included 5 parts in 2.5-3 hours: warming-up exercise, discussion about the homework from the last session, main structured activity, brief summary, and the homework assignment. There were 6 sessions with each focused on a topic: recognize craving and its relationship with IGD; reduce craving through ameliorating the salience of cues and irrational beliefs, withdrawal symptoms and other negative affects; enhance self-monitoring and control for craving through time management training; relieve fulÔ¨Ållment of psychological needs through Internet use and attenuate the relation between craving and gaming behaviors through coping skill training</description>
