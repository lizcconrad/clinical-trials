      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of BG00012 in subjects
      who completed Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200). Secondary objectives are as follows: To evaluate
      the long-term efficacy of BG00012 and to describe the long-term Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
      outcomes in subjects who completed Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200).

    <measure>The degree of disability progression from baseline as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The EDSS measures disability status on a scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Scoring is based on measures of impairment in eight functional systems on examination by a neurologist. Disability is measured as at least a 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS â‰¥1.0 that is sustained for 24 weeks, or at least a 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS = 0 that is sustained for 24 weeks.</description>

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability of parents, legal guardians, and/or subjects to understand the purpose and
             risks of the study and provide signed and dated informed consent and authorization to
             use confidential health information in accordance with national and local subject
             privacy regulations. Subjects will provide assent in addition to the parental or
             guardian consent, as appropriate, per local regulations.

          -  Subjects who completed, as per protocol, the previous BG00012 clinical study 109MS202
             (NCT02410200) and remain on BG00012 treatment.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with study requirements, including the presence
             of any condition (physical, mental, or social) that is likely to affect the subject's
             ability to comply with the protocol.

          -  Any significant changes in medical history occurring after enrollment in the parent
             Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200), including laboratory test abnormalities or current
             clinically significant conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator would have
             excluded the subject's participation from the parent study. The Investigator must
             re-review the subject's medical fitness for participation and consider any factors
             that would preclude treatment.

          -  Subjects from Study 109MS202 (NCT02410200) who could not tolerate study treatment.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
