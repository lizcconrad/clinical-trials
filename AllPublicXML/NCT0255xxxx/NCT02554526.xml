  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using whole blood samples and plasma samples obtained from some hemophilia A patients with
      inhibitors, the investigators will perform the coagulation assessment in the co-presence of
      aPCC and factor VIII by comprehensive coagulation assays and flow chamber analysis under
      blood flow conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comprehensive coagulation assays using recently popular rotational thromboelastometry
      (ROTEM), factor Xa/thrombin/plasmin generation test, and coagulation wave analysis and
      recently developed flow chamber system under blood flow conditions (T-TAS®) will be used. A
      bypassing agent, aPCC (Feiba®) and recombinant factor VIII (Advate®) will be added ex vivo to
      whole blood and plasma samples from patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors to compare
      with the coagulation effects of aPCC in the presence of factor VIII and those of aPCC in its
      absence under the conditions close to the physiological condition. Furthermore, the
      difference in the coagulation effects by the difference in inhibitor epitopes will be
      examined.

        We guess that there are approximately 200-300 hemophilia A patients with inhibitors in our
        country. We have approximately 20 out-patients in our hospital. Based on this information,
        we set up the patients subjects (n=10).
