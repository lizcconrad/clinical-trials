  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1, single-dose study will be conducted in adult female subjects (N = 16) who are
      in general good health and selected for participation in the study according to the selection
      criteria. This study will assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of PT2385
      Tablets. The study will consist of two periods and will be conducted in a crossover fashion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to two sequences of meal conditions (fasting and
      non-fasting). Serial blood samples will be collected for after dose administration in each
      period. Subjects will be confined at the clinical research for a portion of each period.
