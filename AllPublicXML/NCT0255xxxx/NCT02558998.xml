      The objective of this study is to 1) evaluate the impact of a novel individualized care
      planning/ educational technology (the On Q Care Planning System or CPS) on oncology patient
      and provider knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC)
      clinical trials, as well as 2) to evaluate the impact of the On Q CPS on patient referral to
      and enrollment in NSCLC clinical trials.
