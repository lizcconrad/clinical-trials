    <textblock>
      In this study hemodialysis patients that underwent dialysis thrice weekly screen for uremic
      pruritus and 80 patients that at least have refractive pruritus that lead to sleep and daily
      activity disorders enroll in this study. These patients should have at least a course of
      therapy without proper response. After proper informing patients and taking testimonial
      patients enter to study. Then patients randomized in case and control group. In case group,
      patients took montelukast 10 milligram daily and in control group took placebo for 30 days.
      Other antipruritic or antiinflammatory medication has been stopped one week prior to starting
      treatment. Calcium, phosphorous, urea, creatinine, highly sensitive CRP (hsCRP), Parathyroid
      Hormone (PTH), hemoglobin and kt/V were measured at beginning and at end of study. pruritus
      severity assessed by Detailed Pruritus Score that introduced by Duo and Visual Analogue Score
      in beginning and at end of study in both group. Sleep disorder score and its severity added
      to crude score at beginning and end of study and change of measures analyzed.
