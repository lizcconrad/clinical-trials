      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of letrozole on ovulation induction to that
      of clomiphene citrate in women suffering polycystic ovary syndrome.

      Research question:

      In women with PCOS , dose letrozole effective in ovulation induction as clomiphene citrate?

      Researcher hypothesis:

      In women with pcos , letrozole may be as effective as clomiphene citrate in ovulation
      induction.

      Patients and methods Site: this study will be recruited from women attending infertility
      outpatient clinic at Ain Shams university maternity hospital.

             -  The patients will randomly assigned to receive either letrozole (2.5 mg twice daily
                ) or clomiphene citrate (50 mg twice daily ) from day 2 to day 6 of menstrual cycle
                .

             -  Follicular monitoring will be done by transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) on
                alternate days from day 9 of menstrual cycle until a mature follicle detected.
                Follicle considered mature when it attained 18 mm in size or more by averaging
                inner two diameters of the follicle.

             -  A single injection of 10,000 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) will be given,
                if at least one follicle attained 18 mm. TVS will be done after 48 h of hCG
                injection to determine follicle rupture. If the follicle found unruptured, TVS
                repeated after 72 h of the hCG injection to detect whether follicle has ruptured or
                not. Ovulation ascertained by observing rupture of the follicle by ultrasonogram
                (USG).

             -  Endometrial thickness of 8 mm considered a satisfactory response of the
                endometrium.

             -  on day 21 serum progesterone level will measured. A progesterone level of 10 ng/ml
                considered as ovulatory.

           PARAMETERS

           Primary outcome measure :

      (1) Rate of ovulation assessed by number of mature follicles produced per cycle .

      Secondary outcome measures :

      (2) Serum progesterone level on day 21 ( assessed up to 24 weeks). (3) Mean endometrial
      thickness ( assessed up to 24 weeks). (4) Chemical pregnancy ( assessed up to 24 weeks). (5)
      Ongoing pregnancy ( assessed up to 24 weeks).
