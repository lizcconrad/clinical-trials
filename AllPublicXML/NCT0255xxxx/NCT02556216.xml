  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone and mineral disease is a key problem in patients with kidney disease. The available
      clinical parameters are non-specific, unproven for the assessment of the bone metabolism and
      do not reflect the complexity and diversity of the underlying bone pathology. The aim of this
      study is to use bone histology, novel bone markers and bone imaging results to establish a
      reliable decision model (diagnostic tool) that can be used to guide the individual therapy.

      Bone and mineral disease is a key problem in patients with kidney disease. The available
      clinical parameters are non-specific, unproven for the assessment of the bone metabolism and
      do not reflect the complexity and diversity of the underlying bone pathology.

      In this study bone histology parameters including results of tetracycline labeling will be
      compared to non-invasive parameters of bone metabolism (e.g. sclerostin, calciprotein
      particles) and bone structure obtained by imaging (e.g. bone density).

      The aim of the study is to establish a reliable decision model (diagnostic tool) with these
      non-invasive parameters that can be used to guide the individual therapy. The decision model
      will be based on single calculations of the area under the curve for each parameter,
      including determination of the optimal cutpoint, sensitivity and specificity. These results
      will be integrated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. The resulting model will
      enable to calculate the individual probability of the underlying bone diagnosis as a single
      value (without a specific dimension).

    <description>After determining the AUC, sensitivity, specificity and optimal cutpoint for each parameter, a logistic regression model is created which gives the probability of the underlying bone diagnosis as a single probability value.
In this cross-sectional studies each patient gets a one-time assessment of radiologic and blood parameters of bone metabolism obtained within one week. Accuracy is described by the performance measures sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, negative and positive predictive values.</description>
