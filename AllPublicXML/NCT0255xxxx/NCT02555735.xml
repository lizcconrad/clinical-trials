  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study enrolling patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer to
      identify genomic differences between exceptional responder and non-responders to standard of
      care chemotherapy. Data analysis of the gene expression profile of the exceptional responders
      compared to non-responders will define genomic patterns that may help understand their
      response to chemotherapy.

      This is an observational study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer to identify
      genomic differences obtained from their circulating tumor cells between exceptional
      responders and non-responders to standard of care chemotherapy. This study requires a 10 mL
      heparinized peripheral blood sample from each study participant at the time of enrollment to
      isolate, enrich and profile circulating tumor cells. Data analysis of the gene expression
      profile will define genomic patterns using Nearest Template Prediction for a predetermined
      panel of therapeutic agents based on standard of care. Chemotherapy selection is
      physician-choice. Information regarding disease progression will be gathered. Data analysis
      will be performed in study participants in the setting of ongoing disease progression.
