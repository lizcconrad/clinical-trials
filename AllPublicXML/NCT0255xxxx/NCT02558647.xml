      This first aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a cost-effective, more accessible
      alternative treatment approach for insomniacs. Traditional CBT-I has been adapted to an
      online intervention system, so individuals can access a personalized treatment when they
      want. This newly developed web-based computer technology has produced remarkable preliminary
      results, comparable to the results one can achieve when delivering CBT-I in a face-to-face
      format. The current project will test this approach for use on a population scale. Of the 13
      500 participants reporting symptoms of insomnia in HUNT3, 1500 will be randomized into CBT-I
      or a placebo control group. The large scale of this trial will allow detailed analyses of
      subgroups (insomniacs with comorbid conditions), which has not been possible in the previous
      small clinical trials. The upcoming HUNT4 in 2017-2018 will together with data from FD-Trygd
      provide unique long-term FU-data on both a range of health parameters and employment status.
      The second aim is to use the HUNT3 Biobank to examine how genes may be related to insomnia.
      Our study will also be the first of its kind to examine if genes may predict the outcome for
      individuals in the treatment study.
