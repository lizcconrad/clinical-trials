  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary care provides a means by which to connect evidence-based interventions with patients;
      however, many interventions have been evaluated using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in
      non-healthcare settings.

      The primary objective is to conduct a pilot study to determine the effect of evidence-based
      interventions delivered in primary care clinic settings on parent-teen communication about
      alcohol use, sexual health, and safe driving.

      Eligible participants are healthy adolescent patients from the Children's Hospital of
      Philadelphia (CHOP) primary care network with a well-child visit scheduled between the ages
      of 14 to 17 years with one parent willing to participate. Adolescents that hold an
      intermediate driver's license, that are pregnant, or that have pervasive development disorder
      or a developmental delay are excluded from this study.

      Parents will be given written psychoeducational intervention materials on communicating with
      their adolescents about alcohol use, sexual health, or safe driving (e.g.,booklets, tip sheet
      brochures, activity workbooks, web links), receive coaching about using the intervention
      materials, and provider endorsement of the materials during the well-child visit, as well as
      follow-up phone health coaching 2 weeks after the appointment.

      The primary endpoints are evaluating the difference between the intervention and control
      groups on parent-teen communication on the targeted health topics.
