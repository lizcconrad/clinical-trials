  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a serious disease with a dismal prognosis when left untreated.
      Advances in medical therapy have improved survival according to recent registries and
      systematic reviews, but are associated with high healthcare costs.

      Earlier studies in Heidelberg, Germany showed good evidence for the effect of exercise
      training on improving exercise performance, quality of life and pulmonary hemodynamics in
      patients with pulmonary hypertension.

      The main objectives of the present project are:

        1. to investigate the quality of the implementation of a standardized 3 week in-hospital
           exercise training program on markers of outcome and disease severity in PH-patients in
           Switzerland immediately after training and after 3 and 12 month.

        2. to look whether training with hyperoxia vs. standard care might be more effective.

      This is a multicentre, randomized parallel-group trial where the intervention rehabilitation
      is delayed in one group so that they can serve as standard care controls for the others.

      In a nested single-centre randomized-controlled trial patent will additionally be randomized
      to receive either usual rehabilitation (UR) or rehabilitation with standardized supplemental
      oxygen therapy (SSOT) during nights and ergometer training.

      Patients will receive a PH specific rehabilitation program during 3 weeks followed by an
      instructed home-based training program for 12 weeks. Patients who are not already under
      long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) due to daytime hypoxemia will additionally be randomized to
      receive standardized supplemental oxygen therapy (SSOT) during training and nights upon
      written informed consent.
