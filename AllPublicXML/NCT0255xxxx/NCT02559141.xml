    <textblock>
      The Nexfin monitoring system offers a complete non-invasive approach to a continuously
      estimation of blood pressure, CI and PPV by means of finger-cuff based pulse contour
      analysis. Several clinical investigations have proven reliability and interchangeability of
      the Nexfin technology yielding acceptable results especially regarding the trending
      abilities. At present there is no evidence available, whether a early goal directed
      hemodynamic optimization protocol based on a completely non-invasive monitoring technology is
      able to reduce postoperative complication. Therefore, the aim of this single-center study is
      to compare the clinical outcome and postoperative complications of patients undergoing major
      colorectal surgery treated with standard of care or with a GDT protocol based on the Nexfin
      technology.

      The Nexfin™ monitoring system is able to provide continuous beat-to-beat stroke volume index
      (SVI), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), cardiac index (CI) and
      arterial pressure by using an inflatable finger cuff. This system consists of a frequency
      dependent transfer function for calculation of brachial artery pressure from the finger
      artery pressure.

      Major surgery bares the risk of concealed hypoperfusion and therefore possible mismatch in
      oxygen delivery and oxygen demand. It must be noted, that the &quot;basic&quot; perioperative
      monitoring, i.e. electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation and non-invasive or invasive blood
      pressure measurements is not able to accurately detect hypovolemia and ongoing organ
      hypoperfusion. Perioperatively, patients undergoing major abdominal surgery are prone to high
      risk of hemodynamic instabilities and consequently relevant changes in oxygen delivery,
      associated with an increase in postoperative complications and length of stay in hospital.
      Over the last years several studies focused on early goal directed hemodynamic therapy (GDT)
      with strong proof for the feasibility of such algorithms and the improvement in patient's
      outcome with respect to certain clinical scenarios.However, there is still a debate regarding
      an individualized GDT approach, based on pre-procedural defined individualized hemodynamic
      goals yielded by an advanced haemodynamic monitoring technology. We do have to distinguish
      which monitoring system, invasive to non-invasive, matches the kind of estimated risk at what
      time best.
