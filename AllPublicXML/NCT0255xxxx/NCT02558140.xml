  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study consists of three parts. The primary purpose of Part 1 is to
      characterize the safety and tolerability of RO6874813 in participants with locally advanced
      and/or metastatic solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy or for
      whom no standard therapy exists. In addition, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. In Part 2 the safety and tolerability of
      RO6874813 will continue to be characterized in participants with locally advanced and/or
      metastatic solid tumors known to be fibroblast activation protein-alpha positive (FAP+). In
      addition, treatment-induced efficacy of RO6874813 will be assessed by functional imaging and
      paired tumor biopsies. The primary purpose of Part 3 is to demonstrate anti-tumor activity of
      RO6874813 in participants with recurrent or metastatic FAP+ sarcomas.
