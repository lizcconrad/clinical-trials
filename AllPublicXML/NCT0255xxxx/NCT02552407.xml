  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During primary percutaneous coronary intervention, distal embolization of thrombus and
      impaired microvascular perfusion has been associated with an increased mortality.
      Thrombectomy devices during primary percutaneous coronary intervention may prevent distal
      embolization by reducing thrombus burden and thus improve microvascular perfusion and reduce
      mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An individual patient meta-analysis of large randomized controlled trials comparing manual
      thrombectomy versus percutaneous coronary intervention alone in patients with ST elevation
      myocardial infarction will provide significantly more power to detect differences in
      mortality as well as important but rare events such as stroke and to assess benefits in
      pre-defined subgroups.
