  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will enroll women with palpable cancers to assess the
      accuracy of the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) and concomitant procedure as a vehicle to
      optimize and validate the approach in surgical cases where the new device will not
      substantially alter or modify the standard-of-care procedure before initiating an evaluative
      trial of the BCL in non palpable breast cancer cases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to test whether the Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) accurately defines
      the edges of the cancer. Twenty patients with palpable invasive breast cancer will undergo
      preoperative supine MRI, creation of a BCL, and breast conserving surgery using the BCL as an
      adjunct to palpation-guided tumor resection. Participants will also have the tumor position
      on their skin localized with the supine MR/optical scan/tracker method. The primary objective
      is to measure the distance from the center of the spots made by the BCL to the cancer edges.

    <description>The Breast Cancer Locator (BCL) uses 3D printing to create a bra-like plastic form that matches the breast surface when the patient is in the supine MRI (and surgical) position. This locator will be constructed pre-operatively, sterilized and provided to the surgeon at the time of procedure.</description>

    <description>This locator will be constructed pre-operatively, sterilized and provided to the surgeon at the time of procedure. The outline of the breast cancer on the breast surface at the point where the cancer is closest to the skin is built into the locator, so that the surgeon can simply apply the locator to the patient's breast and trace the tumor outline on the skin.</description>
