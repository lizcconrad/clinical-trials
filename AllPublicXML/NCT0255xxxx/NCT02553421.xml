    <textblock>
      This study will examine the use of the ivWatch Model 400 to monitor PIV sites in pediatric
      patients. Half the participants will be monitored by the device without infiltration
      notifications and the other half will be monitored by the device with infiltration
      notifications enabled.

    <measure>Time Infiltration Detected by Nurse</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of intravenous therapy, an expected duration of up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in time to detection between the clinician and the ivWatch device is measured from the non-alarming group. This measurement reveals how much earlier the infiltration could have been detected by the ivWatch device compared to the clinician assessments. This metric is measured using the patients in the non-alarming group since an infiltration notification by the ivWatch device could bias the clinician's diagnosis.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Infiltration Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of intravenous therapy, an expected duration of up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The infiltration sensitivity is defined as the percentage of the clinician-confirmed infiltrations that are detected by the ivWatch device before the clinician's diagnosis. This metric is measured and reported separately for non-alarming and alarming groups, since an infiltration notification by the ivWatch device could bias the clinician's diagnosis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Notification Rate of ivWatch Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of intravenous therapy, an expected duration of up to 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>The notification rate is defined as the number of ivWatch device infiltration notifications issued in a certain amount of time, typically reported in units of notifications per day. The notification rate is the number of notifications per day, excluding cases with clinician confirmed infiltrations. This metric is measured using the subjects in the alarming group since the number of notifications could potentially depend on how quickly nurses reset the device.</description>

The goal of this small pilot study is to give clinicians an opportunity to perform the protocol and operate the ivWatch device and to give researchers the ability to make adjustments prior to starting the subsequent non-alarming group.</description>

        <title>Infiltration Sensitivity</title>
        <description>The infiltration sensitivity is defined as the percentage of the clinician-confirmed infiltrations that are detected by the ivWatch device before the clinician’s diagnosis. This metric is measured and reported separately for non-alarming and alarming groups, since an infiltration notification by the ivWatch device could bias the clinician’s diagnosis.</description>

        <title>Notification Rate of ivWatch Device</title>
        <description>The notification rate is defined as the number of ivWatch device infiltration notifications issued in a certain amount of time, typically reported in units of notifications per day. The notification rate is the number of notifications per day, excluding cases with clinician confirmed infiltrations. This metric is measured using the subjects in the alarming group since the number of notifications could potentially depend on how quickly nurses reset the device.</description>
