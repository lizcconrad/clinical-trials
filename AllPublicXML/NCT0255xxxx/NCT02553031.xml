      This study will explore the potential value in proper therapeutic decision and clinical
      outcome prediction by using integrated MR-PET system and advanced MR techniques in patients
      with colorectal cancer.

      This research expect that the image techniques and experience in this cancer group may be
      valuable and helpful for others. With advantage of MR-PET in better soft tissue
      delineation/functional information and less radiation dose than PET-CT, the ultimate goal in
      both research and clinical application is to establish new diagnostic standard and management
      guideline by MR-PET, which can further improve clinical outcome and disease prognosis in
      patients colorectal cancer.
