  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to assess whether supplementation of Omega 3/6 fatty acids improves
      mainstream schoolchildren's reading ability. The secondary objective was to assess whether
      Omega 3/6 improves cognitive functions such as attention, memory, learning,
      language/communication, problem solving and social ability.This was a 3-month randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by one-way crossover (placebo to active
      treatment) for an additional 3 months. Mainstream schoolchildren aged 9-10 years were
      initially randomised to receive three Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily or identical placebo.
      All outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. The primary outcome
      measure was the LOGOS test, a comprehensive test battery for evaluating reading abilities.
      Secondary outcome measures were the parent-rated Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) Rating Scale-IV, 5-15 scale (domains of learning, memory, language/communication and
      problem solving); Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (to evaluate social ability)

      This was a 3-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (Period 1) followed by
      one-way crossover (placebo to active treatment) for an additional 3 months (Period 2).
      Participants were randomized to receive three Omega 3/6 capsules twice daily (corresponding
      to a daily dose of 558 mg EPA, 174 mg DHA, and 60 mg gamma-linolenic acid) or identical
      placebo capsules (palm oil). All daily doses were taken at home supervised by the parents.
      All outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits.
      The participants were mainstream schoolchildren in the 3rd school year (aged 9-10 years).
      Exclusion criteria were continuous supplementation of Omega-3 fatty acids for periods longer
      than 1 month during the previous year, significant medical conditions (e.g. diabetes,
      epilepsy), intellectual disability, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
      diagnosis, psychoactive medication, or substance use.
