    <textblock>
      The aim of this feasibility study is to provide data for a subsequent randomized controlled
      trial to investigate if patient outcomes will be improved after an acute COPD exacerbation
      using domiciliary nasal high flow therapy (NHF) compared to standard care. This feasibility
      study will investigate the following: process, resources, management and scientific aspects
      of delivering NHF as an adjunct therapy in COPD patients.
