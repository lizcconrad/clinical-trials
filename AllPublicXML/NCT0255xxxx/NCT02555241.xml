    <measure>Change in Mean Length of Utterances (MLU) during manding</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Up to 24 Weeks), End of Standard Treatment (Up to 36 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The mean length of utterances (MLU) during manding will be evaluated in a 10 minute probe. The goal of intervention is to increase of MLU to an average of 3 words per mand.</description>

    <measure>Acquisition of noun-verb and color-shape combinations during tacting</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Up to 24 Weeks), End of Standard Treatment (Up to 36 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of intervention is mastery of 80% of evaluated noun-verb and color-shape targets.</description>

    <measure>Emergence of intraverbal responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Up to 24 Weeks), End of Standard Treatment (Up to 36 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of intervention is the mastery of 80% of evaluated intraverbal responses (2 for each target, 18 total).</description>

    <measure>Change in Macarthur Bates-Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Up to 24 Weeks), End of Standard Treatment (Up to 36 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Macarthur Bates-Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) is completed by a parent/caregiver and evaluates current word use . A higher score indicates the use of more words.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Observe overall improvements in pragmatic language within social/play interactions with parents/caregivers, as measured on the Direct Observation of Spoken Language (DOSL).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Up to 24 Weeks), End of Standard Treatment (Up to 36 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A goal of the intervention is to observe an increase in spontaneous mands, an increase in spontaneous tacts, as well as an increase in intraverbal responses.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>One Baseline Session</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Designated for participants #1 and #2. Participants complete 1 Baseline Session followed immediately by 12 weeks of standard treatment. Standard treatment will require the participant to attend clinic-based treatment sessions for 1 hour per day, 3 days per week, for 12 weeks. Standard treatment will consist of 3 components: mand training, matrix training, and stimulus equivalence training.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Two Baseline Sessions</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Designated for participants #3 and #4. Participants complete a Baseline Session followed by a 12 week wait period before repeating a Baseline Session followed immediately by 12 weeks of standard treatment. Standard treatment will require the participant to attend clinic-based treatment sessions for 1 hour per day, 3 days per week, for 12 weeks. Standard treatment will consist of 3 components: mand training, matrix training, and stimulus equivalence training.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Three Baseline Sessions</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Designated for participants #5 and #6. Participants complete a Baseline Session followed by two repetitions of the Baseline Session (each 12 weeks apart) and 12 weeks of standard treatment immediately following the third session. Standard treatment will require the participant to attend clinic-based treatment sessions for 1 hour per day, 3 days per week, for 12 weeks. Standard treatment will consist of 3 components: mand training, matrix training, and stimulus equivalence training.</description>
