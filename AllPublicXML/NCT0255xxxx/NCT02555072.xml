  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV study cohort, uncontrolled, composed of two segments: children and healthy
      adults. It will be included 2756 children and 2005 adults, evaluated initially in six
      different times (before vaccination, 30-45 days, 1 year, 4 years, 7 years and 10 years after
      vaccination). The Paraiba state was selected for the study because in this region there are
      no yellow fever virus dissemination and therefore no NIP recommendation for people's routine
      vaccination. However, the NIP indicate yellow fever vaccination for individuals who are
      moving to areas with virus circulation. The study will take place in six (6) Basic Health
      Units of three (3) municipalities (2 units per municipality) in the state of Paraíba. The
      selected municipalities are: Alhambra, Caaporã and Conde. The study target population
      consisted of healthy children and adults of both sexes. Children must be between 9 months and
      4 years,11months and 29 days; adults between 18 and 50 years. It will be eligible for the
      study, people who have never received the yellow fever vaccine checked in vaccine design and
      history and who agree to participate. Not be included participants with any contraindication
      to vaccination against yellow fever and individuals who previously moved to risk areas for
      extended periods. The study main objective is to assess the immune status of children and
      adults who have never vaccinated, they will receive the first dose of 17DD yellow fever
      vaccine provided by the study and will be monitored for 10 years. Depending on the results of
      the analyzed of the data, the period of monitoring may be extended.
