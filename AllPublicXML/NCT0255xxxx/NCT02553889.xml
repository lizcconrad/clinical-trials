        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  End stage renal disease maintained on outpatient hemodialysis at a healthcare center
             for &gt; 3 months from screening with hemodialysis using heparin (unfractionated heparin
             or low-molecular weight heparin) 3 times per week for a minimum of 3 hours per
             dialysis session and plan to continue this throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented thrombotic event (acute coronary syndrome, stroke or transient ischemic
             attack, venous thromboembolic event) in the past 3 months.

          -  Active bleeding within the past 3 months from screening or documented bleeding
