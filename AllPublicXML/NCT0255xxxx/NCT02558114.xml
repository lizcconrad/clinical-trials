    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy, safety and recurrence rate of two
      therapeutic strategies with ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis E and severe acute
      hepatitis E: fixed duration of treatment for 12 weeks vs variable duration depending on the
      viremia within 4 weeks of the start of treatment (12 vs 24 weeks).

      The purpose of the study is also improve the safety of treatment with Ribavirin by optimizing
      dose adjusted to renal function, plasma levels of drug and hemoglobin.
