      The overall objective of the present study will be to describe the occurrence of Potentially
      Inappropriate Prescribing (PIP) in Ontario's elderly (&gt;65 yrs) population, assess the health
      and economic burden associated with it, and evaluate interventions aimed at mitigating its
      effects.

      To attain this objective, the investigators will test three specific hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: Instances of Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing are frequent and costly. To
      test this hypothesis, the investigators will apply a subset of the STOPP criteria and Beers
      criteria to Ontario health administrative data to identify instances of potentially
      inappropriate prescribing, and estimate potential savings, both direct and indirect, that
      could be achieved by reducing inappropriate prescribing.

      Hypothesis 2: ED visits and hospitalizations are significantly associated with Potentially
      Inappropriate Prescribing. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will estimate the
      attributable fraction of ER visits and hospitalizations associated with different frequencies
      of PIP using multivariate methods and survival analysis.

      Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of inappropriate prescribing is associated with patient and
      physician characteristics. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will identify each
      physician's annual PIP incidence density, calculated by dividing the number of PIP they
      issued by the total number of prescriptions they provided over the study period and then
      explore the association of patient and physician level covariates with patient outcomes.

      The investigators will test these hypotheses in the framework of a retrospective cohort study
      which the investigators will conduct using Ontario's large health administrative and
      population databases. These are housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences
      (ICES) and contain information on both hospital and outpatient use of health services, as
      well as demographic and socioeconomic data. Patients included in the study will be all OHIP
      (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) eligible patients aged 66 yrs of age and older who have been
      issued at least one prescription between April 1st 2003 and March 31st 2013.

      The investigator team, housed at ICES@uOttawa, has extensive experience and expertise with
      the analysis of these databases, and has the support and resources necessary to successfully
      carry out this study.

      Potentially Inappropriate Prescribing (PIP) in Ontario's elderly (&gt;65 years) population,
      assess the health and economic burden associated with it, and evaluate interventions aimed at

      Beers criteria to Ontario health administrative data to identify instances of potentially
      inappropriate prescribing, and estimate potential savings, both direct and indirect, which
      could be achieved by reducing inappropriate prescribing.

      Hypothesis 2: ED visits and hospitalizations are significantly associated with Potentially
      Inappropriate Prescribing

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will estimate the attributable fraction of ER
      visits and hospitalizations associated with different frequencies of PIP using multivariate
      methods and survival analysis.

      Hypothesis 3: The likelihood of inappropriate prescribing is associated with patient and
      physician characteristics.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators will identify each physician's annual PIP
      incidence density, calculated by dividing the number of PIP they issued by the total number
      of prescriptions they provided over the study period and then explore the association of
      patient and physician level covariates with patient outcomes.

      Background: Adverse drug events are common in the elderly, and contribute significantly to
      emergency room (ER) visits and unplanned hospitalizations. Patients aged sixty-five and over
      currently represent over 14% of the Canadian population, yet spending on prescription
      medications by seniors accounts for over 40% of all retail prescription drug sales. This is
      equivalent to a per capita spending on prescription drugs by seniors that is three times the
      Canadian average. A recent Irish study showed that, of 600 elderly patients admitted to
      hospital for an acute illness, 25% of them had one or more adverse drug events, of which two
      thirds had contributed to the hospitalizations. Of these adverse events contributing to
      hospitalizations, 69% were deemed avoidable. A number of tools and strategies have been
      developed to identify potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP), however, until recently,
      none of the commonly used tools had been shown to reliably predict adverse events. The
      STOPP/START criteria (Screening Tool of Older Persons' potentially inappropriate
      Prescriptions / Screening Tool to Alert doctors to Right Treatment) was recently compared to
      the long-standing Beers criteria, and found to detect adverse drug effects that are causal or
      contribute to hospitalization in elderly patients with acute illness 2.8 times more often
      than the Beers criteria.

      The application of these criteria is usually done in a clinical context, which involves
      time-intensive and expensive chart reviews. There are relatively few studies looking at
      appropriateness of prescribing at the population level, using health administrative data.
      Applying tools to assess appropriateness of prescribing, such as a subset of the STOPP
      criteria, to health administrative data can provide a unique opportunity to assess both the
      frequency of potentially inappropriate prescribing and its associated costs, in terms of both
      medication and health services use at the population level.

      Methods: To achieve these aims, the investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort study
      using Ontario's large health administrative and population databases, that contain
      information on both hospital and outpatient use of health services, as well as demographic
      and socioeconomic data.

      This study will be conducted using Ontario administrative health databases housed at the
      Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), which will be accessed from the
      ICES@uOttawa site.

      Benefits of our work: By using health administrative data from the Institute for Clinical and
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES) we expect to identify factors, both at the patient and prescriber
      levels, that are associated with poor prescribing, and to show that a measure already in
      place in some practice settings is effective at improving not only the quality of
      prescribing, but also at reducing adverse outcomes associated with poor prescribing. This
      evidence can provide the basis for targeted policy measures aimed at improving prescribing
      quality and outcomes for Ontario seniors, and reducing costs.

        Patients included in the study will be all OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) eligible
        patients, 66 years of age or older and receiving at least one prescription medication
        during study accrual period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Individuals eligible for participation in the study will include all patients who were:

          -  continuously eligible for OHIP (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) coverage,

          -  issued at least one prescription (of any type) during the accrual period (between
             April 1st, 2003 and March 31st, 2013),

          -  66 years of age or older at the date of first dispensation during the accrual period;
             this is necessary to ensure the availability of one year of background information on
             medication and health services use for all patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients will be excluded if:

          -  They do not have a valid OHIP number. This includes individuals whose health care is
             provided by other plans (e.g. First Nations people living on reserves, members of the
             Canadian Armed Forces, and refugee claimants) and is therefore not captured by ICES
             data.

          -  Patients will also be excluded if they were not OHIP-eligible for at least one year
             prior to the index date, or one year after the index date, or if they do not have
             continuous OHIP coverage between these two dates; this is necessary to ensure that
             predictors and outcomes of PIP can be adequately captured.

          -  Patients not dispensed any prescription medication will not be included in the study.
