      The purpose of this study was to develop a radiological method to measure stem anteversion
      and to determine its validity and reliability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Version of the femoral stem is an important factor influencing the risk of dislocation after
      total hip replacement (THR) as well as the position of the acetabular component. However,
      there is no radiological method of measuring stem anteversion described in the literature.
      Investigators propose a radiological method to measure stem version and have assessed its
      reliability and validity. In 40 patients who underwent THR, a hip radiograph and CT scan were
      taken to measure stem anteversion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Investigators recruited 40 consecutive patients who underwent THR between October 2015
             and December 2015

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who could not extend the hip because of a residual flexion contracture.

          -  who had a flexion contracture of the knee or who could not flex the hip to 90Â° even
             after THR were excluded because participants could not adopt the posture required for
             the particular radiographs and CT scans.
