  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France is among the countries with a high incidence of colorectal cancer. The prognosis
      associated with colorectal cancer is related to the development stage of the disease at
      diagnosis. Thus, when the cancer is detected and treated at an early stage, the survival rate
      at 5 years was 90%. It is therefore a major issue of screening is widespread in France since
      the end of 2008.

      This screening is based on a two step strategy: 1) the occult blood in the stool (FOBT) and
      if positive 2) the realization of an optical colonoscopy examination currently regarded as
      the evaluation procedure colon reference. But as part of this organized screening, 13% of
      those with a positive FOBT ultimately refuse to have an optical colonoscopy. Under the
      refusal, virtual colonoscopy may be proposed as an alternative according to the
      recommendations of the National Health Authority in 2010. But it has never been assessed as
      part of organized screening. Similarly another alternative is recently developed colic
      capsule that benefits of development in recent years of the capsule for the small intestine
      which has become the gold standard for diagnosis of most diseases of the small intestine
      (bleeding occult, diagnosis of unknown colitis...).

      Therefore the study proposes virtual colonoscopy or colon capsule for people with a positive
      FOBT as part of organized screening and did not realize optical colonoscopy after the usual
      procedure and complete recovery. This study aims to answer the question of the place of colic
      capsule as part of organized screening. An economic component is integrated to assess, in
      terms of health insurance, the cost associated with these two exams, and compare them to the
      cost of optical colonoscopy.

      The proposed study is an observational study of impact of an alternative screening strategy
      for colorectal cancer whose primary objective is to compare the rate of acceptance of virtual
      colonoscopy and colon capsule in patients refusing optical colonoscopy.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Virtual colonoscopy</arm_group_label>
    <description>With virtual colonoscopy, the patient does not need to be hospitalized for examination, which is usually done without hospitalization. A bowel preparation is necessary. It may vary from site to site, but it generally comprises polyethylene glycol or sodium phosphate. The residual stools are &quot;marked&quot; by ingestion of a radiopaque product to differentiate colic lesions. But no contrast agent is injected intravenously. The patient should be supine and a rectal probe is set up to inject either air or CO2. The vesting period does not exceed thirty seconds apnea, and overall completion time of the examination (patient table) is about 10 minutes.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Colon capsule</arm_group_label>
    <description>The colon capsule comprises two cameras located at both ends. Image acquisition is set between four to thirty-five images per second. It begins immediately after ingestion of the capsule which allows recording of esophageal and gastric images. She paused for 2 hours (to save batteries) while crossing the small intestine. It is reactivated in the terminal ileum. The films analysis time is approximately 1 hour, and the capsule remains on average 3 hours in the colon.</description>
