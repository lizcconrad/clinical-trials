  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether addition of aquatic exercise to conventional
      treatment helps reduce the adverse outcomes of deep vein thrombosis and reduce the severity
      of chronic venous insufficiency.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) develops in approximately 25-60% of patients with acute lower
      extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) depending on severity, chronicity, anatomic level of
      involvement and efficacy of anticoagulation.The frequency increases with occlusive iliac
      venous thrombosis. PTS results in significant morbidity and a staggering toll on health
      careresources . PTS is reduced by early percutaneous endovenous intervention and
      administration of new oral anticoagulants. There are conflicting results on the efficacy of
      compression stockings . In general, exercise has been useful in activation of the muscle pump
      and improvement of symptoms. There are no data about exercise in a swimming pool. Both
      walking or swimming reduce the effect of joint contact and therefore pain which is
      particularly useful in patients with arthritis or heavyweight. Furthermore with less effect
      of gravity, absorption of edema would be faster. There are no data on the role of water
      activity in the reduction of measures of venous insufficiency.The purpose of this study is to
      assess whether the encouragement of patients to perform aqua activity above and beyond the
      recommended treatment would positively impact chronic venous insufficiency.
