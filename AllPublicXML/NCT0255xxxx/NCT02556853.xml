  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be allocated to 2 groups: the ultrasound group and the clinical group. The
      correct position of the double lumen tube will be determined by ultrasound (Sonoscape S6®)
      for the patients of the one group (group U) and by clinical examination for the patients of
      the other group (group C). The correct placement will be verified by bronchoscopy (Pentax®).
      The two methods will be compared in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The main purpose of
      the study is to determine if the ultrasound can be used for determination of the correct
      placement of the left sided double lumen endotracheal tube

    <description>After placement of the left sided double lumen endotracheal tube, ventilation of both lungs will be verified by ultrasound (Sonoscape S6®). The ultrasound probe will be placed between the 2nd and 3rd intercostal space at the level of the midclavicular line parallel to the line. The probe will be slightly moved or tilted until the pleural line is identified. If lung sliding is identified then the ventilation of the lung will be considered adequate. The same procedure will be repeated for each lung alone, after lung separation is applied. Verification of the ultrasound findings will be performed by bronchoscopy (Pentax®). The depth of the tube will be adjusted according to the bronchoscopy findings until correct positioning is established.</description>

    <description>After placement of the left sided double lumen endotracheal tube, ventilation of both lungs will be verified by auscultation of the upper lung fields. The same procedure will be repeated for each lung alone, after lung separation is applied. Verification of the ultrasound findings will be performed by bronchoscopy (Pentax®). The depth of the tube will be adjusted according to the bronchoscopy findings until correct positioning is established.</description>
