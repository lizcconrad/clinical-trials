    <description>IBS severity score system questionnaires will use for evaluation of IBS-C symptoms at the pre and post-intervention. This tool is validated for use in IBS patients that assess 5 clinically relevant items during past 10-days and including severity of abdominal pain, frequency of abdominal pain, severity of abdominal distention, dissatisfaction with bowel movement and interference of IBS with life in general. Each items was scored with a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS).</description>

    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>quality of life in IBS-C patients were assessed at pre-and post-intervention using a self-report Irritable Bowel Syndrome-Quality of Life Measure (IBS-QoL). It contains 34 items with 8 sub-classification including dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, health worry, food avoidance, social reaction, sexual, and relationships. The sum of response to this items by every subject were average and transform to 0-100 scale. The higher score indicated better quality of life among IBS-C patients.</description>
