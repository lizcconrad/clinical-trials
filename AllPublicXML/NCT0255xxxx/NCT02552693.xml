  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of an enhanced package of support for activities
      described in the &quot;Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Patient Tracing in Health
      Facilities in Zimbabwe&quot;. This package is intended to increase the effectiveness of active
      patient tracing activities by developing tools, providing mentorship and implementing
      systematic review of processes to improve communication, coordination, and supervision
      between community health workers and facility-based staff.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a pre-/post- intervention rapid assessment of SOP implementation in
      study health facilities. The rapid assessment includes a facility audit, and the
      cross-verification of Mother-baby pair service records, and scheduled appointments. Following
      the baseline rapid assessment, the research team implements the proposed intervention package
      in health facilities randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the study. Data collectors
      conduct monthly visits to study facilities in order to extract appointment attendance
      information from PMTCT, ART, pharmacy, HIV exposed infants (HEI), and early infant diagnoses
      (EID) service registers.
