      The purpose of Part 1 (Phase 1b) is to evaluate the general safety and tolerability of
      repeated 21-day cycles of AL3818 therapy, and to reevaluate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

      The purpose of Part 2 (Phase 2a) is to evaluate the efficacy of repeated 21-day cycles of
      AL3818 therapy preliminary efficacy of AL3818 in subjects with recurrent or metastatic
      endometrial, ovarian or cervical cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 21-day
      cycles of AL3818 therapy. The study is divided into two parts. Part 1 (Phase 1b) will
      evaluate the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and general safety during the first 21-day cycle of
      Al3818 therapy and to reevaluate the MTD. It will include a sequential evaluation of 3
      subjects per cohort in a 3+3 design with up to 18 subjects in total. Cohort 1 will initiate
      at a dose of 12 mg/day of AL3818, for cycles of 14 days of treatment followed by 7 days of
      rest. After three subjects have completed the first cycle of therapy without a DLT,
      additional cohorts may be enrolled sequentially. All subjects will be allowed continuation of
      therapy with repeat cycles of 21-days if they are tolerating AL3818 and have stable disease
      or better. After the first cohort has completed one full cycle of therapy without a DLT, two
      additional cohorts will be sequentially enrolled at 16 mg/day and 20 mg/day doses of AL3818
      for the same 21-day cycles.

      Part 2 (Phase 2a) will evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of repeated 21-day cycles
      of AL3818. It will include up to 45 additional subjects with metastatic endometrial cancer,
      ovarian cancer refractory to platinum therapy or cervical cancer refractory to standard
      therapy. Each subject will receive a dose of up to 20 mg AL3818 or a maximum of the MTD from
      Part 1 (Phase 1b) of this study for continuous 21-Day cycles of therapy (14 days of AL3818
      treatment followed by 7 days off).

      All subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 of this study will be permitted to continue therapy with
      only safety monitoring and bimonthly assessments for progression, if AL3818 is well tolerated
      and the subject has stable disease or better.

        study:

          1. Subjects who have received prior treatment with an FGFr inhibitor or antagonist of
             FGFr. Prior anti-VEGF or anti-angiogenic therapy is allowed in the adjuvant treatment
             setting Prior anti-VEGF or anti-angiogenic therapy for the treatment of recurrent
             disease is not allowed.

          2. Patients who have received prior antiangiogenic therapy, including bevacizumab,

          4. Patients with active bleeding or pathologic conditions that carry high risk of
             bleeding, such as known bleeding disorder, coagulopathy, or tumor involving major
             vessels.

          5. Patient with history or evidence upon physical examination of CNS disease, including
             primary brain tumor, seizures not controlled with standard medical therapy, any brain

             attack (TIA) or subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 months of the first date of treatment
             on this study.

          6. However, patients with metastatic CNS tumors may participate in this trial, if the
             patient is &gt; 4 weeks from therapy completion (including radiation and/or surgery), is
             clinically stable at the time of study entry and is not receiving corticosteroid
             therapy.

          7. Patients with proteinuria. Patients discovered to have a urine protein of 1+ on
             dipstick or â‰¥ 30 mg/dl at baseline should undergo a 24-hour urine collection, which
             must be an adequate collection and must demonstrate &lt; 1000 mg protein/24 hr to allow

          9. Patients who are pregnant or nursing. To date, no fetal studies of AL3818 in animals

             pregnant women. Subjects will be apprised of the large potential risk to a developing
             fetus. It is not known whether AL3818 is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs
             are excreted in human milk, AL3818 should not be administered to nursing women. Women
             of childbearing potential must agree to use contraceptive measures during study
             therapy and for at least 3 months after completion of AL3818 therapy. Because many

             investigator may place the patient at risk when taking a VEGF inhibitor.

         22. Pre-existing uncontrolled hypertension as documented by 2 baseline BP readings taken
             at least one hour apart, defined as systolic bloodpressure (BP) &gt;160 mm Hg or
