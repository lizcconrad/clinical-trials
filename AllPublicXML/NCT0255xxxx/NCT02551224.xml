    <description>This study will measure patient's perceptions of dose delivery, using a preference questionnaire on use of the Breezhaler® &amp; Ellipta® devices, in COPD patients naïve to DPI devices.The mean (SD) score on a scale of 1- 5 (1 = not at all confident/not at all; 5 = extremely confident/a very great deal) 1a. How confident were you that you received the full dose of medication from your inhaler?
1=Not At All Confident, 2=Not Very Confident, 3=Somewhat Confident, 4=Confident, 5=Extremely Confident
1b. How certain were you that there was no drug remaining in the device?
1=Not At All Certain,2=Not Very Certain, 3=Somewhat Certain,4=Certain, 5=Extremely Certain
1c. To what extent did the device help you to know that you have received all the medication?
1=Not At All, 2=A Little, 3=Somewhat, 4=Very Much, 5=A Very Great Deal</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with diagnosis of COPD (mild to very severe disease) based on
             post-bronchodilator FEV1 values in patients with FEV1/FVC &lt;0.70.

          -  No previous use of DPI.

          -  Over and either be current smokers or have a history of smoking &gt;10 years. (e.g., 10
             pack years = 1 pack/day × 10 years, ½ pack/day × 20 years, etc.):

               -  Note: A pack of cigarettes is equal to 20 cigarettes. Occasional smoking of
                  cigars is not relevant to smoking history.

               -  An ex-smoker is defined as a patient who has not smoked for ≥6 months at
                  screening.

          -  Willing and able to reproducibly perform spirometry and inhalational manoeuvers as
             required by the protocol.

          -  Willing and able to comprehend and follow the instructions for use of the inhalational
             devices to be tested in the study.

          -  Questions or requests for clarification regarding the eligibility of a particular
             patient based on the above inclusion criteria should be directed to the medical
             monitor before the patient is enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the components of the placebo used in the study or to
             compounds of similar chemical classes. This includes (but is not exhaustive) patients

             paradoxical bronchospasm on inhalation of placebo medications.

             on any 2 consecutive days.

        <title>Patient's Preference on the Feedback Mechanisms of Dose Delivery Confirmation Using the Breezhaler® and Ellipta® Devices</title>
        <description>This study will measure patient’s perceptions of dose delivery, using a preference questionnaire on use of the Breezhaler® &amp; Ellipta® devices, in COPD patients naïve to DPI devices.The mean (SD) score on a scale of 1– 5 (1 = not at all confident/not at all; 5 = extremely confident/a very great deal) 1a. How confident were you that you received the full dose of medication from your inhaler?
1=Not At All Confident, 2=Not Very Confident, 3=Somewhat Confident, 4=Confident, 5=Extremely Confident
1b. How certain were you that there was no drug remaining in the device?
1=Not At All Certain,2=Not Very Certain, 3=Somewhat Certain,4=Certain, 5=Extremely Certain
1c. To what extent did the device help you to know that you have received all the medication?
1=Not At All, 2=A Little, 3=Somewhat, 4=Very Much, 5=A Very Great Deal</description>
