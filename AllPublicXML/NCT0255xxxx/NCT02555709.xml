    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which VTP-43742
      will be administered to normal healthy volunteers (NHV) and to moderate to severe psoriatic
      patients, both in sequential ascending dose panels.

      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple dose
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics effects of
      VTP-43742 in healthy volunteers conducted at a single, study center and in patients with
      moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis at approximately 8 study centers in the
      United States. A total of 108 participants will be enrolled in the study (48 healthy subjects
      and 60 psoriatic patients).
