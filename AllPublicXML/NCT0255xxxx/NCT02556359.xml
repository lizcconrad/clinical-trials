  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The molecular mechanisms participating in the various aspects of the DNA Damage Response
      (DDR) are absolutely essential to maintain the genome dynamics essential to all living
      organisms. The most commonly studied consequence of faulty DDR is genome instability
      participating in cancer onset. In the present proposal, we wish to explore another aspect of
      DDR, not relevant to cancer, which is its absolute requirement at several key steps of the
      development, maturation, and function of the immune system.

      The most &quot;spectacular&quot; consequences of faulty DNA repair processes with respect to the
      immuno-hematopoietic tissue are the complete block of B and T lymphocytes maturation owing to
      defective DNA joining phase during V(D)J recombination resulting in patients with Severe
      Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID).

      The objectives of this study are to increase our knowledge on the role of the various DNA
      repair processes in the development, the maintenance, and the function of the immune system
      and thus, to better understand why and how dysfunctions of these DNA repair processes result
      in human severe conditions such as CVID, LOCID or other manifestations of immune disorders
      such as autoimmunity.

      The explorations of DNA repair mechanisms in the patients will allow us to establish the
      genetic diagnosis in some patients with until now undefined molecular diagnosis. This is of
      immediate importance for the patients and their families, as it not only contributes to a
      better understanding of the patients' condition, but also allows providing genetic counseling
      for the families.

      Blood samples will be obtained as a source of DNA and viable lymphocytes for functional
      studies. Blood will be sent to the laboratory of Dr JP de Villartay, INSERM UMR1163, Genome
      Dynamics in the Immune System, Université Paris Descartes - Sorbonne Paris Cité, Institut
      Imagine, 24 boulevard du Montparnasse, 75015 PARIS. Functional studies will be performed
      immediately.

      A portion of the blood sample taken as part of the research will be included in a biological
      collection: B-EBV cell lines will be derived from patients and their parents. EBV-B cell
      lines will be established by Centre de Ressource Biologique (CRB, Hôpital Necker - Enfants
      Malades, Bâtiment IMAGINE 1er étage, 149, rue de Sèvres - 75 743 PARIS CEDEX 15, under the
      supervision of Dr Marie-Alexandra Alyanakian &amp; Anne Esling &amp; Christine Gouarin). Skin
      biopsies will be obtained from patients to derive fibroblast lines at CRB.
