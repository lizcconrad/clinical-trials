  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minnesota HealthSolutions Corporation (MHS) proposes to develop and evaluate a program to
      motivate and monitor people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to complete
      home exercise as part of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). The proposed system has two
      components: home-based activity monitoring and health coaching. The investigators will
      conduct a randomized, wait-list controlled clinical study to evaluate the effects of the
      activity monitoring system and health coaching on quality of life and daily steps.
