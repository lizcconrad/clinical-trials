  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the major complications in patients with chronic
      liver disease. The prognosis of HCC relies on the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis.
      Hence to detect cancer at an earlier stage, a regular surveillance test is important for the
      subjects with a high risk of developing cancer. Current guidelines recommend a regular
      surveillance using ultrasonography (US) at a 6 month-interval. Ultrasonography is a
      non-invasive and safe procedure, yet it is limited by the skills of the operator and it is
      often difficult to differentiate cancer from regenerating nodules especially in atrophied
      cirrhotic liver. According to a recent meta-analysis, the overall sensitivity and specificity
      of detecting liver cancer using ultrasonography were both over 90%, however the sensitivity
      was decreased to 60% in detecting early lesions in which surgery or liver transplantation is
      indicated. Of note, addition of alpha feto protein(AFP) to ultrasonography also failed to
      increase the sensitivity in detecting small cancers. Taken together, there is a need to
      develop a new surveillance test with an improved sensitivity and specificity.

      Recently, a retrospective study reported that CT or MRI showed a better sensitivity than
      ultrasonography in detecting early liver cancer. However, performing CT as a surveillance
      test is limited by frequent exposure to radiation and contrast-dye agent. Although MRI does
      not have the risk of radiation-exposure, it is limited by the high cost and limited
      availability. On the contrast, non-contrast MRI offers a cost that is comparable to US and an
      absence of exposure to radiation or contrast-dye agent, which suggests non-contrast MRI as a
      good alternative surveillance tool for early detection of HCC. Therefore, in this prospective
      trial, the investigators will investigate the usefulness of biannual ultrasonography versus
      annual non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma.
