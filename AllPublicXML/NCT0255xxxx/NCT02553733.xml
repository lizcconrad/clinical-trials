  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will test the hypothesis that short-term consumption of
      inorganic nitrate (supplied in concentrated beetroot juice) enhances coronary blood flow
      responses, large artery hemodynamics, and leg oxygenation/exercise tolerance in patients with
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Understanding and improving blood flow regulation in the
      heart and skeletal muscles of patients with PAD is important because exercise triggers
      symptoms of leg pain and substantially raises blood pressure and myocardial demand in these
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality and
      negatively affects functional capacity and quality of life for as many as 14 million patients
      in the U.S. alone. One open-label study showed that acute consumption of beetroot juice
      improved 6 min walk performance, reduced blood pressure, and enhanced leg muscle oxygenation
      in PAD patients. However, no studies have rigorously confirmed these findings in a
      double-blind manner, nor have the effects of this supplement been investigated (acutely or
      short-term) in the coronary circulation of PAD patients.

      In addition to studying its effects on graded treadmill walking performance and consequent
      large artery vasodilation, the present study will examine the effects of short-term beetroot
      juice consumption (twice/day) on both coronary and leg vasodilator (graded calf flexion) and
      vasoconstrictor (isometric handgrip, voluntary apnea) responses in patients with PAD.
      Participants will randomly consume either nitrate-rich or nitrate-depleted beetroot juice
      with a 7 to 14 day wash-out period between. Effects of beetroot juice consumption on plasma
      nitrate, nitrite and methemoglobin will also be assessed.
