  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feasibility of the objective measurement of the ossicular chain mobility, by using a
      force-measuring device based on a fiber optics sensors (PalpEar).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to develop and test a palpating instrument, which enables the
      experienced and occasional otologic surgeon to record force in three dimensions during his
      standard palpation of each ossicle at surgery and al-lows correlation of his subjective
      impression with objective measurement results. The first task was to incorporate force
      sensing capability into a standard 45° angulated 2.5 mm hook, which is commonly used to
      palpate, disconnect and luxate ossicles during middle ear surgery.

    <time_frame>1 day. The measurements are performed during day 1, in parallel with the underlying surgery, and therefore assessed within the time frame of 1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>The palpation forces needed to move the middle-ear ossicles out from their resting position will be measured through a force sensing device. The measured palpation forces are measured in equivalent gram-force [gF]. The primary outcome of the study is to demonstrate if a relation can be established between the subjective feeling of the surgeon and an objective measurement of the palpation force.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference between normal and impaired ossicular chains</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day. The measurements are performed during day 1, in parallel with the underlying surgery, and therefore assessed within the time frame of 1 day.</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison between ossicular chains judged as &quot;normal&quot; by the surgeon and impaired ossicular chains will be performed, to assess if a significant difference can be extracted from the measurement of the palpation force. This would help in a future diagnosis assisted by a force sensing device.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adult subjects

          -  Normally scheduled for middle-ear or internal-ear surgery as a result of an ear
             disease and for whom a routine assessment of the mobility of the ossicle chain is in
             order.

        The targeted subject population consists of patients undergoing stapedotomy for
        otosclerosis and subjects with a normal ossicular chain who are subject to the placement of
        a cochlear implant to treat hearing loss.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Children

          -  Subjects in whom the ossicle chain is missing or incomplete

          -  Missing informed consent form

          -  Incapacitated subjects or subjects with impaired judgment capability.
