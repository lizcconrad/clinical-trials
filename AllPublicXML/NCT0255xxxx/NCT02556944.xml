      To assess postsurgical visual acuity (distant, intermediate, near), refractive errors,
      contrast sensitivity, visual function and patient satisfaction after implantation of
      multifocal IOLs of different add power contralaterally.

    <textblock>
      Multifocal intraocular lens (MIOL) is considered a prevailing alternative to restore the
      functional vision from far to near independent of glasses. Many clinical studies on
      diffractive MIOLs, refractive MIOLs, or hybrid MIOLs in enhancing quality of vision showed
      promising outcomes. Several studies have confirmed the satisfactory visual outcomes of Tecnis
      MIOL with +4.00 D add power. The purpose of study is to assess the visual performance after
      cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of multifocal IOL with two different add power
      (+2.75 D or +3.25 D) in one patient.

               -  A patient has the visual potential of 20/25 or better in each eye after cataract
                  removal and IOL implantation.

               -  A patient with preoperative corneal astigmatism from IOL Master less than 1
                  diopters

               -  Written informed consent to surgery and participation in the study

               -  A patient with evidence of keratoconus or significant irregular astigmatism on
                  pre-operative topography in either eye.
