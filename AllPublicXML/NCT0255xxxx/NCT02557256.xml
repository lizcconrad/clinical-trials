      The aim of the study is to retrospectively review data about malignancies that arise
      primarily in the pelvis and/or in the pelvic organs, in pediatric cancer patients &amp;
      categorize the spectrum of these malignancies according to experience at South Egypt Cancer
      Institute which is the largest referral site in Upper Egypt.

      Background:

      The newborn and infant pelvis is not fully developed and the bladder, uterus, and ovaries are
      to a large degree intra-abdominal. The pelvis of the infant and child has different anatomic
      relationships than the adolescent or adult pelvis. Neoplasms of the pediatric pelvis
      constitute a unique group requiring highly specialized management in a setting staffed by
      pediatric surgical and radiation oncologists. The most common neoplasms are rhabdomyosarcomas
      of the bladder, prostate, and vagina; sacrococcygeal teratoma; and the germ cell tumors,
      including teratomas, endodermal sinus tumors, and the choriocarcinomas. Rapidly improving
      chemotherapy for all of these lesions has resulted in a changed role for the surgeon.

      Patients &amp; Methods:

      A hospital-based study, involving Pediatric cancer patients, those have been diagnosed with
      malignant tumors that primarily arising in the pelvis and/or arising from the pelvic organs,
      and may have an intra-abdominal extension, in the period from 2001 January till 2015
      December, and received treatment at the pediatric oncology department, their medical reports
      will be retrospectively reviewed for data collection.

      Spectrum of these malignancies will be categorized and recorded as specific disease entities,
      based on morphology &amp; the primary site of occurrence, their relative incidence will be
      calculated, and the treatment outcomes will be verified.
