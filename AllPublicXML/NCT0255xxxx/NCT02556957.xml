  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kasensero, a fishing community on Lake Victoria in Uganda, is a representative HIV &quot;hotspot&quot;
      with extremely high HIV prevalence (44.3%) and incidence (~3.9/100py), yet low HIV service
      utilization. Hotspots such as Kasensero may seed and sustain HIV in general populations,
      compromising national and regional HIV control efforts. PEPFAR, UNAIDS, and WHO have
      recognized the urgent need to target hotspots with enhanced HIV treatment and prevention
      efforts. However, evidence on low-cost, comprehensive, and effective HIV control strategies
      for hotspots is limited and is thus a priority need for the field.

      The investigators propose an implementation science, cluster-randomized, controlled trial in
      Kasensero to evaluate the impact on HIV service uptake and HIV incidence of CHWs promoting
      combination HIV prevention (CHP) services supported by mobile health technologies (mHealth).
      CHP is the implementation of multiple, evidence-based HIV prevention services (HIV testing
      and counseling, antiretroviral therapy, medical male circumcision, and behavior change) to
      maximize population-level impact on HIV incidence. For CHP to substantively decrease HIV
      incidence, most community members must be assessed for risk factors and current CHP
      utilization, then triaged, motivated, linked, and, if HIV-infected, retained in care. The
      proposed intervention will use low-cost CHWs leveraging mHealth decision support and
      counseling tools to promote CHP along this entire continuum of HIV service utilization. The
      hypotheses for this implementation science research are that residents in clusters receiving
      the implementation intervention will have improved CHP service uptake and decreased
      Population Prevalence of Viremia (PPDV) compared to controls receiving standard of care.

      The intervention will be evaluated through a pragmatic, cluster-randomized trial nested
      within a large, ongoing population-based cohort study of HIV, the Rakai Community Cohort
      Study (RCCS). Intervention arm participants will be visited in their place of residence by
      CHWs trained to evaluate and triage participants into risk categories, provide tailored CHP
      health counseling, linkage, and adherence support, all supported by a mHealth decision
      support tool. The primary outcomes will be CHP service coverage and PPDV. Other outcomes will
      be HIV incidence, population viral load, implementation measures, retention, virologic
      suppression, and sexual behaviors.

      Complimentary mixed methods (quantitative, qualitative, and cost) evaluations of the trial
      will be conducted to evaluate implementation processes, facilitators, and barriers to inform
      study results and future program uptake. Focus groups and in-depth interviews will be
      conducted during and after the follow-up period and synthesized with quantitative data.
      Intervention costs will be prospectively measured to provide information on program
      affordability.

      Through this study, a novel, low-cost, and scalable implementation intervention to improve
      CHP uptake will be evaluated in an HIV &quot;hotspot&quot; critical to controlling the HIV epidemic.
      The study design ensures rigorous evidence of immediate relevance to many stakeholders.
