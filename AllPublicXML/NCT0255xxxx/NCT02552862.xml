      Study Design: Double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial

      Study Duration:2 years

      Study Center: Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona (single center)

      Objectives: To assess the effect of adjunctive Vivomixx® on bacterial translocation in
      patients with cirrhosis and SBP

      Number of Subjects: 30

      Main Inclusion Criteria: Patients with cirrhosis hospitalized with an episode of SBP at
      Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau

      Study Product, Dose, Route, Regimen: Vivomixx ® sachets containing 450 x 109 bacteria, 2
      every 12 hours during hospitalization (n=15), or placebo (n=15)

      Duration of administration: During hospitalization due to SBP episode

      Hypothesis: The adjunctive treatment with Vivomixx® in patients with cirrhosis and SBP could
      decrease bacterial translocation and systemic and cerebral proinflammatory state. This would
      result in a faster SBP resolution, a decrease in the incidence of complications and an
      improvement in cognitive function.

    <description>Bacterial translocation will be evaluated by change from baseline in bacterial DNA in blood and ascitic fluid, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) and intestinal bile acid binding protein (I-BABP) in blood, and polyethylene glycols (PEG) and claudin 3 in urine .</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, daily until infection resolution (an expected average of 7 days) and at three months after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic Inflammation and immune response will be evaluated by change from baseline in serum C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-22, sTNFR-1, sTNFR-2, sCD163, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -9, interferon (IFN)-γ, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), claudin-5, nitrites and nitrates in serum and ascitic fluid.
Systemic oxidative damage will be evaluated by change from baseline in determination of malondialdehyde (MDA) in blood.</description>

    <measure>Changes in cognitive function (composite measure)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline at infection resolution (an expected average of 7 days)</time_frame>

    <time_frame>At baseline (during the first 12-24 hours after inclusion in the study) and after 3 days of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Brain inflammation will be evaluated by change from baseline in MRI and different biomarkers of neuroinflammation.
A designed MR protocol will be produced, including imaging using different sequences, and more biochemical (MR spectroscopy) and functional (DTI) studies.</description>

    <description>Vivomixx® is a probiotic mixture of 8 proprietary strains. Thirty consecutive patients with cirrhosis and SBP will be randomized to receive Vivomixx® , sachets containing 450 x 109 bacteria, 2 every 12 hours during all the hospitalization until a maximum of 30 days (n=15), or placebo (n=15).
All patients will receive endovenous antibiotics and also intravenous albumin 1.5 g/kg weight the first day and 1 g/kg weight the third day of treatment. The management of patients will follow current guidelines.</description>
