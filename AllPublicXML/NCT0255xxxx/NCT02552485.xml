      Prospective, monocentric study for the evaluation of latent pulmonary arterial hypertension
      in patients with congenital shunt lesions lost to follow-up. Lost to follow-up is defined as
      latest clinical control ≥ 5 years.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) usually
      develops secondary to chronic volume overload of the pulmonary circulation following left to
      right shunt. This overload leads to elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and later to
      increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). This causes pressure overload in the right
      heart, and thereby right ventricular (RV) and right atrial (RA) dysfunction, which may
      implicate considerable morbidity and even mortality. Since PAH nowadays is mostly detected
      when symptoms occur and PAP are elevated, the disease already evolved to an advanced
      (partially irreversible) stage and treatment is often initiated too late.

      Dismissal from follow-up after a surgical correction of simple CHD was customized in the
      seventies and eighties. There is no literature available that learns us whether these
      patients really need follow-up or not. A substantial number must have insidiously developed
      PAH or mild pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) and still are prone to develop PAH later in
      life. It is relevant to recall these patients dismissed from follow-up in the past, because
      they might carry a lot of useful information on the natural history of PAH development. Focus
      will lie mainly on patients with simple shunt lesions, as atrial septal defect (ASD) and
      ventricular septal defect (VSD).
