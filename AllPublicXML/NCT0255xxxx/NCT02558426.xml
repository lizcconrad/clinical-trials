      Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a very common problem affecting western adult population. To
      date the pathophysiology of CVD development encloses several theories such as the role of
      extracellular matrix (ECM) components alterations, the alteration of Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other related molecules, the endothelial dysfunction, and
      several genetic factors but none of these could properly explain its genesis. Estrogen
      Receptors may be involved in CDV pathogenesis. Endogenous estrogens are important regulators
      of vascular homeostasis and they act mainly via three different ERs which are expressed in
      the cardiovascular system: ERα, ERβ, and a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor termed GPER.
      of this study is to explore the expression of estrogen receptors in vessel wall of varicose
      veins through the entire clinical spectrum of CVD.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a very common problem affecting western adult population with
      a prevalence of &lt; 10%, among individuals younger than 30 years for both sex, and with a
      prevalence of 57% and 77%, in men and women aged ≥ 70 years respectively, and may be
      frequently associated with other clinical manifestations.

      The spectrum of CVD ranges from varicose veins to leg edema, and serious dermal clinical
      manifestations consisting of hyperpigmentation, eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, and venous skin
      ulceration.

      To date the pathophysiology of CVD development encloses several theories such as the role of
      extracellular matrix (ECM) components alterations, the alteration of Matrix
      Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other related molecules, the endothelial dysfunction, and
      several genetic factors but none of these could properly explain its genesis.

      A recent study (Serra R et al) showed a higher prevalence of CVD among patients with Breast
      Cancer (BC) respect to general population, especially in those patients that were positive to
      estrogen receptor (ER) expression.

      The presence of ERs was investigated in the walls of normal and varicose veins by Mashiah A.
      et al, previously, and they documented that increased concentrations of estrogen receptors
      were found in varicose vein segments respect to healthy controls and this was particularly
      evident in females.

      Endogenous estrogens are important regulators of vascular homeostasis and they act mainly via
      three different ERs which are expressed in the cardiovascular system: ERα, ERβ, and a G
      protein-coupled estrogen receptor termed GPER.

      Although ERs are also suspected to be involved in the underlying etiology, the exact
      molecular mechanism responsible for development of CVD as well as the relationship with the
      wide range of clinical manifestations of CVD remains to be elucidated and the aim of this
      study is to explore the expression of estrogen receptors in vessel wall of varicose veins
      collected from patients with varicose veins through the entire clinical spectrum of CVD.

Samples obtained from patients undergoing surgical removal of varicose veins will be collected and immediately preserved at -80°. Briefly, the venous tissueswill be excised, homogenized with a motor-driven homogenizer and total RNA will be isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
