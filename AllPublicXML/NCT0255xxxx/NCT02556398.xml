      The project involve evaluation of a web-based nutrition education program and pilot-testing
      of a new smartphone app for real-time data logging to identify factors causing glycemic
      variability.

    <textblock>
      The intervention will be three (3) months in duration and will entail use of a smart phone
      app for real-time data logging to identify factors causing glycemic variability, as well as
      use of a web-based nutrition education program. The investigators postulate that the
      interactive nutrition education curriculum — which will provide feedback to patients about
      the inter-relationship between their food intake and postprandial glucose profiles, as well
      as practical guidance for improvements — will lead to a change in food choices and improved
      post-prandial glucose control.
