  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how satisfied patients are when undergoing an
      overnight polysomnogram (sleep study), what their knowledge about sleep apnea is, and what
      factors affect obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effects of educational interventions on subject compliance, satisfaction, and knowledge
      of their condition will be examined through the use of video vs pamphlet and MD vs staff
      contact for follow-up visit reminder.

    <measure>CPAP Therapy Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days post in-lab split night polysomnogram</time_frame>
    <description>Subject use of CPAP device will be monitored electronically. Subjects will be randomized to educational intervention of either viewing a video or reading a pamphlet prior to in-laboratory split night polysomnogram (sleep study) and initiation of CPAP therapy, and CPAP adherence rates of the two groups will be compared and reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject compliance with sleep clinic appointment</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months after the in-laboratory split night polysomnogram</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be randomized to receive a reminder call for follow up clinic appointment either from MD or staff, and the compliance rates of the two groups will be compared based on call type and educational intervention type.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Knowledge About Sleep Apnea and CPAP Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day post in-laboratory split night polysomnogram</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be administered 2 questionnaires which measure knowledge about their condition, both before and after the in-laboratory split night polysomnogram (sleep study). The scores of the two questionnaires will be combined for both test administrations. Subjects will be randomized to educational intervention of either viewing a video or reading a pamphlet prior to sleep study and initiation of CPAP therapy, and the change in the combined questionnaire scores of the two groups will be compared and reported.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction With the in-laboratory split night polysomnogram</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day post in-laboratory split night polysomnogram</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be administered 2 questionnaires which measure their mood and well-being, both before and after the in-laboratory split night polysomnogram. The questionnaires will be scored and the scores for each subject will be combined at both testing administrations. On the night of the in-laboratory polysomnogram subjects will be randomized to educational intervention of either viewing a video or reading a pamphlet prior to the initiation of the polysomnogram and initiation of CPAP therapy, and the change in the combined questionnaire scores of the two groups will be compared and reported.</description>

    <measure>CPAP Therapy Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month post sleep clinic visit or the date of the missed sleep clinic visit</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be randomized to receive a reminder call for follow up sleep clinic appointment either from MD or non-MD sleep center staff, and the compliance rates of the two groups will be compared based on call type and educational intervention type.</description>
