    <textblock>
      The study will explore CT radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable in diagnosing acute
      appendicitis, by using of dose simulation technique and iterative reconstruction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three sequential non-inferiority tests are planned. First, three readers will review the
      original 2-mSv images. Second, the readers will review the 75%-dose images. After the readers
      review the 75%-dose images and before the readers reviewed the 50%-dose images, the
      non-inferiority of 75% dose to the original dose will be tested. If the non-inferiority is
      not accepted, the study will be terminated with the conclusion of 2 mSv as the lowest
      acceptable dose. If the non-inferiority is accepted, the study will be continue to the next
      step. In the same manner, the readers will review the next lower-dose images (50% and then
      25%), and then the noninferiority will be tested against the original dose.

    <description>Contrast-enhanced CT images of the abdomen and pelvis will be obtained during the portal venous phase using a 256-channel CT system (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, OH). The target median dose-length product (DLP) is 130 mGy·cm, which corresponded to an effective dose of 2 mSv with a conversion factor of 0.015 mSv·mGy-1·cm-1. The radiation output was automatically adjusted according to the individual patient's body size.</description>
