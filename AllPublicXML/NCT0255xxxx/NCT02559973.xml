  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel-group study which will
      enroll and randomize approximately 48 subjects (to achieve 36 completers) with opioid use
      disorder (OUD) who are seeking treatment for OUD. The study includes both a Residential
      (Inpatient) and Non-Residential (Outpatient) Period.

             (QTcF) &gt; 450 msec in males and QTcF &gt; 470 msec in females upon admission to the
             residential facility or prior to administration of RBP-6000.

          -  Currently meet the criteria for diagnosis of moderate or severe substance use
             disorder, by DSM-5 criteria, for any substances other than opioids, and/or tobacco.

          -  Had a significant traumatic injury, major surgery, or open biopsy within the 4 weeks
             prior to signing the informed consent form.

          -  Used buprenorphine-containing products within the 14 days prior to signing the
             informed consent form.

          -  Have a history of suicidal ideation within the 30 days prior to signing the informed
             consent form or prior to study drug administration

          -  Have a history or presence of allergic or adverse response (including rash or
             anaphylaxis) to buprenorphine, naloxone, methadone, or the ATRIGEL Delivery System.

          -  Individuals who have a positive urine drug screen (UDS) prior to admission to the
             residential facility for barbiturates, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, or methadone.
