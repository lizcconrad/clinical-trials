  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Being physically active can reduce pain and fatigue, improve mobility and enhance quality of
      life in people with arthritis, but adherence to an active lifestyle is poor, with less than
      half of people with arthritis being active. The primary goal of this randomized controlled
      trial is to assess the efficacy of a physical activity coaching model to improve physical
      activity participation and reduce sedentary time in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. This model combines the use of a Fitbit Flex (wireless physical
      activity tracker) paired with a FitViz application, a group education session, and telephone
      counselling by a physiotherapist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient self-management is a fundamental component in arthritis care that is often neglected.
      Physical activity is an essential part of self-management, however, less than half of people
      with arthritis are active. There are several factors that are associated with low physical
      activity participation such as motivation, doubts about the effectiveness of prescribed
      exercises, and lack of health professional advice on ways to progress physical activity. The
      variety of risk factors highlights the need for a multifaceted approach that provides support
      in terms of knowledge, skill development and timely advice from health professionals, as well
      as motivational support to stay active.

      Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of a physical activity counselling model,
      involving the use of a Fitbit Flex (wireless physical activity tracker) paired with a FitViz
      application (app), a group education session, and telephone counselling by a physiotherapist,
      to improve physical activity participation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our secondary objective is to assess the effect of the
      intervention on reducing patients' sedentary time, and improving fatigue, mood, pain, and
      self-efficacy in arthritis management. We will carry out three aims: 1) To develop the FitViz
      app to pair with Fitbit to enhance user experience, 2) To conduct a pilot test for the
      Fitbit/FitViz intervention, 3) To evaluate the effect of the physical activity coaching model
      in patients with RA and SLE. In this proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial (RCT), the
      investigators hypothesize that compared to a control group (i.e. the Delayed Intervention
      group), participants in the Immediate Intervention Group will 1) increase moderate/vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA), 2) reduce sedentary time, 3) improve in fatigue, mood, and pain
      levels, and 4) improve in their self-efficacy in disease management.

      The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.
      The proof-of-concept study will employ a stepped wedge RCT design, whereby the intervention
      will be sequentially rolled out to participants over a number of time periods. The order in
      which individuals receive the intervention will be determined at random. The strength of this
      design is that it can properly address the efficacy question, while avoiding the dilemma of
      withholding the intervention to some participants, as in a parallel group design.

    <description>Participants will wear a SenseWear Mini accelerometer for 7 days at baseline, and at the end of Months 2, 4, and 6. We will calculate the average daily MVPA accumulated in bouts per day. A bout is defined as greater than or equal to 10 consecutive minutes at the level of 3 or higher METs, with allowance for interruption of up to 2 minutes below the threshold.</description>

    <description>The SRHI is a 12-item scale, rated on a 7-point Likert scale, that measures characteristics of habitual behavior. We will ask participants to rate their strength of habit for three specific activity-related behaviors: sitting during leisure time at home, sitting during usual occupational activities, and walking outside for 10 minutes. A higher score indicates a stronger habit or behavior that is done frequently, automatically, and done without thinking about it.</description>

    <description>Education, Fitbit/FitViz, physiotherapist counselling. These 3 components will be delivered to the participants in Months 1 and 2. The session will include a short presentation about physical activity in everyday life, an individual goal-setting session with a registered PT, and an orientation to the Fitbit and FitViz app. Participants will use the Fitbit/FitViz. The PT will review the progress with participants via bi-weekly phone calls and progressively modify their activities. In Month 3-6, participants will continue using the Fitbit/FitViz and have access to a PT via email as needed, but no bi-weekly phone calls.</description>
