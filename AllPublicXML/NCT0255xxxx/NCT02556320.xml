  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent study has shown that certain drug allergies were actually related to an immune
      system against certain viruses. The aim of the study is to evaluate, in patients taking
      antiepileptic drugs, if this treatment induces proliferation of these viruses and secondarily
      an immune response that would promote the development of a rash. In particular, will be
      studied whether these drugs can induce virus reactivation &quot;dormant&quot; in the immune system.
      This study will not affect the usual follow-up proposed by investigators, with the exception
      of some additional blood samples.
