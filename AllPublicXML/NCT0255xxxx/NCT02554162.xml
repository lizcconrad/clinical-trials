      This study examines if there are differences in satiety responses between structurally
      different wholegrain rye products.

      The study consists of a satiety trial and mastication trial. The satiety trial consists of
      five study visits. Five cereal products with berry soup are presented in random order for
      each subject serving one of them in each study visit (crossover study design). Each meal
      consists of rye product or wheat bread providing 190 kcal of energy and of 3 dl berry soup (3
      dl) providing 140 kcal of energy. The participants are instructed to evaluate their satiety
      and related sensations before eating the test food, right after eating and then every 30 min
      until 210 min after breakfast consumption. The evaluated sensations are hunger, fullness,
      satiety, desire to eat and prospective food consumption (&quot;How much would you be able to eat
      right now?&quot;), &quot;thirstiness&quot;, &quot;mood&quot;, &quot;vigourosness&quot; and &quot;pleasantness&quot;.&quot;Pleasantness&quot; will be
      evaluated only right after eating the test food.

      Cereal food samples with 3-digit number codes will be offered to each participant in a random
      order in mastication trial. The study products are rye products with varying structures.
      First the participant is asked to evaluate the expected satiety of the product (How filling
      would you expect this portion to be on a scale from 0 (=not full at all) to 10 (=extremely
      full)). Secondly the same food will be served to the participant in three portions and the
      participant will be asked to masticate each portion until she considers it to be ready for
      swallowing. Instead of swallowing the bolus will be expectorated to a plastic container which
      is kept on ice. The mastication process is characterized by measuring electrical activity of
      facial muscles by electromyography (EMG). The mastication process will be video-recorded to
      support data handling.
