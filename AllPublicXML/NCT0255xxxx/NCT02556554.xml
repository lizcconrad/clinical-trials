      A single-center, prospective, 'open-label,' investigator-initiated pilot study evaluating the
      role of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use either alone or with remote monitoring
      capabilities that enable subjects to share CGM data with family and friends (whom the
      investigators will call &quot;followers&quot; in this protocol) among women with T1DM associated with
      pregnancy.
