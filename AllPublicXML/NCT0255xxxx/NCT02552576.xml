  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, open-label, single-arm, phase 4, post-marketing study to further
      investigate the efficacy and safety of Voncento in subjects with Von Willebrand Disease (VWD)
      in whom treatment with a Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) product is required as on-demand
      therapy, for prophylactic therapy, or during surgery. Subjects will be treated with Voncento
      either as an on-demand regimen (eg, to treat a non-surgical spontaneous or traumatic bleeding
      event) or prevention regimen (eg, to prevent an anticipated bleeding event) at a dose
      prescribed by the Investigator in accordance with the Voncento Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SmPC), or with a prophylaxis regimen (regular treatment with Voncento at a
      frequency of 1-3 times per week). Voncento will also be given to prevent and treat any
      surgical bleeding events.
