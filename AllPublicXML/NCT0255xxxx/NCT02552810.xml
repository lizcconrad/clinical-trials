  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contamination of implant abutments could potentially influence the peri-implant tissue
      inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to assess the radiographic bone
      changes around customized, platform switched, abutments placed according to the
      &quot;one-abutment-one-time&quot; protocol, with and without plasma of argon cleaning treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After technical procedures, presence of contaminants (mostly Titanium wear micro-particles,
      Carbon and Aluminum traces due to lubricant used during customization) on the whole abutment
      surface, the internal connection and the screw can be found, even after the usually cleaning
      steps (steaming).

      Such debris, present at titanium/connective-bone tissues interface (gingival portion of the
      abutment), could directly or indirectly deleteriously influence the inflammatory response on
      the peri-implant tissues.

      Plasma of Argon cleaning treatment was demonstrated to have a double effect on titanium
      abutments: removal of pollutions following customization and increase of cell adhesion.
      Additionally, Plasma of Argon demonstrated very potent anti-biofilm activity. This
      prospective, match paired, triple-blinded randomized controlled trial was aimed to test if
      plasma treatment of customized abutments can affect radiographic peri-implant marginal bone
      level changes after 5 years of prosthetic loading.

    <description>An implant was considered a failure if it presented any mobility, assessed by tapping or rocking the implant head with the metallic handles of two instruments, and/or any signs of radiolucency, progressive marginal bone loss or infection, and any mechanical complications (e.g. implant fracture) rendering the implant unusable, though still mechanically stable in the bone. This was evaluated on an intraoral radiograph taken with a paralleling technique strictly perpendicular to the implant-bone interface. The implant stability was assessed at initial loading and following 3 years of application, with the prostheses removed.
A prosthesis was considered a failure if it needed to be replaced by an alternative prosthesis.</description>

    <measure>Peri-implant Marginal Bone Level Changes (Express in mm).</measure>
    <time_frame>At 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>At the time of loading with the provisional crown (T0), periapical standardized digital or analogical radiographs were taken in order to control the perfect adaptation of the abutment on the implant and control peri-implant bone level. The customized film holder was made using an hard silicone on the bite of film holders (Rinn XCP; Dentsply Rinn, Elgin, IL, USA) and the parallel technique was used. Radiographs were also taken at 12 (T1), 24 (T2), 48 (T4), and 60 months (T5) after the final restoration delivery, to evaluate marginal bone level changes.</description>

    <time_frame>At 5 years.</time_frame>
    <description>A customized millimeter tubular support (stent) was placed temporarily around each dental implant. For each site, mesial and distal soft tissue dimensions (papilla height, PH), and buccal peri-implant mucosa dimension at the zenith (REC) were measured, and reported in millimeters. Two measurements were recorded. The first at definitive crown delivery (baseline), and the second at the 5 years follow-up examination. Changes in PH and REC were reported in millimeters as the difference between values recorded at the 5-year follow-up and the baseline.

          <title>Success Rate of the Implants and Prostheses (Participants).</title>
          <description>An implant was considered a failure if it presented any mobility, assessed by tapping or rocking the implant head with the metallic handles of two instruments, and/or any signs of radiolucency, progressive marginal bone loss or infection, and any mechanical complications (e.g. implant fracture) rendering the implant unusable, though still mechanically stable in the bone. This was evaluated on an intraoral radiograph taken with a paralleling technique strictly perpendicular to the implant-bone interface. The implant stability was assessed at initial loading and following 3 years of application, with the prostheses removed.
A prosthesis was considered a failure if it needed to be replaced by an alternative prosthesis.</description>

        <description>A customized millimeter tubular support (stent) was placed temporarily around each dental implant. For each site, mesial and distal soft tissue dimensions (papilla height, PH), and buccal peri-implant mucosa dimension at the zenith (REC) were measured, and reported in millimeters. Two measurements were recorded. The first at definitive crown delivery (baseline), and the second at the 5 years follow-up examination. Changes in PH and REC were reported in millimeters as the difference between values recorded at the 5-year follow-up and the baseline.

Dental implant placement: Using a surgical stent, patients received one implant in the anterior or premolar region of the maxilla.
Second stage surgery: After 3 months of healing, a minimally invasive flap for the second surgery procedure was performed.
Abutment connection: Abutments were randomly allocated to control (subjected only to the usually adopted steam cleaning) and test groups (subjected to plasma of argon cleaning).
Plasma of Argon: Test group abutments underwent argon plasma treatment in a plasma reactor (Diener Electronic, Jettingen, Germany). The treatment conditions were 75 W of power and 1 bar of pressure for 12 minutes.</description>
