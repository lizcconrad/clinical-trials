    <textblock>
      This study is examining the effects of growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) on mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI). GHRH will be given at a dose of 1mg/day for 10 weeks to subjects
      with MCI as well as healthy controls.

    <textblock>
      Subjects with MCI as well as healthy controls will be given GHRH at a dose of 1mg/day for 10
      weeks.

      This study is designed to investigate the effects of GHRH on the following things: 1)
      cognitive function as measured by our neuropsychologist with a series of short tests; 2)
      brain activity as measured by fMRI 3) lean and fat mass of your body as measured by DEXA; 4)
      physical function as measured by a walking test.
