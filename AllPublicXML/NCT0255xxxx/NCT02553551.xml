      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Vitamine C supplements to be helpful to
      reduce the postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy through the double-blinded
      randomized controlled trial.

      The primary purpose of this study is to confirm the reduce of postoperative pain through the
      oral supplement of Vitamine C before and after the surgery. For this purpose, we compared the
      dosage or counts of opioids usage with the oral supplement of Vitamine C or not.

      The secondary purpose is to assess the pain score, postoperative morbidities, postoperative
      length of stay or postoperative time between two groups.
