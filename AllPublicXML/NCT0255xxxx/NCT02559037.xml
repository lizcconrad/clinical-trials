    <description>Acupuncture acupoints: ST36, ST37, SP6, SP9, SP4, LR3, LI3，all are bilateral.Sterile disposable stainless steel needles (with a diameter of 0.30 mm and length of 40 mm or 25 mm) were used. The needles were directly inserted 20-30mm into the skin and elicited a de-qisensation. The needle was kept in position for 30 min.
Moxibustion acupoints: ST25，ST36，both are bilateral. Using mild-warm moxibustion，keep transcutaneous temperature maintained at 43 ℃ ± 1 ℃, 30min for each acupoint. Moxibustion and acupuncture were performed at the same time once every other day, three times a week, a total of 24 weeks of moxibustion treatment. After the treatment, subjects were followed up in the 36 weeks and 48 weeks.</description>

    <description>Sham acupuncture points: same to the experimental group. Needles with the same diameter and length as those used in the experimental group were used for needling; however, the needles were directly inserted only 1-2 mm into the skin, without eliciting a de-qisensation.
Sham moxibustion acupoints: same to the experimental group;using mild-warm moxibustion，keep transcutaneous temperature maintained at 37 ℃ ± 1 ℃, 30min for each acupoint, once every other day, three times a week, a total of 24 weeks of moxibustion treatment. After the treatment, subjects were followed up in the 36 weeks and 48 weeks.</description>

    <description>Acupuncture is puncture the needle into specific part of the body according to a certain angle, using specific means to cause the De-qi sensation, and maintain a certain amount of time.
Mild-warm moxibustion is a type of moxa stick moxibustion that is performed by holding an ignited moxa stick a certain distance above the patient's skin, keeping the spot warm and making it reddened, but not burnt.The temperature maintained at 43 ± 1℃。</description>

Placebo mild-warm moxibustion is a type of moxa stick moxibustion that is performed by holding an ignited moxa stick a certain distance above the patient's skin (farther than the real moxibustion), keeping the temperature maintained at 37 ± 1℃。</description>
