      This study consists of two substudies.

      The first substudy:

      'Renal resistive index in critically ill patients with cardiogenic and septic shock'

      Design: cross-sectional observational

      Aim of this project is:

        1. to determine whether critically ill patients with cardiogenic and septic shock have an
           elevated Renal Resistive Index and

        2. to determine whether Renal Resistive Index differs between cardiogenic/hypovolemic shock
           and shock due to sepsis/systemic inflammation (SIRS)

        3. to determine the relation between the (change in) renal vascular resistance and

             -  Markers of the systemic - and the microcirculation

             -  Fluid status as quantified by bioimpedance analysis

             -  Concomitant renal function

      The second substudy:

      'Predictive value of the Renal Resistive Index on ICU admission and its course for the
      development of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients with cardiogenic and septic
      shock'

      Design: longitudinal observational

      The aim of this project is:

        1. to determine whether the renal resistance index on admission to the intensive care unit
           can predict the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients with
           shock

        2. to investigate if the renal resistance index on admission to the intensive care unit is
           an independent predictor of the development of AKI or depends on the severity and
           duration of shock and other known risk factors of AKI such as comorbidity and use of
           nephrotoxic drugs

      Aim of the large research project is to determine whether the Renal Resistive Index could
      become a monitoring tool for intervention studies aiming to prevent acute kidney injury or
      protect the kidney.

    <textblock>
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a severe complication developing in intensive care patients as a
      result of hypovolemic, cardiogenic or septic shock. It is defined by an abrupt decrease in
      kidney function. It encompasses both direct injury to the kidney as well as acute impairment
      of function, including decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Its prevention is crucial
      because AKI increases morbidity and mortality (1). Mechanisms comprise ischemia/reperfusion,
      oxidative stress, inflammation and toxicity (2).The common pathophysiological pathway
      includes endothelial damage to microvessels leading to impaired macro- and microvascular flow
      and this will aggravate ischemia (3).

      Up to now, much controversy exists about

        -  the changes in renal blood flow during different kinds of shock

        -  the relation between renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and the development of
           AKI

        -  the relation between renal blood flow and markers of the systemic and microcirculation

      In this prospective observational study, three study measurement will be performed in two
      groups of critically ill patients (shock and no shock).

        1. The Renal Resistive Index (RRI) will be determined using Renal Doppler Ultrasound . The
           renal resistive index (RRI) is a sonographic index assessing resistance of the
           intrarenal arcuate or interlobar arteries and is used to assess renal arterial disease.
           It is measured as RRI = (peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic
           velocity. The normal value is ≈ 0,60, with 0,70 being around the upper limits of normal.

        2. The sublingual microcirculation will be quantified using side stream dark field imaging
           (SDF)

        3. Fluid status will be determined by Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the
           Akern device.

      In addition, routinely measured markers of circulation, renal function and fluid balance will
      be collected for analysis.

        Adult patients, admitted tot the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

        Variables will be measured in a population of 80 adult patients admitted tot the Intensive
        Care Unit. This group consists of two groups of 40 patients. The first group consists of 40
        patients with cardiogenic or septic shock, the second group will be the control group being
        intensive care patients without shock. The patients with shock are at increased risk for
        developing Acute Kidney Injury (AKI).
