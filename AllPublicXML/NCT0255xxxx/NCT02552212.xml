  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active Axial Spondyloarthritis without x-ray evidence of Ankylosing Spondylitis
      and with signs of inflammation will be randomly assigned to receive certolizumab pegol (CZP)
      200 mg every two weeks or placebo. The primary objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of
      CZP in these patients.

    <measure>Percentage of subjects meeting the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score major improvement (ASDAS-MI) response criteria at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>ASDAS-MI is achieved when there is a reduction (improvement) &gt;= 2.0 in the ASDAS relative to Baseline.
The ASDAS is calculated as the sum of the following components:
0.121 × Back pain (BASDAI Q2 result) 0.058 × Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Q6 result) 0.110 × PtGADA 0.073 × Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Q3 result) 0.579 × (natural logarithm of the CRP [mg/L] + 1) Back pain, PtGADA, duration of morning stiffness, peripheral pain/swelling and fatigue are all assessed on a numerical scale (0 to 10 units).</description>

The ASAS40 response is defined as relative improvements of at least 40 % and absolute improvement of at least 2 units on a 0 to 10 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) in at least 3 of the 4 domains: Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PtGADA), Pain assessment (total spinal pain NRS scores), Function (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)), Inflammation (mean of Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) questions 5 and 6 concerning morning stiffness intensity and duration) and no worsening at all in the remaining domain.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Bath ankylosing spondylitis disease activity index (BASDAI) is a validated self-reported instrument, which consists of six 10 unit horizontal Numeric Rating Scales to measure the disease activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the subject's perspective. It measures the severity of fatigue, spinal and peripheral joint pain and swelling, enthesitis, and morning stiffness (both severity and duration) over the last week. The final BASDAI scores ranges from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating lower disease activity.</description>
