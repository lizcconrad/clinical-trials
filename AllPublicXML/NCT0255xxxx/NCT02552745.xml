    <textblock>
      This study is aiming to understand the effects of parecoxib on the postoperative
      complications of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing hepatic transcatheter
      arterial embolization (TACE). The investigators enrolled 242 patients who were diagnosed with
      HCC for the first time and who received hepatic TACE at the Cancer Prevention and Treatment
      Center of Sun Yat-sen University from October 2014 to March 2015 were prospectively enrolled.
      The patients were divided into study and control groups according to whether parecoxib sodium
      was administered postoperatively. Pain scores,body temperature, vomiting, and changes in
      liver function after surgery, as well as the length of the hospital stay, were recorded and
      compared.
