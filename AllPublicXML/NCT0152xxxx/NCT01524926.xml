  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will primarily assess the antitumor activity of crizotinib in a variety of tumors
      with alterations in ALK and/or MET pathways. The targeted patient population will include
      patients with tumors harboring specific alterations leading to ALK and/or MET activation,
      where tyrosine kinase inhibitors against these targets have not yet been adequately explored.
