  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Future patients might benefit from a combination of linezolid (LIN) and clarithromycin (CLA)
      in the treatment of Multidrug-resistant and Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis
      (MDR/XDR-TB) due to possible synergistic activity as shown in in vitro experiments in
      different Mycobacteria strains. The investigators observed increased LIN serum levels in
      three cases after combining LIN and CLA of which the investigators described one in a case
      report (Bolhuis et al). The investigators suggest to conduct a prospective pharmacokinetic
      study in MDR- and XDR-TB patients to quantify the above described interaction between LIN and
      CLA.
