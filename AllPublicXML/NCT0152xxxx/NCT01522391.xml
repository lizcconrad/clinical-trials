  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate microbial density in eczematous lesions
      during two weeks of twice daily therapy with the investigational product, DPK-060 1%
      ointment, compared with placebo in patients with atopic dermatitis. This randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the study was preceded with an open-label
      investigation in a small group of patients (n=5) treated with two applications of DPK-060 1%
      ointment per day for four days to assess safety, local tolerability and systemic absorption
      of DPK-060.

      The secondary objectives were to evaluate severity of eczema and pruritus, to assess the
      tolerability and safety of the treatment and to assess the degree of systemic absorption of
      DPK-060 in blood on Day 7 and Day 21 in a sub-set of 10 patients.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A clinical diagnosis of atopic dermatitis

          -  Treatable eczematous lesions of a total area of at least 25 cm2 (100 cm2 for the
             initial five patients)

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential had to be using an appropriate method of
             contraception.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential were not eligible before PK data from the
             first 10 patients had been evaluated and the Medical Products Agency (Swedish
             regulatory agency) had given approval to include women of childbearing potential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant clinical illness, within the two weeks prior to first dose, which could
             affect the outcome of the study

          -  Previous local or systemic antimicrobial therapy within the last four weeks prior to
             the first application of the investigational product (DPK-060 1% or placebo ointment)

          -  Existence of any surgical or medical condition which, in the judgment of the
             investigator, might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of the drug

          -  Patients who had had systemic treatment for atopic dermatitis or other topical or
             transdermal treatments (such as nicotine, hormone replacement therapies)on the site of
             eczema within 14 days prior to first application of DPK-060 1% or placebo ointment
             and/or topical treatment with tar, any corticosteroid,topical immunomodulators or oral
             treatment with any corticosteroids within 14 days prior to first application and/or
             oral antihistamines within 14 days of the first dose.

          -  A need for any other medication during the period 0 to 7 days before entry to the
             study, (excluding the oral contraceptive pill for females) except those deemed by the
             principal investigator / clinical investigator not to interfere with the outcome of
             the study

          -  Diagnosis of other skin diseases, which in the opinion of the investigator, were
             likely to adversely affect the outcome of the study

          -  History or evidence of significant cardiac, renal, hepatic or endocrine disease

          -  Significant hypersensitivity or allergy, as judged by the investigator

          -  Immunocompromised patients

          -  Lice or scabies

          -  Tinea corporis

          -  Hypersensitivity to the ingredients of the vehicle

          -  The presence of prominent tattoos at sites of application of DPK-060 1% or placebo
             ointment

          -  Donation of blood, exceeding 450 mL, during the three months prior to first dose

          -  Participation in a clinical study during the 12 weeks prior to first dose

          -  Ongoing alcohol or drug abuse
