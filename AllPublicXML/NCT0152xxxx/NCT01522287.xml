      The goal of this project is to improve access to effective treatments for obsessive
      compulsive disorder (OCD) through the use of web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      treatment. There intervention involves both a computer program (BT Steps) and human
      interaction via telephone. The investigators will test the efficacy and feasibility of
      computer therapy alone (n=35), computer plus a non-therapist coach (n=35), and computer plus
      a CBT therapist coach (n=35

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for evidence-based mental health treatments i.e., 'treatment based on the best
      available science or research evidence‟1, has been stressed from scientific, ethical, and
      marketing perspectives. While empirical evidence supports both the efficacy and effectiveness
      of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), demand for
      clinicians trained in these approaches far exceeds supply. New technologies provide the
      opportunity to facilitate access to this specialized treatment. A growing body of research
      has found that web-based self-administered psychotherapy is highly effective, cost-efficient,
      and can achieve clinical improvements similar to those obtained with clinician administered
      therapy. The long-term goal of this project is to improve clinical and occupational
      functioning and decrease disability associated with OCD by improving access to effective
      treatments through the use of web-based CBT treatment. The intervention involves a computer
      program (BT STEPS) and human interaction via telephone. The inclusion of human interaction
      for coaching and encouragement has been found to significantly increase compliance and
      success rates in computerized self-help. Whether treatment outcomes differ when this coaching
      is done by a therapist versus when done by a trained non-therapist has not been studied. This
      is the first program to examine a hybrid model involving different levels of remote clinician
      coaching in combination with an on-line self-help tutorial. In Phase I the investigators will
      test the efficacy and feasibility of computer therapy alone (n=35), computer plus
      nontherapist coach (n=35) and computer plus CBT therapist coach. In phase II the
      investigators will do a fully powered study comparing our model to traditional face-to-face
      therapy.

    <description>Subjects assigned to BT STEPS without coaching will receive computer assisted Cognitive Behavior Therapy. They will receive a welcome and orientation call from the project manager and up to three automated reminder e-mails if there is no activity in the BT Steps website for 5 days. E-mails will describe most recent &quot;step&quot; the participant used and what to expect in upcoming steps. The focus of reminder messages is on the patient‟s progress through BT STEPS.</description>

    <description>Subjects randomized to BT STEPS with coaching will receive computer assisted Cognitive Behavior Therapy plus regularly scheduled weekly coaching, encouragement and support via phone. Calls will focus on user's progress in BT STEPS, troubleshoot problems the participant is having with the program, and set progress goals for the next coaching session. Coaches will be supervised by the CBT therapist, and may consult with the CBT clinician as needed.</description>
