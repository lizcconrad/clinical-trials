  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study suggests for the first time a comparison of the hemodynamic performance of the two
      most implanted aortic bioprosthesis in France with the new aortic bioprosthesis available
      since September 2010 at the University Hospital of Clermont Ferrand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the French database Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, 11,621
      patients underwent aortic valve replacement in 2007. Over 77% of biologic prosthetic valves
      were used. Among these biologic valves, those in pericardium are mainly used in all French
      cardiac surgery centers.

      Since March 2010, a new pericardial aortic valve has obtained a CE mark, allowing cardiac
      surgery centers in Europe to implement it in humans.

      Hemodynamic performance of different biologic valves has never been measured. This study
      suggests for the first time a comparison of the hemodynamic performance of the two most
      implanted aortic bioprosthesis in France with the new aortic bioprosthesis available since
      September 2010 at the University Hospital of Clermont Ferrand.
