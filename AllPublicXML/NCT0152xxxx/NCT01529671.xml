    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects or female subjects of non-child bearing potential between the
             ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          -  elderly cohort : healthy male and/or female subjects of 65 and 74 years,

          -  cohort 3: subjects with osteoarthritis of the knee: Male or female subjects not of
             child bearing potential between the ages of 18 and 75 years inclusive at the time of
             entering the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 60 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec at Screening. If
             QTc exceeds 450 msec, or QRS exceeds 120 msec, the ECG should be repeated two more
             times and the average of the three QTc or QRS values should be used to determine the
             subject's eligibility.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of ≤1 g/day. Limited
             use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or
             the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) or more within 56 days prior to
             dosing.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.

        for cohort 3: Evidence of relapse or recurrence of clinically significant endocrine,
        metabolic, pulmonary, hepatic, osteo-mio-artricular, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
        renal, , psychiatric or neurological disease, or neurological disease less than 28 days
        prior to screening.

        Symptomatic OA of the hip ipsilateral to index knee which the patient considers more
        painful than the knee. History of diseases other than OA that may involve the index knee in
        the last 12 months prior to screening, including but not limited to: inflammatory joint
        diseases (i.e rehumatoid arthritis and gout), calcium crystal diseases, bursitis,
        tendinitis, tumors and cysts, ligament injuries, bone fractures, post-infective
        pathologies; widespread chronic pain conditions (ie, fibromyalgia) and neuropathic
        disorders.
