  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a standard of care document, outlining the therapy for children with high risk
      neuroblastoma who are not eligible for Children's Oncology Group (COG) studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This therapy involves the use of melphalan, etoposide, and carboplatin (consolidation
      chemotherapy); autologous stem cell rescue, post-transplant radiation therapy and a
      maintenance phase with Isotretinoin (Accutane, 13-cis-retinoic acid) therapy. If available,
      patients should also consider post-transplant therapy with cytokines and monoclonal antibody
      (ch14.18) on a COG or New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) trial.

    <description>It is suggested that patients who have a complete surgical resection of the primary tumor receive 21.6 Gy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the post-induction chemotherapy, pre-operative primary tumor volume. It is suggested that patients who have an incomplete surgical resection of the primary tumor (residual soft tissue mass measuring &gt;1 cm3) will receive 21.6 Gy EBRT to the postinduction chemotherapy, pre-operative primary tumor volume and an additional boost of 14.4 Gy EBRT to the gross residual tumor (total dose 36 Gy to gross residual tumor volume). Radiation should be given after stem cell transplantation and should start no sooner than 28 days post transplant.</description>

    <description>Post-transplant maintenance therapy with cis-RA daily for 14 days every 28 days repeated for 6 months. This phase of the therapy can be initiated by the BMT team and continued by the referring physician. It is recommended to begin Isotretinoin at day 66 post-transplant and no later than day 100. For patients ≤12 kg, isotretinoin (accutane) should be administered at 5.33 mg/kg/dose divided twice daily. For patients &gt;12 kg isotretinoin (accutane) should be administered at 160 mg/m^2/day divided twice a day. Patients should be considered for monoclonal antibody therapy against GD2, such as ch14.18 if such trials are available.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 30 years of age at diagnosis of neuroblastoma

          -  No evidence of disease progression: defined as increase in tumor size of &gt;25% or new
             lesions

          -  Recovery from last induction course of chemotherapy (absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500
             and platelet &gt; 20,000)

          -  No uncontrolled infection

          -  Minimum frozen peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) of 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg for
             transplant are mandatory and 2 x 10^6 CD34 cells/kg for back-up are strongly
             recommended (thus, PBSC of 4 x 106 CD34 cells/kg is encouraged)

          -  Adequate organ function defined as:

               -  Hepatic: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt; 3 x upper limit of institutional
                  normal 8 Cardiac: shortening fraction ≥ 27% or ejection fraction ≥ 50%, no
                  clinical congestive heart failure 8 Renal: Creatinine clearance or glomerular
                  filtration rate (GFR) &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m^2 If a creatinine clearance is performed
                  at end induction and the result is &lt; 100 ml/min/1.73m^2, a GFR must then be
                  performed using a nuclear blood sampling method or iothalamate clearance method.
                  Camera method is NOT allowed as measure of GFR prior to or during Consolidation
                  therapy for patients with GFR or creatinine clearance of &lt; 100 ml/min/1.73m^2

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with progressive disease should consider participating in phase I studies
             since consolidation therapy using the regimen outlined in this document have not been
             determined to be useful.

          -  Patients who are delayed in consolidation chemotherapy beyond 8 weeks, and don't meet
             organ function criteria.
