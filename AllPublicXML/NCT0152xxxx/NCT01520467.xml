  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no drug with pediatric marketing authorization capable of limiting the
      advance in bone maturation of children with aggressive adrenarche. Estrogens are the
      principal actors involved in bone maturation and premature epiphyseal fusion. Aromatase
      inhibitors, used for the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, block the transformation of
      androgens into estrogens. Third generation inhibitors, of which Anastrozole is one, appear to
      be well tolerated in children and are sometimes used within the framework of clinical trials
      to limit bone maturation and improve prognosis with respect to final size, notably in
      children treated with growth hormone (GH) due to a GH deficit. Nevertheless, the data
      reported are based on small sample sizes and do not include children with pathological
      adrenarche.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), which occurs secondary to an imprinting disorder due to the
      anomalous methylation of chromosome 11 or due to a uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, is a
      rare syndrome (ORPHA813, OMIM 180860) characterized by growth retardation with an
      intrauterine onset, a normal head circumference, small postnatal size and major feeding
      difficulties. Starting at a very young age, the rapid aging of bone can occur even in the
      absence of central puberty, in association with the production of androgens by the adrenal
      glands (adrenarche). This advanced bone maturation can compromise final size, even when the
      child receives growth hormone (GH) treatment for several years.

      Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is also a rare disease (ORPHA739, OMIM 176270), occurring
      secondary to an imprinting disorder due to an anomaly in chromosome 15 (paternal deletion or
      maternal disomy). These children also present feeding difficulties during the first few years
      of life, as well as small size. They are frequently treated with GH, and their bone age can
      increase during the course of adrenarche, as in certain patients with SRS.
