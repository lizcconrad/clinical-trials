  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of Life (Qol) is a complex concept which relates to the perception of subjective
      satisfaction, especially in elderly population. It also relates to the self-perception of
      psychological status, independence level, to the social relationships, and to the environment
      where the elderly person lives. Consequently, there are a number of factors which may change
      the perception of QoL, namely the occurrence of diseases, physical impairment or incapacity,
      and the rupture of social relationship, as well as the aging process itself. Physical
      exercise is associated to improvement of mental and physical health. However, few studies
      investigated the effect of strength training and whole- body vibration training on elderly
      subjects. Following this line of reasoning, the purpose of the present study is to assess the
      effect of physical exercise on cognition and functional abilities in elderly subjects.
      Design: Randomized controlled trial, double-blinded, with 12-week follow-up. Setting: Gama
      Filho University. Participants: Healthy Elderly. Interventions: The patients will be randomly
      assigned to a strength training group (STG), whole-body vibration training group (WBVG) and a
      control group (CG). Main outcome measures: Cognitive function will be assessed using Mini
      Metal State Examination (MMSE), Trail A and B, Digit Span, Stroop Test, Rey auditory-verbal
      learning test and Clock Test, and functional capacity will be evaluated using Senior Fitness
      Test, American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance(AAHPERD)functional
      fitness test, and Short Form 36(SF-36) health survey.

      Design: Three-month controlled, randomized, and double-blind study. The subjects will be
      recruited from the Gama Filho University. They will be randomized with a blind design to a
      whole-body vibration training group (WBV), strength training group (STG) and control group
      (CG) by a researcher who will not participate of the initial assessments.

      Intervention

      The study is a longitudinal randomized clinical trial. The subjects will perform three visits
      to the laboratory where they will be submitted to neuropsychological, behavioral and physical
      evaluations. These evaluations will be performed before and after three months of training.
      Each visit will last about an hour and a half. After a period of one week of adaptation,
      subjects begin training with the charges set out in this study. All groups will carry out
      training twice a week, forty minutes, for three months. Next, will be described in detail the
      experimental procedures in each group:

      STG Group Participants will undergo a training program set for the three functional groups,
      which lasted ten minutes, followed by thirty minutes of strength training twice a week
      consists of six exercises for major muscle groups: leg press, bench press, lat pull down,
      knee extension, knee flexion and Abdominal (3 sets of 10-12 repetitions at 60-80% of 1 RM
      with 3 min interval between sets and between workouts).

      WBV Group Participants will undergo a training program set for the three functional groups,
      which lasted ten minutes, followed by thirty minutes of exercise stimuli to whole-body
      vibration training twice a week (2-3 sets of 30 sec. with frequency of stimulation at 30 Hz
      with 60 s intervals between stimuli), the platform will hold a range of six functional
      exercises combining squats and isometric or dynamic exercises for the upper limbs and trunk.

      Control Group Participants will undergo a training program set for the three functional
      groups of ten minutes duration, followed by thirty minutes of functional exercises twice a
      week (2-3 sets of 30 sec. At intervals of 60 s between stimuli) carry out a range of six
      functional exercises combining squats and isometric or dynamic exercises for the upper limbs
      and trunk without intensity.

    <time_frame>from date to randomization at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) is multidimensional, consisting of 36 items, divided into eight scales, each scale assesses a health concept, they are: limitations in physical activities because of health problems, limitations in social activities due to physical or emotional problems, limitations in daily activities due to health problems, body pain, mental health, limitations in daily activities due to emotional problems, vitality (energy and fatigue), perception of general health.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Senior Fitness Test at 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>from date to randomization at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of functional capacity of patients will be conducted through the battery functional tests of the Senior Fitness Test. Will be evaluated regarding their balance, strength, lower limb and upper, flexibility, agility, running and cardiovascular fitness. The battery consists of seven physical tests: 1) Time to Up and Go (TUG), 2) get up and down, 3) flexibility and 4) strength of MI and MS, 5) 6-minute walk, 6) sit down and test achieve, and 7) test bench.</description>

    <time_frame>from date to randomization at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The participant begins the test in a chair with your heels flat on the floor. At the signal of &quot;ready now&quot; moves to the right and around a cone positioned at 1.50 m and 1.80 m behind to the side of the chair, returning to his chair and sat down. Immediately the participant gets up, moves to the left and around the second cone, returning to his chair and sat down again. So complete a circuit. The individual must complete two full circuits.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Trail Making Test at 12 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>from date to randomization at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper. In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 - 25, and the patient should draw lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles include both numbers (1 - 13) and letters (A - L); as in Part A, the patient draws lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added task of alternating between the numbers and letters. The patient should be instructed to connect the circles as quickly as possible, without lifting the pen or pencil from the paper.</description>
