  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of Vasomera (PB1046) administered subcutaneously in adult subjects with Stage
      1 or Stage 2 essential hypertension.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of
      single ascending doses of Vasomera and the relationship between serum concentrations of
      Vasomera and change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as measured by:

        -  Mean change from baseline in 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured by
           ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) as compared to placebo.

        -  Identification of the minimum and maximum decrease in systolic and diastolic blood
           pressure as measured by ABPM.

        -  Mean change from baseline in cuff systolic and diastolic blood pressure as compared to
           placebo.

        -  Effect of Vasomera on pulse pressure and heart rate.

      An additional secondary objective of this study will be to characterize the immunogenicity
      profile of Vasomera following a single subcutaneous dose.
