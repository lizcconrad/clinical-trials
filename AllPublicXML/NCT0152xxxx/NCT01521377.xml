  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled, four period incomplete block,crossover thorough QT
      study to estimate the effect of repeat dose GSK573719/GW642444M (Vilanterol) combination and
      GSK573719 monotherapy on the QTc interval in healthy male and female subjects compared with
      placebo. At least 100 subjects will receive, four of five possible, 10-day repeat dose
      treatments. Treatments are placebo with a moxifloxacin placebo on day 10, placebo with
      moxifloxacin (400mg) on day 10, GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (125/25μg) with moxifloxacin
      placebo on day 10, GSK573719/Vilanterol combinatio (500/100μg) with moxifloxacin placebo on
      day 10, or GSK573719 (500μg) with a moxifloxacin placebo on day 10. All treatments are double
      blind except for moxifloxacin (400mg) and moxifloxacin placebo controls, given as a
      single-blind single dose on Day 10 of the appropriate treatment period.

      Primary endpoints are individual time-matched changes from baseline QTcF for
      GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (125/25μg) and GSK573719 (500μg), 0-24 hours after dosing on
      Day 10. Secondary endpoints will include individual time-matched changes from baseline in
      QTcF for GSK573719/Vilanterol combination (500/100μg) and moxifloxacin (400mcg) 0-24 hours
      after dosing on Day 10. Also changes from baseline in QTci, QTcB, QT, QRS, RR, PR and
      ventricular rate at each time point after 10 days dosing of each GSK573719 and
      GSK573719/Vilanterol treatment and single dose moxifloxacin (400mg). Maximal change from
      baseline 0-24hours after dosing on day 10 will be derived for QTcF, QTci and QTcB for each
      treatment. Plasma concentrations on Day 10 (0-24 hours) and pharmacokinetic parameters of
      GSK573719 and Vilanterol will also be derived. Key assessments: 12- lead electrocardiogram
      (ECG), pharmacokinetics. Safety will be assessed by blood pressure, heart rate, clinical
      laboratory safety tests and collection of adverse events (AEs).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator believes that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;147
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until after the Follow Up visit

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Body weight ≥ 45 kg and BMI within the range 18 - 29.5 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  No significant abnormality on 12-lead ECG at screening, including the following
             specific requirements:

               -  Ventricular rate ≥ 40 beats per minute

               -  PR interval ≤ 210msec

               -  Q waves &lt; 30msec (up to 50 ms permitted in lead III only)

               -  QRS interval to be ≥ 60msec and &lt; 120msec

               -  The waveforms must enable the QT interval to be clearly defined

               -  QTcF interval must be &lt; 450msec (machine or manual reading).

          -  A 24 hour Holter ECG at screening that demonstrates no clinically significant
             abnormalities or finding that could interfere with interpretation of the study
             results, when assessed by an appropriately trained and experienced reviewer

          -  Subjects who are able to use the Novel DPIsatisfactorily.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent and a signed and dated written informed
             consent is obtained, which includes compliance with the requirements and restrictions
             listed in the consent form.

          -  Normal spirometry (FEV1 ≥ 80% of predicted, FEV1/FVC ≥ 70%).

          -  Non-smokers (never smoked or not smoking for &gt;6 months with &lt;10 pack years history
             (Pack years = (cigarettes per day smoked/20) x number of years smoked)).

          -  Available to complete the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of any medically significant disease, or any disorder that would
             introduce additional risk or interfere with the study procedures or outcome. In
             particular, a family history of QT prolongation, of early or sudden cardiac death or
             of early cardiovascular disease.

          -  History of symptomatic arrhythmias.

             particular, the subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to quinolones,
             ipratropium bromide, tiotropium, atropine and any of its derivatives. Or any adverse
             reaction including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to any β2 agonist or

             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 3 months, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
