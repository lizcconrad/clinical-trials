  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two regimens of polyethylene glycol(PEG) plus
      bisacodyl versus PEG alone for bowel preparation in hospitalized patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate bowel preparation may lead to a longer colonoscopy, and to an inability to
      identify lesions. PEG can provide a rapid orthograde peroral approach to colonic lavage
      without producing significant fluid or electrolyte changes. Thus PEG is now commonly used for
      bowel preparation. However, large amounts and unsatisfactory taste of PEG solution are
      generally poorly tolerated, especially in hospitalized patients who had comorbidity and
      restricted ambulation. Recently, a new PEG-based bowel cleansing agents became available. It
      combines PEG with a high dose of ascorbic acid or bisacodyl. Although many studies reported
      the efficacy of these combined solution for colonoscopy, but efficacy in hospitalized
      patients was under-recognized.
