  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine abuse and addiction are widespread and is causing increasing pressures on
      social, public health and criminal justice systems worldwide. Some of the risk for developing
      addiction may be genetic. Identifying specific genotypes and understanding their interactions
      with the environment may help predict who is at risk for developing a disease. In this study
      the investigators are evaluating the contribution of differences in one genotype - called
      CYP2D6 to the removal of methamphetamine from the body. Methamphetamine is removed from the
      body by special enzymes in the liver. One of these enzymes is called Cytochrome P450 2D6. The
      activity of 2D6 is genetically determined. Some people have no active 2D6 whereas in others
      2D6 is very active. One group of scientists found that people with low 2D6 activity were less
      likely to become methamphetamine addicts. In this study the investigators will determine the
      activity of your 2D6 by looking at the CYP2D6 genotype. If low levels of 2D6 decrease the
      risk of methamphetamine addiction it may be because there is less of the chemicals (called
      metabolites) made by 2D6. The first step in the metabolism (the process of removal of drugs
      from the body) of methamphetamine by 2D6 is conversion of methamphetamine to amphetamine and
      para-hydroxymethamphetamine. 2D6 then converts these to inactive chemicals. In addition to
      determining your genotype, the investigators are interested in the relationship of genotype
      with the methamphetamine metabolism. Thus, as part of this study, you will be given a modest
      oral dose of 5 milligrams of methamphetamine. After receiving the methamphetamine you will
      need to collect your urine for 24 hours.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of genetic variation in CYP2D6 on the
      disposition of methamphetamine in the human body as well as its pharmacologic effects to
      humans.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is healthy, as judged by a responsible physician, with no clinically
             significant abnormality identified on the laboratory or medical evaluation, including
             12-lead ECG, at screening. A subject with a clinical laboratory or laboratory
             parameter outside the reference range (adjusted for age, if appropriate), may be
             included only if the Investigator considers that the abnormal finding does not pose
             additional risk and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          2. Male or female, aged 18-55 years inclusive

          3. Body weight over 50kg (110 lbs) and body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 30 kg/m2
             inclusive.

          4. Have normal cardiac function including normal blood pressure and heart rate.

          5. Have normal renal function as evident by a creatinine clearance &gt;70 ml/min and normal
             serum creatinine levels

          6. The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol at screening or prior to the start
             of dosing.

          2. Subjects with a clinical history of current alcohol or illicit drug use which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability to comply with
             the dosing schedule and protocol-specified evaluations.

          3. Active Psychiatric disease: DSM-IV diagnosis of a current alcohol, opiate, or sedative
             hypnotic dependence disorder requiring medical detoxification, history of
             decompensated schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder; Severe
             mania, hypomania, agitated behaviour, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress
             disorder within the past 90 days; presence of suicidal behavior two years prior to
             enrolment or suicidal intent within the past 30 days.

          4. The subject has received an investigational drug or participated in any other research
             trial within 30 days, 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of
             any drug (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current study medication.

          5. Use of any prescription or non-prescription drugs, vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements within seven days (or 14 days if the drug is a potential CYP2D6 enzyme
             inhibitor) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study
             mediation, unless, in the opinion of the Investigator and sponsor, the medication will
             not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          6. Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Examples of conditions
             that could interfere with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility include
             gastrointestinal bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy, small bowel resection,
             vagotomy, malabsorption, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal or urinary
             obstruction, or celiac sprue.

          7. History of hypersensitivity to amphetamine-type drugs, or history of drug or other
             allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible, contraindicates their
             participation.

          8. Pregnancy or fertile women without adequate means of contraception.

          9. Any other medical or psychosocial condition that would preclude useful, safe or
             consistent participation.
