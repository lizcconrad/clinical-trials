  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project was undertaking by Qilu Hospital of Shandong University and other 13 well-known
      hospitals in China. In order to report the efficacy and safety of Recombinant Human
      thrombopoietin combining with Rituximab for the treatment of adults with refractory immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP), compared to conventional Rituximab therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are undertaking a parallel group, multicentre, randomised controlled trial
      of 240 refractory ITP adult patients from 14 medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive recombinant human thrombopoietin (given
      subcutaneously at a dose of 300 Units/kg for 14 consecutive days,following with a flexible
      dosage depending on platelet count until the 29th day), combining with rituximab (given
      intravenously at a dose of 100 mg weekly for 4 weeks, i.e. Day 1, 8, 15, 22; the others are
      selected to receive low-dose of rituximab treatment (given intravenously at a dose of 100 mg
      weekly, i.e. Day 1, 8, 15, 22). Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated
      before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study. In order
      to report the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy compared to conventional
      rituximab therapy for the treatment of adults with refractory ITP.
