    <textblock>
      Obese patients undergoing cesarean section are at high risk for wound complications, which
      occur in approximately 20% of patients. This is a randomized controlled trial designed to
      determine whether the risk for wound-related complications can be reduced by covering the
      incision with a silver-impregnated dressing in the postoperative period.

      This study's purpose was to evaluate the effect of a FDA approved silver-impregnated dressing
      on cesarean wound complications in obese women. It was initiated and 37 women were
      randomized, but because of logistical barriers, we were unable to gather outcome data either
      by the intended survey or by chart review. When it became clear that we would be unable to
      complete the study, recruitment was terminated and further attempts at data gathering were
      stopped. While a small number of photographs were taken as intended, they were lost due to a
      technological failure prior to any analysis. Therefore no outcome data could be analyzed.
      Nonetheless, as patients of the University of Michigan Health System, all research subjects
      received health care treatment appropriate to their medical condition and circumstances.

      <desc>The original intent was to pull adverse event data from the medical record in batches as the study progressed. Because enrollment ceased early with insufficient numbers to draw conclusions, no adverse event data was collected in study. Therefore the 0 numbers affected listed below in serious and other adverse events represent no collected data of adverse events, not a guarantee that no adverse events happened. All participants were under medical care with attending physicians at all times.</desc>
