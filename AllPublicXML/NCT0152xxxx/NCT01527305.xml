    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of paliperidone
      palmitate in schizophrenic inpatients who have experienced recent exacerbation of acute
      schizophrenia (that is within past 4 weeks).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective
      (looking forward using periodic observations collected predominantly following participant
      enrollment), non-comparative and multicenter study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      of paliperidone palmitate in acute schizophrenic participants. This study consists of a
      screening phase (up to 7 days), treatment phase (13 weeks), and a study completion or early
      withdrawal visit. Safety evaluations will include adverse events, clinical laboratory tests,
      concomitant medications, physical examination, and vital signs, which will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of study participation for each participant will be
      approximately 13 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0), Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is scale of 30 items which includes 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With at Least a 30 Percent Reduction From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is scale of 30 items which includes 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The total score is the sum of all 30 PANSS items, with a range of 30 (absent) to 210 (extreme ill).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Marder Factor Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>Marder factor scores of the PANSS, derived by factor-analysis includes 5 factors: negative symptom, positive symptom, disorganized thought, uncontrolled hostility/excitement, and anxiety/depression factor scales. Positive factor score (range: 8 to 56): sum of select scores from positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Negative factor score (range: 7 to 49): sum of select scores from negative and general psychopathology subscales. Disorganized thoughts factor score (range: 7 to 49): sum of select scores from positive, negative, and general psychopathology subscales. Uncontrolled hostility/excitement factor score (range: 4 to 28): sum of select scores from positive and general psychopathology subscales. Anxiety/Depression factor score (range: 4 to 28): sum of select scores from general psychopathology subscale. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Subscale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is scale of 30 items which includes 3 subscales, the positive subscale (7 items), the negative subscale (7 items), and the general psychopathology subscale (16 items). The scale ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). Each item is rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The subscale score is the sum of scores of items in the subscale. Positive subscale (range: 7 to 49), negative subscale (range: 7 to 49) and general psychopathology subscale (range: 16 to 112). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Severity of Illness Using the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is used to rate the severity of a participant's overall clinical condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 to 7 where 1=Normal, not at all ill, 2=Borderline mentally ill, 3=Mildly ill, 4=Moderately ill, 5=Markedly ill, 6=Severely ill, 7=Among the most extremely ill.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP assesses the overall personal and social functioning on a continuum from grossly impaired functioning to excellent functioning using 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The degree of dysfunction a participant exhibits during the month prior to the assessment is rated on a 6-point scale (1=absent, 2=mild, 3=manifest, 4=marked, 5=severe, 6=very severe). The final total score ranges from 1 - 100 (71 - 100 indicating mild, good or excellent degree of dysfunction, 31 - 70 indicating varying degrees of difficulty, and &lt;=30 indicating such a poor level functioning that intensive supervision is required).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Readiness for Hospitalization Discharge for Inpatients Using the Readiness for Discharge Questionnaire (RDQ) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The 6-item RDQ consists of 5 items assessing suicidality/homicidality, control of aggression/impulsivity, activities of daily living, independence in medication-taking, delusions/hallucinations interfering with functioning, on a 4-point scale (1=strongly agree, 2=agree, 3=disagree, 4=strongly disagree), and 1 item assessing CGI-severity &lt;=4 status using a binary (yes/no) response. Using all 6 items as a guide, the clinician provides a final overall &quot;yes/no&quot; answer to the question 'is the participant ready for discharge'.</description>
