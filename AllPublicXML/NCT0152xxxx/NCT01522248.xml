    <textblock>
      Some people experience symptoms just after receiving the seasonal inactivated influenza
      vaccine. The cause of some of these symptoms is likely to be an immune response to the
      vaccine. The investigators would like to look at the earliest immune responses to the
      inactivated influenza vaccine. This pilot study will help us to determine at what time points
      we should look.

    <description>This is an exploratory trial to look at the kinetics of early (1st 48 hours) cytokine response to influenza vaccine. Serum collected will be assessed for cytokines, and PBMCs may be assessed for innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as for genetic markers associated with immune responses to vaccination.</description>

          2. Good general health as a result of review of medical history and medications.

          3. Willingness to participate in the study as evidenced by signing informed consent
             document.

          4. Available for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known to be pregnant.

          2. Medical, behavioral, cognitive or psychiatric disease that in the opinion of the

             the study protocol.

          3. Severe allergy to eggs or any component of the influenza vaccine

          4. Previous receipt of the 2011-2012 season influenza vaccine

          5. Other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the safety or
             rights of a participant participating in the trial or would render the subject unable
             to comply with the protocol.

          6. History of receiving any investigational product within the past 30 days.

          7. Participant has had medical, occupational, or family problems as a result of alcohol

             syndrome, or autoimmune thrombocytopenia.

         10. Known immunodeficiency syndrome.

         11. Use of chronic (≥14 days) oral or intravenous corticosteroids (excluding topical or
             nasal) at immunosuppressive doses (i.e. prednisone &gt;10 mg/ day) or immunosuppressive
             drugs within 30 days of starting this study.

         12. Receipt of a live vaccine within past 4 weeks or a killed vaccine within past 2 weeks
             prior to entry into the study.

         13. History of a surgical splenectomy.

         14. Receipt of blood products within the past 6 months.

         15. Refusal to allow storage of samples for future research.
