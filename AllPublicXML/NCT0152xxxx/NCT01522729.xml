  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, direct evidences point to the contributing role of peripheral muscle fatigue in
      exercise tolerance among patients with COPD. However, the physiological mechanisms by which
      peripheral muscle fatigue impairs exercise tolerance are still unknown, as factors regulating
      peripheral muscle fatigue in COPD may be complex. One possible link between limb muscle
      fatigue and exercise intolerance could be enhanced afferent signals from the active limb
      muscles to the central command, thereby limiting central motor output and eventually leading
      to exercise termination.

      A direct method to investigate the regulation of peripheral muscle fatigue during exercise in
      patients with COPD is the blockade of peripheral neural afferents via lumbar anesthesia.
      Consequently, investigating the interplay between the peripheral muscular component and the
      central motor command during self-paced exercise could shed light on the regulation of
      peripheral muscle fatigue in COPD and its implication in exercise intolerance.

      The aim of the study is to characterize the role of peripheral muscle afferents on the
      development of muscle fatigue, cardiorespiratory response and exercise tolerance to
      constant-workrate endurance cycling exercise in patients with COPD.

      In a double-blind randomized design, patients with GOLD stage II-III COPD will be recruited
      and will complete a constant-workrate cycling test following either the injection of a
      placebo [NaCl, interspinous L2-L3] or an opioid [Fentanyl 25 µg, intrathecal L2-L3]
      inhibiting central feedback of peripheral muscles sensory afferents. Quadriceps force (TwQ)
      will be measured by magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve and central chemoreceptors
      response will be assessed by CO2 rebreathing, both performed before and after the injection.
      Finally, TwQ will also be measured after the endurance cycling test to assess the magnitude
      of quadriceps fatigue induced by symptom-limited exercise.

    <description>The quadriceps muscle fatigue will be monitored before and after the cycling test to quantify the extent of muscle fatigue produced by the cycling test. This will be done by magnetic stimulation of the femoral nerve and maximal voluntary contraction. Also, non-invasive surface electromyography (EMG) of the quadriceps will help to better characterize muscle fatigue.</description>
