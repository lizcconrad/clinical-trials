      Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the etiology of the weight increase in
      Depot-medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA) users.

      Method:

      Prospective study with 100 women, aged 18-40 years old and BMI &lt; 30kg/m², paired with users
      of a non hormonal method follow for two years. Will be included only women who never used
      DMPA. There will be evaluated habit, blood pressure, anthropometric measure, distribution of
      corporal fat, lipids profile and glycemia parameters every six months. Thirty women and their
      control group will performed a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate the resistance
      of insulin, adiponectin,neuropeptide Y, apolipoprotein A/B and arterial evaluation with
      ultrasound, intimal and media measure. Anova analysis for repeated samples. The metabolic
      alterations should elucidate the etiology, and the beginning of the sub clinical
      cardiovascular disease should be shown/discarded with the arterial evaluation.
