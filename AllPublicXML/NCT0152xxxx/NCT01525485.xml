  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study compares quality of life measures of patients with refractory
      overactive bladder, between two modes of neuromodulation: vaginal electrical stimulation
      (Group A) and sacral nerve stimulation (Group B).

      The specific aims are:

      1. To characterize patient symptom bother score, quality of life, and body image scores in
      patients obtaining sacral nerve stimulation, as compared to vaginal electrical stimulation.

      - Hypothesis 1: Both modes of neuromodulation will impact patients' scores in quality of
      life, patient symptoms, and body image questionnaires.

      All participants will have a standardized intake history which will include age, weight,
      history of prior treatment for incontinence, medication list, obstetric and gynecologic
      history, medical history, and surgical history, as well as a complete review of systems. The
      physical examination will include vital signs (including BMI), genitourinary exam, including
      Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ), and neurologic exam. All patients will undergo
      spontaneous uroflowmetry, urine dipstick from catheterized specimen, multichannel
      urodynamics, and 3-day voiding diary. Measurement of post-void residual will also be
      obtained. Completion of the UDI-69, King's Health Questionnaire10, and the Modified Body
      Image Perception Scale (MBIS) will also be part of the initial visit 11,12.

      All participants taking anticholinergics will undergo a 2 week flush-out period prior to the
      intake assessment. After the intake assessment, the provider will determine which treatment
      option is appropriate to the participant, and they will then be assigned to one of the two
      treatment arms: Group A will use vaginal electrical stimulation using the Empi Intravaginal
      Stimulation Unit Minnova (Empi, St. Paul, MN, USA) and participants in Group B will receive
      sacral neuromodulation using InterStim (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

    <description>Participants will have a dedicated visit with a pelvic floor physical therapist during which instructions on usage and technique for the Minnova unit will be given. The electrical parameters selected will be: 10 Hertz frequency, 5-second on/10=second off cycle, and a pulse width of 0.4 milliseconds. The bipolar square will be delivered over a range that varies from 0 to 100 milliamps, depending on the maximum current intensity comfortably tolerated by the patient. The participant will perform each treatment session for 20 minutes twice daily for 8 weeks. Participants will be asked to keep a log recording the dates, times, and duration of each treatment session.</description>

        The projected sample size is 48 patients. We anticipate the recruitment of 16 patients for
        the InterStim arm of this study and 32 patients who will undergo vaginal electrical
        stimulation. Participants will be drawn from the University of Oklahoma Urogynecology
        clinics. Our catchment area includes OU Physicians clinic (private clinic) and Presbyterian
        Professional Building (resident clinic). Our referral area includes all of Oklahoma as well
        as the surrounding states. Participants will be recruited by physician referrals as well as
        by campus advertisements.
