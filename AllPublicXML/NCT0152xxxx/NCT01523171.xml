      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the efficacy of once daily dose of SAR302503 in subjects previously treated
      with ruxolitinib and with a current diagnosis of intermediate-1 with symptoms, Intermediate-2
      or high-risk primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis (Post-PV MF),
      or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (Post-ET MF) based on the reduction of spleen
      volume at the end of 6 treatment cycles;

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on Myelofibrosis (MF) associated symptoms as
           measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) diary

        -  To evaluate the durability of splenic response

        -  To evaluate the splenic response to SAR302503 by palpation at the end of Cycle 6

        -  To evaluate the splenic response to SAR302503 at the end of Cycle 3

        -  To evaluate the effect of SAR302503 on the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F allele burden

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAR302503 in this population

        -  To evaluate plasma concentrations of SAR302503 for population PK analysis, if warranted

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expected duration of the treatment in this study is approximately 8 months, based on a
      maximum 28-day screening period, followed by a 6-month (6-cycle) treatment period, and an EOT
      visit for subjects who will not continue the treatment after completing the 6 cycles of
      SAR302503, or discontinue the treatment early for any reasons as well as a follow-up visit
      which should occur 30 days after the last administration of SAR302503. Patients who continue
      to benefit clinically will be allowed to remain on study medication beyond the 6-month
      treatment period until the occurrence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
