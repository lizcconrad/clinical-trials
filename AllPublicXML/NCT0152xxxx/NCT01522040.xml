  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized pilot study that seeks to address the research question: In
      children with moderate-to-severe asthma, do intravenous magnesium infusions added to standard
      Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)-level asthma care significantly decrease time from
      patient presentation until PICU discharge?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a double-blind, prospective randomized pilot study. Subjects will be
      randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive routine asthma care with or without a magnesium drip.
