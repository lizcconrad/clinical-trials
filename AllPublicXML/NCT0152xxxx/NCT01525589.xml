      A Clinical Trial of PM01183 in Metastatic Breast Cancer to assess the antitumor activity of
      PM01183 ,to evaluate whether the presence of a known germline mutation in BRCA 1/2 predicts
      response to PM01183 in Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients, to evaluate the safety
      profile of this PM01183 to analyze the pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/PD
      (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) correlations and to evaluate the pharmacogenomic (PGx)
      expression profile in tumor samples.

      A Multicenter Phase II Clinical Trial of PM01183 in BRCA 1/2-Associated or Unselected
      Metastatic Breast Cancer to assess the antitumor activity of PM01183 in terms of overall
      response rate (ORR), duration of response (DR),clinical benefit [ORR or stable disease
      lasting over three months (SD &gt; 3 months)], progression free survival (PFS), and one-year
      overall survival (1y-OS) and to evaluate whether the presence of a known germline mutation in
      BRCA 1/2 predicts response to PM01183 in MBC patients, to explore the activity of PM01183 in
      specific breast cancer subpopulations according to hormonal receptor status, HER-2
      overexpression, number and/or type of prior therapies, or according to other available
      histological/molecular classifications, to evaluate the safety profile of this PM01183
      administration schedule [Day 1 every three weeks (q3wk)] in this patient population, to
      analyze the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PM01183 in this patient population, to explore PK/PD
      (pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic) correlations, if applicable and to evaluate the
      pharmacogenomic (PGx) expression profile of selected putative markers potentially predictive
      of response to PM01183, in tissues from tumor samples.
