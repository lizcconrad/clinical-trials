      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best schedule of vaccine therapy with or
      without sirolimus in treating patients with cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) expressing solid
      tumors. Biological therapies, such as sirolimus, may stimulate the immune system in different
      ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed
      with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells
      that express NY-ESO-1. Infusing the vaccine directly into a lymph node may cause a stronger
      immune response and kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy works
      better when given with or without sirolimus in treating solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety of DC205-NY-ESO-1 vaccine (DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401)
      with and without sirolimus. Toxicity as defined by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the NY-ESO-1 specific cellular and humoral immunity:

        -  Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ and CD4+ T-cells.

        -  Peripheral blood NY-ESO-1 specific antibodies.

        -  Peripheral blood frequency of CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T-cells.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore time to disease progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo standard collection of peripheral white blood cells via leukapheresis over
      90-240 minutes for vaccine preparation. Patients are assigned sequentially to Cohorts 1a-1d.

      COHORT 1a: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 intranodally on days 1,
      29, 57, and 113.

      COHORT 1b: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and
      sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-14, 29-42, and 57-70.

      COHORT 1c: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and
      sirolimus PO or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube on days 15-28, 43-56, and
      71-84.

      COHORT 1d: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in Cohort 1a and
      sirolimus PO or PEG on days 1-84.

      COHORT 2: Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 as in the Cohort (1a-1d)
      that is determined to be safe and produces optimal immunological effects and sirolimus PO on
      days 1-14 as in Cohort 1b dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12
      months.
