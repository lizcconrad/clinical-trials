  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the baseline variability of a panel of tissue
      (tumor and adjacent) and blood-based biomarkers obtained from participants with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary hypothesis is that the upper bound of the 80%
      Confidence Interval of log beta-catenin protein or messenger RNA (mRNA) expression from one
      core needle biopsy (CNB) equivalent is =&lt; 0.65.

          <title>Tumor Volumes From Repeated MRI Measurements of HCC.</title>
          <description>Two volumetric MRI and diffusion weighted (DW) MRI scans were performed without contrast on each participant. The two scans were separated by 10 to 15 minutes, and each scan was read by a separate reader to determine the volume of each tumor. The mean of log tumor volume is presented, based on tumors as observation units.</description>
          <population>Eleven participants underwent MRI and DW MRI scans and only ten of their tumors were deemed measurable by both readers for analysis. Participants in both the Imaging and Imaging/Pathology treatment groups were combined for this analysis, whereas participants in the Pathology only treatment group were not analyzed for this outcome measure.</population>
