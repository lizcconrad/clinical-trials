  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to compare the surgical conditions during laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy at a low intra-abdominal pressure with deep or moderate muscle relaxation.

      The primary hypothesis is that surgical conditions during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are
      better with deep muscle relaxation than moderate muscle relaxation.

      The purpose of this investigation is to compare the surgical conditions with two degrees of
      neuromuscular blockade in patients who have laparoscopic cholecystectomy done with
      pneumoperitoneum 8 mmHg.
