    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2a study is intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and effects on
      intraocular pressure of two dose levels and two dose frequencies of LX7101 when administered
      topically in the eyes of patients diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular
      hypertension.
