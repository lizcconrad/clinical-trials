      A proper digital nerve (PDN) defect in the thumb can produce partial or complete sensory loss
      which can result in functional disability. This article reports the treatment of the thumb
      PDN defect using a pedicled nerve graft harvested from the dorsal branch of the PDN. Fourteen
      patients with the thumb PDN defect underwent a new surgical procedure in which the pedicled
      nerve graft was used to bridge nerve defect. For comparison, the investigators also collected
      a consecutive series of 21 patients with thumb PDN defects treated using a nonvascularized
      sural nerve graft. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of pedicled nerve
      grafting for PDN defects in the thumb.

      At final follow-up, the investigators measured the sensibility of the thumb pulps and the
      donor sites using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and static 2-point discrimination
      (2PD) test. The test points were at the centers of the radial and ulnar portions of the thumb
      pulp and the donor sites separately. Each area was tested 3 times with a Dellon-Mackinnon
      discriminator. Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before
      proceeding to another lower value.
