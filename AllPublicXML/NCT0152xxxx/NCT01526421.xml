  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the current standard of care for treatment of
      HIV infection, is highly effective when taken appropriately. Before starting this treatment,
      a person must be aware of their HIV status and present to a clinic for medical care. They
      then undergo screening procedures (medical assessment and laboratory tests) to determine
      whether they are eligible to receive HAART, i.e. whether HIV treatment is necessary and safe
      for them.

      In many urban centres including Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, there is a high rate of HIV
      infection among users of illicit drugs. However, HIV-infected drug users often do not present
      to the medical system and complete the process necessary to start HAART. Given the known
      benefits of HAART, new strategies are required to increase rates of HAART initiation in this
      group. Contingency management (CM) is a strategy to affect behaviour by providing a reward
      (e.g. money) to reinforce the desired behaviour. CM has been used with success in other areas
      of medicine (e.g. smoking cessation, weight loss) and in the drug using population, but has
      not been established as a means to improve HAART uptake.

      The proposed research primarily seeks to assess the effectiveness of monetary-based CM in
      engaging HIV-infected drug users in HAART programs. Drug users identified through outreach
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two arms; participants in one arm will be offered
      a monetary-based reinforcer to participate (n=150) and participants in the second arm will be
      offered no reinforcer (n=150). Participation involves reporting to the study site for formal
      study of eligibility screening, consisting of clinical evaluation, medical history and
      laboratory testing required to determine eligibility to receive HAART. Participants
      randomized to the reinforcer arm will receive gift cards at the completion of screening
      procedures.

      Our hypothesis is that drug users offered a monetary-based reinforcer will be significantly
      more likely to complete HAART eligibility screening than those not offered a reinforcer.

      HAART eligibility screening entails presenting to the study site within 2 weeks of
      pre-screening, undergoing laboratory testing and providing a medical history, and returning
      for results within the subsequent four weeks. Any potential subjects who appear to be acutely
      intoxicated will be asked to return the next day or at a later date or time of their
      choosing. All participants will be asked to return for their results within four weeks after
      screening. Subjects will have 70 mL of whole blood collected by venipuncture by a trained
      study nurse. Laboratory tests will include HIV confirmatory testing (antibody and Western
      blot), CD4 cell count and plasma HIV-1-RNA level (plasma viral load; pVL), Hepatitis A, B and
      C serology, pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential, complete blood count (CBC)
      with differential and platelet count, chemistry profile (creatinine, urea and electrolytes),
      and transaminase levels (ALT, AST). All participants will also have a medical history taken
      and undergo a physical examination. Recorded data will include subject gender, age,
      ethnicity, race, area of residence and living arrangement (categorized as homeless/on the
      street, unstable [defined as living primarily in a single room occupancy hotel, boarding
      room, or transition house] or stable). Additional features which will be recorded will
      include nature and frequency of illicit substance use, and participation in other cohort
      studies or methadone maintenance programs. All clinical past medical history and
      co-morbidities and laboratory data will be recorded for assessment of subject HAART
      eligibility.

      All subjects who return for the results, whether HAART-eligible or not, will have their
      laboratory results explained to them and will be counseled as to a recommended course of
      clinical care by the study nurse. Those eligible for HAART will be offered enrollment into
      Part II of the study. Those not eligible for HAART will be invited to re-evaluate their
      eligibility for antiretroviral therapy at yearly intervals through the study site. Once 150
      subjects have been randomized to each of the two study arms (total n=300), recruitment will
      be temporarily halted and statistical analysis will determine whether the reinforcer resulted
      in a significant and clinically relevant increase in the proportion of subjects who complete
      HAART eligibility screening.
