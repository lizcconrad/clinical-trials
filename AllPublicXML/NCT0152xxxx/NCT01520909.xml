    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      eltrombopag in children with previously treated chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are
      between 1 and 17 years of age. This is a 2 part study. In part 1, patients will be randomized
      to receive either eltrombopag or placebo for 13 weeks. All patients who complete part 1 will
      enter part 2. In part 2, all patients will receive 24 weeks of eltrombopag.

    <measure>Weighted Mean Platelet Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12 of Part 1</time_frame>
    <description>The weighted mean platelet count is defined as &quot;the area under the platelet-time curve divided by the duration of the study (12 weeks)&quot;. Weighted mean platelet counts from baseline to week 12 of the randomized period was compared between placebo and eltrombopag using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline platelet count and age cohort. For each subject the area between two adjacent visits with platelet counts was calculated. The area was calculated for all pairs of adjacent visits starting at Day 1 of randomized period and then the total sum of all the areas was divided by the total duration of time during the randomized period. For each subject, this method calculates an 'average' platelet count and it allows the possibility that subjects may have had different number of assessments during different times relative to baseline.</description>

    <description>Single PK samples were collected at each visit during Part 1 Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and at each weekly or monthly visit during Part 2 Weeks 1-12 (Study Weeks 13-37). The concentration data were pooled across visits to identify population PK and variability parameter estimates and covariate effects. Vc/F is defined as the volume of the central (e.g. plasma) compartment and Vp/F is defined as the volume of the peripheral compartment. These parameters are dose independent. From the final model, a single value of each PK parameter was estimated for each subject, and geometric mean (95% CI) values are presented for each cohort.</description>

          -  Previous treatment for ITP with splenectomy, rituximab and cyclophosphamide must have
             been completed at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1.

          -  Patients treated with concomitant ITP medication (e.g. corticosteroids or
             azathioprine) must be receiving a dose that has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior
             to Day 1.

          -  Patients must have a complete blood count (CBC) not suggestive of another
             hematological disorder.

          -  Patients must have the following laboratory results:

          -  prothrombin time international normalized ratio (INR) and activated partial
             thromboplastin time (aPTT) within 80 to 120% of the normal range.

          -  clinical chemistries that do NOT exceed the upper limit of normal reference range by

        <title>Weighted Mean Platelet Count</title>
        <description>The weighted mean platelet count is defined as &quot;the area under the platelet-time curve divided by the duration of the study (12 weeks)&quot;. Weighted mean platelet counts from baseline to week 12 of the randomized period was compared between placebo and eltrombopag using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline platelet count and age cohort. For each subject the area between two adjacent visits with platelet counts was calculated. The area was calculated for all pairs of adjacent visits starting at Day 1 of randomized period and then the total sum of all the areas was divided by the total duration of time during the randomized period. For each subject, this method calculates an ‘average’ platelet count and it allows the possibility that subjects may have had different number of assessments during different times relative to baseline.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Any Bleeding and Significant Bleeding as Assessed Using the WHO Bleeding Scale During Part 2</title>
          <description>The WHO Bleeding Scale is a measure of bleeding severity with the following grades: Grade 0 = no bleeding, Grade 1 = petechiae, Grade 2 = mild blood loss, Grade 3 = gross bleeding and Grade 4 = debilitating blood loss. The WHO Grades were dichotomized into the following categories: no bleeding = Grade 0; any bleeding = Grade 1 to 4; no clinically significant bleeding = Grade 0 to 1; clinically significant bleeding = Grade 2 to 4.</description>
          <population>ITT Population. Only those participants who entered into Part 2 open-label Eltrombopag only phase were analyzed. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</population>

          <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During Part 2</title>
          <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death, is life threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in other situations.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Maximum Toxicity Grade for the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters at Any Time Post-Baseline During Part 1</title>
        <description>Clinical chemistry parameters were summarized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0: Grade 0 (G0), none; Grade 1 (G1), mild; Grade 2 (G2), moderate; Grade 3 (G3), severe; Grade 4 (G4), life-threatening or disabling. Clinical chemistry parameters included: aspartate amino transferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, albumin, alanine amino transferase (ALT), prothrombin international normalized ratio (PT INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and creatinine. The Baseline value is defined as the value taken at Day 1 or, if missing, the latest non-missing Screening value. For serum creatinine, due to the variations in creatinine, the average of the Screening and the Day 1 values will be used as Baseline. The maximum post-Baseline toxicity grade includes any scheduled or unscheduled post-Baseline assessment during Part 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Maximum Toxicity Grade for the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters at Any Time Post-Baseline During Part 2</title>
        <description>Clinical chemistry parameters were summarized according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0: G0, none; G1, mild; G2, moderate; G3, severe; G4, life-threatening or disabling. Clinical chemistry parameters included: AST, ALP, total bilirubin, albumin, ALT, and creatinine. For participants randomized to Placebo in Part 1, the BL value for Part 2 is defined as the value taken at Week 13 of Part 1. For serum creatinine, the value taken at Week 13 of Part 1 will be used as BL. For participants randomized to Eltrombopag in Part 1, the BL value is defined as the value taken on Day 1 or, if missing, the latest non-missing Screening value. For serum creatinine, due to the variations in creatinine, the average of the Screening and the Day 1 values will be used as BL. For participants who do not have both a Screening and Day 1 value, the Screening or Day 1 value will be used as BL. The maximum post-BL toxicity grade includes any scheduled or unscheduled post-BL assessment.</description>

            <description>Participants who received eltrombopag in Part 1 continued on the same dose in Part 2 unless adjustments were warranted according to the dosing guidelines. Participants who received placebo in Part 1 received Eltrombopag as per age criteria as follows: aged between 6 and 17 years with a body weight &lt;27 kg received eltrombopag 37.5 mg QD, and those with a body weight &gt;=27 kg received eltrombopag 50 mg QD. Participants of East Asian ancestry received a starting dose of eltrombopag 25 mg QD. Participants aged between 1 and 5 years received eltrombopag 1.2 mg/kg QD and; participants of East Asian ancestry received a starting dose of eltrombopag 0.8 mg/kg/day.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters were summarized according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0: G0, none; G1, mild; G2, moderate; G3, severe; G4, life-threatening or disabling. Hematology parameters included: leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin (increased), hemoglobin (anemia), lymphocytes (increased), and lymphocytes (decreased). The Baseline value is defined as the value taken at Day 1 or, if missing, the latest non-missing Screening value. The maximum post-Baseline toxicity grade includes any scheduled or unscheduled post-Baseline assessment during Part 1.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Maximum Toxicity Grade for the Indicated Hematology Parameters at Any Time Post-Baseline During Part 2</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters were summarized according to the NCI CTCAE, version 4.0: G0, none, G1, mild; G2, moderate; G3, severe; G4, life-threatening or disabling. Hematology parameters included: leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin (increased), hemoglobin (anemia), lymphocytes (increased), and lymphocytes (decreased). For participants randomized to Placebo in Part 1, the BL value for Part 2 is defined as the value taken at Week 13 of Part 1. For participants randomized to Eltrombopag in Part 1, the BL value is defined as the value taken on Day 1 or, if missing, the latest non-missing Screening value. For participants who do not have both a Screening and Day 1 value, the Screening or Day 1 value will be used as BL. The maximum post-BL toxicity grade includes any scheduled or unscheduled post-BL assessment.</description>

Participants who received placebo in Part 1 received Eltrombopag as per age criteria as follows: aged between 6 and 17 years with a body weight &lt;27 kg received eltrombopag 37.5 mg QD, and those with a body weight &gt;=27 kg received eltrombopag 50 mg QD. Participants of East Asian ancestry received a starting dose of eltrombopag 25 mg QD. Participants aged between 1 and 5 years received eltrombopag 1.2 mg/kg QD and; participants of East Asian ancestry received a starting dose of eltrombopag 0.8 mg/kg/day.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Vital Sign Data Falling Outside the Reference Ranges (RR) at the Indicated Visit During Part 1</title>
        <description>Vital sign measurements were taken before any blood draws and included systolic blood pressure(SBP), diastolic blood pressure(DBP), and heart rate(HR). The number of participants are reported with vital sign data falling outside the standard reference ranges RR as reference range high(RRH) and reference range low(RRL). The Baseline(BL) value is defined as the value taken at Day 1 or if missing, the latest non-missing SCR value. RR for Blood Pressure (mmHg) are read as: Lower Limit of Normal, Normal Range, Upper Limit of Normal. For Ages 1 to 5 years (yrs) ranges are SBP &lt;85, 85 to 115, &gt;115; DBP &lt;45, 45 to70, &gt;70. Ages 6 to 11 yrs: SBP &lt;85, 85 to 120, &gt;120;, DBP &lt;50, 50 to 75, &gt;75. Ages 12 to 17 yrs: SBP &lt;95, 95 to 135, &gt;135; DBP &lt;55, 55 to 85, &gt;85. RR for HR(bpm) are ages 1 to &lt; 3 yrs: &lt;90, 90 to 140, &gt;140; ages 3 to &lt; 5 yrs: &lt;75, 75 to 130, &gt;130, ages 5 to &lt; 8yrs: &lt;65, 65 to 115, &gt;115; ages 8 to &lt; 12yrs: &lt;55, 55 to 110, &gt;110; and ages 12 to 18 yrs: &lt;55, 55 to 110, &gt;110.</description>

        <description>Vital sign measurements were taken before any blood draw and included systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate(HR). The number of participants are reported with vital sign data falling outside the standard RR as reference range high(RRH) and reference range low(RRL) from SCR up to Week 24 of Part 2 and from Follow-up Week 1 to Week 4. RR for Blood Pressure(mmHg) are read as: Lower Limit of Normal, Normal Range, Upper Limit of Normal. For Ages 1 to 5 years (yrs) ranges are SBP &lt;85, 85 to 115, &gt;115; DBP &lt;45, 45 to70, &gt;70. Ages 6 to 11 yrs: SBP &lt;85, 85 to 120, &gt;120; DBP &lt;50, 50 to 75, &gt;75. Ages 12 to 17 yrs: SBP &lt;95, 95 to 135, &gt;135; DBP &lt;55, 55 to 85, &gt;85. RR for HR (bpm) are ages 1 to &lt; 3 yrs: &lt;90, 90 to 140, &gt;140; ages 3 to &lt; 5 yrs: &lt;75, 75 to 130, &gt;130, ages 5 to &lt; 8yrs: &lt;65, 65 to 115, &gt;115; ages 8 to &lt; 12yrs: &lt;55, 55 to 110, &gt;110; and ages 12 to 18 yrs: &lt;55, 55 to 110, &gt;110.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments for Eltrombopag for AUC (0-t)</title>
        <description>Single PK samples were collected at each visit during Part 1 Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and at each weekly or monthly visit during Part 2 Weeks 1-12 (Study Weeks 13-37). The concentration data were pooled across visits to identify population PK and variability parameter estimates and covariate effects. AUC(0-t) is defined as the area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval. The AUC(0-t) for a 50mg dose was estimated for each cohort. From the final model, a single value of each PK parameter was estimated for each subject, and geometric mean (95% CI) values are presented for each cohort for a 50mg dose.</description>

        <title>Population PK Model Point Estimate for Eltrombopag for Absorption Rate-constant (Ka)</title>
        <description>Single PK samples were collected at each visit during Part 1 Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and at each weekly or monthly visit during Part 2 Weeks 1-12 (Study Weeks 13-37). The concentration data were pooled across visits to identify population PK and variability parameter estimates and covariate effects. Ka is defined as the absorption rate constant. This parameter is dose independent, and the population estimate Ka is reported.</description>
