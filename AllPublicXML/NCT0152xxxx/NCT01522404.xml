  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if atomoxetine causes a change in the biologic
      markers (substances that may indicate the presence of a disease) in the cerebrospinal fluid
      (CSF) of participants diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In this research study,
      the spinal fluid of subjects with MCI who take atomoxetine will be compared to spinal fluid
      of those who take capsules containing inactive material, also known as placebo. At the
      six-month timepoint, subjects who were taking placebo during the first six months will be
      placed on active study medication, and those who received active study medication will be
      reassigned to placebo. After completion of the study, subjects will be able to receive
      open-label atomoxetine.

      This study will also evaluate if the drug is safe and well-tolerated. Additionally,
      information will be gathered to identify the dose of atomoxetine that is most beneficial, and
      how taking this medication affects thinking and behavior, as well as imaging and blood
      biomarkers. The results of this research will help determine if atomoxetine alters signs of
      inflammation and other biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease.
