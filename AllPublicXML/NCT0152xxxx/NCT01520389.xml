    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 and pharmacologic open-labeled dose-escalation trial using a &quot;3+3&quot;
      design, evaluating MM-151 at varying dose levels and frequencies, and subsequently in
      combination with irinotecan.

      This study is a Phase 1 and pharmacologic open-labeled dose-escalation trial using a &quot;3+3&quot;
      design exploring weekly, bi-weekly, and tri-weekly dosing schedules. Successive MM-151
      monotherapy cohorts of three or more patients will be treated at escalating doses until a
      maximum tolerated dose is identified, and subsequently in combination with irinotecan. The
      study consists of three parts as follows: MM-151 monotherapy dose escalation (Part 1); MM-151
      monotherapy expansion cohort in cetuximab-refractory colorectal cancer (Part 2); MM-151 +
      irinotecan dose escalation (Part 3). It is expected that approximately 4 study sites will
      participate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced malignant solid
             tumor that has recurred or progressed following standard therapy, or that has not
             responded to standard therapy, or for which there is no standard therapy, or who are
             not candidates for standard therapy

          -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age

             the study and for 90 days following the last dose of MM-151 (an effective form of
             contraception is an oral contraceptive or a double barrier method)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients for whom potentially curative antineoplastic therapy is available

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Patients with an active infection or with an unexplained fever &gt; 38.5Â°C during
             screening visits or on the first scheduled day of dosing. (At the discretion of the
             investigator, patients with tumor fever may be enrolled.)

          -  Patients with untreated and/or symptomatic CNS malignancies (primary or metastatic);
             patients with CNS metastases who have undergone surgery or radiotherapy, whose disease
             is stable, and who have been on a stable dose of corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks
             prior to the first scheduled day of dosing will be eligible for the trial
