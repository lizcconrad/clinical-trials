    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) during surgery for colorectal liver
      metastases (CLM) has become a part of clinical practice. However, if it should be selectively
      or routinely applied remains unclear. This study is carried out to clarify which are the
      criteria for a selective use of CE-IOUS if any.

    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound (CE-IOUS) during surgery for colorectal liver
      metastases (CLM) is entered in clinical practice. However, its impact seems to decrease with
      the improvement of preoperative imaging. Therefore, if CE-IOUS should be selectively or
      routinely applied remains unclear: a profile of patients who may benefit of CE-IOUS
      application has to be disclosed. The aim of this study is to define reliable criteria for a
      selective use of CE-IOUS during surgery for CLM. IOUS is performed using 3-6 MHz convex
      probe, and a 7.5-10 MHz micro convex probe. Staging is completed by CE-IOUS using the
      standard 3-6 MHz convex probe and the dedicated 1.88-3.76 MHz harmonic frequency probe. In
      all patients, 2.4 mL of sulphur-hexafluoride microbubbles (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan, Italy)
      are injected through a peripheral vein by the anesthesiologist. Ultrasound guidance is used
      to drive the dissection plane as previously described. Reference standards are histology and
      imaging at 6 months after surgery. Univariate and multivariate analyses are performed.
      Statistical significance is set at P=0.05.

    <description>One hundred and twenty-seven consecutive patients —77 males and 50 females, mean age of patients was 61 years (median 65 years; range 29-85 years)— underwent liver resection using intraoperative ultrasound and contrast-enhanced intraoperative ultrasound.</description>

    <description>After entering the abdominal cavity, liver mobilization is achieved by dissecting the round and falciform ligaments. IOUS is carried out with a standard 3-6 MHz convex probe, and a 7.5-10 MHz micro convex probe. Staging was completed by CE-IOUS using the standard 3-6 MHz convex probe and the dedicated 1.88-3.76 MHz harmonic frequency probe. In all patients, 2.4 mL of sulphur-hexafluoride microbubbles (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan, Italy) are injected through a peripheral vein by the anesthesiologist.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  consecutively enrolled patients with CLM who underwent surgery and during this
             procedure received IOUS and CE-IOUS.

          -  each patient had at least 6 months of postoperative follow-up.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients who after IOUS and CE-IOUS had explorative laparotomy only were excluded from
             the analysis since there was no histological confirmation of the tumor and most of
             them were lost to surgical follow-up
