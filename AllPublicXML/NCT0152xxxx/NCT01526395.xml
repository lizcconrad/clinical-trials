  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In developing countries, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is typically delivered without the
      use of an anesthetic prior to the treatment, known as unmodified ECT. This interventional
      study aims to decrease the practice of unmodified ECT at Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical
      University, U.P. &amp; G.M. &amp; Associated Hospitals (C.S.M) by administering a low dose anesthetic
      (propofol) prior to ECT delivery. In so doing, the investigators hope to facilitate the
      transition from unmodified to modified ECT without incurring excessive costs to the center.
      It is hypothesized that ECT patients will opt for modified treatment, that adverse effects
      will be minimal, and that costs will not rise prohibitively.

      Patients that are currently receiving unmodified ECT at C.S.M Hospital will be eligible for
      the first phase of the study in which only data is collected. Three months after study start,
      patients who are to receive ECT for a psychiatric disorder will be eligible to participate in
      the intervention (introduction of propofol at a low dose prior to ECT). Data collection will
      include information such as demographics, ratings scales, seizure length, anxiety level,
      adverse events, and number of treatments.

    <description>The major intervention proposed in this study is the introduction of low dose IV propofol for sedation prior to ECT treatment at C.S.M Medical University. The investigators will use a dose of 0.25 to 0.50 mg/kg of IV propofol. The maximum dose of 0.50 mg/kg is not sufficient for anesthesia (i.e., to make unconscious), but should provide a light level of sedation and be &quot;amnestic,&quot; meaning the patient should have memory loss for the period of time around the ECT procedure itself. The propofol dose will be titrated upwards (from an initial dose of 0.25 mg/kg) with successive treatments in increments of 0.05mg/kg, until it is just sufficient to be lightly sedating. ECT will be administered 30 to 60 seconds after propofol is injected. ECT may be given up to three times per week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects are any psychiatric patients at C.S.M. for whom ECT is recommended by their
             doctor, whether or not they actually receive ECT.

          -  Subjects must also have an American Society for Anesthesiologists (ASA) rating score
             of 1 (completely healthy) or 2 (mild systemic disease) with stable symptoms and
             laboratory values.

          -  Subjects must be between the ages of 18 to 65 years old and be able to give informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who speak neither English nor Hindi.

          -  History of or anatomical evidence for a difficult airway being a short mandible,
             micrognathia, large tongue or large goiter, arthritis of the jaw or neck, or enlarged

             which might compromise the airway. Patients who smoke 15 or more cigarettes per day
             will be excluded unless abstinent for at least 10 days, to reduce the risk of
             respiratory complications.

          -  Patients who receive modified ECT during the first phase of the study.

          -  Pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding.

          -  Hypersensitivity to propofol or any of its components.

          -  Patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have impaired cardiac function.

          -  BMI &lt; 18.
