      The purpose of this study is to use comprehensive exercise testing to examine causes of
      exercise limitation in children and young adults with sickle cell anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the burden of sickle cell anemia (SCA) on affected individuals is significant, few
      studies have examined the influence of having SCA on such measures of physical function as
      exercise capacity. Moreover, the physiologic basis of poor physical functioning in children
      with SCA is unknown and has not been studied extensively. The purpose of this proposal is to
      use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to gain a comprehensive understanding of exercise
      capacity, as a measure of physical function, in children and young adults with SCA. The
      specific aims of this project are to: 1) Measure peak oxygen consumption (VO2), the reference
      standard for exercise capacity, in children and young adults with SCA classified by primary
      pathophysiologic contributor to their decreased exercise capacity, and 2) Examine the acute
      inflammatory response, measured by an increase in soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule
      (sVCAM) activity, in subjects undergoing CPET. These aims will be performed in 60 subjects
      with SCA and 30 matched controls without SCA. In a secondary analysis, we will also study the
      impact of baseline exercise capacity and the inflammatory response to exercise on short and
      long-term disease related morbidity. This study is essential because it will address several
      areas of exercise capacity, including the physiologic contributors to exercise limitation
      that remain fundamental knowledge gaps in SCA.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. age 10 to 21 years old; AND

          2. Hb SS or S-Î²0 thalassemia disease, confirmed by hemoglobin analysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. inability to perform maximal testing due to physical limitation (e.g. stroke or
             avascular necrosis); OR

          2. history of exercise-induced syncope or arrhythmias. Subjects will wait at least 2
             weeks following any vaso-occlusive pain episode and 12 weeks following any
             disease-related complication requiring transfusion support. Individuals on hydroxyurea
             will be eligible. A total of 30 controls without SCA or sickle cell trait will be
             matched for age, sex and race and recruited from the siblings, friends or relatives of
             subjects enrolled on this study
