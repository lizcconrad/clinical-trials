    <time_frame>1-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells following ex vivo depletion in arm 3 will be analyzed by flow cytometry and compared to a pre-CD25-depletion sample. The depletion of CD25+ cells among the entire CD4+ population is expected to reach 80% efficiency.</description>

    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Timing and duration of regulatory T cell depletion and recovery following in vivo or ex vivo (arms 2 and 3) CD25+ T cell depletion will be performed at pre-defined timepoints prior to and following autologous stem cell transplant by flow cytometry on peripheral blood samples and directly compared to the percentages of regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127-) present at the same timepoints in patients enrolled onto arm 1 in which no regulatory T cell depletion is performed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of autologous graft-versus-host disease following in vivo or ex vivo regulatory T cell depletion</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>The indicence of autologous graft-versus-host disease, as assessed by the development of skin rash, diarrhea and/or liver function test abnormalities consistent with autologous graft-versus-host disease following CD25+ T cell depletion and autologous stem cell transplant compared with the incidence of autologous graft-versus-host disease in patients enrolled onto arm 1 in which no regulatory T cell depletion is performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Kinetics of recovery of peripheral blood cellular elements</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to recovery of neutrophils and platelets will be analyzed by daily complete blood counts following autologous stem cell transplant. Patients enrolled onto arms 2 and 3 (in vivo and ex vivo regulatory T cell depletion, respectively) will be directly compared to patients enrolled onto arm 1 in which no regulatory T cell depletion is performed.</description>
