      The purpose of this study is to confirm the clinical and economic benefits of IRay treatment
      with respect to the number of anti-VEGF injections and frequency of visits during the first
      year after treatment for patients with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

      The objective of this study is to confirm the clinical and economic benefits of low voltage
      external beam radiotherapy with the IRay with respect to number of anti-VEGF injections and
      frequency of ophthalmic assessments during the one year interval following treatment in
      subjects with neovascular AMD.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have neovascular AMD and have received an anti-VEGF injections within 1 month
             prior to entering the study, and have the need for further treatment with anti-VEGF
             therapy.

          -  Must have a total lesion size of &lt;12 disc areas and a CNV lesion with the greatest
             linear dimension of &lt;6 mm, but not greater than 3 mm from the center of the fovea to
             the furthest point on lesion perimeter.

          -  Must have provided informed consent, documented it in writing, and have been given a
             copy of the signed informed consent form.

          -  Must be willing and able to return for scheduled treatment and follow-up examinations
             for the 3-year duration of the study.

          -  Must be at least 50 years of age.

          -  Women must be post-menopausal ≥1 year or surgically sterilized.

          -  Must have best corrected visual acuity of greater than or equal to 24 letters in the
             study eye and at least 20 letters in the fellow eye (if both eyes meet all the study
             criteria, then the eye with the worst vision should be selected as the study eye).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Present with any implanted device, where the device labeling specifically
             contraindicates subjects undergoing x-rays.

          -  An axial length of &lt;20 mm (because of limitations of the IRay device) or &gt;26 mm (to
             exclude subjects with pathologic myopia).

          -  Evidence of diabetes or retinal findings consistent with diabetic retinopathy, or
             retinopathy for any cause.

          -  Prior or concurrent therapies in the study eye for age related macular degeneration
             (other than intravitreal anti-VEGF), including submacular surgery, subfoveal thermal
             laser photocoagulation (with or without photographic evidence), transpupillary
             thermotherapy (TTT) and ocular photodynamic therapy.
