    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOX A12 alone and in
      combination with a background therapy of bortezomib and dexamethasone (VD) chemotherapy in
      previously treated patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant plasma cells express high levels of CXCR4 chemokine receptors, which cause cell
      migration and adhesion to stromal cells secreting the CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12 (SDF-1). NOX A12
      is a specific CXCL12 antagonist and may improve chemotherapy by disrupting CXCR4-CXCL12
      interactions, thereby mobilizing plasma cells from protective tissue microenvironments to the
      blood. Furthermore, SDF-1 inhibition may alter the activation status of plasma cells, thereby
      triggering apoptosis or sensitization of plasma cells towards chemotherapy.

    <description>Pilot Group (NOX A12 single agent, and combined with VD):
3 cohorts of 3 patients will receive treatment with NOX A12 alone at a single dose of 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg i.v. 2 weeks before the combination treatment of NOX A12 and VD will start. The combination of NOX A12 and VD will follow a dose titration design beginning at 1 mg/kg NOX A12 (cycle 1) proceeding to dose levels of 2 mg/kg (cycle 2) and 4 mg/kg (cycle 3) NOX A12 in combination with VD. This is followed by consolidation in cycles 4-8 when NOX-A12 will be kept at the highest individually titrated dose.
Expansion Group (NOX A12 in combination with VD):
Expansion patients will not receive single agent NOX-A12, but will receive combination treatment as for the pilot group.</description>
