  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. Chronic
      hyperglycemia and disturbed lipid regulation commonly seen in diabetes are the main causes of
      this process. Despite the critical role of oxidative stress in diabetes, most clinical trials
      with available antioxidants and vitamins have either failed to show any long term benefits or
      have produced inconsistent results (10-11). There has been growing interest in establishing
      the possible roles of oral hypoglycemic agents including Metformin in reduction of oxidative
      stress. Metformin, the most common prescribed oral medication in type 2 diabetes, lowers
      HbA1c around 1.5%, rarely causes hypoglycemia (compared with insulin or sulfonylureas), has
      relatively few contraindications, its adverse effects are generally tolerable, does not cause
      weight gain, is cheap, and is highly acceptable among patients. Given the long term benefits
      observed with metformin use, a role in modulating oxidative stress is imputable. We designed
      this study to evaluate the actions of metformin on oxidative stress in a group of
      medication-na√Øve newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients.

    <description>Serum concentrations of markers of oxidative stress (i.e. advanced glycation end products, advanced oxidation protein products, ferritin reducing ability of plasma) along with activities of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. paraoxonase1, lecithin cholesterol asyltransferase) are measured. To assess the change in inflammatory condition associated with fat tissue dysfunction (a close entity to oxidative stress) serum concentrations of fat tissue hormones (i.e. leptin, vaspin, adiponectin, visfatin)are also assessed.</description>
