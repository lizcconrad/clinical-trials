    <description>Calculated based on parasite count in blood. In thin film, use actual WBCs/µl, of blood to calculate parasite density by using the following formula: parasites/µl= #parasites× actual WBC/#WBCs counted. In thick film, assume that there are 250 RBCs per HPF, RBC count from 8 HPF equal 2000 RBC, Use actual RBCs/µl blood to calculate parasite density by using the following formula: parasites/µl= # of parasites in 8HPF/2000)× actual RBC.</description>
