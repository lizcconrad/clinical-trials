          -  Evidence of significant organ system dysfunction (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular
             disease, cirrhosis, hypogonadism, hypo- or hyperthyroidism; hypertension)

             in the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  Has received HPP593 in a previous clinical trial.

          -  Smoking within 6 month prior to Day -1.
