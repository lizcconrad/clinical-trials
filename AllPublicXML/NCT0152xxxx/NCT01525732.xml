  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spastic esophageal motility disorders induced significant symptoms including dysphagia,
      retrosternal pain and regurgitation. Per oral endoscopic myotomy (P.O.E.M.) is a novel
      approach to perform myotomy through the esophagus with long submucosal tunnel. This study
      aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of P.O.E.M. and translate the techniques from
      animal study to clinical practice in human.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with age ranged 18 to 80 who had primary esophageal motility disorders
             will be recruited. The primary motility disorders included: Achalasia, hypertensive
             LES, Nutcracker esophagus and Diffuse esophageal spasm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from this study with the followings -

               1. Pregnancy

               2. Informed consent not available

               3. Previous history of esophagectomy or mediastinal surgery

               4. Previous history of endoscopic resection for early esophageal cancers, including
                  endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection

               5. End-stage Achalasia with dilated esophagus more than 6cm on Barium swallow
