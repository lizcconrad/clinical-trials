  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become an important target for cancer
      therapy, and the small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have played an
      important role in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). What accompanies with
      the encouraging efficacy in NSCLC is the common side effects, of which the most common one is
      the specific papular and pustular acne-like rash which affects mainly the face, scalp, and
      upper torso. But till now, no medicament has been proved effective enough to treat or prevent
      the EGFR-TKIs associated rash. The EVOZAC® Calming Skin Spray has shown acceptable activity
      at the rash prevention in our preliminary study, so the investigators conduct the randomized,
      double-blind, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EVOZAC® Calming Skin
      Spray in prevention of EGFR-TKIs associated rash in NSCLC.
