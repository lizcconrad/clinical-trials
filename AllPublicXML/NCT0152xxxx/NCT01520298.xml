  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled trial
      evaluating the benefit of IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev™) as adjuvant analgesia in geriatric hip
      fracture patients. IV acetaminophen has received FDA approval. IV acetaminophen does not have
      the liver toxicity as oral acetaminophen. No oral acetaminophen will be administered. All
      patients diagnosed with a hip fracture aged at least 65 years and expected to undergo
      surgical intervention are eligible to participate. Hip fractures affect greater than 300,000
      geriatric patients annually, representing the second leading cause of hospitalization for
      this patient population. Pain control in these patients is often problematic due to
      co-morbidities and changes in their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Subjects
      may receive the normal DVT prophylactic treatments post-op.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 46 subjects will be enrolled at LGH. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive
      either IV acetaminophen 1000 mg q6 hours (FDA recommended dose) or IV placebo. While
      receiving the study drug/placebo the subject's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate,
      &amp; pain intensity will be monitored. Additional pain meds will be given if needed. Study
      treatment will continue until subject is taken into the operating room; at that time the
      intervention will be discontinued and other pain medication will be provided. Participation
      in the study will end at time of discharge from the hospital. Researchers are expecting a 33%
      decrease in opioid use for subjects randomized to treatment group.
