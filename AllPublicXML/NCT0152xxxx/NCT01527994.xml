  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current treatments for opioid addiction would benefit by the addition of a non-opioid based
      treatment medication. Recent behavioral studies have shown that the neurokinin-1 (NK1)
      receptor is involved in opioid reward and withdrawal. This study proposes to study a
      potential non-opioid treatment, the clinically available, FDA approved, NK1 antagonist
      aprepitant, in opioid addicted patients. Based on the unique behavioral and pharmacological
      characteristics of opioid addiction, and what is known of the currently employed treatments,
      the investigators propose that the therapeutic mechanism of any potential opioid addiction
      treatment medication must include the ability to reduce opioid withdrawal. This is of
      particular importance during treatment initiation (eg. detoxification). In addition, for
      long-term treatment and relapse prevention, it is important to manage drug craving and
      inhibit the rewarding effects of opioids if patients do experience a slip. Therefore, the
      investigators propose to study aprepitant using human models of opioid withdrawal, craving
      and acute opioid reward and reinforcement. The investigators will also include a
      neuro-economics choice procedure paradigm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects ranging in age from 18-55 years who are currently opioid
             dependent based on meeting DSM-IV criteria for dependence on heroin and who are either
             treatment or non-treatment seeking individuals.

          2. Use of intravenous heroin daily for a minimum of 45 days prior to study entry.
