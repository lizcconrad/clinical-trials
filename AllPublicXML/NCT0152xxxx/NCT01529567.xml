  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are recruited by self-referral.
      They are randomized to two 10 weeks of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral programs. Both
      programs include mindfulness training, education about how excessive avoidant and control
      behaviors maintain IBS symptoms, and changing of these behaviors to live a richer life. One
      of the programs also includes instructions on how to perform systematic exposure. The
      hypothesis of the study is while both groups will show improvement in terms of IBS symptom
      severity and quality of life, the addition of systematic exposure will lead to more
      improvement in symptoms.
