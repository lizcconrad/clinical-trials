  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, open-label, single-arm trial of the safety of a single
      FT1050-treated CB unit for hematopoietic reconstitution after a reduced-intensity
      conditioning regimen for hematologic malignancies. A maximum of 40 eligible adult subjects
      will be enrolled and treated in the trial at approximately 2-4 centers within the U.S.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in three sequential cohorts of 6-12 evaluable subjects each.

      Cohort 1 will enroll eligible subjects for whom a single CB unit has been identified that
      meets the minimum HLA-matching criteria and has a minimum pre-cryopreservation total
      nucleated cell (TNC) dose of at least 2.5 x 10^7 cells/kg. Cohort 2 is identical to Cohort 1,
      except that the TNC dose of the CB unit must be between 2.0 - &lt;2.5 x 10^7 cells/kg. Finally,
      Cohort 3 is identical to Cohort 2, except that the TNC dose of the CB unit must be between
      1.5 - &lt;2.0 x 10^7 cells/kg. If no safety rules are triggered, the study will proceed to the
      next dosing cohort. Within a dosing cohort, no more than three subjects may be before Day 42
      at any one time, unless they have already engrafted neutrophils. The final dosing cohort is
      defined as the last cohort where 12 evaluable subjects are treated and no stopping rules are
      triggered. The corresponding TNC dose level will be considered the minimally acceptable TNC
      dose level.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with hematologic malignancies for whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation
             is deemed clinically appropriate. Eligible diseases and stages include:

               -  Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma

               -  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)

               -  Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)

               -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)

          2. Lack of 5-6/6 HLA-matched related or 8/8 HLA-A, B, C, DRß1 matched unrelated donor; or
             unrelated donor not available within appropriate timeframe.

               -  Identification of suitable backup CB unit(s) (single unit with
                  pre-cryopreservation cell dose ≥ 2.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg or two units with
                  pre-cryopreservation cell dose ≥ 1.5 x 10^7 TNC/kg each) and meeting minimum HLA
                  match criteria.
