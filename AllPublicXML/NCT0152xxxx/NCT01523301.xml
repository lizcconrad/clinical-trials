      The study included a maximum 2-week Screening Period, a maximum 4-week Titration Period for
      early-stage Parkinson's disease or maximum 7-week Titration Period for advanced-stage
      Parkinson's disease, 8-week Maintenance Period, a maximum 6-day De-escalation Period for
      early-stage Parkinson's disease or maximum 12-day De-escalation Period for advanced-stage
      Parkinson's disease and 30-day Safety Follow-Up Period.

      The maximum study durations for an individual subject with early-stage Parkinson's disease
      and with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease were 19 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Score of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D consists of 17 items. Nine of the items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4. The remaining 8 items are scored on a 3-point scale, from 0 to 2. Therefore, the total score ranges between 0 to 52, with a cutoff score of 15/16 diagnosing major depressive disorder.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Score of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) is a self-report instrument to measure Depression symptoms and severity. There are 21 items in the BDI-II. Scores of 0-13 are considered minimal depression; 14-19 indicates mild depression; 20-28 indicates moderate depression; and 29-63 indicates severe depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Score of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (Activities of Daily Living-ADL Subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS Part II is a tool to measure Activities in Daily Living - it includes speech, salivation, swallowing, handwriting, cutting food and handling utensils, dressing, hygiene, turning in bed and adjusting clothes, falling (unrelated to freezing), freezing when walking, walking, tremor, and sensory complaints related to Parkinsonism. Each of the 13 questions is measured on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The total score of UPDRS part II ranges from 0 (normal) to 52 (severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Score of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (Motor Subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement of motor symptoms is measured by the change from Baseline in UPDRS Part III motor score. The UPDRS Part III is an accepted and validated scale for the assessment of motor function in Parkinson's disease. Each of the elements in the UPDRS Part III is measured on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is normal and 4 represents severe abnormalities. The total score of UPDRS part III ranges from 0 (normal) to 108 (severe abnormalities).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Combined Score of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (ADL) Plus Part III (Motor Subscale)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The combined score of UPDRS part II and UPDRS part III is the sum of the individual scores and threfore ranges from 0 (normal) to 160 (severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Score of Apathy Scale (AS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The AS is an abbreviated version of the Apathy Scale (AS). The AS consists of 14 items phrased as questions that are to be answered on a four-point Likert scale. It was developed specifically for patients with Parkinson Disease (PD). For questions 1-8, the scoring system is the following: not at all = 3 points; slightly = 2 points; some =1 point, a lot = 0 point. For questions 9-14: the scoring system is the following: not at all = 0 points; slightly = 1 point; some = 2 points; a lot = 3 points. Adding all scores provides the final score with a range from 0 to 42.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to the End of Maintenance Period in the Score of Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to Week 15)</time_frame>
    <description>The SHAPS is a self-report instrument developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. The sum of the 14 items scores ranges from 0 to 14. A higher score represents more anhedonic symptoms.</description>

Early-stage Parkinon´s disease for 1 week: Rotigotine dose at 2 mg/24 h. Advanced-stage Parkinson´s disease for 1 week: Rotigotine dose at 4 mg/24 h.
Afterwards the dose has been increased in the Titration Period by 2 mg/24 h each week until either the optimal or maximal dose was reached.
All subjects remained 8-weeks in the Maintenance Period. In the De-escalation Period Subjects with early-stage Parkinson´s disease de-escalated their dose by 2 mg/24 h every other day to 2 mg/24h, and then to 0 mg after 2 days. Subjects with advanced-stage Parkinson´s disease de-escalated their dose by 2 mg/24h every other day to 4 mg/24h, and then to 0 mg after 2 days.
A Safety Follow-Up Visit was scheduled for all subjects 30 days after their last dose administration.</description>

It was developed specifically for patients with Parkinson Disease (PD).

For questions 9-14: the scoring system is the following: not at all = 0 points; slightly = 1 point; some = 2 points; a lot = 3 points.

      <time_frame>Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) were collected during the study, which began in April 2012 and concluded in October 2014.</time_frame>

          <title>Rotigotine</title>
          <description>Rotigotine, daily doses, treatment Group.
Early-stage Parkinon´s disease for 1 week: Rotigotine dose at 2 mg/24 h. Advanced-stage Parkinson´s disease for 1 week: Rotigotine dose at 4 mg/24 h.
Afterwards the dose has been increased in the Titration Period by 2 mg/24 h each week until either the optimal or maximal dose was reached.
All subjects remained 8-weeks in the Maintenance Period. In the De-escalation Period Subjects with early-stage Parkinson´s disease de-escalated their dose by 2 mg/24 h every other day to 2 mg/24h, and then to 0 mg after 2 days. Subjects with advanced-stage Parkinson´s disease de-escalated their dose by 2 mg/24h every other day to 4 mg/24h, and then to 0 mg after 2 days.
A Safety Follow-Up Visit was scheduled for all subjects 30 days after their last dose administration.</description>
