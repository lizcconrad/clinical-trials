  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm children are at increased risk for developing lung disease due to immature lungs.
      Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support is increasingly used as treatment. Nasal continuous
      positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is the most common NIV-mode. Recently, high flow nasal
      cannulas (HFNC) have become an alternative NIV-mode. Both nCPAP and HFNC provide increased
      pressure in the airways aiming to keep the lungs open. With nCPAP it is common to use short
      binasal prongs that fill the nostrils completely and are pressed tightly over the nose. With
      HFNC oxygen/air is administered via two small, thin cannulas located just inside the
      nostrils, but the nostrils are not blocked.

      The aim of this study is to compare patient comfort in premature infants treated with nCPAP
      and HFNC. The investigators hypothesis is that HFNC increases patient comfort.

      The study is a randomized cross over study (2 x 24 hours). Children eligible for inclusion
      should be born before 34 weeks of gestation and have moderate respiratory distress, thus be
      &quot;in need&quot; of nCPAP. During the study period (48 hours) the investigators will consider how
      the child tolerates treatment with nCPAP versus HFNC. Primary outcome is patient comfort
      assessed with the EDIN-score (Neonatal pain and comfort score). Secondary outcomes are stress
      hormone response (cortisol in saliva), surrounding noise and parental satisfaction. The
      child's breathing pattern will be carefully monitored. The study involves no extra painful
      investigations.

      The investigators plan to recruit 20 patients.

    <description>EDIN score (neonatal pain and comfort score) is a validated scoring system to assess pain and comfort in term and preterm infants. The cumulative EDIN score, based on three evaluations/24 h, is recorded for each 24 h epoch with HFNC or CPAP, respectively. The change in EDIN score between the two 24 h epochs are assessed.</description>
