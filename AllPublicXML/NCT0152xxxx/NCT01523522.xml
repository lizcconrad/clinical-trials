  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to offer autologous muscle-derived progenitor cell injection as an
      efficient mini-invasive surgical therapy that would be simple for the patient and could be
      used in a majority of cases, including in young women in the post-partum. This approach may
      provide efficient tissue repair of the striated anal sphincter which is not permitted by
      existing therapies. This innovative therapy may ultimately be proposed after failure of the
      common treatments and before an high-risk invasive surgical intervention. Besides, injection
      of muscle-derived progenitor cells in animals has shown very encouraging results of the
      sphincter function assessed ex vivo. Hence, a high benefit may be expected with this
      approach.

      after verification of information and inclusion criteria. patients were randomized to
      treatment or placebo arms and receive the injections.

      an evaluation of the function and quality of life are realized. after a period of 6 months,
      patients in the placebo arm receive the injection of myoblasts that have been preserved.
