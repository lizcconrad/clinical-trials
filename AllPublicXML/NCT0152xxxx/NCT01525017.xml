      The primary objective of this study is to answer the question &quot;Is it possible to inject the
      Combig-DC vaccine in a renal tumour without getting unacceptable side effects&quot;? Patients
      newly diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma will get Combig-DC vaccinations at two
      occasions in a two weeks period (day 1 and day 14). After another two weeks the kidney will
      be eliminated. Adverse events will be registered, as well as changes in vital signs(heart
      rate, blood pressure and body temperature) and lab parameters. Immunologic response will be
      evaluated by measuring immunologic markers in blood and tumour tissue, and measuring the size
      of the metastases three months after nephrectomy.
