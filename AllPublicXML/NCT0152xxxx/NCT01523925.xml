  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project attempts to perform a randomized controlled trial to verify the efficacy and
      motor control mechanism of the proposed combined functional electrical therapy with
      distributed constraint-induced therapy or with robot-assisted Bilateral training.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two theory-based, task-oriented approaches are distributed CIT (dCIT) and robot-assisted
      Bilateral training(BAT). CIT/dCIT involves massed practice of the affected arm and restraint
      of the unaffected arm. BAT involves repetitive practice of symmetrical bilateral movements on
      robot. Both are evident to improve motor performance, motor control or daily function in high
      functioning patients. These dCIT and BAT have their own limitations for motor-deficit
      rehabilitation after stroke, i.e. only appropriate for high-functioning or mildly motor
      impaired patients. Functional electrical therapy, an innovative technology, is proposed as an
      adjunct to these behavioral approaches to assist in movement execution. Functional electrical
      therapy is used to increase the electric activity of muscles for movement and the active
      range of motion in low functioning patients. Combining functional electrical therapy into CIT
      or BAT may extend the utility of these two behavioral approaches beyond patients with mild
      motor deficits and could expedite the progress of motor recovery. This project attempts to
      perform a randomized controlled trial to verify the efficacy and motor control mechanism of
      the proposed combined functional electrical therapy with dCIT or with BAT.
