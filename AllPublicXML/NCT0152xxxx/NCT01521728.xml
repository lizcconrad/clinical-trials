  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first questions asked by patients with a new diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
      (ALS) often include: &quot;Does exercise help slow the progression of the disease?&quot;, &quot;Is there any
      harm in exercising?&quot;, or &quot;What type of exercise (endurance or resistance) is most
      appropriate?&quot; At this time, however, there is a lack of answers for people who suffer from an
      illness that affects their strength above all else. Yet the beneficial effects of exercise in
      both healthy people as well as people with other diseases have been extensively studied and
      resulted in recommendations about the types of exercise that are beneficial. In this study
      the investigators will ask participants with ALS to exercise in one of three ways:
      weightlifting (resistance exercise), stationary bicycling (endurance exercise), and range of
      motion exercise (the current &quot;standard of care&quot; for ALS patients). The investigators will use
      several different types of tests to determine whether one type of exercise is tolerated
      better and is safer than another. The investigators will also collect information about how
      the body responds to exercise in ALS. This study will help in the development of a larger
      national study to understand how exercise can be combined with other treatments to
      potentially improve strength and alter the course of the disease.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In ALS, stretching and range of motion are routinely recommended for the prevention of &quot;frozen shoulder syndrome&quot; and contractures resulting from weakness. The problem is compounded in ALS where upper motor neuron dysfunction may result in spasticity and incapacitating contractures with pain. Therefore, maintaining an aggressive program for stretching and range of motion exercise is widely accepted as a &quot;standard of care&quot; for ALS management.</description>
