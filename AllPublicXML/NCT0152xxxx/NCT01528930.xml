  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of chronic pulmonary disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) in
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients has been increasing worldwide. In Korea,
      the common etiologic pathogens for this disease are Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and
      Mycobacterium abscessus. Treating NTM lung diseases can be extremely difficult and may
      require multiple drugs.

      Amikacin is an effective antibiotic for NTM infection. However, intravenous amikacin
      treatment is limited by its systemic route of administration and a lot of adverse events.
      Amikacin inhalation treatment could overcome these limitations and also could be effective
      for treatment of NTM pulmonary disease due to maintaining a high lung concentration. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether amikacin inhalation treatment is effective in
      patients with MAC infection who experienced treatment failure after standard treatment for
      more than 6 months or with M. abscessus infection.

Amikacin is provided for inhalation via nebulization.
500 mg of amikacin is administered once daily using the Pari-Boy N/Long Life Nebulizer.
Administration time is approximately 20 minutes.
