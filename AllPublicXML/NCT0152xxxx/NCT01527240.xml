    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine whether a single injection of CsA after
      intravenous thrombolysis can significantly decreased the volume of cerebral infarction at day
      30 ± 15 assessed with Flair MRI.

      Secondary objectives are to determine whether a single injection of CsA after intravenous
      thrombolysis is safe and effective regarding to death and disability.
