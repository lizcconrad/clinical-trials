  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the effect of a diet combining two different functional concepts on
      markers associated to cardiometabolic risk. The functional concepts are selected on the basis
      of their reported ability to influence the inflammatory tonus. It is hypothesized that the
      medium-term consumption of a diet combining low GI-prebiotic foods may positively influence
      various biomarkers associated with the risk for developing metabolic syndrome and
      cardiometabolic disease. Also, the combination of functional mechanisms are expected to
      result in synergistic effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention is carried out in healthy women following a randomized crossover design in
      which an &quot;active&quot; (functional&quot;) diet is compared with a control diet formulated in agreement
      with the Nordic Dietary Recommendations but lacking the functional ingredients of the active
      regime.

      The active diet supplies important daily amounts of dried legumes and wholegrain cereal
      products.

      Each dietary treatment is applied for 4 weeks separated by a 4-6 week washout period.
      Subjects are encouraged to maintain a stable body weight under the whole trial.
