      Suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents in the US yet there is a
      paucity of research on effective treatments for this population. The primary aim of the
      research described in this application is to evaluate the efficacy of dialectical behavior
      therapy (DBT) for suicidal adolescents. DBT has an empirical track record with suicidal
      adults of reducing the incidence, frequency and medical risk of suicide attempts and
      non-suicidal self-injuries among individuals meeting criteria for borderline personality
      disorder (BPD). While DBT is widely used in the community with suicidal adolescents,
      particularly those with difficulties characteristic of BPD such as poor emotion regulation
      and impulse control, no randomized trial of DBT with suicidal adolescents has ever been
      conducted. And, while non-randomized trials indicate that the intervention is both safe and
      effective, without a randomized trial the investigators simply do not know whether DBT for
      suicidal adolescents is efficacious or not. Given the severity of the problem and the lack of
      alternative treatments for high risk adolescents, addressing this question is of great
      importance. The second aim of the research is to analyze mediators of reduced suicidal and
      self-injurious behaviors in adolescents. 170 adolescents at two sites (Seattle and Los
      Angeles) will be randomized to DBT or Individual and Supportive Group Therapy (IGST). Both
      treatments include 6 months of individual and group treatment and adolescents and a parent
      complete 5 assessments over a 1-year period.

    <description>DBT is a cognitive behavioral approach to treatment that synthesizes change based strategies characteristic of behavior therapy and validation strategies consistent with acceptance based treatments through application of dialectical principles and techniques. Based on a combined capability deficit and motivational model which states that 1) adolescents with suicidal behaviors and borderline features lack important interpersonal, self-regulation and distress tolerance skills, and 2) personal and environmental factors often both block and/or inhibit use of behavioral skills that adolescents do have, and at times reinforce dysfunctional behaviors. The primary adaptation for adolescents is the inclusion of family in the DBT skills training portion of therapy as well as a much greater inclusion of parents in the management of high suicide risk.</description>

    <description>The aim of IGST is relief or reduction of symptoms, the promotion of personal growth including enhancement of adolescents' strengths/coping skills and capacity to use environmental supports and to help suicidal adolescents increase their sense of self-esteem. Treatment aims to reduce suicidal behavior and emotion dysregulation by helping the adolescent learn to trust and validate themselves. The overarching assumption in IGST is that adolescents become suicidal for a variety of reasons, but they often report feeling isolated, misunderstood, unloved and unwanted. IGST Interventions include providing a strong therapeutic alliance where the therapist provides an environment that is completely trusting and validating to counter the experience of the depressed/suicidal youth.</description>
