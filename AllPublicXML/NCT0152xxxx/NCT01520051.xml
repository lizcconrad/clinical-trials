  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by lower respiratory
      tract (LRT) symptoms such as wheeze, cough and airway obstruction. Patients with asthma
      frequently suffer from exacerbations, which can be triggered by allergens and, in particular,
      viral respiratory infections. It has recently been shown that mepolizumab, a humanized
      monoclonal antibody that neutralizes interleukin(IL)-5, markedly reduces the exacerbation
      rate in asthma patients with eosinophilic airway inflammation. Previous studies have
      indicated that in a mixed population (eosinophilic and non eosinophilic) of mild asthma
      patients, mepolizumab did not have an impact on lung function and asthma symptom scores upon
      allergen provocation, although it did on markers such as sputum and blood eosinophils.
      Together, these observations led to the hypothesis that mepolizumab treatment reduces the
      exacerbation rate by limiting virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

      The investigators hypothesize that neutralization of IL-5 during virus infection in patients
      with allergic asthma:

        1. Reduces virus-induced bronchial inflammation

        2. Attenuates virus-induced asthma symptoms, airflow limitation and bronchial
           hyperresponsiveness.

        3. Enhances cellular immune responses to the virus.

      The aims of this study are to:

        1. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization reduces the inflammatory response to viral
           airway infections in allergic asthma patients

        2. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization prevents or reduces asthma symptoms during
           virus-induced asthma exacerbations

        3. To investigate whether IL-5 neutralization affects the cellular immune response to viral
           airway infections in allergic asthma patients

      Mild allergic asthma subjects receive three times an infusion containing 750 mg of
      mepolizumab. Two weeks after the third infusion, subjects will be experimentally infected
      with RV16. One day before and six days after infection a bronchoscopy will be performed to
      collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and bronchial brushes. Blood will be collected at each
      infusion and each bronchoscopy and at least 6 weeks after infection. Lung function will be
      evaluated throughout the study.
