  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic or locally advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) who
      develop resistance against the two hitherto approved drugs for this disease, the tyrosin
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and sunitinib, have a poor prognosis. Sometimes a further
      response may be achieved by other drugs, mainly other TKIs, which have been explored in
      different studies but not yet have been approved for clinical use. Pazopanib is a TKI
      inhibiting the tyrosin kinases KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGF 1-3, all of which have important roles
      in the pathogenesis of GIST. Theoretically, it may function in GIST, and it deserves
      investigational trials. The drug is approved for metastatic renal cancer and is relatively
      well tolerated. In this trial (SSG XXI), the disease control rate (DCR) = (CR+PR+SD) after 12
      weeks of treatment will be assessed as the primary endpoint, and at the same time trough
      levels will be measured. Secondary endpoints include ORR, PFS, toxicity, and disease control
      rate in relation to trough level week 12 and in relation to the primary mutation of the tumor
      (if known). The goal is to include 72 patients in the trial, which is open and single arm.
