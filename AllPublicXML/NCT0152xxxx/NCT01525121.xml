      This is a randomized crossover study, designed to evaluate if the manual expiratory rib cage
      compression technique improves respiratory mechanics and is effective in secretion removal in
      mechanically ventilated patients.

      Chest physiotherapy is an essential component of the multidisciplinary approach in critical
      care settings. In this context, a number of devices and manual techniques have been used to
      remove pulmonary secretions and re-expand collapsed areas. This study was designed to
      evaluate whether manual rib cage compression improves airway clearance and respiratory
      mechanics in mechanically ventilated patients. In a randomized crossover trial, 20
      mechanically ventilated patients underwent thoracic manual compression and control
      intervention (normal ventilation) at the same day. The main outcomes were sputum production
      and the changes in respiratory mechanics.

    <description>This a crossover study, so all subjects performed both, control and experimental interventions. The patients were kept in supine at 30 degree head-up position. Ventilatory mode was changed to volume-controlled, with a tidal volume of 8mL/kg, inspiratory flow of 60 Lpm and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. A first tracheal suctioning was done, and the mucus was discarded. Then, a series of two minutes of bilateral expiratory rib-cage compressions ensued. Aiming to minimize inter-therapist variability, the maneuver was applied by the same registered and trained physiotherapist. Control intervention followed the same sequence, but instead of the compressive maneuver they were kept on normal ventilation with the parameters described above.</description>

    <intervention_name>Expiratory Rib Cage Compression</intervention_name>
    <description>The therapist hands were positioned on the lower ribs, and the force was applied every two breaths only during the expiration, synchronizing the maneuver rate with the patient's respiratory rate. Then, the patients underwent a suctioning procedure, and a hyperinflation maneuver consisting of a 10 minutes period under pressure support ventilation of 35 cmH2O was done. In control intervention instead of the compressive maneuver the patients were kept on normal ventilation.</description>
