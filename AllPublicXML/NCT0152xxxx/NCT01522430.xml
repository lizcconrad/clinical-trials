      The DEPART study end points are to provide conclusive evidence, using a randomized, double
      blinded, sham procedure controlled study design, that radiofrequency renal denervation:

        1. reduces daytime ambulatory blood pressure,

        2. improves nocturnal dipping in blood pressure at the ambulatory blood pressure recording.

    <description>Radiofrequency catheter based therapy for renal denervation: Symplicity catheter will be advanced into the renal artery and connected to a radiofrequency generator. As previously described, four-to-six discrete, low-power radio frequency treatments will be applied along the length of both main renal arteries. At least four radiofrequency applications will be delivered in each renal artery, unless this is not feasible for anatomical reasons.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  They have a mandatory &gt; 3 antihypertensive medication therapy, including a thiazide or
             a loop diuretic (according to the patient's renal function, unless documented
             side-effects) and at least one attempt to treat with spironolactone, given at usual
             recommended dose since at least 8 weeks, before inclusion,

          -  A mandatory check list of secondary cause of hypertension has been excluded

          -  They succeed the pill count test.

          -  They have a mandatory ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before inclusion with at
             least 70% of valid readings during daytime (08:00 am 08:00 pm, using a sampling
             frequency of 20 minutes, only devices validated according to
             http://www.dableducational.org are permitted), where daytime ambulatory blood pressure
             of systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure exceeds 135 mmHg and/or 85 mmHg,
             respectively. Daytime ambulatory blood pressure of systolic and/or diastolic blood
             pressure below 135 mmHg and/or 85 mmHg, respectively, is acceptable for inclusion in
             the study if the patient takes four or more antihypertensive medication (3).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an eGFR &lt;30ml/min/m² are excluded,

          -  patients with known renal atherosclerotic lesions,

          -  previous procedures in the renal arteries,

          -  known unsuitable anatomy for the procedure,

          -  previous nephrectomy,

          -  contrast agent allergy,

          -  hyperthyroidia.
