      Primary Objective:

      - To assess potential impact of moderate and severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      of cabazitaxel

      Secondary Objective:

      - To assess the safety of cabazitaxel in patients with various degrees of renal impairment
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening phase, registration, cabazitaxel administration will start
      within 5 business days of registration, with 21-day study treatment cycles. Cycle lengths may
      be extended up to a maximum of 14 additional days in case of unresolved toxicity. Patients
      continue to receive treatment until they experience, unacceptable toxicities/Adverse Events,
      disease progression, withdraw their consent, or the investigator decides to discontinue the
      patient, and the subsequent 30 days follow-up or study cut-off, whichever comes first.

      Patients may continue to be treated as long as they are benefiting from study treatment and
      have not met study withdrawn criteria.

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Diagnosis of histologically or cytologically proven non-hematologic malignancy. The
             cancer must be one that is either refractory to standard therapy or for which no
             standard therapy exists. Cabazitaxel is an adequate treatment option, as judged by
             investigator.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5x10^9/L

               -  Platelets ≥ 100x10^9/L

             (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, macrolides, antiprotease agents, etc) is not
             allowed within 2 weeks before or during the test period of the pharmacokinetic
