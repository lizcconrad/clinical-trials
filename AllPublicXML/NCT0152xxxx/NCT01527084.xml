      1. To determine the appropriate timing of surgical intervention after Percutaneous Catheter
           Drainage (PCD) in infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN).

        2. To see the change in morbidity and mortality after changing the interval of surgery
           after PCD

      In present study we plan to determine the appropriate timing of surgical intervention after
      PCD in step up approach of Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN).

      The investigators also intend to evaluate the role of PCD in obviating the surgical
      intervention in the management of IPN and evaluate the risks &amp; benefits of extended treatment
      policy of PCD in step up approach of IPN in comparison to early surgery after PCD.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with diagnosis of IPN (UK GUIDELINES) managed with percutaneous catheter
             drainage (PCD) for 10 to 15 days and not showing significant improvement on PCD will
             be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient showing significant improvement on PCD within 10 days of its
             insertion.(Significant improvement on PCD is defined as resolution of fever,
             acceptance of enteral nutrition, decrease in total leukocyte count, reversal of organ
             system failure)

          2. Sterile pancreatic necrosis

          3. An acute intra abdominal event ( perforation of hollow viscus, bleeding, or the
             abdominal compartment syndrome) during or within 10 days after PCD insertion

          4. Previous drainage or surgical necrosectomy for infected pancreatic necrosis (ERCP with
             or without papillotomy is allowed.)

          5. Previous exploratory laparotomy for acute abdomen and diagnosis of pancreatitis during
             laparotomy
