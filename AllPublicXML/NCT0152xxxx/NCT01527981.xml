    <time_frame>Baseline assessment; 4, 8, and 12 months post-intervention assessments</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' depression severity was measured by clinician-administered measures (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and self-report measures (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale). Clinician-delivered measures were administered at baseline and follow-up assessments by assessors blinded to participants' randomization status.</description>
