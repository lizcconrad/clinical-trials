         17. The effects of PF-00299804 in human foetal development are unknown. For this reason,
             women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use effective contraception
             (hormonal control method, barrier, abstinence or surgical sterilization) before
             inclusion in the study, during participating in the study and at least 3 months after
             treatment has ended the trial. The definition of an effective contraceptive method is
             based on the criterion of the principal investigator or designee. In case of a woman
             become pregnant or there is suspicion that she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, the trial physician must inform immediately. All women of childbearing

             excluded from this, those patients who have been treated with EGFR inhibitors for
             obvious reasons. However, those patients who have received Stupp scheme + other drugs
             like bevacizumab and cilengitide, remain eligible.

          3. Prior treatment with an investigational drug/s known or are suspected to be active by
             the action of any component of the EGFR tyrosine kinase.

          4. Surgery of any kind (does not include diagnostic procedures such as minor lymph node
             biopsy) in the 2 weeks prior to baseline assessments of the disease, or presence of
             side effects of previous procedures.

          5. Presence of any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality that can affect
             oral administration, transit or absorption of study drug, such as the inability to
             take medication by mouth as tablets.

          6. Presence of any psychiatric or cognitive disorder that limits the understanding or the
             signature of informed consent and / or jeopardize the fulfillment of the requirements
             of this protocol.

          7. Significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, including:

               -  Congestive heart failure in the previous 6 months

               -  Known or suspected congenital long QT syndrome

               -  History of clinically significant ventricular arrhythmias of any type (as

               -  Heart rate &lt; 50/minute in the baseline electrocardiogram

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension.

          8. Any patient with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, even though is
             currently controlled, or presents signs or symptoms suggestive of impaired left
             ventricular function at discretion of the investigator,should have an evaluation of
             LVEF in these circumstances. If the result is under the center lower limit normal or
             lower than 50%, the patient would not be eligible.

          9. History of any cancer, except for the following circumstances:

               -  Patients with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been free

         12. Presence of leptomeningeal dissemination.

         13. Pregnant or breastfeeding. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects of PF-00299804 is unknown. Because
             there is an unknown risk of potential adverse effects in infants, secondary to
             maternal treatment with PF-00299804, breastfeeding should be discontinued if mother is
             treated with PF-00299804.

         14. Patients positive for HIV being treated with antiretroviral combination therapy. These
             patients are not eligible due to potential pharmacokinetic interactions with
             PF-00299804. Additionally, these subjects have an increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. HIV-positive patients not on
             antiretroviral combination therapy, are eligible if the disease is controlled at the
             discretion of the investigator.

         15. History of allergic reactions attributed to drugs with similar chemical or biological
             composition than PF-00299804.

         16. Another acute or chronic serious medical condition, uncontrolled intercurrent illness
             or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial
             participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the
             interpretation of test results and that,investigator's discretion, make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this trial. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including,
             but are not limited to, ongoing or active infection or psychiatric illness / social
             situations that limit the compliance of study requirements.
