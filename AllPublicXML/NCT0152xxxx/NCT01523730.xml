  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking rates are extremely high in persons with schizophrenia and this increases
      the risk of disease and death due to tobacco-related disorders. One of the features of
      schizophrenia is reduced cognitive abilities, such as poor attention and memory. It is
      thought that people with schizophrenia smoke cigarettes to reduce these cognitive problems,
      as nicotine can improve cognitive function in these people. When people with schizophrenia
      stop smoking it causes further cognitive difficulties, which makes quitting harder for them
      compared to people without schizophrenia. A method called repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) allows clinicians to give repeated magnetic pulses through the scalp to
      cause changes in brain activity and behaviour. rTMS can improve cognitive function in people
      with schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that rTMS can reduce tobacco craving and
      consumption of cigarettes. Therefore, we believe that rTMS will improve the cognitive
      deficits observed during cigarette smoking abstinence and help reduce cravings for
      cigarettes. Ultimately, rTMS may help smokers with schizophrenia who can't quit smoking with
      available treatments. This study will examine the effect of rTMS on tobacco cravings and
      cognitive problems produced by overnight abstinence from cigarette smoking in persons with
      schizophrenia in comparison to people without mental illness who smoke. Important information
      about the potential of rTMS for the treatment of cognitive deficits and tobacco addiction in
      schizophrenia will be obtained. Providing more effective smoking cessation treatments in
      people with schizophrenia may lead to improved physical and mental health for these patients,
      who are extremely susceptible to tobacco addiction and tobacco-related illness.

    <measure>Cigarette craving as assessed by Tiffany Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (TQSU)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>Craving will be assessed using the TQSU, a 32-item list of signs and symptoms of nicotine cravings and urges to smoke which subjects rate how strongly they agree or disagree with the statements on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cigarette withdrawal using the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>Withdrawal will be assessed using the MNWS on which subjects self-report nicotine withdrawal symptoms including nicotine craving, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, increased appetite or weight gain, depressed mood, and insomnia on a 5-point scale of 1 (none) to 5 (severe). Note: The internal consistencies and test-retest reliability of the MNWS, TQSU and FTND in schizophrenia are comparable to those observed in controls.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre- and post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 1 and 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>Expired Breath CO (in parts per million; ppm) will be used to biochemically verify smoking status.</description>

    <measure>Plasma nicotine/cotinine levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma nicotine and cotinine levels will provide and objective measurement of cigarette smoking. Assays will be performed by the CAMH Clinical Laboratory using GC/MS/MS procedures which have been adapted from published procedures.</description>

    <measure>Continuous Performance Test-X (CPT-X)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>The CPT-X is designed to measure sustained attention and response inhibition. Participants press the space bar as quickly as possible after each letter is presented except when the letter 'X' is presented. Common measures reported include % Hits, % Omissions, % Commissions, Reaction Time, Reactions Time Variability and an Attentional Index (d') Duration: 15 minutes</description>

    <measure>N-back</measure>
    <time_frame>Post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>The N-back is designed to measure working memory (WM). This task requires continuous upgrades of the memory store and is suited to studying varying levels of working memory load. Task-load will be parametrically manipulated by varying the interval between targets requiring responses (i.e., 1-back, 3-back) according to previously published methods. The dependent variables of interest will include the average performance and reaction times. Duration:45 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spatial Delayed Response (SDR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>The SDR is designed to measure visuospatial working memory (VSWM). Subjects focus on a central fixation cross on a computer screen. While fixated (staring at the cross), a dot-shaped cue flashes in one of 32 possible locations towards the outer edge of the screen. Then a delay period occurs (5, 15 or 30 seconds). After the delay, the fixation cross returns and the subjects must point on the computer screen where they remember seeing the dot cue. Results are reported as the averaged &quot;distance from target&quot; in cm for the 10 trials at each delay condition. Duration: 15 minutes.</description>

    <measure>EEG recording during performance of N-back Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>EEG recording during performance of N-back Task:
EEG data will be collected using the methods reported in by our lab. A 64-electrode cap and Synamps2 DC-coupled EEG system (Compumedics) will be used. Evoked γ-power from the frontal electrodes will be measured while the participants complete the N-back task.</description>

    <time_frame>Post rTMS/sham treatment week 1 and 2: at baseline smoking as usual (day 2), following over-night smoking abstinence (day 3am) and smoking reinstatement (day 3pm)</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT measures verbal learning and memory. The HVLT-R is a verbal list-learning test designed to measure the acquisition of new verbal information using a 12-item word list.Duration: 10 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Smoking Topography</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1 and 2: At baseline, day 2 when smoking as usual and following over-night smoking abstinence day 3</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking patterns will be assessed by measuring aspects of smoking topography (using the CReSS system) such as latency to puff, puff frequency, puff volume, puff duration, inter-puff interval, depth of inhalation and inter-cigarette interval which are postulated to be in vivo measures of smoking reinforcement.The CReSS calculates and stores a number of measures including total number of puffs smoked per session, total puff volume per cigarette, puffs per cigarette, duration of inter-puff interval, average maximum puff velocity, average puff volume and average puff duration.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo two testing weeks (active and sham rTMS treatment) administered in a randomized order, to which both experimenter and participant will be blind. There will be a washout period of at least one month between the testing weeks to ensure that any changes in cortical function induced by rTMS have returned to baseline. rTMS treatment sessions will take place twice daily on days 1-3 of each test week. Sham Condition: A single-wing tilt rTMS coil position producing somatic sensation (contraction of scalp muscles) with minimal direct brain effects will be used (same stimulation parameters and site as active condition).</description>
