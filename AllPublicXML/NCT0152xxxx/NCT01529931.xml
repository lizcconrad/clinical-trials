  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a follow up study designed to gather information about the effect of the
      number of Hair2Go maintenance treatments on hair clearance 1 year after the last basic
      Hair2Go treatment. This study includes taking photos and documenting endpoints but does not
      include treatments.

      The Hair2Go device is intended for short-term and long-term removal of unwanted hair
      adjunctive to shaving. The device uses a technology called Elōs, which is a combination of
      electrical field at radio frequencies (RF) and intense optical energy, that are
      simultaneously applied to the tissue and were found to have synergistic effects. Thus, lower
      levels of both energies are used to facilitate the treatment for individuals of all skin
      types and hair colors.

      This study is a multicenter study. Subjects that completed the basic treatments of previous
      Hair2Go studies (OHR-2, OHR-3, or OHR-5-Face) will be offered the option to enroll in this
      study that will not include treatments. The individual data collected in the OHR-2 (and its
      extensions, i.e. OHR2-P and OHR2-1Y), OHR-3, and OHR-5-Face studies will be used for the
      analysis together with data gathered in this study. Photographs of the previously treated
      areas will be taken 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the last basic treatment if they were not
      already taken as part of the OHR-2, one of its extensions (i.e. OHR2-P and OHR2-1Y), or
      OHR-5-Face.
