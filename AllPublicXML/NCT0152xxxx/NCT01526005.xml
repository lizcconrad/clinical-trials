  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even though the health risks and societal costs of cigarette smoking are well-known, roughly
      19.8% of American adults continue to smoke. While most smokers endorse a desire to quit, very
      few (&lt; 5%) will actually quit in a given year without treatment, and only about 20-25%
      achieve abstinence after 6 months or more of effective treatment. Therefore, there continues
      to be a vital need to improve outcomes for cigarette smokers seeking treatment. Current
      first-line medications for Tobacco Dependence include nicotine replacement therapies (such as
      the patch, gum, lozenge, nasal spray, and inhaler), varenicline HCl (Chantix), and bupropion
      HCl (Zyban), with the current standard of care in most treatment settings being to choose
      specific medications based primarily on availability, ease of use, and patient preference.
      The goal of the proposed research is to improve the delivery of smoking cessation treatment
      by determining if pre-treatment nicotine receptor density in cigarette smokers is associated
      with smoking cessation outcome with the standard nicotine patch taper. The study's main
      hypothesis is that cigarette smokers with less pre-treatment upregulation of nicotine
      receptors will have a greater likelihood of quitting smoking from a standard course of
      nicotine patch treatment than smokers with more up-regulation of these receptors. Positron
      emission tomography (PET) will be used to test this hypothesis.

        Tobacco dependent cigarette smokers will be recruited through newspaper and internet
        advertisements from populations living in the counties surrounding the West Los Angeles
        Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult who is a tobacco dependent smoker (smokes 10-30 cigarettes per day)
             meeting criteria for Nicotine Dependence as defined by DSM-IV criteria

          -  Has the desire to quit smoking

          -  Ability to read, write, and give voluntary informed consent

          -  An exhaled CO greater than or equal to 8 ppm during the study screening visit to
             verify smoking status

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any history of an Axis I psychiatric diagnosis other than Nicotine Dependence
             (including other substance abuse/dependence and mood, anxiety, and psychotic
             disorders)

          -  Any current medication or any history of a medical condition that might affect the
             central nervous system at the time of scanning (e.g., current treatment with a
             psychotropic medication, or history of severe head trauma or epilepsy).

          -  Unstable cardiovascular disease, liver disease, or renal insufficiency. Routine
             history and physical examination will be performed at the initial screening visit to
             insure that participants meet study criteria

          -  Pregnancy (urine pregnancy tests will be obtained on all women of child-bearing
             potential) due to the theoretical risk of radiation exposure to the fetus.
             Pre-menopausal women will only be scanned during the early follicular phase (by
             participant report) of the menstrual cycle because hormonal levels have been shown to
             affect nicotine metabolism.

          -  Caffeine dependence, as evidenced by withdrawal symptoms temporally associated with
             caffeine ingestion.
