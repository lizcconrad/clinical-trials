  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed test is intended to enable dentists to differentiate between cavitated and
      non-cavitated tooth decay in the areas where teeth are in contact (interproximal surfaces).
      In these areas, dentists cannot visually inspect for caries, and currently bitewing X-rays
      (BWs) only correctly detect the presence of enamel decay 15-25% of the time. This low
      sensitivity can lead to late treatment resulting in unnecessarily large fillings, crowns,
      pain, root canals, and possible later loss of teeth.

      Hypothesis: Use of radiographic contrast on teeth will increase the accuracy of detection of
      early cavitation from 58% to 90%.

    <textblock>
      Tooth sites will be recorded by tooth number, type of surface (mesial, distal,occlusal),
      cavitated, non-cavitated, healthy. Radiographs will similarly be scored.Although contrast
      agents are classified as drugs this is not a study of drug properties or effect on cells
      since the properties of the agent are already well know and its safety record well
      established. This study will be recording the radiopacity of the contrast agent on healthy
      tooth surfaces, non-cavitated tooth surfaces and cavitated tooth surfaces. The outcome for
      each surface type will be presence or absence of a radiopacity on a radiograph which will be
      made at the one and only visit for each study subject. The radiograph contains the data from
      the intervention (placement of contrast agent) and the outcome will be assessed some weeks
      later after the completion of the data collection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  must have a minimum of 2 adjacent teeth so that interproximal surfaces of interest are
             in contact and hidden from direct visual inspection.

          -  the occlusal plane should be normal so that the interproximal contact regions are
             normal.

          -  English or Spanish speaker.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  pregnant women

          -  a person who has participated in a similar study involving dental radiography within
             the last 12 months.

          -  fillings must not be present in the regions of interest.
