  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical trial is to improve and personalize pancreatic cancer care to
      deliver the most effective therapy while avoiding unnecessary exposure to potential side
      effects. Excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) protein and mRNA expression
      predicts response to oxaliplatin - patients whose cancers make small amounts of ERCC1 are
      much more likely to respond to cisplatin than those whose tumors produce large amounts. The
      hypothesis is that the combination of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin is a uniquely effective
      regimen for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer whose tumors have a low expression of
      ERCC1.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma

          -  Patients must not have had prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy for metastatic
             pancreatic cancer

          -  Prior adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected disease or chemoradiotherapy for
             locally advanced disease is allowed but must have been administered &gt; 6 months prior
             to registration

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing women

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or any other cancer
             from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years

          -  Patients must not have known brain metastases

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may render the patient at
             excessive risk for treatment complications
