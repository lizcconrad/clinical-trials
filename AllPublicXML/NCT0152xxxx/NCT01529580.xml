  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will address a major challenge to the field of autism research: improving
      expressive communication in children with autism who have reached school age but have not
      acquired functional spoken language (non-verbal school aged children with autism; NVSACA).

      Fifteen children who completed the RO1 ICAN intervention (NCT01018407) at the Kennedy Krieger
      site and follow-up testing but continue to have minimal functional spoken language will be
      participants in this study. After eligibility is established, participants will be randomly
      assigned to a baseline duration of one week, two weeks or three weeks before the start of
      active treatment. Once the baseline duration is completed, participants begin active
      treatment one hour of intervention three days per week in the participants' school setting.
      In month 2, weekly teacher trainings begin. In month 5, weekly parent trainings begin to
      improve the child's generalization of skills and teach parents the strategies implemented in
      their child's treatment. Post-baseline and post-treatment assessments will be completed in
      the lab at a time that is convenient for the participants' families.

    <description>If eligible, you will be randomly assigned- as if by flipping a coin- to one of three baseline durations, during which your child will engage in daily interactions with their interventionist to determine if skills targeted by this intervention are improving naturally as your child matures, without active treatment from the study's interventionist. In this case, the duration is 1 week before your child begins active treatment with their interventionist.</description>

    <description>The intervention has 3 components:
One-on-one play based intervention: administered by the interventionist at the school for 1 hour, three times a week, each week for the 5 month duration of the intervention.
Parent training: at the beginning of the 5th month of intervention, parents will receive training once a week for an hour during the remaining four weeks of intervention.
Teacher training: in month 2 of the intervention, the teacher will receive 2 1.5 hour training sessions along with a weekly in-class coaching given as needed following completion of the second session of training.</description>
