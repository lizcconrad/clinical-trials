    <textblock>
      This is a study for children and adults who are interested in a new therapy for their
      allergies to dust mite and timothy grass. The new therapy is called sublingual immunotherapy
      and the investigators are testing if it is safe and well tolerated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled study of sublingual
      immunotherapy (SLIT) in pediatric and adult subjects with both house dust mite (HDM) and
      timothy grass (TG) allergies. We will evaluate whether Dermatophagoides farinae (DF) and/or
      TG allergen SLIT is safe in children and adults. We will also determine whether treatment
      with DF and/or TG SLIT reduces the severity of allergic symptoms (allergic rhinitis, allergic
      conjunctivitis) and enhances their resolution. The study will also evaluate whether SLIT
      provides a robust durability of response once it is terminated. The dosing-phase of the study
      will last up to 12 months. In addition, a follow up period of 2 years will occur.
      Approximately 10 subjects will be on placebo, and 20 on active treatment.

        SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Pediatric and adult timothy grass- and Dermatophagoides farinae-sensitive subjects
             with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma perennially or during grass
             pollen season.

          2. Subjects must be 5 years of age or older.

          3. Sensitivity to the relevant allergen will be documented by a positive skin prick test
             result (see Appendix E for details).

          4. All female subjects of child-bearing potential will be required to provide a urine
             sample for pregnancy testing that must be negative one week before being allowed to
             participate in the study.

          5. Subjects must be planning to remain in the study area during the trial.

          6. Subjects and/or their parents must be trained on the proper use of the Epi-Pen to be
             allowed to enroll in the study.

          7. Subjects and/or their parents must be mentally and physically capable of
             self-administering oral drug.

        SUBJECT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        No absolute contraindications to allergen skin testing and/or sublingual immunotherapy are
        known. However, the risk of serious systemic anaphylactic reactions to pollen or any potent
        allergenic extract suggests a number of preexisting conditions that should be considered
        relative contraindications. Among those conditions are acute infections, autoimmune
        disease, severe cardiac disease, and treatment with beta-adrenergic antagonistic drugs
        (beta-blockers).

          1. Subjects having a history of unexplained anaphylaxis within 2 years or a history of
             multiple (â‰¥2) episodes of anaphylaxis in the past year, frequent allergic or
             non-allergic urticaria, or history consistent with poorly controlled persistent
             asthma. Anaphylaxis must be medically diagnosed.

          2. Subjects with unstable angina, significant arrhythmia, uncontrolled hypertension,
             chronic sinusitis, or other chronic or immunological diseases that in the mind of the
             investigator might interfere with the evaluation or administration of the test drug or
             pose additional risk to the subject e.g. gastrointestinal or gastroesophageal disease,
             chronic infections, scleroderma, hepatic and gallbladder disease, chronic non-allergic
             pulmonary disease.

          3. Subject with an FEV1 or PEF less than 80% predicted (moderate persistent asthma) with
             or without controller medication.

          4. Subjects who have received an experimental drug in the last 30 days prior to admission
             into this study or who plan to use an experimental drug during the study.

          5. Subjects who have received timothy grass or dust mite allergen immunotherapy within 3
             years prior to admission in this study.

          6. Subjects who are current users of oral, intramuscular, or intravenous corticosteroids,
             tricyclic antidepressants, or are taking a beta-blocker (oral or topical).

          7. Subjects routinely using medication that could induce adverse gastrointestinal
             reactions during the study.

          8. Subjects refusing to sign the EpiPen Training Form (see Appendix F).

          9. Pregnant or breast feeding females.

         10. Subjects who have any symptoms at dose levels 1 or 2 at the Preliminary Dosing Visit
             (see, below).

         11. Subjects with significant pet allergies who have significant exposure at home or at
             work.
