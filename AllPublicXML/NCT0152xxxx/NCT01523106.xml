  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, comparing the effect of
      L-carnitine vs placebo on fatigue among Crohn's disease patients.

      The specific aim of this study is to determine if treatment with L-carnitine is more
      effective than placebo at decreasing fatigue severity scores, while accounting for disease
      activity and concomitant anemia, depression/anxiety and poor sleep quality.

      A total of 100 patients will be recruited, in order to be able ensure to detect a significant
      difference in fatigue between the treatment and control groups.

    <description>The Fatigue Severity Score is a validated instrument to assess fatigue associated with chronic disease. The scale ranges from scores from 9 to 63, with a higher score indicated greater fatigue.</description>

    <description>This is a validated instrument to measure fatigue and has been validated for use for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Scores range from 4-20, with higher scores indicated more severe fatigue.</description>
