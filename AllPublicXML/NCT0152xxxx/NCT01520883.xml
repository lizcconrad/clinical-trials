  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients suffering from asthma are not compliant to their treatment and consequently,
      are not well controlled. Shared decision making intervention has shown an improvement in the
      outcome of patients with chronic disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate decisional
      conflict and to assess decisional needs of adults with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthmatic patients will be recruited and asked to fill a decisional conflict scale.

      Patients, asthma educators and physicians will also be recruited to fill a needs assessment
      questionnaire about decisions taken by asthmatics.

    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the level of decisional conflict, subjects were asked to fill out a decisional conflict scale on asthma management which was developed by O'Connor adapted for our study. This questionnaire consisted of 16 questions. The answers used a Likert scale ranged from 1 - strongly agree to 5 - strongly disagree.</description>
