    <textblock>
      This study will track up to 600 young adults (ages 18 to 29) for a two-year period,
      collecting variables such as gambling behavior, drug and alcohol use, psychiatry and medical
      history, family history, impulsivity, quality of life, self-esteem, and cognition. For some
      individuals who meet criteria as being impulsive, they will be randomized to receive an
      intervention to help reduce their impulsivity.

    <measure>Structured Clinical Interview for Pathological Gambling (SCI-PG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SCI-PG is a validated and reliable scale assessing the presence of DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling. The number of criteria met for PG is added for a total score and those meeting 5 or more criteria have DSM-IV pathological gambling.
Subjects are expected to be followed for the duration of the 3 year study.
