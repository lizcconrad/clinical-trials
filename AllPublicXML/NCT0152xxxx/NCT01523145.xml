  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and affect 1-2 % of the population in the
      western world. Atrial fibrillation can be treated with a relatively new procedure, called
      radiofrequency ablation.

      The aim of this study is to explore if patients treated with ablation for atrial
      fibrillation, benefit from an integrated rehabilitation programme, that consist of physical
      training and psycho-educative consultations with a specialised nurse.

      The hypothesis is, that integrated rehabilitation can improve mental health, physical
      capacity and other factors.

      1-2 % of the population in the western world live with atrial fibrillation. One way to treat
      atrial fibrillation is with radiofrequency ablation. Ablation is a relatively new treatment
      and therefore only few studies has been exploring how the patients are doing after discharge.
      In Denmark the patients are not offered rehabilitation, only brief follow-up with a doctor.
      Therefore the aim of this study is to explore if the patients will benefit from a integrated
      rehabilitation programme consisting of physical training and psycho-educational intervention.

      A randomized clinical trial is conducted to investigate the effect and meaning of an
      integrated rehabilitation programme on the physical and psychosocial functioning of patients
      treated for atrial fibrillation with radiofrequency ablation. The trial is a parallel arm
      design.

      A mixed methods embedded experimental design is chosen to include both quantitative and
      qualitative data to evaluate the intervention. The intervention consists of four
      psycho-educational consultations provided by specialized nurses and a twelve week
      individualized exercise training programme provided by physiotherapists. A qualitative
      post-intervention study will explore rehabilitation participation experiences.

      The hypothesis is, that integrated rehabilitation can improve mental health, physical
      capacity, self-rated health, quality of life, sleep-quality and reduce anxiety, depression,
      health care utilisation, work cessation and mortality in patients treated for atrial
      fibrillation with radiofrequency ablation and that it is cost effective.

      210 patients will be included.

      Questionnaires, cardiopulmonary testing, 6 minute walking test and qualitative interviews
      will be used to evaluate the effect and meaning of the programme.
