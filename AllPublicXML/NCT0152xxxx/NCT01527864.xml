      A phase II, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out.
      Patients were randomly assigned to the treatment (PC + pegylated endostatin) or the control
      group (PC+ placebo). The efficacy was evaluated every six weeks.Follow-up continued until
      disease progression or death.

      A randomized phase 2 study, involving patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who
      had not previously received chemotherapy, compared paclitaxel and carboplatin Plus placebo
      with paclitaxel and carboplatin plus PEGylated endostatin, with PEGylated endostatin at a
      dose of 10 mg/m2 intravenously every weeks.
