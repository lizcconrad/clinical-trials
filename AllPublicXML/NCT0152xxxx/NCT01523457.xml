      The primary objective of this study was to determine the progression free survival in
      patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and in patients with locally advanced unresectable
      non-metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with a dose-attenuated modification of folinic acid,
      fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX). Secondary endpoints included:
      determine objective response rate according to RECIST; determine overall survival; evaluate
      toxicity; determine rate of resection in locally advanced unresectable stratum; correlate
      time to progression, objective response, and overall survival with early changes in glucose
      metabolism using [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) scanning.

      A phase II open label single arm multi-institutional study at Yale's Smilow Cancer Hospital
      (New Haven, CT, USA), the Smilow Cancer Hospital Care Centers (regional community-based
      clinics), the VA Connecticut Healthcare System West Haven Campus (West Haven, CT, USA) and
      Bridgeport Hospital (Bridgeport, CT, USA). The primary objective of this study was to
      determine the PFS in patients with MPC and LAPC treated with a dose attenuated modification
      of FOLFIRINOX.

      NOTE: Upon results reporting (2016), the registration record was reorganized to display MPC
      and LAPC groups in individual arms. The most meaningful comparison is between MPC/LAPC and
      historical controls. That is how results are reported in the published paper, see citations.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the progression free survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and in patients with locally advanced unresectable non-metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with a dose-attenuated modification of FOLFIRINOX. Tumour response was determined according to RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review.</description>

    <description>Response will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1 by independent radiology review) at 8 week intervals in patients with metastatic disease and in patients with locally advanced disease.</description>

    <measure>Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities will be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0. Rates of grade 3 and 4 toxicities will be compared to historical controls. MPC and LAPC are combined because they were given the exact same medication. The study aimed to compare this dosage with historical dosage, so this comparison is the most appropriate.</description>

    <description>Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (MPC) were treated with modified FOLFIRINOX every 2 weeks as follows: oxaliplatin 85 mg m 2 infused over 120 min, immediately followed by folinic acid 400 mg m 2 infused over 120 min with the addition, after 30 min, of irinotecan 135 mg m 2 infused over 90 min, followed by 5FU 300 mg m 2 IV bolus, followed by 2400 mg m 2 continuous infusion for 46 h (25% reduction in bolus 5FU and irinotecan doses). All patients received pegylated filgrastim with each cycle on day 3 or 4 in the absence of severe leukocytosis. All patients routinely received palonosetron, aprepitant and dexamethasone for emesis prophylaxis.</description>

FOLFIRINOX is a chemotherapy regimen. It is made up of the following four drugs:
FOL - folinic acid (leucovorin), a vitamin B derivative that modulates/potentiates/reduces the side effects of fluorouracil; F - fluorouracil (5-FU), a pyrimidine analog and antimetabolite which incorporates into the DNA molecule and stops DNA synthesis; IRIN - irinotecan (Camptosar), a topoisomerase inhibitor, which prevents DNA from uncoiling and duplicating; and OX - oxaliplatin (Eloxatin), a platinum-based antineoplastic agent, which inhibits DNA repair and/or DNA synthesis.</description>

All patients received pegylated filgrastim with each cycle on day 3 or 4 in the absence of severe leukocytosis.
