  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spastic esophageal motility disorders induced significant symptoms including dysphagia,
      retrosternal pain and regurgitation. Per oral endoscopic myotomy (P.O.E.M.) is a novel
      approach to perform myotomy through the esophagus with long submucosal tunnel. This study
      aimed to investigate the feasibility and safety of P.O.E.M. and translate the techniques from
      animal study to clinical practice in human.

               3. Previous history of esophagectomy or mediastinal surgery

               4. Previous history of endoscopic resection for early esophageal cancers, including
                  endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection

               5. End-stage Achalasia with dilated esophagus more than 6cm on Barium swallow
