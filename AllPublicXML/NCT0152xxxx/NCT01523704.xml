  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of patients with implantable pulse generator (IPG) has steadily increased in Japan
      causing increment in number of in office follow-ups and greater burden on many hospitals.

      The purpose of this multicenter randomized study is to demonstrate that BIOTRONIK Home
      Monitoring system reduces office follow-up visits without compromising patient safety.

      Patients will be randomized into HM follow-up only (Group 1) or HM &amp; in-office follow-up
      (Group 2) and will be followed-up for 27 months.

    <description>Patients assigned to HM Group(HM follow-up ONLY) will have Home Monitoring programmed ON. They will be seen in the office for device interrogations at the 3-month follow-up, and at 27 month follow-up. In the meanwhile the device status will be evaluated using HM only for the 9, 15 and 21 month scheduled follow-up. Patients will visit the hospital for device interrogation on 27 month final follow-up.</description>
