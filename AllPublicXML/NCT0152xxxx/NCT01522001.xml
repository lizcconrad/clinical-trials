    <textblock>
      Cardiac rehabilitation is an individual adapted multidisciplinary intervention for people
      suffering from Heart Disease. It involves;

        -  Dietary counseling,

        -  Exercise training,

        -  Psychosocial support,

        -  Physician

        -  smoking cessation

        -  Patient education

      The purpose is quick and complete recovery and to reduce the chance of recurrence.

      In Denmark people admitted with Acute Cardiac Disease is referred to a course of hospital
      based cardiac rehabilitation at discharge.

      The Danish Municipal Reform of 2007 changed the responsibility of rehabilitation from the
      Regions, who runs the hospitals, to the municipalities.

      Shared care is in this setting that elements of treatment are completed different places in
      Health Care.

      The aim of this study is:

        -  to establish a shared care model for Cardiac rehabilitation following admission with
           Acute Coronary Syndrome and

        -  to compare this model to the existing hospital based cardiac rehabilitation after
           admission with Acute Coronary Syndrome.

      Primary outcome is participation in cardiac rehabilitation.
