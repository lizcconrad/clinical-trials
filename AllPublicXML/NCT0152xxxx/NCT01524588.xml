  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is used in medically assisted procreation, to induce an
      ovarian stimulation in women. However, the FSH dose that has to be injected is quite hard to
      adjust, because an excess of exogenous hormone could lead to very severe complications for
      patient. This hormone acts on its cognate receptor, the FSHR, present on the granulosa cells
      surface, and which regulation involve the intra-cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus domain.

      The investigators first aimed to research in the c-terminus part of the receptor the presence
      of allelic variants that could explain the variations of response to FSH stimulation.

      The investigators also would want to complete the data already known on a functionally
      determinant single nucleotide polymorphism on 680 position in the c-terminus part of the
      hFSHR.

      Then, the investigators would analyze the entire sequence of the hFSHR of patients presenting
      an unusual phenotype in response to FSH treatment, in order to detect a potential mutation
      involved in the receptor functionality.

      The results of this study could allow us to increase our knowledge on the hFSHR physiology
      and functionality, in order to adjust treatment to the genetic profile of patients.
