      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies genes in samples from younger patients with
      adrenocortical tumor.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To perform whole-genome sequencing, deep sequencing, micro RNA analysis, methylation
           status, copy number variation analysis, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
           analysis in pediatric adrenocortical tumors and compare those results to those of the
           same patient's normal cells.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor and blood samples are analyzed for whole-genome sequencing, deep
      sequencing, micro RNA , methylation status, copy variation, and single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms. Results are then compared with patients' normal cells.
