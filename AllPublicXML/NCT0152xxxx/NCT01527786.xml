  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depressed women suffer from functional impairment in their mood, thoughts,
      cognition and physical well being leading to poor motivation, bonding difficulties, decreased
      productivity, conflict and neglect. Moderate/ severe depression responds best to a
      combination of antidepressants and counseling. This study will estimate the proportion of
      women who return to functionality after treatment with Desvenlafaxine and examine the
      differential impact of change in depression and anxiety symptoms on functionality over twelve
      weeks. Depression and anxiety symptoms will be monitored through six mood questionnaires;
      functional recovery will be monitored through a simple self-report questionnaire at each
      visit.

      Women will be recruited through a tertiary level care program and advertisements in BC
      Children's &amp; Women's Hospital as well as St.Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, B.C., Canada. If
      deemed eligible for the study (meeting a diagnosis of postpartum depression with or without
      comorbid anxiety disorder) and the potential participant agrees to participate, consent will
      be signed. The participant will return on a bi-weekly basis for study visits, where mood and
      anxiety will be monitored, in addition to blood pressure and weight. Starting dose of
      Desvenlafaxine is 50mg, and this can be titrated to 100mg/per day if needed. Questionnaires
      will assess depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, panic disorder,
      obsessive-compulsive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), which measures global functional impairment, as well as the individual score on each subscale (work/school; social life; family life/home responsibilities). To provide estimates for further studies, the mean change in score will be estimated with 95% confidence limits as a measure of variability. In addition, the proportion of subjects showing a change of more than clinically important change of more than 5 points will be estimated.</description>
