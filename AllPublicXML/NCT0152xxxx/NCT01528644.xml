  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia affects around two billion people worldwide. Food fortification with
      iron is a realistic way to combat this problem. Water soluble forms of iron are considered to
      be more bioavailable than nonsoluble iron compounds. However, the former often cause sensory
      problems when added to foods, while the latter cause fewer problems but are not generally
      well absorbed and are therefore ineffective as fortificants. A potential strategy for
      overcoming this problem is the use of water soluble iron compounds protected by a water
      resistant barrier, which will prevent potential organoleptic changes within fortified foods
      and protect the iron (from oxidation) through the digestion process thus increasing its
      availability. The investigators will use alginate, in the form of alginate beads, as a
      protective barrier for soluble iron gluconate. It has been shown that alginates bind divalent
      and trivalent cations and therefore may be a useful vehicle for soluble iron compounds to
      fortify foods.

      The aim of this project is to measure the effect of alginate on iron absorption from ferrous
      gluconate and assess the potential modulating effect of calcium on iron absorption in the
      presence and absence of alginate.

      This study is a randomised, single blinded, cross-over trial with participants randomly
      allocated into two groups: A (n= 8 volunteers) and B (n=8 volunteers). The study will include
      a total of four arms.

      By administration of test meals #1 (iron in alginate beads) and #4 (iron in a capsule) the
      possible protective effect of alginate on iron absorption will be investigated. By
      administration of test meal #2 (iron in alginate beads + calcium capsule)and #3 (iron in a
      capsule + calcium in a capsule)the study will investigate whether alginates can bind calcium
      (a well-known iron inhibitor) in vivo, thus diminish the potential negative effect of calcium
      on iron absorption.

      Only half (8) of the volunteers will undergo treatments including calcium. Therefore group A
      will undergo all 4 tests, whereas group B will undergo 2 out of 4 tests.

      The four test meals will be administered a week apart following an overnight fast. On each
      occasion blood sampling will take place over a period of 6h with samples taken via a cannula
      at t=0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min. Serum samples will be
      analysed for iron content allowing calculation of iron absorption.

      The assumptions made for the power calculation to estimate the number of volunteers are that
      a difference of 2.5% in iron absorption in the presence and absence of alginate ( test meal
      #1 and test meal #4) will be nutritionally significant. A minimum of 12 volunteers would be
      required to complete the study to detect a difference of 2.5% at a significance level of 0.05
      for 80% power. A minimum of 8 volunteers would be required to detect a significant difference
      in iron absorption of 3.3% between a test meal containing 20mg of iron as iron gluconate with
      calcium and a test meal containing 20mg of iron as iron gluconate with calcium and alginate
      beads (test meals #2 and #3). This assumes a power of 80%, a level of significance of 0.05
      and standard deviation of differences (within pairs) of 2.8%

    <description>All experimental days will be exactly the same with the exception of the test meal administered to the volunteer. Volunteers will undergo a 10 hour overnight fast from 10:00pm, then they will be asked to attend the CRTU at approximately 8:00 am the following morning. A nurse will take and record the volunteer's blood pressure and if within the range an intravenous (i.v.) cannula will be inserted into a vein in one of the volunteer's arms. The cannula will remain in situ for six hours. After the first blood sample (t=0) will be taken, volunteers will consume one out of 4 test meals. After consumption further blood samples will be collected at: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min. Blood samples will subsequently be analysed for serum iron concentrations.</description>
