  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms of
      tremor, slowness of movement, and stiffness, leading to progressive disability and loss of
      independence. Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), including urinary incontinence (UI),
      urgency, and/or nocturia, are common non-motor symptoms that further diminish the already
      compromised quality of life for adults living with PD. Behavioral interventions for UI -
      including pelvic floor muscle exercise (PFME) therapy - have proven efficacy in randomized
      controlled trials and are free of side effects. Exercise-based behavioral therapy for UI
      requires individuals to learn a motor skill (PFME) and implement an adaptive behavioral
      strategy that incorporates the PFME to suppress urinary urgency and prevent UI.

      We will conduct a two-site, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of PFME-based
      behavioral therapy to treat urinary symptoms in adults with PD. After stratification by UI
      severity, PD severity, and gender, a group of 60 subjects (30 in each group) will be
      randomized to receive behavioral therapy or a behavioral control over 8 weeks in order to
      achieve a sample size of 50 individuals (25 in each group) who complete the study. A 6-month
      follow-up is planned in the treatment group.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. PD participants who are randomized to the exercise-based behavioral therapy group (Group
           A) will report a significant reduction in weekly frequency of UI episodes compared to PD
           participants in the behavioral control group (Group B). The primary outcome, frequency
           of UI, will be measured using a seven-day bladder diary.

        2. Compared to PD participants in Group B, the reduction in UI frequency in Group A will be
           clinically meaningful as measured by a corresponding improvement on questionnaires of
           satisfaction and quality of life as well as a decline in other urinary symptoms
           including urgency and nocturia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease determined by a board-certified neurologist
             with specialty training in movement disorders

          -  ≥ 4 weekly episodes of UI and at least one episode per week associated with feelings
             of urgency, where urgency is defined as the complaint of a sudden compelling desire to
             void which is difficult to defer

          -  Willingness to attend clinic visits

          -  Willingness to keep 7-day bladder diaries throughout the study period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant cognitive impairment, as indicated by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment
             (MoCA) score of &lt; 18.

          -  Inability to produce an interpretable 7-day bladder diary at baseline

          -  Previous intensive PFME training

          -  Clinically significant depression as measured by a Geriatric Depression Scale-Short

             125 mL in volume

          -  Severe uterine prolapse past the vaginal introitus

          -  Poorly controlled congestive heart failure or poorly controlled chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease on physical exam
