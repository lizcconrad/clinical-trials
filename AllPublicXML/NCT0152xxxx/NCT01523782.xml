    <textblock>
      There is not clinical validation that the benefits of L-asparaginase can offers during
      induction chemotherapy for elderly patients, where prevent toxicities is critical.This Phase
      IIa clinical trial propose to evaluate, specifically for elderly patients, the tolerated dose
      of GRASPA® in combination with a poly chemotherapy treatment which enables efficient
      L-asparagine depletion for a period at least equal to 7 days.
