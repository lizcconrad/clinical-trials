    <textblock>
      The main aims of this study are to determine whether: a) psoriasis patients with or without
      arthritis have more cardiovascular inflammation than healthy subjects and b)3 months of
      etanercept (enbrel) therapy (prescribed to psoriasis patients with or without arthritis by
      their treating clinicians) will decrease cardiovascular inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common disease characterized by skin lesions and systemic inflammation with or
      without arthritis. Patients with psoriasis have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease than
      healthy subjects, and this may be related in part to the inflammatory nature of their
      disease. This study is intended to help provide explanations for the increased cardiovascular
      disease risk in psoriasis and to assess whether this risk can be reduced by biologic
      anti-inflammatory therapies prescribed to resolve skin lesions and arthritis.
