  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 study of intravenous (IV)
      LY2495655 in participants with advanced cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of the following parts:

        1. Dose Escalation - Cohorts of at least 3 participants will be treated with increasing
           doses of LY2475655 until maximum tolerated dose (MTD) criteria are met in 1 of the 6
           dose levels, or the 6th cohort is completed without meeting maximum tolerated dose
           criteria.

        2. Dose Confirmation - Up to 10 more participants will be enrolled to the MTD dose level,
           or if it was not possible to define the MTD during dose escalation, all clinical and
           bioanalytical data will be reviewed to select the recommended Phase 2 dose and an up to
           10 additional participants will be enrolled to this dose level.

    <description>Administered intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks (14 days) for four (4) 14 day cycles. Participants receiving clinical benefit may continue to receive treatment until one or more of the discontinuation criteria are met.
Starting dose in Part 1 (dose escalation) will be 2 mg. The dose will be subsequently increased to 7 mg, 21 mg, 70 mg, 210 mg, and 700 mg. The dose administered in Part 2 (dose confirmation) will be determined from Part 1.</description>
