      The the aim of this study is to determine the benefits of Telehealth monitoring in the
      management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major burden on healthcare systems
      worldwide. The current management of patients with COPD includes well established
      interventions such as pulmonary rehabilitation and inhaled therapies which have demonstrated
      variable impact on reducing rates of exacerbation and improving health related quality of
      life.

      Telehealth is a home monitoring system used to record clinical observations and carry out
      question and answer sessions. It has been proposed that Telehealth medicine may offer an
      alternative strategy to the overall management of these patients.

    <description>The system is uploaded with personal information including: monitoring start time; clinical observations (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturations); and questions relating to symptoms. The patient is instructed on use and observed monitoring. The patient is monitored daily for a period of six months. The monitoring session lasts approximately 10 minutes during which the patient attaches a finger probe and blood pressure cuff and responds 'yes' or 'no' to the set questions. Daily data is transmitted via a phone line to a secure server to be downloaded and reviewed by a Telehealth nurse.If one or more of the clinical observations is outside normal limits the appropriate healthcare intervention is utilised.</description>
