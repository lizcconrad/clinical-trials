      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vinorelbine plus
      oxaliplatin in pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Triple-negative breast cancer is associated with less treatment choices and shorter overall
      survival. Both vinorebine and oxaliplatin are effective in metastatic breast cancer. The
      investigators designed this trial to evaluate the combination of these two drugs in
      pretreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer.
