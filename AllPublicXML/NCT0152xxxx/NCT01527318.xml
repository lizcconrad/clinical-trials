  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neutral Lipid Storage Disease With Myopath (NLSDM) is a disease caused by a defect in the
      PNPLA2 gene encoding ATGL. Patients with NLSDM accumulate triglycerides and exhibit muscle
      weakness, cardiac failure and hepatosteatosis. Most of these patients die at young age due to
      cardiac failure. Not much is known about the underlying mechanisms, though recently it was
      discovered that PPAR activation in ATGL-/- mice was impaired leading to decreased
      mitochondrial function, lipid accumulation and cardiac failure resulting in death at young
      age. Activation of PPARs, by treatment with fibrates rescued the phenotype and reduced
      mortality rates in these mice. These findings may have a major impact for patients with NLSDM
      if these results can be translated to humans. Therefore, the investigators would like to
      evaluate the beneficial effects of fibrate treatment on muscle mitochondrial and cardiac
      function in patients with NLSDM.

      Patients will be treated with fibrates during a period of 28 weeks. Baseline measurements
      will be performed prior to the study and after treatment. Cardiac and muscular lipid
      accumulation, cardiac function, mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity will be
      assessed during these baseline measurements.
