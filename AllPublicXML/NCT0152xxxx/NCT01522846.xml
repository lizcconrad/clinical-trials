  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heparinized solution has been used for maintenance of arterial catheter during perioperative
      period. Although the infused dose of heparin is very low, the investigators examine whether
      the heparin effect is remained or not in blood using rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)
      analysis.

    <description>INTEM is not an abbriviation. INTEM is one of the ROTEM test and it is an coagulation test name (such as prothrombin time test) using patient's whole blood. We put the blood sample of patinet into the machine, so the result comes out automatically. It will be checked twice at pre- and postopertive 30 minute and it'll be analyzed and compared.</description>
