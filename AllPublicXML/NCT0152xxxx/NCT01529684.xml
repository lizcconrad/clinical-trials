    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, in particular the routes of
      excretion and extent of metabolism of OSI-906 after a single oral dose of 14C-labeled
      OSI-906. Subjects with Advanced Solid Tumors may participate and then continue into the
      Optional Treatment Phase.

      This study includes two parts: Part A Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit
      on Day -1 and remain confined to the unit until post dosing discharge criteria are met up to
      a maximum of 10 days. On Day 1, subjects will receive a single oral dose of 14C-labeled
      OSI-906.

      Part B (optional) Once the subject has completed part A, the subject may elect to continue
      participation in Part B. Subjects will receive OSI-906 (non-radiolabeled) twice daily by
      mouth. Subjects will be seen for scheduled visits every 7 days for the first 36 days and then
      every 21 days.
