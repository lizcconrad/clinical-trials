  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5−10% of people with asthma do not respond to to standard therapy and are
      referred to as having difficult asthma. Evidence shows that this poor response is not always
      related to asthma severity and non−adherence to treatment is recognized as a common
      underlying problem, in 35% of these patients. Recognising non−adherence in the clinic is
      problematic as there is no straightforward objective test to identify it.

      Previous studies have demonstrated up-regulation of FKBP51 gene expression following
      treatment with steroids, making it a potential biomarker of steroid exposure. It is therefore
      also a potential biomarker of non-adherence to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. The
      investigators plan to assess the feasibility of distinguishing non-adherent subjects who are
      by omission steroid naïve from adherent subjects, steroid exposed subjects using FKBP51 gene
      expression in sputum and throat swabs.

      To do this the investigators will obtain throat swab and sputum samples from healthy
      volunteers, steroid naïve asthmatics and adherent asthmatics on high dose ICS to assess if
      FKBP51 gene expression is comparable in each group.

      The investigators will then compare the FKBP51 gene expression response to directly observed
      inhaled steroid therapy in steroid naïve, non-adherent and adherent asthmatics. This will
      identify if the response in gene expression distinguishes steroid exposed (adherent) from
      steroid naïve (non-adherent) patients.

      Identifying non-adherence will benefit patients by enabling appropriate tailored management
      for non-adherence to enhance treatment effectiveness. It will also identify patients with
      therapy resistant asthma who have an unmet need and may benefit from expensive novel
      therapies such as Omalizumab.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        This pilot study will investigate the following groups (n=10 per group):

          1. Healthy volunteers.

          2. Steroid naïve asthmatics.

          3. Refractory asthmatics adherent to high dose inhaled steroids.

          4. Non-adherent asthmatics.

        Inclusion Criteria

        For inclusion into this study all participants must:

          -  be 16 years old or older

          -  give written informed consent

        Healthy volunteers must:

          -  be in good general health as determined by past medical history and physical.

          -  have no other significant medical history and specifically no prior history of asthma
             or persistent respiratory symptoms.

          -  normal spirometry.

        Steroid naïve subjects

          -  have a diagnosis of asthma

          -  receiving treatment at Step 1 BTS/SIGN Guidelines i.e. no inhaled steroid

        Non-adherent subjects must

          -  have a diagnosis of asthma

          -  be non-adherent to ICS as determined by ICS prescription filling of &lt;/=50% in the
             previous 6 months

        Refractory asthmatic adherent subjects must:

          -  have a diagnosis of asthma receiving high dose ICS treatment (beclomethasone
             equivalent dose &gt; 1000 µg per day)

          -  be adherent to ICS as determined by ICS prescription filling &gt;75% in the previous 6
             months
