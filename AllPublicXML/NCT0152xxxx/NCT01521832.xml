             Female subjects of more than 51 years of age must be surgically sterile or
             post-menopausal (defined by a value of follicular stimulating hormone &gt;18 mIU/mL and
             no spontaneous menstruation for at least one year before the first dose),
             non-lactating and have a negative serum pregnancy test.

          -  Subjects must be in good health, as determined by a medical history, physical
             examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory evaluations Note:

             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, or who have a positive result to the
             test for HIV antibodies.

          -  Subjects who have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increases the risk of participating in the study, such as QTcF interval
             &gt;450 msec (male) or greater than 470msec (female), or with sinus rhythm with PR
             interval &lt;110 msec or &gt;240 msec, confirmed by a repeat ECG.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not participate in the study.
