  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been a very successful surgical intervention in the
      geriatric population. Numerous studies have reported good mid and long term results of THA in
      patients over the age of 60 years. With the reported high success rate of this surgical
      intervention, the THA surgery is being performed in younger patients who have significant
      joint disease.

      A clinical trial, using a randomized blinded design, was undertaken to compare the functional
      outcome of 1) alumina heads/alumina liners, and 2) alumina head/Crossfire polyethylene liners
      in patients 60 years of age or younger with non-inflammatory arthritis of the hip.

      Subjects were assessed preoperatively and at one and five years postoperatively. Ten-year
      follow-up is currently underway.

      The primary outcome measure is the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index. Secondary measures were the
      RAND-12, as well as measurement of complication and revision rates. The patient's demand on
      the implant as calculated by the patient's age, weight, health status and activity level was
      also measured.
