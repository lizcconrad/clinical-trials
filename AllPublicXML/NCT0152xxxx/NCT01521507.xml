  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the long-term treatment effectiveness for adult patients
      with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and evaporative dry eye by: 1) comparing the LipiFlow®
      System to a standardized daily warm compress and eyelid hygiene control therapy over a
      duration of 3 Months; and 2) evaluating the LipiFlow® alone and in combination with other MGD
      and dry eye treatments over a duration of up to 12 Months.

      This is a post-market, non-significant risk, prospective and multi-center clinical trial
      divided into two stages. The first stage from enrollment to 3 Months is an open-label,
      randomized controlled design to compare the effectiveness of a single LipiFlow® System
      treatment to a standardized daily warm compress and eyelid hygiene Control therapy with
      Crossover LipiFlow® treatment of the Control subjects at 3 Months. The second stage,
      occurring between 3 and 12 Months, is an observational design to evaluate the effectiveness
      of LipiFlow® alone and in combination with other MGD and dry eye treatments over a duration
      of up to 12 Months. Subjects are entered into the following subgroups based on the subject's
      self-assessment of the adequacy of symptom relief and protocol-defined criteria for
      additional treatment.

        1. One LipiFlow® Treatment: Subjects who receive only one LipiFlow® treatment.

        2. Two LipiFlow® Treatments: Subjects who receive a second LipiFlow® treatment.

        3. Combination Treatment: Subjects who receive one or two LipiFlow® treatments followed by
           other MGD or dry eye treatment, as prescribed by the physician.

    <measure>Stage 1 Mean Change in Total Meibomian Gland Score From Baseline to 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the meibomian glands, the secretion characteristics from 15 gland orifices along the lower eyelid were evaluated under a slit lamp biomicrosope using a handheld instrument, Meibomian Gland Evaluator, to apply gentle standardized pressure to the eyelid margin. Expressed secretion characteristics were graded on a scale of 3 (clear liquid secretion), 2 (cloudy liquid secretion), 1 (inspissated/toothpaste consistency), and 0 (no secretion). Total meibomian gland score was calculated based on the sum of the secretion grades for all 15 glands over a range from 0 to 45 with a higher score reflecting less meibomian gland dysfunction. To be eligible for the study, the Baseline total meibomian gland score must have been 12 or less in each eye. Change = 3 Month score - Baseline Score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Stage 1 Mean Change in Total OSDI Score From Baseline to 3 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Dry eye symptoms assessed using the OSDI questionnaire were sensitivity to light, grittiness, pain or soreness, blurred vision and poor vision. The questionnaire evaluated the frequency problems with the eyes limited performance in reading, driving at night, working with a computer or bank machine, and watching television. Also, the frequency that eyes felt uncomfortable was assessed in windy conditions, areas with low humidity, and air-conditioned areas. The frequency scale was 0 (none of the time), 1 (some of the time), 2 (half of the time), 3 (most of the time), and 4 (all of the time). The total OSDI score was calculated as the sum of frequency scores for all symptoms multiplied by 25 and divided by the number of questions answered with a range from 0 to 100. A lower total OSDI score represents less disability from dry eye symptoms. To be eligible for the study, the Baseline total OSDI score must have been 13 points or higher in each eye. Change=3 Months score-Baseline score.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Between February 19, 2012 and October 15, 2012, this study enrolled subjects with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and evaporative dry eye from nine ophthalmic practices in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 274 subjects were consented and 200 subjects were randomized. Of the 74 subjects who were not randomized, 52 subjects did not meet the study eligibility criteria and 22 subjects elected not to participate prior to randomization or had not yet attended the Baseline visit when study enrollment was completed.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Subjects received a single, 12-minute, in-office treatment of both eyes for MGD with the LipiFlow System after randomization in Stage 1 of study.
In Stage 2, subjects were entered into subgroups based on the subject's assessment of adequacy of symptom relief:
One LipiFlow Treatment - After subjects received one LipiFlow treatment at randomization, no other MGD or dry eye treatment was prescribed for the study duration.
Two LipiFlow Treatments - Subjects received a second LipiFlow treatment during Stage 2. No other MGD or dry eye treatment was prescribed for the study duration.
Combination Treatment - After subjects received one or two LipiFlow treatments, they received other MGD or dry eye treatment, as prescribed by the physician.</description>

        <title>Stage 1 Mean Change in Total Meibomian Gland Score From Baseline to 3 Months</title>
        <description>To assess the meibomian glands, the secretion characteristics from 15 gland orifices along the lower eyelid were evaluated under a slit lamp biomicrosope using a handheld instrument, Meibomian Gland Evaluator, to apply gentle standardized pressure to the eyelid margin. Expressed secretion characteristics were graded on a scale of 3 (clear liquid secretion), 2 (cloudy liquid secretion), 1 (inspissated/toothpaste consistency), and 0 (no secretion). Total meibomian gland score was calculated based on the sum of the secretion grades for all 15 glands over a range from 0 to 45 with a higher score reflecting less meibomian gland dysfunction.

          <description>To assess the meibomian glands, the secretion characteristics from 15 gland orifices along the lower eyelid were evaluated under a slit lamp biomicrosope using a handheld instrument, Meibomian Gland Evaluator, to apply gentle standardized pressure to the eyelid margin. Expressed secretion characteristics were graded on a scale of 3 (clear liquid secretion), 2 (cloudy liquid secretion), 1 (inspissated/toothpaste consistency), and 0 (no secretion). Total meibomian gland score was calculated based on the sum of the secretion grades for all 15 glands over a range from 0 to 45 with a higher score reflecting less meibomian gland dysfunction. To be eligible for the study, the Baseline total meibomian gland score must have been 12 or less in each eye. Change = 3 Month score - Baseline Score.</description>

        <description>Dry eye symptoms assessed using the OSDI questionnaire were sensitivity to light, grittiness, pain or soreness, blurred vision and poor vision. The questionnaire evaluated the frequency problems with the eyes limited performance in reading, driving at night, working with a computer or bank machine, and watching television. Also, the frequency that eyes felt uncomfortable was assessed in windy conditions, areas with low humidity, and air-conditioned areas. The frequency scale was 0 (none of the time), 1 (some of the time), 2 (half of the time), 3 (most of the time), and 4 (all of the time). The total OSDI score was calculated as the sum of frequency scores for all symptoms multiplied by 25 and divided by the number of questions answered with a range from 0 to 100. A lower total OSDI score represents less disability from dry eye symptoms. To be eligible for the study, the Baseline total OSDI score must have been 13 points or higher in each eye.

A lower total OSDI score represents less disability from dry eye symptoms. The total OSDI score at 12 Months was compared across subgroups, as defined below.</description>
          <population>Intent to Treat (All participants who received at least a partial LipiFlow treatment or Crossover LipiFlow treatment and had data available at 12 Months). The Two LipiFlow treatments subgroup was not analyzed because the sample size (n&lt;5) was too small for meaningful analysis.</population>
