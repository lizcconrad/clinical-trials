    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK) profiles of single and multiple ascending oral doses of TG-2349 in healthy East Asian and Caucasian volunteers.</measure>
    <time_frame>predose, and 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24,36,48,72,96 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Dose proportionality will be assessed by evaluating PK parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax. Parameters that are not dose dependent will be assessed by evaluating Tmax, t1/2, and λz. The linear relationship between the log-transformed PK parameter and the natural log of the dose will be tested using a linear lack-of-fit test. The dose-dependent parameters will not be dose normalized. Residual analysis will be used to assess the assumptions of normality and variance homogeneity for the statistical model.</description>

    <description>Vital signs, physical examinations, 12-lead ECG, safety laboratory parameter abnormalities, and other toxicities graded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0 will be examined to evaluate safety profiles of the study treatments.

    <time_frame>predose, and 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24,36,48,72,96 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics and graphs will be presented for the antiviral variables. Change from pre dose will be analyzed descriptively for each time point after study drug administration. Graphic displays of raw data and changes over time will be performed at each dosing level (plots of raw data of TG-2349 at each time point with mean and median).
The breakthrough is defined as a greater than or equal to 1 log10 increase in HCV RNA above nadir, or detectable HCV RNA, while on treatment, after an initial drop to a level of below the detection. The slope of the plasma viral RNA decrease during the first few days of treatment, any subsequent plasma viral RNA increase observed during and/or after dosing, and all breakthrough events should be recorded and summarized.</description>
