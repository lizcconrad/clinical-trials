  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines prospects of hypnotherapy in reducing agitation in patients after cardiac
      or spinal column surgery. A particular aim is to point out the effects on postoperative
      cognitive outcome. Additional blood and urine tests are conducted (concerning cardiac
      stratum).
