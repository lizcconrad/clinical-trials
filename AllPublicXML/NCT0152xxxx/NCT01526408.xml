    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of treatment with famciclovir in
      unilateral Meniere's Disease patients, specifically whether hearing can be improved. The
      investigators will determine the percentage of unilateral Meniere's Disease patients
      experiencing an absence of hearing fluctuation after 3 months of treatment with famciclovir
      as compared to the placebo arm.

             audiogram at Time 1 to Time 2 (less than one year apart) of greater than 15 dB.

          -  Less than 45 dB 4-frequency pure-tone average in the affected ear

          -  Tinnitus and/or aural fullness

          -  Willing to undergo the clinical trial procedures

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Known allergy to famciclovir or any of the ingredients in the formulation

          -  Taking oral steroids or receiving IT steroids at time of enrollment. If the subject
