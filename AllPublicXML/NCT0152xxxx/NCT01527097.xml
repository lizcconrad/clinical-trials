  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with psoriasis seem to have increased risk for developing atherosclerosis. This may
      be due to the fact that psoriasis and atherosclerosis are both caused by inflammation and
      involvement of cells of the immune system. Atherosclerosis is frequently treated by statins
      (class of cholesterol lowering drugs), which lower bad cholesterol levels and also reduce
      inflammation. Some new evidences also suggest that therapy with statins may improve psoriasis
      skin disease.

      The current study aims are to evaluate whether a strong statin named Atorvastatin can improve
      psoriatic skin disease and functioning of the arteries. The study also aims to evaluate if
      the activity of these two diseases are related to levels of common inflammatory biomarkers
      (substance in blood) and whether Atorvastatin can change their levels.

  <why_stopped>
    We strongly feel that the ability to recruit the required number of patients is very low and
    thus decided to stop the study.
