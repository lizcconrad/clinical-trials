        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of signed and dated, written informed consent prior to any study specific
             procedures.

          -  Male and female (nonchildbearing potential, nonlactating)healthy volunteers aged 18 to

             gastrointestinal, liver, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, metabolic,
             malignant, psychiatric, or major physical impairment), as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Any clinically significant illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4
             weeks of the first administration of IP.

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, hematology, or
             urinalysis results as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Significant orthostatic reaction at enrollment as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Abnormal vital signs, after 10 minutes supine rest as defined in protocol.
