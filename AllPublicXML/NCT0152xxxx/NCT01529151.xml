  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Western University of Health Sciences is seeking men and women to participate in a study on
      the effectiveness of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) and Vestibular Rehabilitation
      Therapy (VRT) in patients with vertigo. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy
      of OMT in the treatment of individuals with vertigo, alone and in combination with Vestibular
      Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT). Because of the health care costs associated with vertigo, the
      cost effectiveness of OMT and VRT will also be examined.

    <description>Direct action OMT procedures, including HVLA, involve the application of a force in the direction of restricted joint motion in order to resolve somatic dysfunction. Indirect techniques, including counterstrain, balanced ligamentous tension and myofascial release, entail applying a force away from the restrictive barrier of a joint or soft tissue structure.</description>
