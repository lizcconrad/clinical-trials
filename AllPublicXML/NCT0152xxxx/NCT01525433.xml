  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 400 Hispanic women will be recruited and randomized to one of three
      interventions:

        1. Control (no change);

        2. A low-intensity information program, consisting of a video approach educating women on
           the importance of cervical cancer screening;

        3. A higher intensity program consisting of the video plus a 'promotora' or lay-community
           health educator led intervention at the participant's home to encourage cervical cancer
           screening.

      The investigators will compare which intervention is most effective in encouraging Hispanic
      women to undergo cervical cancer screening (Pap test)

    <description>Evaluation of the patient navigator program as a method to improve adherence and reduce time to follow-up among study participants who receive an abnormal Pap test result. Time to follow-up will be compared to a similar population of patients who were not part of the study who also receive a diagnosis of an abnormal Pap test.</description>
