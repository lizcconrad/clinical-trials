  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be comprised of 2 parts, Part A and Part B, both in healthy male
      participants.

      Part A of the study will investigate the safety of intravenous (IV) ketamine administration
      after single oral doses of LY2979165 (capsules) or LY2140023 (tablets). Part A will be
      completed before starting Part B.

      Part B of this study will investigate whether different dose levels of LY2979165 or
      LY2140023, when administered before ketamine, result in changes to the images on a brain scan
      seen with ketamine alone. Brain imaging is currently used for a number of reasons including
      understanding where in the brain medicines have their effects. Ketamine is an anesthetic used
      in this study to activate particular regions of the brain.

      The single oral doses of LY2979165 to be used in both parts of the study are 20 and 60 mg
      with matching dummy drug (placebo) for each dose.

      The doses for LY2140023 are 10, 40, and 160 mg with matching placebo for each dose.

      Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study and follow up 7-14 days
      after the last dose of study drug. The study will last up to 8-weeks for an individual
      participant.
