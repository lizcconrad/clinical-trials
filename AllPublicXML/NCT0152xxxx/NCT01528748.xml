      This study examines the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of
      Psychotherapy (CBASP) in reducing both alcohol consumption and depressive symptoms in adults
      who are chronically depressed and alcohol dependent. Participants will receive a 20-session
      course of CBASP psychotherapy over a period of 21 weeks and will be assessed for severity of
      pretreatment psychological abuse and trauma as well as pre and posttreatment interpersonal
      functioning. Two primary hypotheses are to be tested: 1) demonstrate that CBASP is effective
      in reducing depressive symptoms (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-24 ratings) and alcohol
      consumption (drinks per drinking day) in this chronically depressed alcohol dependent cohort
      when posttreatment ratings are compared to pretreatment levels; and 2) demonstrate that
      acquisition of feeling safe with the therapist and acquisition of the ability to perceive the
      interpersonal consequences of one's behavior will significantly increase from pre to
      posttreatment levels and will be associated with reductions in drinking and depressive
      symptoms.

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) is a behavioral intervention that addresses the unique behavioral characteristics of chronically depressed individuals, most of which are highly relevant for alcoholics as well. CBASP has a structured, individualized, and collaborative (patient and clinician) design. The intervention emphasizes teaching effective coping strategies and employing motivational, cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal techniques. Individual therapy (1 hour) sessions occur on a weekly basis for a total of 20 sessions over a period of 21 weeks.</description>
