  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous sedation was used for dealing with transient hypertension, so-called white-coat
      hypertension, before dental treatment. Midazolam used as a sedative also has antianxiety
      effect, and the mechanism is guessed that it minimizes patients' stress, resulting in the
      stability of blood pressure. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to
      evaluate the effect of low dose of midazolam on blood pressure and anxiety scale in
      white-coat hypertensive dental patients.

    <description>Investigators select subject from patients for whom the doctor has ordered intravenous sedation. Inclusion criteria is SBP&gt;=140mmHg or DBP&gt;=90mmHg measuring when the patient sits on dental chair and has settled down for 5 minutes. Informed consent is obtained from the patient.
Patient conducts Japanese version of STAI and VAS about anxiety to dental treatment.
Investigators take venous line on the upper limb and inject the drug (midazolam at dose of 0.02mg/kg) intravenously. Investigators measure blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation every 2 minutes until 10 minutes after drug administration.
10 minutes later, patient conducts Japanese version of STAI and VAS about anxiety to dental procedure again.
Investigators inject an additional sedative agent and the dental treatment is started.</description>
