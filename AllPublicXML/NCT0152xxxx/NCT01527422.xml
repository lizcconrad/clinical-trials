  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We now propose to investigate the combination of CHOP-Rituxan plus PEG-Filgrastim
      (PEG-filgrastim) and GM-CSF. PEG-Filgrastim would be given in order to allow us to administer
      the chemotherapy courses every 2 weeks with the practical advantage of requiring only one
      dose of PEG-filgrastim instead of daily doses of G-CSF.

      1.1 Primary Objective:

        1. To identify the ideal dose of the combination of CHOP-R with PEG-Filgrastim (Neulasta)
           using first a fixed dose of Neulasta and an escalating dose of GM-CSF (Leukine) up to
           250 mcg. When that dose is reached, if possible, the dose of Neulasta will be increased
           stepwise. CHOP-R will be delivered every 14 days at a fixed standard dose with dose
           adjustments of PEG-Filgrastim and GM-CSF upwards and downwards according to nadir or
           zenith blood counts.

           1.2 Secondary Objective:

        2. To generate preliminary pilot data as to the effectiveness of the regimen in inducing
           very early remissions as measured by the CT-PET scan technique.

    <description>Rituximab will be administered on day 1 of courses 1-6 at 375 mg/m2 concurrently with CHOP-R.All patients will receive antiemetics priorchemotherapy.Courses will be repeated every 14 days.If blood counts don't allow re-treatment on day 14 the counts will be repeated at least twice per week until recovery allows re-treatment.The aim is to achieve a dose that will be as close as possible to 250 mcg and that will result in grade 0 or grade 1A or 1B toxicity at the most. The dose of PEG-Filgrastim will initially be fixed at 3 mg until dose level +3 is reached (which includes 250 mcg Leukine) at which time the dose of Neulasta will be escalated if necessary. All patients will receive Neulasta as a subcutaneous injection on the day 3.</description>
