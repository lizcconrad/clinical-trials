    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical equivalence of the test formulation
      of mometasone furoate anhydrous 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray (manufactured by Teva
      Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and distributed by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA) to the marketed
      formulation Nasonex速 (mometasone furoate monohydrate) nasal spray, 50 mcg/actuation
      (Schering) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis.

      In addition, the efficacy of both the test and reference nasal sprays will be compared to a
      placebo nasal spray and safety will be compared.

             in most states) the parent or legal guardian should sign the consent form and the
             child will be required to sign a patient &quot;assent&quot; form that will be written in such a
             way as to be understandable to a child.

          -  If female and of child-bearing potential, have a negative urine pregnancy test and is
             prepared to abstain from sexual intercourse or use a reliable method of contraception
             during the study. In order for hormonal birth control to be considered a reliable
             method the patient must have been on their regimen for at least 28 days.

          -  Documented positive allergic skin test, performed within the previous 12 months, to
             one or more of the allergens in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A minimum of two years of previous history of seasonal allergic rhinitis to the
             pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A score of at least 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) and a
             minimum score of at least 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; and a minimum score of at least 2
             for one of the remaining 3 symptoms. The patient must meet these minimum requirements
             prior to being entered into the placebo lead-in period and also prior to being
             enrolled in the randomized, active treatment period of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Under 12 years of age.

          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or likely to become pregnant during the study.

          -  Negative or lack of documented skin allergen test (performed within the previous 12
             months) to at least one of the allergens in season at the time the study is being

          -  Patients who suffer from chronic signs and symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis
             (PAR) should be excluded from the study unless the Investigator assesses that the

             Rhinitis (SAR) rather than chronic PAR.

          -  Patients who suffer only from perennial allergic rhinitis of seasonal allergic
             rhinitis to a different allergen than that in season at the time the study in
             conducted.

          -  Previous history of less that 2 years of seasonal allergic rhinitis to the
             pollen/allergen in season at the time the study is being conducted.

          -  A total score of less than 6 on the reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) or a
             score less than 2 for &quot;nasal congestion&quot; or a score less than 2 for all 3 remaining
             symptoms. Any patient who meets the minimum rTNSS requirements at the start of the
             placebo lead-in period but no longer meets the requirements prior to the randomized
             active treatment period of the study cannot continue in the active treatment period.

          -  Significant history of current evidence of chronic infectious disease, system
             disorder, organ disorder, or other medical condition that in the Investigator's
             opinion would place the study patient at undue risk by participating or could
             jeopardize the integrity of the study evaluations.

          -  Receipt of any drug as part of a research study within 30 days prior to the first
