  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent works has emphasized that the mechanism of action of paracetamol analgesic depend on
      its metabolism in the body, since a breakdown product of paracetamol, the AM404 is now
      considered the analgesic metabolite of paracetamol suggesting as paracetamol may be a
      pro-drug.

      Indeed, it has been shown that paracetamol may have a deleterious effect, especially in
      vulnerable populations (hepatic insufficiency, elderly). First results showed a very
      significant decrease in sulfatation and gluthatione and increased phase 1 metabolism of
      acetaminophen, which involves enzymes such as cytochrome P450.

      Multifactorial causes, combining nutrition (depletion of sulfur amino acids), increased
      detoxification of toxic metabolites of paracetamol, stress or trauma are discussed to explain
      the results.

      Clinical studies showed a great variability of pain assessment by patients and variability in
      the metabolic response of paracetamol. Genetic factors probably play a role remains largely
      unknown.

      The review of the literature on genetic polymorphism shows the involvement of a number of
      enzymes that are well known, predominantly on the metabolism of acetaminophen liver, but
      without connection with its analgesic effect. This is a critical missing link in the
      understanding of the analgesic effect of paracetamol.

      Randomized, single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over in 100 healthy
      volunteers meeting the inclusion criteria and receiving 2g of paracetamol orally or placebo
      on two study periods separated by one week.

      The evaluation criterion is the difference in areas under the curve of pain thresholds to
      thermal and mechanical stimulations test
