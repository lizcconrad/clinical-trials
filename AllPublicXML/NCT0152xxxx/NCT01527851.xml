      Introduction: Currently, bariatric surgery appears to be the most effective treatment to
      improve the health of morbidly obese population. However, the massive weight loss induced by
      this intervention can create excess loose skin in various parts of the body contributing to
      the feeling of failure in their desire to feel better in some patients. Several studies show
      that people are once again disappointed and dissatisfied with their body appearance due to
      the mass of unsightly loose skin that disrupts their quality of life. However, very few
      studies have focused on the barriers that this excess skin could create in everyday physical
      activity. The aim of the investigators pilot study is to assess the impact of excess skin on
      the practice of physical activity in women who underwent bariatric surgery and evaluate if
      there is a relationship between physical activity and the level and location of excess skin.
      Also, the investigators will explore, the benefits of plastic surgery in patients who had
      this intervention.

      Materials and methods: About twenty women who underwent bariatric surgery and a dozen who had
      subsequent plastic surgery will be included in this pilot study. Anthropometry, weight loss
      post bariatric and plastic surgery, motivational stage on the practice of physical activity,
      usual practice of physical activity, functional and physical ability, perceived benefits and
      barriers of physical activity, self-esteem and quality of life will be assessed. After
      analyzing the results, a group discussion will be established to further evaluate the impact
      of excess skin on the practice of physical activity. The evaluation will be identical for
      monitoring the effects of plastic surgery but the discussion group will also address the
      benefits and satisfaction related to plastic surgery.

      Expected results: Excess skin could be a barrier to physical activity by limiting the
      functional and physical capacity. Thus, plastic surgery could improve the practice of
      physical activity with a direct improvement of functional discomfort, the subjects'
      motivation to be physically active, perceived benefits and barriers to physical activity,
      self-esteem and quality of life.

      Issue project: This pilot project will generate data that will allow us, depending on the
      relevance of the results, to continue the investigators investigation with a larger cohort.
