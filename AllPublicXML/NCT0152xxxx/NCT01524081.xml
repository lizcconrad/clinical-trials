      Aim of prospective randomized a placebo controlled study is to prove that in case of acute
      surgical procedure due to appendicitis, ileus of small bowel and perforation of small bowel
      and stomach appropriately administered antibiotic prophylaxis is effective with lower
      incidence of infection in surgical site and comparable risk of development of other
      nosocomial infections versus group without antibiotic prophylaxis. Secondary aim is to
      determine risk of developing nosocomial infection in the above mentioned group of patients,
      identify group of patients which does not benefit from prophylaxis, and compile financial
      costs for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment of nosocomial infections and thus the
      background for the recommended procedure with regards that such prospective study does not
      exist in the Czech Republic.

      Introduction Infection related to surgical procedure was always considered the main cause of
      mortality end morbidity in surgical patients. ATB prophylaxis has become the breakthrough in
      surgical praxis in terms of prevention of surgical postoperative complications (Surgical Site
      Infection - SSI) and radical improvement of surgical results. ATB prophylaxis prior to
      intervention procedures presents however 1/3 of costs for medicinal products and it is also
      potentially hazardous. Even single use of antibiotic agent can be a cause for development of
      nosocomial infection with indispensable mortality and costly treatment. Several
      recommendation in worldwide literature have been presented during the last 10 years which
      concerned indications and route of administration of antibiotics prior to scheduled or acute
      surgical procedure; indications for acute procedures broaden and it increases the consumption
      of antibiotics. Excessive pre-hospital and hospital exposure to antibiotics is however
      related to development of microbial resistance which shows in higher incidence of nosocomial
      infections (health care - associated infection - HAI) - urinary infections, pneumonia,
      catheter infection and another diseases such as Clostridium colitis caused by highly virulent
      type. Moreover some studies suggest bad compliance in dosing and timing of antibiotic
      prophylaxis which causes only the negative effect of prophylaxis without positive affection
      of SSI. This knowledge and disagreement led us to elaboration of protocol for prospective
      randomized placebo controlled study which could be the base for correct surgical praxis in
      investigator's conditions.

      Aim of the project The aim of this prospective randomized placebo controlled study is to
      prove the positive effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of SSI in patients with
      comparable risk of developing other nosocomial infections in case of acute abdominal
      procedures for diagnosis such as appendicitis, ileus of small bowel and stomach or small
      bowel perforation and thus with exclusion of tertiary peritonitis. Secondary aim is to
      identify the group of patients in which risk of developing nosocomial infection exceeds
      benefit of ATB prophylaxis. Tertiary aim is to assess whether preoperative microbial
      screening has its significance for reduction of HAI. After comparing the financial cost of
      therapy (including SSI and HAI generally) it will be possible to submit background for
      proposal of recommended procedure for administration of antibiotic prophylaxis in the most
      common acute surgical procedures with regard to risk factors for genesis of nosocomial
      infections. Such prospective randomized placebo controlled study has not been conducted in
      the Czech Republic; further study with similar target group of patients (very common in
      surgical praxis) has not been published in world literature.

      Hypothesis Correctly administered antibiotic prophylaxis prior to acute abdominal procedures
      reduces frequency of SSI. It can increase the frequency of severe nosocomial infections in
      risk group of patients. rational use of antibiotic prophylaxis should however lead to
      reduction of incidence of nosocomial infections with clinical and socioeconomic impacts
      including prevention of feared severe infections associated with health care (HAI).

      Methodology

      Method is aimed at:

        1. Assessing the effect of risks to development of nosocomial infections on behalf of
           patient (ASA, morbidity, relevance of the actual disease, microbial screening targeted
           on community infection, BMI, previous hospitalization in health care facility).

        2. Assessing perioperative influence on the genesis of nosocomial infections (correct
           administration of ATB prophylaxis- protocol control, perioperative influences - blood
           loss, body temperature, extend of inflammation, SIRS sings, duration of surgery, ICU
           stay, microbial profile, analgesia, physiotherapy, complications assessment).

        3. Assessing the influence of ATB if those are correctly administered on the genesis of SSI
           in acute procedures (length of hospitalization, length of treatment and complications).

        4. Long term and socioeconomic impacts of SSI (60 days follow up, life quality assessment),
           standard proposal. After completion of patient monitoring the analysis of cost for
           hospitalization including medication, surgery and postoperative outpatient control will
           be conducted using the hospital information system.

      Appropriate patients to be enrolled in the study are all patients with following diagnosis
      operated at the site: Acute appendicitis (classical or laparoscopy appendectomy), ileus of
      the small bowel (adhesiolysis, enterotomy with suction or resection of small bowel),
      perforated stomach or duodenal ulcer (classical excision of the ulcer and suture of the GIT
      wall), i.e. patients without stercoral peritonitis. Patient will be definitely included if
      they signed the preoperative informed consent form which they were able to understand well
      and whose diagnosis was confirmed during surgery. Patients will be excluded if they are
      younger than 18 years of age, pregnant females, and patients with known allergy to
      administered ATB and also if their mental state does not allow appropriate instruction and
      signing of the informed consent and further patients who used ATB in the course of last 2
      weeks.

      Preoperative care, actual surgical procedure and subsequent postoperative care are not the
      direct subject of study and will be conducted according to so far known procedures.

      Patient will be administered therapeutic agent (antibiotic) or placebo in form of intravenous
      infusion 60 minutes prior the surgical procedure due to suspicion of the above mentioned
      diagnosis. If the surgery lasts for more than 3 hours, the infusion will be repeated. After
      analysis of the most common pathogens in individual clinical diagnosis, microbiologist chose
      following preparations: Acute appendicitis - Cefuroxim (Zinacef 1.5 g) + Ornidazol (Avrazor
      1g), perforated ulcer - Aminopenicillin + inhibitor (Amoksiklav 2.4 g) + Fluconazole 800mg
      i.v., ileus of small bowel - Cefuroxim (Zinacef 1.5 g) + Metronidazol (Avrazor 1g). Surgeon
      will confirm the definite diagnosis during surgery which will confirm the definite inclusion
      in the study. Surgeon will not be present dilution or administration of the agent. Nobody
      from patient's attending study personnel will not be able to distinguish whether the patient
      was administered antibiotic or saline solution. The prophylaxis will be extended for 24 hours
      in common half-dosage according to publication sources.

      Randomization will be conducted using generator of random numbers. This sequence will be
      incorporated in simple digital patient database internet access to which will be password
      protected. One educated ICU nurse will enter only basic patientsÂ´ data and system itself will
      determine whether to prepare placebo or diluted antibiotic. Since that moment this
      information will be confidential and software will be accessible only for entering other
      monitored parameters. Dividing into individual groups will be conducted in interim controls
      after six months intervals and final division after completion of study. Totally there will
      be 2 major groups and 6 subgroups and those 3 subgroups according to individual diagnosis
      each one with 1 control group. If severe complication (allergy reaction) occurs, the
      principle investigator can uncover the blinding using specific password; system entry will
      automatically mean exclusion of the patient from study.

      Patients will be discharge from the hospital based on criteria (agreement of the patient,
      without signs of severe infection (SIRS), sufficient oral intake, sufficient analgesia with
      oral analgesics, would treatable in the outpatient department); patient will be treated as
      outpatients in case of complications; patients will be questioned on the phone in case of
      uncomplicated course and they will be ask to fill out life quality questionnaire (SF36) on
      the day 30 and 60.

      Demographic data on included patient and monitored data will be recorded into special cards
      and transmitted in the specifically created software to further processing.

      Investigators assume to include total of 500 patients during 3 years.

      Time schedule:

        1. year of the project: creation of the randomization program, personnel education,
           software creation, inclusion of 130 patients with appendicitis diagnosis, 18 patients
           with ileus of small bowel and 35 patients with perforation of ulcerous disease. Data
           processing. Results will be evaluated at the end of the year.

        2. year of the project: Inclusion of 130 patients with appendicitis diagnosis, 18 patients
           with ileus of small bowel and 35 patients with perforation of ulcerous disease. Data
           analysis will be performed and subgroup analysis and partial results will be processed
           and presented.

        3. year of the project: Inclusion of 90 patients with appendicitis diagnosis, 14 patients
           with ileus of small bowel and 30 patients with perforation of ulcerous disease. Follow
           up termination. Definite data collection, analysis, results evaluation including
           financial analysis. Standard proposal. Presentation in national and international
           forums, publications.

      Principle investigator will apply the created protocol and will continuously control its
      compliance including schedule, will process interim data, will evaluate data compliance with
      literature and will prepare their presentation and publication and will process final
      results. 2nd co-worker is guarantees the microbiological part of the project; 3rd and 4th
      co-workers will collect rather large amount of data and will enter them in created system.
      5th and 6th co-workers will control including appropriate patients in study (it means acute
      procedure), % of included patients out of number of suitable patients is an important
      criterion for significance of gathered data. They also cooperate in presentation data
      processing. 7th co-worker controls correctness of data collection. 5 specifically educated
      independent nurses who do not attend the patient (24 hour service) will prepare infusions for
      patients according to acquired randomization data - placebo or monitored group.
      Administrative worker will select data from the information system and patientsÂ´ files, file
      and selects study cards and supervises their correct completion.

      Means of data collection Data collection will be conducted in terms of preoperative
      examination: Demographic data (age, diagnosis, co-morbidity expressed by score - ASA, BMI,
      blood count, CRP), microbiology samples for detection of influence of community pathogens,
      especially presence of multiresistant pathogens - Clostridium difficile will be sought.

      In course of surgery: evaluation of perioperative finding, SSI risk 0-3 point; contamination
      scoring I-IV, body temperature monitoring (BT), blood loss (including weighing of screens),
      length of surgery.

      In postoperative period will be recorded: number of transfusion preparations, number of days
      on UPV, days at ICU, oral intake, physiotherapy, invasive inlets (peripheral venous catheter,
      permanent urinary catheter, nasogastric tube, drains) and quality of analgesia (Visual Analog
      Scale - VAS).

      On discharge: samples collection for microbiological examination, record of SSI incidence and
      other HAI defined according to criteria of National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN),
      completion of assessment of life quality questionnaire (SF36).

      After discharge: complications will be recorded till day 30 and 60 (SSI and HAI), life
      quality assessment. After completion of patient monitoring the analysis of cost for
      hospitalization including medication, surgery and postoperative outpatient control will be
      conducted using the hospital information system.

      Statistics:

      Morbidity which ranges from 15 to 20%, investigators consider 10% as clinically significant
      reduction. Minimal extent of each collection is 118 when considering 5% level of significance
      for single sided test and test power 70%; minimal extent of each collection for portion of
      nosocomial infection 6-10% is 234 in case of clinically significant decrease by 5%. Estimates
      of numbers required for detection of clinical difference of two days (standard deviation
      estimate 2.6 for appendicitis respectively 3.2 for perforation and 2.3 for ileus of small
      bowel) lead to values 36, 47 a 25 people in each group. Total number for each set is 250
      people and it fulfills the above mention criteria and ranges 175, 50 and 25 in each subgroup
      are sufficient. Group homogeneity will be compared based on descriptive statistical methods;
      risk factors will be evaluated using regression analysis and multivariant analysis. When
      comparing basic factors p&lt;0.05 will be considered as clinically significant in case of above
      given test power.

      Patient informed consent (short version, complete version was approved by ethics committee
      and is enclosed in appendix): Study description: Each surgical procedure has its own risk so
      called postoperative infectious complications. One possibility how to prevent those
      complications is the preventive administration of antibiotics just prior the procedure - so
      called antibiotic (ATB) prophylaxis. There is no clear evidence for positive effect of ATB
      prophylactic use in some acute surgical procedures. On the other hand introduction of ATB
      prophylaxis has its complications. Aim of study: Aim of the study is the recommendation
      whether in given cases administration of ATB prophylaxis has positive effect on reduction of
      incidence of postoperative infectious complications and whether this benefit is higher than
      risks related to ATB administration. Inclusion in study and conductance: Single inclusion is
      only based on the decision of patient (approximately 500 patients). Study participation will
      be offered to patients who will be operated on due to acute appendicitis, perforated stomach
      or duodenal ulcer or due to ileus of small bowel. Pregnant and lactating females are excluded
      from the study. After patient's consent with study participation the intravenous preparation
      will be administered which contains active substance (antibiotic) or placebo (only saline
      solution). Both administered substances are registered preparations administered for given
      purpose in general praxis. The chance of application of either active preparation and or
      placebo is 50:50. Patient will be telephonically inquired about concrete postoperative
      complications on day 30 and 60 after surgery. If there is suspicion on complication, patient
      will be examined and treated using standard procedure. He will be further asked for
      completion of questionnaire about life quality. Health risks: This study is not related to
      practically any excessive risk. ATB and placebo administration does not in any way influence
      the surgical procedure or postoperative care. Non-invasive sample collection for cultivation
      (urine collection, sputum collection -secretion from respiratory tract mucosa, smear from
      throat and stool). Compensation for bodily harm: If patient obliges to study physician's
      instructions and her/his team and health damage of patient occurs as a result of
      administration of any preparation, the study sponsor will cover all cost for treatment of
      this damage which is not covered by patient's health insurance. Patient's declaration: I,
      undersigned, agree with my participation in study. I am older than 18 years of age. I was
      informed in detail about the aim of study, its procedures and what it is expected from me.
      Study physician explained me the expected benefits and possible health risks. I acknowledge
      that conducted study is an investigation activity. Study is randomized and therefore I
      acknowledge possibility of random assignment into individual groups which differ in therapy.
      I fully understood and I have the opportunity to ask additional questions which were
      satisfactory answered to me. I informed study conducting physician about all my diseases and
      medications which I have been taking over the last 28 days and also about medication which I
      currently take. I declare that I do know that I am pregnant at time of inclusion in the
      study. I understood that I can discontinue or withdraw my participation in the study at any
      time without affecting course of my further treatment. My personal data will be kept in full
      confidentiality after study enrollment according to applicable laws in the Czech Republic.
      Based on my given consent my original medical information could be accessed to authorized
      acquired data by sponsor representatives, independent ethics committees and international or
      local competent authorities (The State Institute for Drug Control in the Czech Republic).
      Confidentiality protection of personal data is guaranteed for those cases. There will not be
      any cost to me for my participation in study and concomitantly study enrollment is not
      related to any financial reward. I understood that my name will never be present in reports
      about this study. (date, name, signature) Cooperation Working site of co-worker participates
      in postgraduate education; co-worker is recognized surgical expert and therefore he is
      guarantee for correct study conductance and results applications in praxis; the cooperation
      will be confirmed by agreement.

      Discussion Investigator's working site will conduct internal retrospective study dealing with
      SSI in patients with appendicitis and stomach ulcer perforation. 180-200 acute appendectomies
      will be performed every year with SSI frequency 2.5 - 18.5% according to contamination. Group
      of patient with stomach ulcer perforation will be evaluated similarly (n=42) with SSI 14.3%,
      total morbidity 35% and mortality 11.9%. All of those data correlate with results from the
      world literature however it is possible that after retrospective assessment correct
      monitoring of ATB prophylaxis (40% compliance) and patient stratification will reduce the
      frequency of complications.

      Information Working site of designer performs hundreds of the above given operations which a
      presumption for completion of the study aims. Especially young surgeon will participate in
      this study who will manage methodology of hospital care as well as surgery under supervision
      of experienced physician and will educated for patientsÂ´ monitoring. Statistical evaluation
      will be performed by professional statistician. Principle investigator has numerous
      experiences with clinical studies and she/she published his/her results in journals. Other
      specific equipment is not necessary for study procedure.

      Conclusion Proposed prospective randomized double blinded study will provide clear results
      assessing effect of administration of ATB prophylaxis on the incidence of SSI and other HAI
      in case of the most common acutely performed surgical procedures. Risk factor analysis and
      costs for treatment will aid to determine group of patients who will benefit from prophylaxis
      and vice versa.

      Expected results and significance of the project Project results will be used as background
      for establishing recommended procedure of antibiotic prophylaxis administration in surgery.
      Standardized protocol will be introduced for patients monitoring including monitorzation of
      nosocomial infections which is can be applied in general surgical praxis. Simple universal
      software will be created in terms of study which manages patient database and thus enables
      rapid concurrent assessment of health care quality. Respective reduction of nosocomial
      infections frequency should result in significant economic benefit for surgical praxis. With
      regard that similar complex prospective study has not been published in national and
      international magazines, publication in impact journal; socioeconomic analysis will be
      published especially in national medical journals so it would be easily accessible.

      Project should aid the prevention of nosocomial infections (HAI) and reduction of their
      genesis and thus to increase surgical care, shorten hospitalization and should have impact on
      the whole society.
