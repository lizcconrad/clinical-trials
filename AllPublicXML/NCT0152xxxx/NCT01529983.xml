      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of intense focused ultrasound
      and carbon dioxide-fractionated laser for treatment of periorbital wrinkles.

      This is a prospective randomized comparison study comparing the efficacy of micro-focused
      ultrasound versus fractionated carbon dioxide laser for treatment of periorbital wrinkles.
      Subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. The treated
      sites are both lower eyelids and lateral orbits. Each side will be randomized to receive
      1550nm-fractionated laser treatment on one side and the contralateral side will receive
      micro-focused ultrasound treatment every 6-8 weeks for a total of 2 treatments.

    <description>Fractional photothermolysis (FP) for treatment of photo- damaged skin is an FDA-approved method for treating facial rhytids. Fractionated treatment with 1550-nm laser is a safe, nonsurgical method for improvement of periorbital rhytides, photodamage, and scarring</description>

    <arm_group_label>High-intensity focused ultrasound</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFUS) is an FDA-approved method for periorbital treatment and nonablative tissue tightening. Ultrasound waves induce a vibration in the tissue, generating heat and increasing the tissue temperature within a focal area. The tissue changes depend on amount of heat and exposure duration. These findings are similar to the thermally induced changes within the skin after CO2 laser fractional ablative treatments.</description>
