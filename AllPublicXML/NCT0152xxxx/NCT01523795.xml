  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether playing motion-controlled video games
      produces low caloric intake and higher caloric expenditure than watching TV or playing
      traditional video games.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in behaviors and emotions during TV
      watching and video game playing. Participants will be randomized to either watch TV, play
      traditional button-based video games, or play motion-based video games for one hour while
      palatable snack foods and sugar-sweetened beverages are provided within easy reaching
      distance. Both energy intake as well as energy expenditure during a one-hour period will be
      measured. All three conditions will be optimized to resemble typical in-home conditions as
      much as possible.

      An additional goal of this study is to provide insight into the possible pathways by which TV
      and video games differentially affect intake and expenditure. Distraction from the real world
      (also called presence or engagement) will be analyzed to determine if a) these variables
      differ across groups and b) if these variables explain differences in energy intake and/or
      expenditure. The TV group will watch TV shows using Netflix streaming service, which will
      allow them to choose from a variety of popular shows without viewing commercials. As the
      investigators are primarily interested in satiety and hand occupation effects, the lack of
      commercials will allow us to eliminate food advertisements as a causal factor.

      Finally, the third major goal of the study is to investigate how young adults choose
      screen-based media. In the two video game arms, participants will be allowed to choose to
      play any of 10 provided games, and in the TV group, participants will be able to choose from
      hundreds of options. Choices of game/program, time spent on each game/program, and
      psychological reactions to each game will be measured and analyzed.
