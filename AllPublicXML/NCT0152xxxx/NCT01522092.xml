  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depression are common in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD). Frequently exacerbation's of breathlessness are associated with panic/fear
      and indeed this may be the main cause for the for hospital admission. Patients prone to a
      tendency to experience and communicate somatic distress in response to psychosocial stress
      and to seek medical help for it are top of the &quot;frequent flyer&quot; league, costing the health
      care economy dearly. This is a particular problem in Hull with the high levels of smoking and
      urban deprivation combining to place the city at the bottom of the Department of Health COPD
      league tables.

      Our hypothesis is that an effective treatment for anxiety will reduce the number of episodes
      of hospital admission by reducing the panic/fear element of mild COPD exacerbation's thus
      allowing the patient time to access the existing community based support services.
