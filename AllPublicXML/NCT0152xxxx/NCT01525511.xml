  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The observed changes of P. falciparum sensitivity to artemisinin leads to the intensification
      of early detection as well as treatment monitoring in malaria infection. It is widely
      accepted that the development of resistance can be delayed by the use of combination therapy,
      especially artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs). The resistance problem is
      considered extremely serious and as the consequence WHO has recommended that all monotherapy
      for malaria should be stopped Current WHO guideline recommends the drug combination regimens
      using ACT with effective partner medicines to decrease the risk of development or spreading
      of artemisinin resistance.

      Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP); the fixed-dose combination of Dihydroartemisinin
      (DHA) and Piperaquine phosphate (PQP) is now one of the recommended drugs by WHO as the oral
      treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum. DHA-PQP composes of both blood schizonticidal
      drugs, with different mechanism of action and different half-life to improve the therapeutic
      efficacy and to prevent the development of drug resistance to the individual drug. Moreover,
      it is beneficial for the mutual protection against resistance and long lasting protection
      against new infection, due to long half-life of PQP.

      Primaquine is an effective gametocytocidal for P. falciparum transmission prevention and as
      tissue killing for the radical cure in Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale infection. It
      will be given only in the presence of other antimalarials, so it is necessary that the data
      of the potential drugs interaction of primaquine and DHA-PQP should be characterized. It is
      inevitable that in the near future, Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) and primaquine
      combination treatment becomes necessary. These drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450
      enzyme which potentially causes pharmacokinetic alteration, resulting in clinically
      significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or
      therapeutic failures because of the suboptimal exposure of the parasite.

      This study is planned to evaluate potential pharmacokinetic interaction of orally
      administered primaquine (PQ) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQP) in healthy adult
      subjects. The results of these interaction studies are important in order to provide clinical
      guidance for the optimum combination of primaquine and DHA-PQP treatment regimens in malaria
      infections.

             Where age is in years, weight (wt) is in kg, and serum creatinine (Scr) is in units of

             the drug half-life (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication
             until the completion of the follow-up procedure, unless in the opinion of
             investigator, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or

             contraindicates participation in the trial. In addition, if heparin is used during
             pharmacokinetic sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

         12. Lack of suitability for participation in this study, including but not limited to,
             unstable medical conditions, systemic disease manifested by tendency to
             granulocytopenia e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus that in the opinion
             of the investigator would compromise their participation in the trial.

         13. AST or ALT &gt;1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN)

         14. Subjects with history of renal disease, hepatic disease, and/or cholecystectomy
