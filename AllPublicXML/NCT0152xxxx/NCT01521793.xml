      The purpose of this study is:

        -  To evaluate the safety of up to 3 additional courses of oral QLT091001 administered once
           daily for 7 days in subjects treated previously with a single 7-day course of QLT091001
           in Study RET IRD 01

        -  To evaluate whether up to 3 additional courses of oral QLT091001 administered once daily
           for 7 days can maintain or improve visual function.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with LCA or RP due to RPE65 or LRAT deficiency who received a 7-day treatment
             course of QLT091001 and completed the Day 30 visit in Study RET IRD 01

          -  Subjects who meet any one of the following criteria at least 1 month after start of
             the 7-day treatment course in Study RET IRD 01:

               -  no increase in GVF (in at least 1 eye): Follow-up GVF increased ≤20% from
                  baseline or

               -  decrease in GVF (in at least 1 eye): Follow-up GVF decreased below the highest
                  previous response by ˃20% or

               -  Considered a reasonable candidate for retreatment, based on the Investigator's
                  discretion, in consultation with the independent DSMB and the Sponsor, based on
                  regression or lack of response in other parameters of visual function (e.g.,
                  subjective reports of changes in color vision or adaptation to low light) but who
                  do not meet other (GVF) criteria for study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any clinically important abnormal physical finding at Screening.

          -  Subjects who have taken any prescription or investigational oral retinoid medication
             (e.g., Accutane,® Soriatane®) within 6 months of Day 0 and subjects who did not
             tolerate their previous oral retinoid medication will be excluded regardless of the
             time of last exposure.

          -  Subjects with liver failure, uncontrolled thyroid disease, hypersensitivity to
             retinoids, or hypervitaminosis A

          -  Subjects who have taken any supplements containing ≥10,000 IU vitamin A within 60 days
             of screening
