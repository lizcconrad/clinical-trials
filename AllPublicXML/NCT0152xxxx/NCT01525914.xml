  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: That, in men on surveillance for favorable risk prostate cancer treated with
      dutasteride, prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics is of value in identifying those men
      who harbor occult high grade prostate cancer.

      The study will determine the prevalence of a secondary rise in PSA &gt; 0.5 ng/ml and the PSA
      doubling time in subjects on surveillance being treated with dutasteride.

      This analysis is a subset of the data associated with the active surveillance cohort at
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. Approximately 150 subjects within the cohort have received
      dutasteride therapy from 6 months to 3 years. All subjects have had serial PSAs at regular
      intervals between 3 to 6 months, and all have had a biopsy performed within 1 to 3 years of
      initiating dutasteride. The prevalence of a secondary rise in PSA &gt; 0.5ng/ml will be
      calculated with the impact of dutasteride therapy on the PSA doubling time. This information
      will be correlated with baseline PSA value, prostate volume, extent of disease on initial
      biopsy and baseline PSA kinetics. PSA kinetics will be also correlated with Gleason score
      upgrading on repeat biopsy. The rate of negative biopsies in men on dutasteride therapy will
      be compared with a similar group of surveillance subjects not treated with dutasteride.
