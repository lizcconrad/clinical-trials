  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II open label study of crenolanib besylate. This study will enroll subjects
      with relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 activating mutations. Prior treatment with other
      FLT3 TKIs is allowed. Subjects will take crenolanib 200mg/m2/day divided in three doses daily
      (preferably every eight hours), taken orally at least 30 minutes pre or post meal until
      disease progression, death, or the patient discontinues treatment for adverse events,
      investigator's judgment, or other reasons. Patients who are able to proceed to allogeneic
      stem cell transplant will be able to resume crenolanib therapy post-transplant in an attempt
      to maintain remission.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Relapsed/refractory primary AML or AML secondary to antecedent hematologic disorder
             with an expected survival of 3 months or greater

          -  Patients must have tested positive for FLT3-ITD and /or other FLT3 activating
             mutations within &lt; 60 days of the screening period.

          -  Adequate liver function, defined as total or direct bilirubin ≤1.5x ULN, ALT ≤3.0x
             ULN,AST ≤3.0x ULN. Exceptions for ALT and AST restrictions will be made in the setting
             of documented liver involvement with leukemia

             &gt;/=Grade 2 persistent non hematological toxicity related to the transplant or did not
