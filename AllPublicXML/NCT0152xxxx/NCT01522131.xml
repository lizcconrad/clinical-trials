  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The proposed study will evaluate and compare the clinical response of using
      bioresorbable collagen membrane alone or defect debridement with erbium Laser irradiation in
      conjunction with bioresorbable collagen membrane in the treatment of Class II furcation
      defects in maxillary and mandibular teeth. The study will examine whether there is a superior
      regeneration potential when the laser energy is combined with membrane defect isolation.

      Procedure: The study will use 2 groups, a control group and a test group with 16 patients in
      each group, with severe chronic periodontitis having clinical or radiographic evidence of
      Class II furcation defects in the buccal or lingual of the mandibular molars or Class II
      furcation defects on the buccal of maxillary molars. 16 patients will serve as the control
      group and open flap debridement with bioresorbable collagen membrane will be the mode of
      treatment. Group 2: 16 patients will serve as the test group and will undergo open flap
      debridement in conjunction with Er, Cr: YSGG laser irradiation and a bioresorbable collagen
      membrane will be used.

      All subjects will be patients of record in the Graduate Periodontics clinic at the UT School
      of Dentistry. These individuals will have already been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis
      and require surgical intervention to treat the disease process. All patients will have
      received initial periodontal therapy consisting of oral hygiene instructions and scaling and
      root planing. Once enrolled in the study, all subjects will receive surgical therapy
      involving opened flap debridement of the affected furcation defects along with membrane
      isolation of the defect. The test group will have debridement performed with the Er,Cr:YSGG
      laser and ultrasonic cleansing, while the control group will have hand instrumentation along
      with ultrasonic cleansing. This procedure will take approximately 1.5 hours. Postoperative
      appointments at 1,2,4,8 weeks requiring 15-30 minutes per appointment; at 3 months for
      periodontal maintenance and reinforcement of home care requiring 45 minutes; and at 6 months
      for periodontal maintenance, reassessment of the furcation defect and correction of residual
      defects requiring 75 minutes. Patients will be exited from the study 2 weeks after the last
      maintenance appointment and placed on recall with the Department of Periodontics dental
      hygienist. The total time commitment for each patient is 6 months.

    <measure>Change in Clinical Attachment( Gain or Loss) Measured by Horizontal Clinical Attachment Loss(in mm) From Baseline to 6 Months.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with periodontitis lose bone and clinical attachment over a period of time. In both control and test a Nabers probe( curved probe) marked in mm was used to quantify this loss or gain of clinical attachment in a horizontal direction from the cemento-enamel junction to the the most apical extent of the bone at the furcation entrance at baseline and after 6months after the procedure. These measurements were done intrasurgery and before opening of the flaps,again both at initial visit and 6 months after the procedure was done. This measurement will be measured in mm in postive numbers and then will be compared to measurements ( in mm) at intial and baseline. If there is a loss in attachment it will be denoted by negative number. If theres a gain in attachment it will be denoted by a positive number after the comparison.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Evidence of Regeneration of Class 2 Furcation Defects Based on Changes in Vertical Pocket Depth Measurement(in mm)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients with periodontitis lose bone and clinical attachment over a period of time in vertical direction also. In both control and test a UNC probe marked in mm was used to quantify this loss or gain of clinical attachment in a vertical direction from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical extent of the bone at the furcation entrance at baseline and after 6months after the procedure. These measurements were done intrasurgery and before opening of the flaps,again both at initial visit and 6 months after the procedure was done.This measurement will be measured in mm in postive numbers and then will be compared to measurements ( in mm) at intial and baseline. Increase and decrease of vertical probing depth will be noted by a positive number.</description>

        <title>Change in Clinical Attachment( Gain or Loss) Measured by Horizontal Clinical Attachment Loss(in mm) From Baseline to 6 Months.</title>
        <description>Patients with periodontitis lose bone and clinical attachment over a period of time. In both control and test a Nabers probe( curved probe) marked in mm was used to quantify this loss or gain of clinical attachment in a horizontal direction from the cemento-enamel junction to the the most apical extent of the bone at the furcation entrance at baseline and after 6months after the procedure. These measurements were done intrasurgery and before opening of the flaps,again both at initial visit and 6 months after the procedure was done. This measurement will be measured in mm in postive numbers and then will be compared to measurements ( in mm) at intial and baseline. If there is a loss in attachment it will be denoted by negative number. If theres a gain in attachment it will be denoted by a positive number after the comparison.</description>

        <title>Clinical Evidence of Regeneration of Class 2 Furcation Defects Based on Changes in Vertical Pocket Depth Measurement(in mm)</title>
        <description>Patients with periodontitis lose bone and clinical attachment over a period of time in vertical direction also. In both control and test a UNC probe marked in mm was used to quantify this loss or gain of clinical attachment in a vertical direction from the cemento-enamel junction to the most apical extent of the bone at the furcation entrance at baseline and after 6months after the procedure. These measurements were done intrasurgery and before opening of the flaps,again both at initial visit and 6 months after the procedure was done.This measurement will be measured in mm in postive numbers and then will be compared to measurements ( in mm) at intial and baseline. Increase and decrease of vertical probing depth will be noted by a positive number.</description>
