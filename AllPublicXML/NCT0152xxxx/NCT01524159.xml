      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation of bromelain (a
      proteolytic enzyme from the pineapple plant) on the reduction of plasma fibrinogen level
      among type 2 diabetic subjects who have a high risk of cardiovascular disease.

      The null hypothesis [Ho] is: there is no significant improvement in plasma fibrinogen, serum
      lipid profile, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference and C-reactive protein for subjects
      with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of CVD following the intervention of bromelain
      supplementation compared to placebo group.

      The alternative hypothesis [H1] is: there is a significant improvement in plasma fibrinogen,
      serum lipid profile, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference and C-reactive protein for
      subjects with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of CVD following the intervention of bromelain
      supplementation compared to placebo group.

      According to American Heart Association (2010), heart disease and stroke are the No. 1 causes
      of death and disability among people with type 2 diabetes. At least 65% of people with
      diabetes die from some form of heart disease or stroke. Type 2 diabetes is associated with a
      two to fourfold increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events and markedly enhances
      the risk of stroke(Coutinho et al, 1999) due to a variety of associated risk factors that
      include high blood pressure, lipid disorders, high low-density lipoproteins (LDL)
      cholesterol, high triglycerides, low high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol, smoking,
      obesity, lack of physical activity and poorly controlled blood sugars(American Heart
      Association 2010).

      Bromelain, a crude extract from the pineapple plant, was first introduced as a therapeutic
      compound in 1957 (Heinicke &amp; Gortner, 1957). Heinicke et al. (1971) reported that bromelain
      was effective for use in cardiovascular diseases as an inhibitor of blood platelet
      aggregation, minimizing the risk of arterial thrombosis and embolism.

      A literature review identified only three human studies (in Honolulu and Germany). In view of
      this review and the valuable therapeutic properties of bromelain to cardiovascular disease,
      there is a need for a study to confirm bromelain's use for cardiovasular disease.

      This study is a randomized placebo control, parallel design, and double blind, pilot efficacy
      study which was carried out in Hebei Yiling Hospital, China. The study assessed the effects
      of 12 weeks of bromelain (1050mg/day) supplementation on plasma fibrinogen level compared to
      usual care. Study participants were type 2 diabetes who have a risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease.
