    <textblock>
      Invasive urothelial bladder cancer is a common malignancy causing 14,000 deaths annually in
      the United States. The primary objective of the feasibility/Phase I portion of the study is
      to establish the feasibility and safety of proton and the safety of IMRT for patients with
      pure or mixed variant urothelial carcinoma.

      Invasive urothelial bladder cancer is a common malignancy causing 14,000 deaths annually in
      the United States. The primary objective of the feasibility/Phase I portion of the study is
      to establish the feasibility and safety of proton and the safety of IMRT. Safety will be
      based on acute toxicity. The primary objective of the phase II study is to generate estimates
      of the local failure rate for intermediate and high risk patients treated with either proton
      therapy or IMRT. The study, however, is not explicitly designed to compare outcomes of proton
      therapy and IMRT. Secondary objectives include further evaluation of acute and late toxicity,
      quality of life and estimation of overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pure or mixed variant urothelial carcinoma o Allowable mixed variant subtypes include:
             squamous differentiation glandular differentiation nested pattern microcystic
             micropapillary lymphoepthelioma-like plasmacytoid and lymphoma-like
             sarcomatoid/carcinosarcoma giant cell trophoblastic differentiation clear cell lipid
             cell undifferentiated Radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection within the
             prior 48 weeks Pathologic T3 or higher stage disease, N0-2, M0 (AJCC, 7th Ed.,
             Appendix C) No clinical evidence of residual or recurrent disease based on the
             following minimum diagnostic work-up within 8 weeks of a patients consent to
             participate.

               -  History and physical examination

               -  Chest imaging by x-ray (PA and lateral views) or CT scan (with or without IV
                  contrast);

               -  Axial abdominal and pelvic imaging by MRI (preferably with gadolinium)

               -  Bone scan

               -  Patients with microscopically involved (positive) surgical margins, but no
                  grossly evident residual disease by imaging or physical exam are eligible.

        The patient is a candidate for definitive external beam radiotherapy;

          -  No prior radiotherapy to the region of study;

          -  No inflammatory bowel disease, active collagen vascular or connective tissue
             disorders, and no other medical or social contraindications to radiotherapy, as
             determined by a participating radiation oncologist; Age Â³18 years ECOG performance
             status: 0-2 Concurrent noninvestigational medications will be permitted Informed
             consent: Patients must have the ability to understand and be willing to sign the
             study-specific informed consent indicating their understanding of the investigational
             nature and the risks of this study before any of the protocol related studies are
             preformed (this does not include routine laboratory testing or imaging studies
             required to establish study eligibility);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable renal function in the month prior to registration defined as a creatinine
             rise of 1 mg/dL Prior partial or complete small bowel obstruction either before or
             after radical cystectomy Prior radiotherapy to the pelvis; o Prior radiation therapy
             for a different cancer or disease process is allowed, provided there will be no
             overlap of radiation therapy fields between the participants prior and current course
             of radiation therapy, radiotherapy was completed more than four weeks from enrolling
             in this study.

        Planned concurrent chemotherapy or other investigational drug to be given with radiation
        treatments o Prior chemotherapy or investigational drug for bladder cancer or a different
        cancer is allowed, provided that: The therapy was completed more than two weeks prior to
        the start of adjuvant pelvic radiation The participant has recovered to Grade 1 toxicity

        residual disease by physical exam or axial imaging.

        Prior or concurrent second invasive malignancy other than prostate and non-melanoma skin
        cancers, unless disease free for a minimum of five years. If a patient had a concurrent
        prostate cancer, then it must have been resected to negative margins.

        Known severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

        o Any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, medical condition, or other
        factor, which at the discretion of the Principal Investigators, would interfere in the safe
        and timely completion of study procedures, compromise the patients ability to tolerate the
        protocol therapy, or is likely to interfere with the study procedures or results.
