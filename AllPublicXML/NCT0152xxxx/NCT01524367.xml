  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excitement during the emergence from general anesthesia is a great post-operative problem. It
      may lead to serious consequences for the patient, such as injury, increased pain, hemorrhage,
      self-extubation, and removal of catheters, and it can necessitate physically or chemically
      restraining the patient. It has been reported that the incidence of postoperative emergence
      excitement in adults after general anesthesia is 21.3% occurrence.

      Many things are mentioned as risk factors for emergence excitement. Among them, excitement
      after orthognathic surgery (two-jaw) was more common than after other types of surgery. The
      patients undergoing emergence with nasotracheal intubation after orthognathic surgery may
      have a sense of suffocation during emergence from anesthesia, which may increase the
      incidence of emergence excitement.

      Pain is also a main cause of postoperative excitement. Dexmedetomidine, which is an
      S-enantiomer of medetomidine with high specificity for α2-adrenoceptor (α2 : α1, 1620 : 1)
      compared to clonidine (a2 : a1, 220 : 1), is approved as a sedative and co-analgesic drug.

      To the best of the investigators knowledge, effect of dexmedetomidine on emergence excitement
      was investigated only in children.

      The investigators hypothesized that single dose of dexmedetomidine would reduce the incidence
      and the severity of the emergence excitement in adults with nasotracheal intubation after
      orthognathic surgery (two-jaw).
