      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of alpha 1 anti-trypsin
      (alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human) and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human may be a better
      treatment for graft-versus-host disease caused by a stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and tolerability of alpha 1 anti-trypsin (AAT) in patients with
      steroid non-responsive acute GVHD.

      II. Characterize pharmacodynamic effects of AAT on pro-inflammatory cytokines, heparan
      sulfate, and the spectrum of peripheral blood T cells.

      III. Determine clinical responses of GVHD to AAT in patients with steroid non-responsive
      acute GVHD.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor human
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human intravenously (IV) on days 1, 3, 5, and
      7. Patients who experience no toxicity and in whom GVHD is stable or improved after the day 7
      dose can continue therapy with alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor human on days 9, 11, 13 and 15.
