  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-month study is to compare how well two programs help older adults make
      physical activity a regular habit.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although only a small percentage of older adults engage in habitual physical activity,
      previous studies have demonstrated interventions that include cognitive-behavioral strategies
      can enhance long-term, independent physical activity. In addition, there are episodic charity
      events, such as charity walks, that attract large numbers of participants of all age ranges
      to engage in moderate-intensity physical activity. These actions are a form of prosocial
      behavior, defined as voluntary, intentional behavior that results in benefits for another.
      The opportunity to help others seems to be a motive in inspiring these individuals to at
      least engage in one session of moderate physical activity. Thus, the current research project
      contemplates whether prosocial behavior may be implemented as a viable behavioral incentive
      for long-term physical activity.

      Participants in the Prosocial Behavior Physical Activity (PBPA) intervention will receive a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention to teach participants the behavioral skills necessary to
      engage in long-term (12-month) independent physical activity. Participants in the Healthy
      Aging (HA) intervention will receive excellent educational sessions based on a number of
      topics of relevance to older adults. Both programs will provide supervised stretching
      sessions so that participants learn how to safely and effectively improve flexibility, which
      helps reduce the likelihood of falls and disability. However, the PBPA intervention will also
      allow participants to earn food for donation to Second Harvest Food Bank based on their
      regular physical activity and volunteer time.

    <description>A series of 3 physical function tests will be administered to all participants at three time points: (1) at baseline before randomization; (2) 3 months after the interventions begin; and (3) 12 months after the interventions begin. All of the tests are brief and uncomplicated to perform.</description>

    <description>The PBPA condition involves a cognitive-behavioral intervention to teach participants the behavioral skills to engage in independent physical activity. Participants will engage in supervised physical activity delivered two times a week during months 1 to 3 at the William G. White, Jr. Family YMCA in Winston-Salem, NC. During months 4 to 6, supervised sessions will be held once per week, and sessions will be held once per month in months 7 to 9. Participants will engage in completely independent physical activity in months 10 to 12. PBPA participants will also be able to earn boxes of food for donation to the Second Harvest Food Bank (SHFB) of Northwest North Carolina based upon their weekly physical activity. Lowe's Foods, a regional grocery chain, will donate the food. Participants in the PBPA intervention also will receive a 12-month membership to the William G. White, Jr. Family YMCA at no cost.</description>

    <description>Behavioral: Healthy Aging (HA) The HA group will receive a health education intervention based on topics from several sources, including the National Institute on Aging's Age Pages, University of Pittsburgh's 10 Keys to Healthy Aging; and Stanford University's Successful Aging program, among other topics . The HA intervention will receive ongoing staff contact, and will provide participants with excellent information on health-related topics. Biweekly 45-minute lectures will be given during months 1 to 6, and once per month during months 7 to 9. After each session, participants will engage in a 15-minute stretching routine. During months 10 to 12, no lectures will be given. After completion of the 12-month assessments, participants will receive a 12-month membership to the YMCA at no cost.</description>
