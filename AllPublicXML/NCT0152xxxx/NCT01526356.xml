  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a topically applied formulation of rapamycin to
      cutaneous angiofibromas in subjects with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Subjects will
      apply either the topical vehicle containing rapamycin or the topical vehicle alone nightly to
      their angiofibromas for six months.

      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the topical medication for
      reduction of cutaneous angiofibromas in patients with TSC. The secondary goal of this study
      is to confirm the safety of the topical medication.
