  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies (cancer that has spread to
      other parts of the body).

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of a new combination of
      drugs, PD-0332991 and 5-Fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin for patients with advanced solid tumor
      malignancies . PD-0332991 stops cells from dividing by blocking an enzyme called
      cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), which cancer cells need to grow and divide. By inhibiting this
      enzyme, PD-0332991 prevent cancer cells from growing and dividing, while the 5-Fluorouracil
      and Oxaliplatin damage the cells, hopefully increasing the killing of cancer cells, thus
      decreasing the tumors in the body.

      PD-0332991 is an investigational or experimental anti-cancer agent that has not yet been
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in colorectal cancer. It is given as a
      pill which is taken once a day for one week followed by one week off. 5-Fluorouracil and
      Oxaliplatin are administered as an infusion into a vein once every 2 weeks and are approved
      for and used as chemotherapy for several cancers.
