  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to demonstrate the benefit of a simplified version of the DIAMOND System
      (A third Generation) in comparison to a sham treatment in terms of Glycemic control, measured
      as A1c, FBG and Post-Prandial Glucose levels.

      The study hypothesis is that HbA1c will show greater improvement in patients receiving 12
      months of therapy by the DIAMOMD System than in patients not receiving this therapy.

      the effect.
