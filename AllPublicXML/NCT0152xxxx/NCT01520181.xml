  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-lactam allergy is the most prevalent drug allergy. Drug eruption is the most common
      symptom whereas life-threatening anaphylaxis is rather rare. A recently published study
      (Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, January 2011, Vol. 127, p. 218-222) described
      the safety of a 2-day oral beta-lactam challenge in penicillin-allergic patients,
      disregarding their penicillin skin test results. In the proposed study the investigators will
      similarly challenge beta-lactam allergic patients, both children and adults for an extended
      (5 days) period of time. The study will include patients with a history of a skin rash
      following beta-lactam administration as well as patients who cannot provide any data on their
      presumed allergic reaction, disregarding their penicillin skin test results.

    <measure>The safety of a 5-day oral challenge in patients with suspected beta-lactam allergy</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>In case of the development of any adverse reactions throughout the 5-day challenge patients will notify the investigators over the phone. If assessed necessary by the investigators, patients will return to the Allergy Clinic for repeated evaluation. After completion of the 5-day challenge all patients will be contacted by the investigators and will be inquired about any adverse reactions throughout the challenge. The number of participants with adverse reactions to the challenge will be reported.</description>
