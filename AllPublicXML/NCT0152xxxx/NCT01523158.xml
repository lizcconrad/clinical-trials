  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis) results from allergy to grass and tree pollen. The
      majority of affected individuals manage well with medication from the Pharmacy or from their
      general practitioner (GP), but for some severely affected people it severely impacts on
      quality of life. Less than 40% of those affected in UK general practice feel that these
      medications achieve good symptomatic control.

      Specific immunotherapy or desensitisation is the practice of administering small amounts of
      allergen to allergic patients in increasing doses. This treatment is highly effective in
      these patients and furthermore is truly disease-modifying, with benefits persisting
      long-term, even when the treatment has been completed. Desensitisation is a routine treatment
      in the UK, Europe and North America. The exact immune mechanisms that underlie this
      symptomatic improvement are not entirely clear. Dr Tarzi, Professor Frew and Professor Kern
      have recently developed new methods for the investigation of immune responses to allergens.
      These methods require relatively small blood samples and may provide useful information about
      how immunotherapy exerts its effects. In addition to improving the investigators basic
      understanding of this treatment, such knowledge may drive improvements in the treatment and
      could be useful for monitoring patients for response. The investigators study proposes to
      investigate changes in the immune responses to pollen allergens during immunotherapy. Blood
      will be taken just prior to the first immunotherapy injection and again just prior to the
      final injection. In this way the investigators will be able to compare the immune responses
      to pollen allergen before and after treatment.
