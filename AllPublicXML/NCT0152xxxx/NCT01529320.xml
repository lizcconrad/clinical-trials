        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects ≥18 years old.

          2. Subjects with a history of diagnosis of sensitization to Nickel sulphate.

          3. Delayed type hypersensitivity demonstrated by positive reaction with epicutaneous or
             patch test.

          4. Skin Phototype II-III.

          5. Women with fertile age and a negative result in the pregnancy test before inclusion.
             Women must use an adequate contraceptive method during the study.

          6. Written informed consent prior to inclusion.

          7. Able and willing to comply with protocol procedures and to follow the investigator's
             instructions.

        Criteria for treatment initiation: At day 7, before starting treatment, subjects must meet
        the inclusion criteria and all the following criteria: ≥ 3 VAS and eczema intensity of (+
        +) or (+++) according to ICDRG scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active cutaneous disease causing itch (active eczema, urticaria or insect bites)

          2. Active systemic disease that may induce itch (hepatic or renal disease).

          3. Active psychiatric disease that could interfere with symptom assessment.

          4. Treatment with drugs inducing itch.

          5. Treatment with oral or topical preparations that could interfere with the itching
             sensation induced by patch test.

          6. Treatment with systemic or topical corticosteroids, antihistaminics or calcineurin
             inhibitors.

          7. Active skin disease in the back that may interfere with the assessment of response to
             topical application of allergen

          8. Pregnancy or lactation

          9. Subjects with contraindications specified in Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).
