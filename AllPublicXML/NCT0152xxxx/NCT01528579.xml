      Background:

      Costs of health care consumption and sick leave 2006 in Sweden for Whiplash Associated
      Disorders (WAD) was estimated to be 4 billion Swedish crowns. Despite tremendous costs and
      personal sufferings there are only a few prospective randomized studies (RCT) in patients
      with chronic WAD, and none of them evaluating return to work, or the role of neck specific
      exercises with or without a combination of a behavioral approach compared with prescribed
      physical activity.

      Aim:

      The general aim of this RCT is to examine what neck-specific training with or without a
      combination with behavioral approach adds to prescribed physical activity of persons with
      chronic WAD with regard to pain intensity, physical and psychological function, health care
      consumption and return to work. Another aim is to study predictive factors of importance for
      a good outcome of rehabilitation.

      Method:

      After informed consent patients in age 18-63 years of age with WAD II-III with more than 6
      months duration will be randomized to one out of the three alternatives of physiotherapy,
      treatment with medical exercise therapy with neck specific exercises (A),treatment with a
      behavioral approach combined with neck specific exercises (B), prescribed physical activity
      (C). Randomisation will be done by the central project leader. 200 patients will be included
      in the study. All physiotherapists engaged in the structured and well described treatment
      will be introduced in the program by the project leader. The measurements with good
      clinometric properties will be performed before treatment, after 12 weeks, 6, 12 and 24
      months after inclusion into the study. Clinical measurements will be performed by a blinded
      investigator. Background data, disease-specific and generic data will be measured by
      self-evaluated answered questionnaires by the patients. Days of sick-leave will be collected
      from the Social Insurance Agency. Main outcomes of the measurements are pain intensity, neck
      specific disability and return to work. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated.
