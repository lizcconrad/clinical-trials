  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine the efficacy of hydrocortisone administration in the augmentation
      of the therapeutic effects of Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, an empirically tested
      treatment shown to be effective in the the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      The augmentation builds on both the translation of neuroscience findings demonstrating the
      effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) on learning, and on empirical clinical findings from other
      investigators demonstrating beneficial effects of GCs in reducing traumatic memories in
      trauma-exposed persons.

             be enrolled. Female participants must agree to use an effective method of birth
             control (i.e., oral contraceptive, Norplant, diaphragm, condom, or spermicide,
