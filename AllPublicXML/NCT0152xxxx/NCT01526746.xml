  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand whether there is any difference in the
      amount of tasimelteon (including its breakdown products) in the blood of individuals with
      severe renal impairment compared to individuals who have normal renal function. The safety
      and tolerability of tasimelteon will also be assessed throughout this study.
