  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a 20 week open pilot study of Interpersonal and Social
      Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) to treat individuals (n=18) with subthreshold bipolar (BP) who are
      currently depressed. The investigators will conduct a preliminary evaluation of sleep-wake
      and social rhythm patterns in study participants using questionnaires and actigraphy. Primary
      aims of this study are to evaluate feasibility of this treatment and assessment approach.
      Exploratory aims are to examine 1) sleep-wake and social rhythm patterns in subthreshold BP,
      2) impact of IPSRT on symptoms and functioning over time and 3) relationship between
      sleep-wake and social rhythm patterns and treatment outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subthreshold bipolar disorder (BP) is a common, understudied, illness associated with high
      levels of impairment. &quot;Subthreshold&quot; BP refers to individuals who have episodes of both
      depression and hypomania, but the episodes of hypomania do not last long enough or are
      characterized by too few symptoms to meet conventional criteria for &quot;threshold&quot; hypomania.
      Compared to individuals with episodes of depression only (major depressive disorder or MDD),
      individuals with subthreshold BP have higher rates of suicide, earlier onset of illness, more
      episodes of depression, and more co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Despite the severity of
      the disorder, virtually nothing is known about how to treat this illness.

    <description>IPSRT Subjects will receive weekly 45 minute sessions of IPSRT for 20 weeks. IPSRT sessions focus on reducing symptoms by teaching patients to: a) increase regularity of social rhythms and regulate sleep-wake cycles; b) resolve interpersonal problems that contribute to mood symptoms (role dispute, role transition, grief, or interpersonal deficits); and c) recognize and accept the symptoms of subthreshold BP disorder (psychoeducation). Although we train therapists in techniques that are specific to each component, in practice, these strategies are administered flexibly and fluidly, without distinct boundaries between modalities. During the course of a session, therapists move seamlessly among the techniques, according to patients' needs.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adults age 18 - 65

          2. Meets criteria for bipolar disorder NOS, currently in an episode of major depression,
             as defined by the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and documented by
             the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID-I), and
             by a rating of &gt;15 on the 25-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-25). We
             will limit inclusion specifically to those individuals who have histories of 1) at
             least one short (2-3 day) hypomanic episode OR 2) at least one subthreshold hypomanic
             episode (at least 4 consecutive days of elevated mood and 2 of the other symptoms of
             hypomania or irritable mood with 3 of the other symptoms of hypomania). NOTE: Like the
             National Comorbidity Survey Replication, individuals whose hypomania occurred while on
             antidepressant medication will not be excluded from the trial (Merikangas, personal
             communication, 2011).

          3. Ability and willingness to give informed, written consent.

          4. Subjects may participate in this study if they are currently taking psychotropic
             medications at time of informed consent. They will start study interventions if they
             still meet eligibility criteria after a one week wash-out period.

          5. Ability and willingness to participate in study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe or poorly controlled concurrent medical disorders that may cause confounding
             depressive symptoms (i.e., untreated hypothyroidism or lupus) or require medication(s)
             that could cause depressive symptoms (i.e., high doses of beta blockers or alpha
             interferon)

          2. Meets criteria for one of the following concurrent DSM-IV psychiatric disorders: any
             psychotic or organic mental disorder, bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, current
             alcohol or drug dependence, primary obsessive compulsive disorder or primary eating
             disorders. (primary refers to the diagnosis associated with the most functional
             impairment); borderline personality disorder; antisocial personality disorder

          3. Acute suicidal or homicidal ideation or requiring psychiatric hospitalization.
             Subjects who require inpatient treatment will be excluded (or discontinued) from the
             study and referred to one of WPIC's inpatient mood disorder units, or, if preferred,
             to an inpatient facility nearer to the patient's home

          4. Severe cognitive deficits that would preclude treatment with psychotherapy and/or
             prevent completion of study questionnaires

          5. Non-fluent in English. Subjects must be able to speak and understand English because
             one of the study interventions, IPSRT, is an experimental talk-therapy. The DMDPP does
             not have multilingual therapists.

          6. Current participation in another form of individual psychotherapy. Concurrent
             participation in couples therapy, peer support groups (such as Alcoholics Anonymous),
             or family therapy will be permitted

          7. Prior lack of response to a trial of at least 12 weeks of IPSRT conducted by a
             qualified IPSRT therapist
