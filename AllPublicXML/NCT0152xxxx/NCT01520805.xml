    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether CPI-613 is effective and safe in either
      patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or patients with
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who have failed therapy with a hypomethylating agent (such as
      decitabine [Vidaza] and azacitidine [AZA]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new therapy for AML is necessary because, although there are several treatment options for
      patients with AML, these treatments are very toxic and not available to all AML patients or
      only useful for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Also, there is essentially no treatment
      for patients with refractory or relapsed AML outside of bone marrow transplant. Accordingly,
      there is a great medical need for a safe and effective therapy for AML, especially refractory
      and relapsed AML. Also, although hypomethylating agents have been found to be effective
      against MDS, these agents are toxic. Furthermore, after relapsing from a hypomethylating
      agent, there is no treatment for this disease.

      A nearly completed clinical trial of CPI-613 (Cornerstone Study# CL-CPI-613-009 or Wake
      Forest Study# CCCWFU 29109, under IND# 107,800) shows that CPI-613 is well tolerated at doses
      as high as 3,000 mg/m2. Results from this nearly completed trial also suggest that CPI- 613
      may be effective against refractory and relapsed AML, as well as against MDS that is relapsed
      from a hypomethylating agent. Therefore, CPI-613 may be a suitable treatment option for
      refractory/relapsed AML and MDS relapsed from a hypomethylating agent. The promising
      preliminary efficacy data from Study# CL-CPI-613-009 (Wake Forest Study# CCCWFU 29109, under
      IND# 107,800) is the basis on which Cornerstone is conducting the current Phase 2a trial to
      further assess the efficacy of CPI-613 against these diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have either documented refractory or relapsed AML, or documented MDS of any risk group
             that has failed a hypomethylating agent (such as decitabine [Vidaza] and azacitidine
             [AZA]). (Therapy failure with a hypomethylating agent is defined as patients who have
             been sufficiently treated with hypomethylating agents without response in the opinion
             of the treating physician, or whose disease has progressed or relapsed while on a
             hypomethylating agent.) Has never been treated with CPI-613.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2.

          -  Expected survival &gt;2 months.

          -  18 years of age and older of both genders.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically
             sterile) must use accepted contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device
             [IUD], oral contraceptive, or double barrier device) during the study, and must have a
             negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation.

          -  Fertile men must practice effective contraceptive methods during the study, unless
             documentation of infertility exists.

          -  No radiotherapy, surgery or hormonal therapy for any kind of within 2 weeks prior to
             participating in this study. Patients must have fully recovered from the acute
             toxicities of any prior treatment with any anti-cancer drugs (including
             hypomethylating agents in MDS patients), radiotherapy or other anti-cancer modalities
             (i.e., returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment) for any
             tumors. Patients with persisting, stable chronic toxicities from such prior treatment
             â‰¤Grade 1 are eligible, but must be documented as such.

          -  Recombinant erythropoietin or G-CSF is not allowed, since CPI-613 does not induce
             myelosuppression.

          -  No evidence of active or serious infection of any kind within the past month. No
             systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection not controlled, defined as
             exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without improvement,
             despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment.

          -  Signed informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious medical illness, such as significant cardiac disease (e.g. symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the
             past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or New York Heart Association Class
             III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would potentially increase
             patients' risk for toxicity.

          -  Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within the previous 6 months,
             symptomatic coronary artery disease, abnormal ECG, or symptomatic congestive heart
             failure.

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding, or any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g.,
             active peptic ulcer disease).

          -  Dyspnea with minimal to moderate exertion. Patients with large pleural, pericardial,
             or peritoneal effusions.

          -  Evidence of active infection, or serious infection within the past month.

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural solid or hematologic
             tumors.

          -  Patients receiving any standard or investigational therapy for any tumor indication
             within the past 2 weeks, or any investigational agent for any indication within the
             past 4 weeks, prior to the study.

          -  Patients who have received immunotherapy of any type for any indications within the
             past 4 weeks prior to the study.

          -  Ongoing oral corticosteroids are not permitted. However, topical and inhaled
             corticosteroids are permitted, and prophylactic steroids are allowed for transfusion
             reactions.

          -  Life expectancy less than 2 months.

          -  Pregnant women, or women of child-bearing potential not using reliable means of
             contraception.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Fertile men unwilling to practice contraceptive methods during the study period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow protocol requirements.
