  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that the addition of antiangiogenic agents to conventional therapeutic
      strategies, e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, or other tumor-targeting agents, will increase
      clinical efficacy. For advanced colorectal cancer,the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab has
      become an important treatment option and its combination with chemotherapy is now being one
      of the standard first line therapy. This phase II study was conducted to determine the
      efficacy and safety of another antiangiogenesis inhibitor rh-endostatin plus mFOLFOX6 in
      advanced colorectal cancer.

      Rh-Endostatin (Endostar; Simcere Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, JiangSu,China) is a humanized
      recombinant endostatin which is a direct angiogenesis inhibitor targeting the microvascular
      endothelial cells (ECs). A pivotal phase III study completed in China demonstrated that the
      addition of rh-endostatin to navelbine plus cisplatin conferred clinically significant
      improvements in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), as well as response
      rate (RR), in patients with previously untreated metastatic non small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). In vitro, the combination of Endostatin and fluorouracil showed synergistic activity
      in inhibiting colon cancer. MFolfox6 was standard first-line regimen in advanced colorectal
      cancer. The investigators carried out a phase II trial to investigate the activity and safety
      of rh-endostatin plus mFOLFOX in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.
