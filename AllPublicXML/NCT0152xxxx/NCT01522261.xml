      Does mechanical bowel preparation (complete bowel cleansing)help the Surgeon with
      visualization of the operative field during laparoscopic pelvic reconstructive surgery?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to receive a complete MBP or not prior to their surgical
      procedure. All patients will use 1 fleets enema the night before surgery and one the morning
      of surgery to ensure that the rectum is empty of all stool. This will be done since some
      surgeons use a rectal probe in the rectum to help with manipulation during the procedure.
      Stool in the rectal vault could contaminate the surgical field and lead to an infection.

      Patients will be randomized at their pre-op visit and provided instructions according to the
      group assignment. On the day of surgery patients will be asked to complete a questionnaire in
      the pre-op holding area to assess their overnight symptoms including insomnia, weakness,
      abdominal distention, nausea, thirst and overall tolerability of the Bowel Preparation
      assigned.

      Immediately after surgery, the primary surgeon will be asked to complete a visual analog
      score sheet evaluating the ease of the procedure with regard to retraction of the large and
      small bowel to help with visualization of the sacral promontory, retraction from posterior
      cul-de-sac, and maintaining adequate positioning after retraction. All surgeons (attendings,
      fellows, and residents) will be blinded re: the patients group assignment. Each primary
      surgeon will be asked to assign a final grade to the procedure as easy, medium, or difficult
      based on overall bowel retraction.

      At their 2 week follow up visit patients will be asked to report return of bowel function
      (first bowel movement or flatus) in # of days after surgery and incidents of stool leakage
      post op.

    <description>The primary objective of this protocol is to determine whether there is truly an advantage for the surgeon (visually) in having patients complete a Mechanical Bowel Prep prior to surgery or if an enema completed the evening before and morning of the surgery is sufficient.</description>
