  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well talactoferrin works in treating patients with relapsed or
      refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or squamous cell head and neck cancer.
      Biological therapies, such as talactoferrin, may stimulate the immune system in different
      ways and stop tumor cells from growing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Monitoring of immunologic response to therapy in tumor tissue and peripheral blood.
      Identification of potential candidate biomarkers indicating clinical benefit to
      talactoferrin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), stable disease (SD),
      overall survival (OS), disease stability, and disease stability at 7 weeks.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive talactoferrin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 12 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 14 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for at least 12 months.
