  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease results in narrowing of the blood vessels supplying oxygenated blood
      to the heart muscle. Diagnosis in patients with symptoms of chest pain is now quickly done
      with CT coronary angiography. This x-ray test can show narrowed blood vessels but has limited
      ability to predict the severity of the narrowings in some cases. We have described a new
      approach using PET exercise 18F-FDG imaging as a method to image areas of heart muscle not
      getting enough blood during exercise stress. The 18F-FDG images are co-registered with the CT
      anatomy from the CTA to provide direct evidence of the consequences of the narrowing.

      The Investigators and others have demonstrated direct imaging of myocardial ischemia using
      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) with exercise or dipyridamole stress and positron emission
      tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). This approach with
      &quot;hot-spot&quot; imaging may have greater diagnostic accuracy for ischemia than conventional
      &quot;cold-spot&quot; myocardial perfusion imaging.

      Recent advances in multi-modality imaging permit fusion of CTA images with PET or SPECT
      perfusion images and functional assessment of anatomical CAD. Registration of the 2 data sets
      can be optimized using the CT acquired with the PET or SPECT15. 18FDG uptake as a marker for
      ischemia can be directly related to the coronary anatomy and guide revascularization.

    <description>Exercise Stress Testing. All patients will undergo a symptom-limited exercise treadmill test using the Bruce protocol after a 24 hour high fat, low carbohydrate diet and an overnight fast. Persantine Stress Testing: Subjects who have undergone Persantine stress protocol for the PET or SPECT will follow the same protocol. A high fat, low carbohydrate diet for 24 hours and a 12 hour overnight fast will precede the study stress scan. Anti-anginal medications will be withheld on the morning of the exercise test.
18FDG (370 mBq) will be injected at either peak exercise or within 1 hour of peak.
Patients will be imaged 60 minutes after radiotracer injection in the supine position in a Discovery 690/VCTLYSO PET system (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin)</description>
