      Aim of the study is to demonstrate superiority of a continuous cooling of the skin over
      topical EMLA or placebo in reducing the burning pain during the application of capsaicin 8%
      patch (&quot;Qutenza&quot;).

      Secondary it will be tested, if the 2 different pre-treatments have an effect on the
      application pain within the first 24 hours, and if different pre-treatments have an effect on
      the reduction of the epidermal nerve fiber density (ENFD) 1 week after Qutenza application.

      According to literature, one of the most common adverse events of capsaicin 8% patch is a
      burning pain and a reversible erythema at the application site. In general it is recommended
      to apply a topical anesthetic one hour before capsaicin 8% patch application, or to treat the
      pain with cooling, NSAIDs or even opioids. Nevertheless, there is still only limited data
      available on the effects and side-effects. In this study it shall be tested if cooling the
      skin down for about 5-10 Celsius, immediately before Qutenza is applied, and continuing the
      cooling during the whole application time, results in a reliable prevention of the burning
      pain compared to pretreatment with topical anesthesia applied one hour in advance. This would
      lead to the assumption that the application pain is predominantly caused by a decrease of the
      threshold for heat pain beyond skin temperature and can therefore be prevented by a lowering
      of the skin temperature.

      By ascertaining pain 24 hours after capsaicin 8% patch application and epidermal nerve fiber
      density (ENFD) 1 week after capsaicin 8% patch application it shall be proved if the
      different pretreatment methods do not change the secondary effects of capsaicin application.

      If results turn out to be positive, it would be a massive relief with regard to time
      management and rescue medication.
