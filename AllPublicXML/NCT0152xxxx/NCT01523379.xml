  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complex regional pain syndrom is a weighty disease that often results in a lifelong
      disability. Mostly this disease appears unilateral after comparatively mundane fractures or
      operations. In early stages CRPS shows inflammatory processes. These inflammatory components
      can be seen as edema and vasodilatation. These inflammatory processes lead us to the
      hypothesis that selective COX-2-inhibitors might help patients with CRPS.
