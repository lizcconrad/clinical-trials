      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood and tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory
      may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer. It may also help
      doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies gene expression in samples from patients with T-cell
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To test whether the tumor suppressor candidate gene PDLIM2 is downregulated in human
           cancers such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and to use the human
           T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1)-mediated in vitro transformation of human T cells as
           control.

      OUTLINE: Previously collected cancer and control tissues are analyzed for the expression
      patterns of PDLIM2 and other control genes. Human T-cells isolated from human blood are also
      co-cultured with HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines.
