      Background:

      - Chile has the highest diagnosis and death rates of gallbladder cancer in the world.
      Gallbladder cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death in Chilean women. High rates of
      gallstones and obesity, as well as genetic concerns, may explain these high rates.
      Researchers want to study gallbladder cancer in more depth in Chile. A small study must be
      done to see if a full-scale study is feasible.

      Objectives:

      - To test the methods and procedures of a small-scale study of gallbladder cancer in Chile.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have gallbladder cancer or gallstones, or are
           healthy control volunteers.

        -  Participants will be recruited from four clinical centers in Chile.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Because
           gallbladder cancer has a high fatality rate, family members may be asked to provide
           additional medical history information if study participants die or become too ill to
           provide this information.

        -  Participants will provide blood, urine, stool, hair, fingernail, and saliva samples.

        -  Gallstones, bile, and tissue samples will be collected from those who have gallbladder
           removal surgery. Normal and tumor tissue samples will be collected as needed.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol. This is a data collection study
           only.

      We are proposing a pilot study of gallbladder cancer (approximately 120 subjects) in Chile in
      2011-2012 to assess the feasibility of conducting a planned full-scale population-based
      multidisciplinary gallbladder cancer study in Chile. After the completion of the pilot study,
      we plan to submit a concept to SAG and a proposal to TEP for review/approval of the
      full-scale study in 2012. It is important and timely to study gallbladder cancer in Chile
      because this country has the highest reported gallbladder cancer incidence and mortality in
      the world, with rates that are 6-10 times higher than those reported in the United States.
      Moreover, gallbladder cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Chilean women and the
      third leading cause of cancer death among Chilean men (next to stomach and lung cancer).
      Reasons for the very high risk of gallbladder cancer in Chile are unclear, although the high
      prevalence of obesity and gallstones as well as genetic susceptibility have been suggested to
      explain part of the high risk of gallbladder cancer in this population.

      In 2009, NCI and the Chilean government signed a letter of intent to join forces to identify
      reasons for the high risk of gallbladder cancer in Chile in hopes of developing strategies
      for cancer prevention. Subsequently, DCEG and NCI s Office of Latin America Cancer Program
      Development (OLACPD) organized a gallbladder workshop for U.S. and Chilean scientists in
      Santiago, Chile. Workshop participants concluded that a large-scale multidisciplinary
      epidemiologic investigation in Chile is urgently needed to clarify risk factors specific to
      the Chilean population and to help derive preventive strategies to reduce the burden of
      gallbladder cancer in Chile. Before NCI/DCEG commits substantial resources to support a large
      field effort, we propose to evaluate the feasibility of successfully carrying out a high
      quality multidisciplinary epidemiologic study in Chile. We are requesting TEP approval for
      the This protocol describes a pilot study of gallbladder cancer in Chile with a case-control
      in four hospitals (120 subjects, including 40 cancer cases, 40 gallstone cases, and 40
      population controls) to assess the feasibility of conducting a large study in Chile
      component, including gallbladder cancer cases, gallstone patients, and population-based
      controls, and a gallstone expansion recruiting additional patients undergoing cholecystectomy
      and population-based controls to further explore gallstones in this high-risk population. The
      total number of participants recruited will be 420.
