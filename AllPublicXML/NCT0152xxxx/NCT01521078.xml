  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive alcohol consumption in university students continues for be a serious public health
      concern with a variety of negative consequences. There have been a number of different brief
      interventions developed to address this issue among university students. The current project
      will add to this literature by evaluating the use of a personalized feedback intervention
      (www.CheckYourDrinkingU.net; CYDU). Specifically, this trial will examine whether providing
      access to the CYDU will result in short-term reductions in drinking. This issue is important
      as use of these interventions is not a mandatory requirement for university students so the
      issue is whether making materials of this type available leads to any reductions in risky
      drinking. It is hypothesized that students provided access to the CYDU will display greater
      reductions in drinking at a six-week follow-up as compared to students who were not provided
      access to the CYDU.

    <description>The CYDU is an internet-based intervention that provides a personalized feedback summary which compares the participant's drinking to that of other university students. The CYDU is a modified version of the Check Your Drinking screener which has been validated in four separate randomized controlled trials. The primary modification of the CYDU is that the population norms used for comparison are those of university students (in the USA or Canada).</description>
