  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People affected by rheumatoid arthritis are often suffering from fatigue and decreased QOL.
      In this study we are measuring the impact of SC biologics on these parameters.

    <measure>Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale - Version 2 (AIMS2) Main Component Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS2 is a disease-specific measure of physical, social, and emotional well-being. It is a 78-item questionnaire assessing 12 scales: moving capacities, walking and dexterity, hand and fingers movements, arm movements, self-care, household activities, social activities, support of family and friends, joint pain, work, nervous tension and psychological condition (anxiety and depression). Each item was scored as 0 (or 1, best situation) to 4 (worst situation). Sub-total score of each of the 12 scales normalized to a maximum of 10. Total score were calculated for AIMS2 Affect ([Level of tension + Mood]/2), AIMS2 Physical ([Mobility level + Walking and bending + Hand and finger function + Arm function + Self Care + Household tasks]/6), and AIMS2 Symptom (Arthritis pain) with total score range from 0 to 10 for all component scores, where higher scores indicated worse situation.</description>

        <title>Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale - Version 2 (AIMS2) Main Component Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>AIMS2 is a disease-specific measure of physical, social, and emotional well-being. It is a 78-item questionnaire assessing 12 scales: moving capacities, walking and dexterity, hand and fingers movements, arm movements, self-care, household activities, social activities, support of family and friends, joint pain, work, nervous tension and psychological condition (anxiety and depression). Each item was scored as 0 (or 1, best situation) to 4 (worst situation). Sub-total score of each of the 12 scales normalized to a maximum of 10. Total score were calculated for AIMS2 Affect ([Level of tension + Mood]/2), AIMS2 Physical ([Mobility level + Walking and bending + Hand and finger function + Arm function + Self Care + Household tasks]/6), and AIMS2 Symptom (Arthritis pain) with total score range from 0 to 10 for all component scores, where higher scores indicated worse situation.</description>

        <population>ITT population included participants for whom the primary endpoint or 1 of the secondary endpoints could be determined at baseline. Here “n” = participants who were evaluable for this measure for specified component score. The results for social interaction and role components of AIMS2 were not analyzed due to change in planned analysis.</population>

        <title>Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale - Version 2 (AIMS2) Main Component Score at Month 24</title>
        <description>AIMS2 is a disease-specific measure of physical, social, and emotional well-being. It is a 78-item questionnaire assessing 12 scales: moving capacities, walking and dexterity, hand and fingers movements, arm movements, self-care, household activities, social activities, support of family and friends, joint pain, work, nervous tension and psychological condition (anxiety and depression). Each item was scored as 0 (or 1, best situation) to 4 (worst situation). Sub-total score of each of the 12 scales normalized to a maximum of 10. Total score were calculated for AIMS2 Affect ([Level of tension + Mood]/2), AIMS2 Physical ([Mobility level + Walking and bending + Hand and finger function + Arm function + Self Care + Household tasks]/6), and AIMS2 Symptom (Arthritis pain) with total score range from 0 to 10 for all component scores, where higher scores indicated worse situation.</description>

        <population>ITT population included participants for whom the primary endpoint or 1 of the secondary endpoints could be determined at baseline. Here “n” = participants who were evaluable for this measure for specified component score. The results for social interaction and role components of AIMS2 were not analyzed due to change in planned analysis.</population>

        <description>Pearson correlation coefficient between AIMS2 component score and DAS28-ESR score (AIMS2 component score vs DAS28-ESR) was calculated. AIMS2: 78-item questionnaire assessing 12 scales. Each item was scored as 0 (or 1, best situation) to 4 (worst situation). Sub-total score of each of the 12 scales normalized to a maximum of 10. Total score were calculated for AIMS2 Affect ([Level of tension + Mood]/2), AIMS2 Physical ([Mobility level + Walking and bending + Hand and finger function + Arm function + Self Care + Household tasks]/6), and AIMS2 Symptom (Arthritis pain); total score range from 0 to 10, higher scores indicates worse situation and DAS28-ESR calculated from the number of SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour) and participant's assessment of disease activity VAS (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad]). Total score range: 0-10, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28-ESR &lt;= 3.2 = low DA, DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high DA.</description>

          <title>Pearson Correlation Coefficient Between Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale - Version 2 (AIMS2) Main Components and Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation (DAS 28-ESR)</title>
          <description>Pearson correlation coefficient between AIMS2 component score and DAS28-ESR score (AIMS2 component score vs DAS28-ESR) was calculated. AIMS2: 78-item questionnaire assessing 12 scales. Each item was scored as 0 (or 1, best situation) to 4 (worst situation). Sub-total score of each of the 12 scales normalized to a maximum of 10. Total score were calculated for AIMS2 Affect ([Level of tension + Mood]/2), AIMS2 Physical ([Mobility level + Walking and bending + Hand and finger function + Arm function + Self Care + Household tasks]/6), and AIMS2 Symptom (Arthritis pain); total score range from 0 to 10, higher scores indicates worse situation and DAS28-ESR calculated from the number of SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour) and participant's assessment of disease activity VAS (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad]). Total score range: 0-10, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28-ESR &lt;= 3.2 = low DA, DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high DA.</description>
          <population>ITT population, Here “n” = participants evaluable for this measure for specified component score and “N” (number of participants analyzed) = participants who were evaluable for this measure. The results for social interaction and role components of AIMS2 were not analyzed due to change in planned analysis.</population>

        <description>Pearson correlation coefficient between AIMS2 component score and DAS28-CRP score (AIMS2 component score vs DAS28-CRP) was calculated. AIMS2: 78-item questionnaire assessing 12 scales. Each item was scored as 0 (or 1, best situation) to 4 (worst situation). Sub-total score of each of the 12 scales normalized to a maximum of 10. Total score were calculated for AIMS2 Affect ([Level of tension + Mood]/2), AIMS2 Physical ([Mobility level + Walking and bending + Hand and finger function + Arm function + Self Care + Household tasks]/6), and AIMS2 Symptom (Arthritis pain); total score range from 0 to 10, higher scores indicates worse situation DAS28-CRP was calculated from the number of SJC and TJC count using 28 joint count and CRP (mg/L). Total score range: 0-10, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28 (CRP): &lt;3.2= low DA, &gt;3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high DA and &lt;2.6 = remission.</description>

        <title>Spearman Correlation Coefficient Between Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count and Erythrocyte Sedimentation (DAS 28-ESR) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Fatigue Score</title>
        <description>Spearman correlation coefficient between DAS28-ESR and VAS fatigue (DAS28-ESR vs VAS score) was calculated. DAS28-ESR calculated from the number of SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, ESR (mm/hour) and participant's assessment of disease activity VAS (scores ranging 0 [very well] to 100 mm [extremely bad]). Total score range: 0-10, higher score= more disease activity. DAS28-ESR &lt;= 3.2 = low DA, DAS28 &gt; 3.2 to 5.1 = moderate to high DA and VAS fatigue = Participants recorded their fatigue score on a range of 0 to 10, where higher score indicated higher intensity of fatigue.</description>
