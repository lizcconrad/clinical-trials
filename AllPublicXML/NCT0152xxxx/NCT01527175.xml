  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subclavian vein (SCV) is often the preferred site for central venous access.
      Ultrasound-guided SCV catheterizations with supraclavicular (SC) or infraclavicular (IC)
      approach have been proved to be useful in children. The investigators compared the success
      rate, number of attempts, time tocatheterization, and complication.

    <measure>The duration for susscessful placement of needle into subclavian vein</measure>
    <time_frame>within 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The time needed to place needle into the vein (from needle entry into the skin to aspiration of blood with syringe) was measured. When the duration was recorded as greater than 20 min, the procedure was defined unsuccessful and excluded from the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of attempt for susscessful placement of needle into subclavian vein.</measure>
    <time_frame>within 20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>An 'attempt' was defined as each needle advancement to place needl into the vein. When the duration for susscessful placement of needle into subclavian vein was recorded as greater than 20 min, the procedure was defined unsuccessful and excluded from the analysis.</description>
