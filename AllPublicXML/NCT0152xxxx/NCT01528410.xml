  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open, randomised, and controlled trial conducted in sixty (60)
      patients diagnosed with refractory or recurrent ascites. Patients will be randomised
      (enrolled) to either treatment arm A- implanted with the ALFApump System or treatment arm
      B-standard of care with evacuation large volume paracentesis. The main aims of the study are
      to determine the paracentesis free survival, defined as the time to the first large volume
      therapeutic paracentesis &gt; 5 litres. The secondary aims are to assess non-inferiority of
      cirrhosis-related complications in the group of patients randomized to the ALFApump system
      group, as well as nutritional effects, resource utilisation, patient quality of life and
      survival non-inferiority.
