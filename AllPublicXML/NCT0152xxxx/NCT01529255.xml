      -  The purpose of this study is to to prove that the long-term efficacy of strategy of
           treatment adjustment at W24 according to virological response based on ROADMAP concept
           is better than standard of care strategy.

        -  To evaluate the off-treatment durability of HBeAg seroconversion in patients who
           discontinued treatment due to sustained HBeAg seroconversion and HBV DNA&lt;300copies/ml
           with over 12 months consolidation treatment
