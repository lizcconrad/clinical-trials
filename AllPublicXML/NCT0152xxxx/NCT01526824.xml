  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke or TIA (mini-stroke), as well as in patients
      who are candidates for neuroendovascular stenting, it is standard of care to treat these
      patients with antiplatelet therapy, or &quot;blood-thinners&quot;, the most common of which is
      clopidogrel (Plavix) with or without the addition of aspirin. A relatively common problem
      encountered with these patients is non-responsiveness to clopidogrel therapy. A prior study
      in cardiac patients showed that the addition of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Lovaza,
      or &quot;fish oil&quot;) can increase a patient's response to therapy with clopidogrel, but there have
      been no studies in neuro patients. In this study, patients will be divided into one of two
      groups: in the study arm, patients will receive clopidogrel +/- aspirin as well as Lovaza. In
      the control arm, patients will only receive clopidogrel +/- aspirin. Assays will be done to
      measure responsiveness to clopdiogrel on days 0, 12-24 hours after loading dose, day 3-5 if
      still inpatient, and at a follow-up visit 20-30 days after the start of the study. The
      investigators believe that this study will show an increase in platelet aggregation in
      patients receiving both clopidogrel and Lovaza.
