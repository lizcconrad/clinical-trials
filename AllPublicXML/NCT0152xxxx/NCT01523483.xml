  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study objective is to investigate the effectiveness of vaginal micronized
      progesterone in prolonging pregnancy after an episode of preterm labor which responded to
      tocolytic treatment. Furthermore, the investigators aim is to study the mechanisms of actions
      of progesterone supplementation by examining its effect on the two components of parturition:
      cervical ripening and myometrial contractility. The investigators will utilize transvaginal
      ultrasound to assess the changes in the cervical tissue, and non-invasive trans-abdominal
      uterine EMG to assess the uterine muscle activity. The investigators will also look at the
      effect of progesterone on contraction frequency by tocodynamometer (TOCO), though EMG is
      expected to provide much more information.

    <measure>Changes in uterine electromyographic (EMG) activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every 14 days until delivery or 36+6 weeks of gestation</time_frame>
    <description>EMG tracing will be analyzed using power density spectrum (PDS) and raw signal amplitude techniques to find mean PDS peak frequency and magnitude. Propagation velocity (PV) of uterine EMG signals will be determined from the time interval between signal arrivals at adjacent electrodes. Amplitude and duration of EMG burst plots will also be analyzed. The study groups will be compared with the PDS, PV and EMG burst plots to determine if progesterone alters the EMG in a way that is less likely to proceed toward labor and delivery.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with singleton pregnancies at gestational ages 25+0 to 33+6 weeks after an
             episode of preterm labor, with cervical length ≤25mm:

          -  Patients presenting with signs and symptoms of preterm labor will be admitted and
             given the standard treatment for preterm labor, i.e. tocolysis for 48 hours, and
             antenatal steroids.

          -  Those who will remain undelivered for 48 hours and will be found to have a cervical
             length of 25mm or less will be offered entrance into the study.

          -  Preterm labor will be defined as at least 4 contractions in 30 minutes with cervical
             change assessed by digital cervical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) will be excluded from the
             study, due to the possibility of ascending infection, as will those with suspected
             chorioamnionitis.

          -  We will not include multiple pregnancies.

          -  Patients with medical conditions that contraindicate tocolysis, such as non-reassuring
             fetal heart tracings, will also be excluded.
