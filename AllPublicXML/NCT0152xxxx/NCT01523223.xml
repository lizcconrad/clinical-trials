  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of donor CD8+ memory T-cells in
      treating patients with hematolymphoid malignancies. Giving low dose of chemotherapy before a
      donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may
      also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem
      cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-cancer effects). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of purifying allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells suitable for
      clinical application and to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of these
      cells in patients with recurrent or refractory hematolymphoid malignancies following
      allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine disease response, time to disease progression, event-free survival, and
      overall survival following treatment with allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

      II. To assess donor specific chimerism before and at designated time points after treatment
      with allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients undergo CD8+ memory T-cell infusion over 10-20 minutes.
