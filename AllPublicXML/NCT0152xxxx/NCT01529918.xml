    <textblock>
      This pilot RCT study aims to develop and evaluate the uptake, feasibility, and potential
      value of a strategy for web-diabetes risk assessment versus paper-based methods in an
      undiagnosed diabetes population over 40 years of age from all listed FHT provided through an
      electronic medical record database. Following randomization, intervention participants will
      have the option to decide to use web-based self-screening and the control group will receive
      only a paper-based method. There will be two options for web-based screening; one involves
      completion of the CAN-RISK screening tool as part of a personal health record self-management
      program (MyOscar) versus a one off online risk-assessment. The intervention and control group
      will be compared with respect to risk-assessment uptake. Educational sessions and further
      assessment of diabetes conducted by the clinical health care team will be offered to all
      participants who scored a high risk of diabetes in accordance with the CAN-RISK results.
      Actual numbers of diabetes cases in those with a high risk score will be compared between the
      intervention and control groups as well as compared to the usual method of diabetes screening
      in a randomly chosen non-identifiable sample from the same clinical setting in the same one
      year period. The assessment of patient acceptability in feasibility of the implementation of
      the self-screening tool will be accomplished through surveys designed to be completed by
      patients and staff.
