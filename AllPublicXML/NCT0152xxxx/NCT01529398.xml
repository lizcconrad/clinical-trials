  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with knee osteoarthritis (OA) have functional instability and defective neuromuscular
      function, it was recently suggested that sensorimotor exercises may be important and needed
      to improve the effectiveness of training programs for these patients. This study objective
      was to compare the effectiveness of a supervised resistance muscular training (RT) versus
      sensorimotor training (SMT) for patients with Knee OA, on decrease of pain and functional
      improvement.

    <description>The group realized 16 weeks of resistance training for the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, twice a week, with duration of 30 minutes each session. The intervention included strength leg raises, simple quadriceps and hamstring strengthening with cuff weights realized in 3 sets of ten repetition maximum(10RM) for each muscle group. The group also realized stretching exercises for lower limbs and received orientation about the knee osteoarthritis.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group also received information about knee osteoarthritis and realized the same warm-up and cool-down intervention realized in the interventional groups. During 16 weeks they went to the ambulatory twice a week to perform 5 minutes of stationary bicycle and 5 minutes of stretching exercises for lower limbs.</description>
