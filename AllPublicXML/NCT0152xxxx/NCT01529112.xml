    <measure>The Percentage of Participants With The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 Symptom Scores Achieving Clinically Significant Deterioration on Quality of Life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 of Cycle 1 (prior to treatment in Cycle 1)), every 4 weeks during treatment, and 4 weeks after completing treatment or up to approximately 2 years (data cut-off date of 21 January 2014)</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom score, a cancer specific self-reporting questionnaire was composed of 9-symptom scales assessing fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties. All of the multi-item scales and single-item measures ranged in score from 0 to 100. For each domain and item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the raw score to a range from 0 to 100, with a higher scale score representing a higher response level/ high level of symptomatology / problems. The data is presented as percentage of participants with EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom score achieving clinically significant deterioration on QOL. Participants were considered as deteriorated for a given symptom if the change in score from Baseline was 10 points or higher at any time point after Baseline. The data presented is based on the data cut-off date of 21 January 2014 while the study is still ongoing.</description>

    <description>The EORTC module QLQ-LC13 symptom score was a self-reporting cancer-specific questionnaire composed of 13 questions incorporated into 1 multi-item scale designed to evaluate dyspnea and a series of single items assessing different types of pain, as well as, cough, hemoptysis, dysphagia, sore mouth, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy. For each domain and item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the raw score to a range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible function/QOL, and highest burden of symptoms for symptom domains and single items. The data is presented as percentage of participants with EORTC module QLQ-C13 symptom score achieving clinically significant deterioration on QOL. Participants were considered as deteriorated for a given symptom if the change in score from Baseline was 10 points or higher at any time point after Baseline. The data presented is based on the data cut-off date of 21 January 2014 while the study is still ongoing.</description>

        <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered with an investigational product. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose; resulted in death, was life-threatening (i.e., the subject was at a risk of death at the time of the event; this did not include an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or was a congenital abnormality/birth defect. In this study, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (defined as an AE (serious/non-serious) that started/increased in severity on/after the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the final dose of study medication) were assessed.</description>
        <time_frame>For each participant, from the first dose till 30 days after the last dose or up to approximately 2 years (data cut-off date of 21 January 2014)</time_frame>

        <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom score, a cancer specific self-reporting questionnaire was composed of 9-symptom scales assessing fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties. All of the multi-item scales and single-item measures ranged in score from 0 to 100. For each domain and item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the raw score to a range from 0 to 100, with a higher scale score representing a higher response level/ high level of symptomatology / problems. The data is presented as percentage of participants with EORTC QLQ-C30 symptom score achieving clinically significant deterioration on QOL. Participants were considered as deteriorated for a given symptom if the change in score from Baseline was 10 points or higher at any time point after Baseline.

        <title>The Percentage of Participants With The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Module QLQ-LC13 (Lung Cancer 13) Symptom Scores Achieving Clinically Significant Deterioration on QOL</title>
        <description>The EORTC module QLQ-LC13 symptom score was a self-reporting cancer-specific questionnaire composed of 13 questions incorporated into 1 multi-item scale designed to evaluate dyspnea and a series of single items assessing different types of pain, as well as, cough, hemoptysis, dysphagia, sore mouth, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy. For each domain and item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the raw score to a range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible function/QOL, and highest burden of symptoms for symptom domains and single items. The data is presented as percentage of participants with EORTC module QLQ-C13 symptom score achieving clinically significant deterioration on QOL. Participants were considered as deteriorated for a given symptom if the change in score from Baseline was 10 points or higher at any time point after Baseline. The data presented is based on the data cut-off date of 21 January 2014 while the study is still ongoing.</description>

          <description>The EORTC module QLQ-LC13 symptom score was a self-reporting cancer-specific questionnaire composed of 13 questions incorporated into 1 multi-item scale designed to evaluate dyspnea and a series of single items assessing different types of pain, as well as, cough, hemoptysis, dysphagia, sore mouth, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy. For each domain and item, a linear transformation was applied to standardize the raw score to a range from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the best possible function/QOL, and highest burden of symptoms for symptom domains and single items. The data is presented as percentage of participants with EORTC module QLQ-C13 symptom score achieving clinically significant deterioration on QOL. Participants were considered as deteriorated for a given symptom if the change in score from Baseline was 10 points or higher at any time point after Baseline. The data presented is based on the data cut-off date of 21 January 2014 while the study is still ongoing.</description>
