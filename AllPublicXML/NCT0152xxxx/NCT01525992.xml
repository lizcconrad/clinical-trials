      In this study the investigators aim to evaluate the impact of a community pharmacy-based
      program to educate type 2 diabetic patients about medications, life style and self-care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a progressive metabolic disorder that leads to several
      morbidities and increased mortality and costs. Studies showed that strict control of blood
      glucose in diabetic patients reduces patients' risk of microvascular complications. Community
      pharmacies are a well-placed healthcare facility located at the heart of the community with
      convenient access to pharmacists as health care professionals. Some studies have shown
      effective interventions led by community and clinical pharmacist in developed countries. In
      developing countries, little evidence exists about feasibility of implementing community
      pharmacy-based services to promote medications adherence, self glucose monitoring and
      self-care in diabetic patients.

      This study is a 2 arm randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients are referred to the
      community pharmacy from an endocrinologist's office. Of 135 type-2 diabetic patients who will
      be recruited in the study,68 will be randomly allocated to the intervention arm using
      telephone balanced blocked randomization method.

      A community pharmacy-based program will provide training about medications, life style and
      self-care to the intervention arm. The control arm (67 patients) will receive usual care
      during the study period.

      The primary outcome of this study is measured as change in hemoglobin A1C pre and post
      intervention. As the secondary outcome, medications adherence, diabetes self-care activity,
      body mass index and blood pressure are measured.

    <description>A trained pharmacist will counsel each patient based on his/her individual needs about medications, life style and self-care. The pharmacist will use a checklist to document the type of education delivered to each patient. A glucometer is provided for each patient in this arm to monitor blood glucose daily. Three to six visits to the community pharmacy are set during the 6-months study period. At each visit, medication related problems and self-care issues are discussed with the patient and the glucometer test strips are provided for the following month. A telephone call will be made to each patient between visits to ensure adherence to drug therapy and resolve any problems .</description>
