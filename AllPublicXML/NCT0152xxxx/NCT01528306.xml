    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to see if HP802-247, an investigational treatment with living
      human skin cells, helps to heal blisters or wounds in subjects with Dystrophic Epidermolysis
      Bullosa (DEB). The durability of the skin in healed wounds treated with HP802-247 will also
      be assessed.

          -  Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of DEB with recurring blisters, ≥ 2 years of age at
             Screening. Subjects may be of either sex and of any race or skin type provided that
             their skin color, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not interfere with the
             study assessments.

          -  A parent or legally authorized representative must be willing and able to ensure
             subject is present for all required study visits.

          -  A parent or legally authorized representative must be able to follow instructions.

          -  Have an open wound for ≤ 72 hours that:

               -  is still open and has not scabbed or crusted over

               -  has no dermatologic disease and/or condition in the treatment area (other than
                  DEB with recurring blisters), including active or recent infection (within 7
                  days) that may be exacerbated by treatment, require treatment with antibiotics /

                  with examination

               -  is ≥ 4 cm² and ≤ 48 cm2 in total area (open portion)

          -  Females of childbearing potential (defined as post-menarcheal as documented in the
             medical history) may participate in the study if they meet all of the following

               -  they are not breast feeding;

               -  they have a negative urine pregnancy test at Week 1 Period 1;

               -  they agree to undertake scheduled urine pregnancy tests at Week 1 for Periods 1,
                  2, &amp; 3 and at study exit

               -  they do not intend to become pregnant during the study;

               -  they are using adequate birth control methods and they agree to continue using

          -  A parent or legally authorized representative must be willing and able to ensure
             subject is present for all required study visits (for minor subjects)

          -  A parent or legally authorized representative must be able to follow instructions (for
             minor subjects)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications or hypersensitivity to the use of the test article, their components
             (e.g., aprotinin, fibrinogen), or substances used in the manufacture of the test
             article (e.g., penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, bovine serum albumin).

          -  Therapy with another investigational agent within thirty (30) days of the Screening
             Visit, or during the study.

          -  Have uncontrolled intercurrent or chronic illness that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements, represents a potential
             safety risk, or require treatment with an excluded drug/treatment.

          -  The Investigator or Medical Monitor may declare any subject ineligible for a valid
             medical reason.
