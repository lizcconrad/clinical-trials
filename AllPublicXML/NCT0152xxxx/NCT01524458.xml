  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      rimary spastic esophageal motility disorders, though uncommon, induce significant symptoms to
      patients including dysphagia, spastic chest pain, regurgitation as well as heartburn. The
      commonest causes of spastic esophageal motility disorders included Achalasia, hypertensive
      lower esophageal sphincter (LES), Nutcracker esophagus and Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES).
      Majority of these diseases were diagnosed by manometry. Achalasia is the most common primary
      esophageal motility disorder in which the LES failed to relax with increased pressure.
      Currently the standard treatment for Achalasia and spastic motility disorders is Laparoscopic
      Myotomy. The development of Natural Orifices Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (N.O.T.E.S.) has
      lead to a new way to perform myotomy - Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (P.O.E.M.). Basically,
      through mucosal incision, a submucosal tunnel is created after identification of the level of
      gastroesophageal junction. Myotomy will be performed with endoscopic instruments and the
      entrance site will be closed with clips.
