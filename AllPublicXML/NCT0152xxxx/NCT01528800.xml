    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if vitamin K supplementation three times per week reduces
      the progression of coronary artery calcification over 12 months in dialysis patients compared
      to placebo?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At every stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), the leading cause of mortality is
      cardiovascular disease. This is due, in part, to vascular calcification of the coronary
      arteries. The extent of VC in the coronary arteries of patients with CKD is commonly
      determined by high resolution CT scan. The total coronary artery calcium (CAC) score,
      measured in Agatston units (AUs), reflects the calcium burden in the 3 major coronary
      arteries and is the current standard for determining extent of vascular calcification in
      hemodialysis patients. Matrix Gla protein (MGP), a vitamin K dependent protein, is a key
      inhibitor of vascular calcification and is present in the arterial wall. It is established
      that MGP becomes up-regulated adjacent to sites of calcification and that vitamin K is
      critical to its function. Therefore vitamin K status may be critical to the extent of
      vascular calcification in this patient group. However, to date, no trial has examined whether
      vitamin K supplementation prevents the progression of coronary artery calcification in
      patients with kidney failure, a group in which high risk has been established. Therefore, our
      primary research question is: Does vitamin K supplementation with 10 mg of phylloquinone
      thrice weekly reduce the progression of coronary artery calcification (as measured by CAC
      score) over 12 months in incident hemodialysis patients with a baseline CAC score of &gt;= 30
      Agatston Units compared to placebo? Secondary questions include: 1) Does phylloquinone reduce
      the progression of calcification in the thoracic aorta, aortic valve and mitral valve? and 2)
      Does phylloquinone decrease major cardiovascular events such as acute coronary syndrome,
      congestive heart failure, stroke, transient ischemic attack, amputation or revascularization
      procedure?
