  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether in the setting of primary health care it
      is effective to treat with metronidazole returning travellers with gastrointestinal symptoms
      and B. hominis in the stool or not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of B. hominis is between 30-50% in developing countries. Many travellers visit
      developing countries and are therefore at risk to be infected by this parasite. It's frequent
      that travellers return from developing countries with gastro-intestinal symptoms and
      approximately 10% of them have B. hominis as the sole parasite identified in the stools. Some
      anti-infective drugs, including metronidazole, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and
      nitazoxanide, have shown to have activity against B. hominis, but there is still controversy
      about the pathogenic potential of B. hominis and there is no consensus about the indications
      for treatment.

      It is hypothesised that metronidazole is more effective than placebo in returning travellers
      with gastrointestinal symptoms and B. hominis as the sole intestinal parasite identified in
      the stool.
