  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of hygienic socks with antifungal agent-loaded microcapsules for subjects
      with interdigital type tinea pedis (athlete's foot between the toes). This is a 6 week study
      which has a 2 week treatment period and a 4 week follow-up evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinea pedis (Athlete's Foot) is a common skin disease which affects a large number of the
      population. The development of hygienic socks through the microencapsulation technology have
      great potential to provide the convenient pharmacological treatment on one hand, and good
      moisture management which can reduce the microbial overgrowth on the other hand for patients
      with tinea pedis. The socks, therefore, reduce the effects of the skin disease on the quality
      of life.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be at least 18 years of age and of either sex.

          -  Subjects must have clinical evidence of interdigital tinea pedis of one or both feet
             characterized by: (i) moderate erythema, (ii) scaling and (iii) mild pruritis.

          -  Have microscopic evidence (positive KOH) of the presence of fungi. Evaluable subjects
             must have a positive KOH and a fungal culture positive for a dermatophyte in the skin
             scrapings taken at the Baseline Visit. Subjects with a positive KOH may be entered
             into the study pending the results of the fungal culture

          -  Be willing and able to give informed consent/assent or have their parent/guardian do
             so, if applicable.

          -  Be willing and able to use the assigned study medication as directed and to commit to
             all follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          -  Be in good health and free of any disease or physical condition which might, in the
             Investigator's opinion, expose the subject to an unacceptable risk by study
             participation.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating and not intending to become pregnant
             during the course of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study.

             prior to the start of the study.

          -  Has received systemic antifungal therapy within 4 weeks prior to the start of the
             study medication.

          -  Has used systemic antibacterials or systemic corticosteroids within 4 weeks prior to
             the start of the study. Systemic corticosteroids do not include intranasal, inhaled,
             and ophthalmic corticosteroids used for the management of allergies, pulmonary
             disorders or other conditions.

          -  Has a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or is immunocompromised (due to
             disease, e.g., HIV, or medications).

          -  Has concurrent tinea infection e.g. Tinea Versicolor, Tinea Cruris, Moccasin-type
             Tinea Pedis, etc. (in the opinion of the Investigator).

          -  Onychomycosis, involving ≥ 20% of the area of either great toenail or involvement of
             more than five toenails in total.

          -  Has any other skin disease which might interfere with the evaluation of tinea pedis.

          -  Is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study.

          -  Has received an investigational drug or treatment with an investigational device
             within 30 days prior to entering this study.

          -  Is unreliable, including subjects with a history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Has known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the study medications.
