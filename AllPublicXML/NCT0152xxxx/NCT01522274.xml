    <textblock>
      This research study is for FEMALE cigarette smokers who want to quit smoking.

      Participants will be provided with brief quit-smoking education at the beginning of the study
      and will receive the nicotine patch for 10 weeks, free of charge.

      Participants will be assigned to either an exercise program or a general health education
      program. The exercise and health education programs will take place over 14 weeks, with
      follow-up appointments 3, 6, and 12 months after the end of the 14-week program.

      There is no fee for any part of this study and participants will be compensated for their
      time.

      Participants must complete telephone screening process first.

      All eligible participants must attend an orientation session when the investigators will
      explain the study in detail. After this session, interested participants will complete a
      consent form and the investigators will collect blood pressure, resting heart rate, body mass
      index (height/weight), and a carbon monoxide sample to confirm eligibility. The investigators
      will then explain the physician consent process (all eligible and interested participants
      must obtain consent from a physician or clinic that they have seen in the past year to
      confirm that it is safe for them to participate).
