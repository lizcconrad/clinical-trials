      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to confirm the safety and
      determine the immune response of the killed oral cholera vaccine in healthy adults and
      children in Ethiopia.

      This study serves as a bridging trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a two dose
      regimen of the WC-OCV (Shanchol®) in Ethiopian population. In order to assess whether the
      bivalent killed oral cholera vaccine may be used safely among those who are most at risk for
      cholera, we need to determine the safety and immunogenicity of the killed oral cholera
      vaccine. The vaccine was evaluated in a large number of human subjects in India Vietnam, and
      Bangladesh, in which it has demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and clinical protective
      efficacy. Though we do not expect the vaccine to act differently in the Ethiopian population,
      we aim to confirm our presumptive understanding that two doses of WC-OCV is safe and
      immunogenic in healthy volunteers at one year and above (exclusive of pregnant women).
      Findings from this study can pave the way for the possible use of the killed whole cell oral
      cholera vaccine in both endemic and outbreak settings at a larger scale.

Non-biological placebo of above composition has been used in 2010 for &quot;Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of orally administered, killed, bivalent whole-cell , cholera vaccine, Shanchol in Bangladeshi Adults and Children&quot;. This study involving 330 subjects was carried out at International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) located in Dhaka, Bangladesh with Dr. Firdausi Qadri as Principal Investigator (NCT01042951). There were no safety concerns associated with this placebo in this study and the report of this study has been submitted to the National Regulators in Bangladesh and the World Health Organization.</description>
