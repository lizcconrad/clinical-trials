      The Objective is to determine if renal hypothermia during open partial nephrectomy results in
      improved post-operative renal function compared to warm ischemia.

      Primary Aim is to determine the effect of hypothermia on preservation of overall renal
      function compared to no hypothermia in patients who require hilar vessel clamping during open
      partial nephrectomy for a renal tumor.

      Hypothesis: Hypothermia will result in improved post-operative preservation of overall renal
      function.

      Secondary Aim is to determine the effect of hypothermia on preservation of affected renal
      function (kidney with the tumor) compared to no hypothermia in patients who require hilar
      vessel clamping during open partial nephrectomy for a renal tumor.

      Hypothesis: Hypothermia will result in improved post-operative preservation of affected renal
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of renal cell carcinoma is increasing and in 2008 it is estimated that over
      51,000 new renal cancers will be diagnosed in the United States. To preserve renal function,
      urologists commonly remove the diseased segment of the kidney (partial nephrectomy) instead
      of removing the entire kidney (radical nephrectomy). While the benefit of preserving function
      in patients with renal cell carcinoma has become clear, optimal preservation techniques are
      yet to be determined. Specifically, the role of hypothermia during partial nephrectomy has
      been inadequately studied despite theoretical benefit. The investigators objective is to
      assess the effectiveness of renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy. The investigators
      hypothesis is that renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy results in improved
      post-operative renal function compared to warm ischemia.

      Methods: To test the investigators hypothesis, 180 partial nephrectomy patients will be
      randomized to cold or warm ischemia. Global and side-specific renal function will be assessed
      pre-operatively and 12 months post-operatively using radionucleotide clearance and renal
      scintigraphy.

      Significance: To the investigators knowledge, this study will be the first prospective trial
      to evaluate the clinical impact of renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy. Since renal
      function preservation is the primary purpose of partial nephrectomy, these findings will have
      an important impact on surgical technique and patient outcome.

    <description>Within 10 seconds of clamping the renal vessels, the kidney will be encased with saline ice slush for a period of 10 minutes. The slush will be created from sterile saline using an operating room slush machine. The slush is applied by the surgeon and lightly packed around the kidney to ensure complete coverage with at least a 2 cm layer. Slush removal is performed by the surgeon beginning at the 10 minute mark. Enough slush is removed to uncover the tumour area. Surgical incision of the kidney begins as soon as the tumour area is uncovered.
When reconstruction of the kidney is complete, the slush is completely removed from the surgical field and the clamps are removed from the renal vein and artery.</description>
