  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common clinical dose-limiting adverse
      drug reaction, and the primary manifestations are different degree of neuromotor,
      sensorineural and autonomic nervous dysfunction.

      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel clinical trial is
      to observe the efficacy and safety of the Acetyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride enteric-coated
      tablets in treatment of peripheral sensory neuropathy that anti-cancer chemotherapeutics
      induce.
