      The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Simons Variation in Individuals Project
      (Simons VIP) is currently recruiting healthy controls for a study aimed at better
      understanding autism spectrum disorder. The UCSF site of the Simons VIP is conducting
      functional and structural imaging, neuropsychological evaluation, genetic testing, and
      neurologic exams in healthy individuals to compare with findings in autism spectrum disorder.

      To better understand autism spectrum disorders, the UCSF Simons VIP team is recruiting
      healthy controls to participate in a study involving brain imaging and psychological
      assessments and questionnaires. The study will involve phone interviews, cognitive testing
      and questionnaires, genetic testing, physical exam, photographs, non-invasive brain imaging
      sessions (MRI and MEG). The study can take up to 17 hours to complete, and there may be up to
