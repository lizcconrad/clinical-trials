    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Singapore. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of the study drug in healthy people and investigate how much of the study drug
      gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it. Information about
      any side effects that may occur will also be collected.
