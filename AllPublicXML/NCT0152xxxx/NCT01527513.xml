      This will be a 2-part multicentre study in approximately 117 patients. Part I of the study
      will consist of a 4-week prospective observational baseline period, a 12-week double-blind
      period (4-week up-titration and 8-week maintenance), and a tapering-off period.

      After the screening visit (V1), patients will enter the baseline period. At the end of the
      baseline period (V2), eligible patients will be randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to receive
      double-blind treatment with Eslicarbazepine acetate or Placebo in addition to concomitant
      therapy with 1 or 2 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs). Concomitant AED therapy will be kept stable
      during the whole study.

      Initial dose of the study treatment will be 10 mg/kg/day. After 2-weeks on 10 mg/kg/day, the
      dose will be up-titrated to 20 mg/kg/day (maximum 1200 mg/day). After 2 weeks on 20
      mg/kg/day, dose will be up-titrated to 30 mg/kg/day (maximum 1200 mg/day) and patients will
      receive this dose for 8 weeks. If intolerable adverse events (AEs) occur, the patient can be
      down-titrated to the previous dose (only 1 down-titration step will be allowed) or
      discontinued. After the 8-week maintenance period, the study treatment will be tapered off in
      10 mg/kg/day 2 week steps. However, if a patient experiences an increase in seizure frequency
      (e.g. more than 100% increase vs. baseline) during tapering-off, the patient can proceed
      directly to the open-label part of the study (Part II).

      After completion of the last 2-week 10 mg/kg/day step, patients will have the option to enter
      a 1 year open-label treatment (Part II) with Eslicarbazepine acetate (up to 30 mg/kg/day,
      maximum 1200 mg/day), or will have a 4 week observational follow-up period.

    <description>Power of Attention was defined as the sum of the reaction time measures from the attentional tasks (simple [dominant hand only] reaction time, choice reaction time and digit vigilance speed) in order to assess information processing speed and attention/psychomotor speed.Change from baseline to the end of the double-blind period in Power of Attention will be compared between the treatment groups using an ANCOVA. Non-inferiority of ESL vs Placebo will be assessed by comparing the 95% CI's upper bound of the difference of Least Squares Mean (LSmeans) between treatment groups (ESL-placebo) with 121 ms. If the upper bound is greater than 121 ms then the null hypothesis that the change from baseline in the Power of Attention score in ESL group is at least 121 ms inferior than the placebo group will be rejected. Single Values were calculated the average of post treatment visits (visits 5 and 7or EDV) minus average of baseline visits (visits 1 and 2)</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Power of Attention Score to the End of the Double Blind (DB) Period</title>
        <description>Power of Attention was defined as the sum of the reaction time measures from the attentional tasks (simple [dominant hand only] reaction time, choice reaction time and digit vigilance speed) in order to assess information processing speed and attention/psychomotor speed.Change from baseline to the end of the double-blind period in Power of Attention will be compared between the treatment groups using an ANCOVA. Non-inferiority of ESL vs Placebo will be assessed by comparing the 95% CI’s upper bound of the difference of Least Squares Mean (LSmeans) between treatment groups (ESL-placebo) with 121 ms. If the upper bound is greater than 121 ms then the null hypothesis that the change from baseline in the Power of Attention score in ESL group is at least 121 ms inferior than the placebo group will be rejected. Single Values were calculated the average of post treatment visits (visits 5 and 7or EDV) minus average of baseline visits (visits 1 and 2)</description>
        <time_frame>Visit 1 (-4 weeks for training), Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 5 (6 weeks), Visit 7 (12 weeks) or at early discontinuation visit (EDV)</time_frame>
        <population>The primary analysis was based on the Cognitive Per-protocol (PP) population – all patients in the Modified Cognitive Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population who completed the 8-week maintenance period and were not Important Protocol Deviations (IPDs) with respect to the primary cognitive endpoint.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Power of Attention Score to the End of the Double Blind (DB) Period</title>
          <description>Power of Attention was defined as the sum of the reaction time measures from the attentional tasks (simple [dominant hand only] reaction time, choice reaction time and digit vigilance speed) in order to assess information processing speed and attention/psychomotor speed.Change from baseline to the end of the double-blind period in Power of Attention will be compared between the treatment groups using an ANCOVA. Non-inferiority of ESL vs Placebo will be assessed by comparing the 95% CI’s upper bound of the difference of Least Squares Mean (LSmeans) between treatment groups (ESL-placebo) with 121 ms. If the upper bound is greater than 121 ms then the null hypothesis that the change from baseline in the Power of Attention score in ESL group is at least 121 ms inferior than the placebo group will be rejected. Single Values were calculated the average of post treatment visits (visits 5 and 7or EDV) minus average of baseline visits (visits 1 and 2)</description>
          <population>The primary analysis was based on the Cognitive Per-protocol (PP) population – all patients in the Modified Cognitive Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population who completed the 8-week maintenance period and were not Important Protocol Deviations (IPDs) with respect to the primary cognitive endpoint.</population>
