    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase I study with two parts. Part Two with SCH900776 in combination
      with hydroxyurea will not be pursued at this time.

      Part One investigates monotherapy with oral hydroxyurea. The primary objective is to
      determine whether a tolerated dose (TD) of hydroxyurea as a single agent can increase the
      percentage of tumor cells in S and G2 phase of the cell cycle. For this reason, all patients
      in Part One must have a tumor lesion accessible for a skin punch biopsy. Tumor biopsies will
      be obtained on two separate occasions: prior to hydroxyurea and at 16-18h after starting
      hydroxurea therapy on day 1 only.

      A baseline 12-lead ECG will be obtained from each study participant. Single-agent hydroxyurea
      will be administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle, for ONE cycle only. On these days
      oral hydroxyurea will be started in the late afternoon and administered every 4 hours for a
      total of 6 doses.

      Venous (up to 10 mL) blood samples will be obtained at time zero (pretreatment), 30 min, 1h,
      1.5 2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5 and 4h following the first oral dose of hydroxyurea, and pretreatment
      and at the same times following the sixth oral dose of hydroxyurea (i.e., 20, 20.5, 21, 21.5,
      22, 22.5, 23, 23.5 and 24 h).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Advanced or metastatic, histologically/cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumors
             or lymphoma which has progressed on standard therapy.

          2. Study participants must have a Karnofsky Performance status of &gt; 70.

          3. Study participants must have a predicted life expectancy of at least 3 months.

          4. Study participants must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          5. Study participants must be at least 18 years.

          6. Study participants (and/or parent/guardian for study participants who are otherwise
             unable to provide independent consent) must be willing and able to give written
             informed consent and adhere to study visit schedules.

          7. A female study participant of child-bearing potential or a male study participant and
             their female sexual partner(s) of child-bearing potential who are sexually active must
             agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception prior to enrollment while
             receiving protocol-specified medication and for 6 months after stopping the
             medication. Acceptable methods of contraception include double-barrier methods such as
             male or female condom in combination with spermicides, or diaphragm or cervical cap
             with spermicides, or medically prescribed intrauterine device. Contraceptive
             medication (i.e. oral contraceptives) vasectomy and tubal ligation should each be
             considered a single barrier.

          8. A female study participant of child-bearing potential or a male subject and their
             female sexual partner(s) of child-bearing potential who are not currently sexually
             active must agree to use a medically accepted method of contraception should they
             become active while participating in the study.

          9. Premenopausal women will require a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study
             entry.

         10. Study participants must have adequate renal function as evidenced by an estimated
             creatinine clearance (eCrCl using the Cockcroft-Gault formula) of &gt; 60 mL/min.

         11. Study participants must have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute
             neutrophil counts (ANC) ≥ 1500 µL, and platelet counts ≥100,000 µL.

         12. Study participants, except those with Gilbert's Syndrome, must have adequate hepatic
             function as evidenced by serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN and AST/ALT levels ≤ 2.5 x
             ULN for the reference laboratory. If the study participant has known hepatic
             metastatic disease then AST/ALT should be ≤ 5.0 x ULN.

         13. Tumor site accessible for both pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies will be
             required for a minimum of 67% of study participants in each dose cohort where &quot;n&quot; is
             at least 3. In PART ONE of the study the first cohort-dose level 0, (who will receive
             hydroxyurea plus zero mg of SCH900776) is unique in that all participants in this
             cohort will be required to have biopsiable tumor sites.
