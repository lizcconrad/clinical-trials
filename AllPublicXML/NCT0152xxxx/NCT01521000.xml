      Primary Objective: To determine whether early intervention (with garment sleeve and gauntlet)
      in patients with pre-clinical lymphedema can halt the progression of lymphedema.

      Secondary Objectives:To evaluate whether bioimpedance is an accurate, reliable method to
      measure pre-clinical and clinical lymphedema.

      Tertiary Objective: To determine whether bioimpedance analysis is better than the gold
      standard of volume displacement to measure lymphedema.

      The successful completion of this study will address whether bioimpedance analysis is a
      reliable, accurate method to measure pre-clinical and clinical lymphedema. In addition, we
      intend to evaluate whether bioimpedance analysis is better than the gold standard of volume
      displacement for measuring lymphedema. And most importantly, we will evaluate whether a short
      trial of compression garments in women identified to have pre-clinical lymphedema can
      actually halt the progression of disease. Bryn Mawr Hospital would propose to publish the
      research and findings of this study, which may have future bearing on the post-operative
      therapeutic management of subjects with pre-clinical lymphedema following axillary surgery.
