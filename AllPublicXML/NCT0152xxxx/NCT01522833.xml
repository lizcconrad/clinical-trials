  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With roughly 80% of cancer patients receiving their oncology care in the community setting,
      the investigators are proposing to sample from a community-based center to evaluate the
      percentage of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-wild type patients that gain benefit
      from erlotinib and assess the clinical characteristics that are associated with
      erlotinib-responders. Additionally, biopsy specimens from enrolled patient cases that are
      EGFR-wt will be evaluated via exploratory genetic analysis for correlated markers.

      Tissue-testing will be performed or test results will be reviewed to identify EGFR-wt and
      EGFR mutation positive advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient cases with an
      erlotinib-treatment duration of six months or longer (as 2nd/3rd line and/or maintenance
      single-agent therapy) in a community-based setting.

      Biopsy specimens from enrolled patient cases who are EGFR-wt will be evaluated via
      exploratory genetic analysis for correlated biomarkers.
