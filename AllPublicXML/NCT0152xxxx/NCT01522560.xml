  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Professionalism is one of the six competences required by The Accreditation for Graduate
      Medical Education Outcome Project to be taught and evaluated during residency. Anesthesia
      residents are faced with unique communication challenges in their practice including brief
      contact time with their patients, operating room efficiency pressure, etc. To assess
      professionalism in Anesthesiology residents is important to obtain evaluations from people
      with whom they interact including patients, surgeons, colleagues and members of the support
      team. The Multisource feedback (MSF) approach has been used to evaluate communication skills
      and professionalism among practicing physicians and residents in a variety of settings. This
      evaluation model has never been used previously to evaluate anesthesia residents. The
      investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to validate and evaluate a MSF in
      professionalism for anesthesia residents. Participants include eighty residents doing two
      months rotation in Pediatric Anesthesia Department at The Cleveland Clinic Anesthesia
      Institute from July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2013. MSF questionnaires will be validated using
      face and content validity methods and comparing them with the current system of evaluation.
      Residents will be randomly assigned to a feedback group or to the control group. Both groups
      will receive MSF evaluation from the faculty, patients' parent and coworker. Only the group
      assigned to feedback is going to have a 'coaching meeting' every month to identify strengths
      and weaknesses and create strategies for improvement. The investigators are planning to
      compare the mean values of the baseline evaluations with the mean values obtained after the
      first and second months from the MSF.

    <description>We will assess the impact of feedback using the MSF (versus no feedback) on the professional behavior of anesthesia residents as measured by the MSF. The randomized groups of residents with and without feedback will be compared on mean MSF score after the first and second months of the rotation using a linear mixed effects model to account for the correlation between measurements on the same resident and to adjust for baseline score as a covariate.</description>

    <description>Residents will be randomly assigned to a feedback group or to the control group. Besides the standard evaluation at the end of the rotation, in both groups, residents will receive every week a MSF evaluation from the faculty, the patients' parent, and the coworker. Also, for every resident a baseline self assessment will be applied at the beginning and at the end of the rotation. Only the group assigned to feedback is going to have a 'coaching meeting' every month with the Chairman of Department of Pediatric Anesthesia to identify strengths and weaknesses and create strategies for improvement, based on the MSF.</description>
