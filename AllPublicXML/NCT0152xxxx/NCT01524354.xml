  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study was to evaluate the significance of monitoring anesthetic depth for the
      conduct of anesthesia and the early postoperative period in patients subjected to surgical
      correction of combined valvular disorders.

      Our aim was to evaluate the effect of monitoring anesthetic depth on duration of
      postoperative mechanical ventilation and ICU stay after surgical correction of combined
      valvular disorders.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Criteria for termination of postoperative respiratory support were the following: patient able to cooperate; adequate muscular tone; SpO2 &gt; 95% with FiO2 0.5; PaCO2 &lt; 45 mm Hg; postoperative bleeding rate &lt; 50 mL hr-1; stable hemodynamics without inotropic/vasopressor support; body temperature of &gt; 35 Â°C. Temporary pacing was not regarded as a contraindication for tracheal extubation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>length of ICU stay</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The time until 'fit for ICU discharge' criteria as well as the actual length of the ICU stay were registered. The 'fit for ICU discharge' criteria included the following: fully oriented patient, SaO2 &gt; 90% on room air, no episodes of severe arrhythmias, bleeding &lt; 50 mL hr-1, diuresis &gt; 0.5 mL kg-1 hr-1, no need for inotropic/vasopressor support and no signs of ischemia on ECG.</description>
