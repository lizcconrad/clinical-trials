  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the clear and often stated need, a formal transition program does not exist for
      asthma patients as they move from pediatric to adult care in Western Canada. This population
      is not having their health care needs met. The investigators proposed study would evaluate a
      well structured transition program designed to facilitate continuity of care for this at risk
      patient population.

      Primary hypothesis: A pediatric-to-adult asthma transition program will improve the
      asthma-specific quality of life of young asthma patients in the Calgary area over a 1 year
      period.

      Secondary hypothesis: A pediatric-to-adult asthma transition program will improve asthma
      control, decrease asthma exacerbations, and reduce health care utilization in young asthma
      patients in the Calgary area over a 1 year period.
