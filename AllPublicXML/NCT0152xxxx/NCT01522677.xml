  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis for this study is that it is safe and feasible to administer
      intraluminal photodynamic therapy (PDT) to colon cancers by colonoscopy to induce localized
      inflammatory/immune response. The objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of
      PDT to colon cancer patients administered before surgery and to characterize the
      inflammatory/immune response at the tumor site and systemically. The long-term objective of
      these studies is to modify he natural biology of colorectal cancers and improve patient
      survival.

      The central hypothesis for this study is that it is safe and feasible to administer
      intraluminal photodynamic therapy (PDT) to colon cancers, via colonoscopy, in the neoadjuvant
      setting to induce localized tumor cell death and an inflammatory/immune response with an
      increased Th1 component, utilizing 5-ALA as a photosensitizer. The objective is to conduct an
      initial phase I/II clinical study to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of colonoscopic,
      neoadjuvant intraluminal PDT to colon cancer patients administered 96 hours pre-resection, to
      characterize the inflammatory/immune response at the PDT treated tumor site, and to evaluate
      the systemic anti-tumor immune response. The long-term objective of these studies is to
      provide an easily administered, adjunctive, therapeutic maneuver that lacks systemic
      toxicity, with the potential to modulate the natural biology of colorectal cancers that have
      not elicited a favorable anti-tumor immune response and to improve patient survival.

    <description>Define biologic efficacy of PDT in relation to generation of an immune response at the tumor site and systemically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologically proven diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

          2. Have clinical stage I, II, or III disease.

          3. Expected survival must be greater than twelve (12) months.

          4. A Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) must be 70 or greater (Appendix I).
