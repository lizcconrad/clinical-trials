  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is in evolution as new molecular pathways and targeted
      therapies are identified. Although most NHLs respond to currently available therapies, the
      majority of patients relapse and many never have a complete response to therapy. In the
      investigators attempts to further understand the pathogenesis of NHLs, the investigators have
      identified and characterized expression of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) at the DNA,
      RNA and protein levels in association with the presence of NHLs (and other neoplastic
      diseases). The investigators preclinical evidence suggests a correlation with the level of
      HERV-K (a particular family of HERVs) expression and NHL disease activity, leading us to
      hypothesize that HERV-K expression may contribute to the development of the disease and/or to
      its recurrence. If this hypothesis is correct, then drugs that inhibit HERV-K expression may
      prevent recurrence of disease and/or may provide a novel therapeutic approach for NHLs.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators eventually intend to study the use of
      anti-retroviral therapies in patients with NHL. The investigators in vitro studies have
      demonstrated that HERV-K expression decreases in response to the currently FDA-approved and
      available, anti-HIV drugs, Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir). These
      medications are tolerated well in HIV patients, but it is unknown how the combination of
      Lamivudine and Tenofovir will be tolerated by patients with NHL. To further test the
      investigators hypotheses, the investigators propose the following Specific Aims of the
      current study: (1) To evaluate the tolerability, toxicity and safety of administering
      Lamivudine and Tenofovir in combination to patients with relapsed or refractory NHL; (2) To
      evaluate the effects of the combination of lamivudine and tenofovir on HERV-K plasma viral
      RNA load; and (3) To monitor the response rate of the NHL to treatment with the combination
      of lamivudine and tenofovir.

      The investigators study will recruit adult patients with relapsed or refractory NHL whom the
      investigators have identified as having expression of HERV-K. Volunteer participants will be
      administered the combination of lamivudine and tenofovir and monitored for tolerability,
      toxicity, compliance, changes in viral RNA load and disease response.
