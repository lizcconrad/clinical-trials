  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regaining independent walking is the top priority for individuals recovering from stroke.
      Thus, physical rehabilitation post-stroke should focus on improving walking function and
      endurance. However, the amount of walking completed by individuals with stroke attending
      rehabilitation is far below that required for independent community ambulation. There has
      been increased interest in accelerometer-based monitoring of walking post-stroke. Walking
      monitoring could be integrated within the goal-setting process for those with ambulation
      goals in rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of
      accelerometer-based feedback of daily walking activity during rehabilitation on the frequency
      and duration of walking post-stroke.

    <description>For participants assigned to the feedback group, physiotherapists will receive a summary of patients' walking activity for the previous week as a tool to guide goal planning. Physiotherapists will use the information as a 'homework checker' to determine if patients are complying with an assigned walking program. In the case of non-compliance, the physiotherapist will discuss a coping strategy for better integrating walking activity into the patients' day. In the event that the patient is meeting their specific sub-goals for walking activity, the physiotherapist will re-evaluate these sub-goals and suggest more challenging goals.</description>

    <description>For participants assigned to the control group, physiotherapists will not receive accelerometer-based feedback of daily walking activity. However, physiotherapists will still discuss the achievement of walking goals with their patients. This is usual care around goal planning.</description>

    <description>Participants will wear accelerometers every weekday during in-patient rehabilitation to monitor walking activity. Feedback of daily walking activity will be provided to the patients' treating physiotherapists to assist with goal-planning around walking.</description>
