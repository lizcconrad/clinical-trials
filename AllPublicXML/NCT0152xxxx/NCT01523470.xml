    <textblock>
      The investigators design a pilot randomised, single-centred, controlled trial to compare
      different withdrawal methods of Non-invasive ventilation. Our study aims at comparing
      stepwise withdrawal of Non-invasive ventilation versus immediate withdrawal of Non-invasive
      ventilation. The primary endpoint is to compare the rate of success between two withdrawal
      methods. The investigators define success as no recurrence of acute hypercapnic respiratory
      failure or restitution of Non-invasive ventilation within 48 hours after NIV is stopped. The
      secondary endpoints include time to recurrence of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure
      measured from the time of randomisation, the total days of Non-invasive ventilation use and
      the days of hospitalisation. Results from this trial will inform design of future randomised
      trial in this area.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients would receive standard medical treatment with inhaled bronchodilator, systemic
      steroid, antibiotics according to our local bacteriology. Acute NIV was initiated by trained
      respiratory nurses according to standardised protocols. The nurses would be at the bedside
      during the initial acclimatization. BIPAP vision was used to provide bi-level pressure
      support ventilation. Interfacing with different types of nasal or full-mask would be
      individualised. NIV was used for as many as possible in the first day, at least 20 hrs.
      Throughout the NIV treatment, the following parameters will be monitored when NIV is started:
      arterial blood gases, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure, mental state, pulse
      oximetry. If a patient failed to respond to NIV, he or she would be intubated if appropriate.
      Criteria for failure include lack of clinical improvement with increasing dyspnea and
      deterioration of blood gases, hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled ventricular arrythmia,
      development of hypercapnic coma and cardiopulmonary arrest.

      A patient would be considered suitable to withdraw from the ventilator if he or she fulfil
      the criteria at rest.

    <description>On the day of decision of withdrawal (day0), the duration of non-invasive ventilator (NIV) will be decreased to 16 hours. On the following day (day1), the duration of NIV will be further decreased to 12 hours. The duration will be further decreased to 8 hours at night on the following day (day 2), and it will be stopped on the day after (day 3). Vital signs and blood gases will be monitored for a total of 5 days after withdrawal is planned (day 0 to day 5).</description>

    <description>BIPAP Synchrony is a machine for non-invasive ventilation for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in chronic obstructive airway disease exacerbation. It is a temporary measure. It is proven to be effective and reduce mortality and intubation in COAD exacerbation. However, the method of withdrawal of the machine remained controversial.</description>
