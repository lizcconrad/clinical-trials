  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glucose metabolism is impaired in many critically ill patients and is often aggravated by
      parenteral feeding, infections and/or pre-existent diabetes.Therefore insulin infusion
      protocols, which are based on frequent bedside glucose monitoring, have been implemented on
      most critical care units. Despite extensive efforts of the intensive care unit staff
      difficulties were experienced in achieving efficient and safe glucose control. Several
      barriers to the implementation of glycemic control have been identified. Most importantly,
      there is concern about increased frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes. To overcome these
      problems Space GlucoseControl was developed as a decision support system which helps to
      achieve safe and reliable blood glucose control in the desired ranges (4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l or
      4.4 - 8.3 mmol/l).

      The objective of this non-interventional study is to gain additional information on the
      performance of the Space GlucoseControl system for glycaemic control in ICU patients when
      used in routine clinical practice.
