    <textblock>
      The SCAR study uses a software program entitled QLAB, a proprietory program, developed by
      Philips Healthcare (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA). Literature on two-dimensional speckle
      tracking imaging (2DSTE) is growing, but data relevant to the population in the SCAR study is
      minimal. Accumulation of data relevant for a population of subjects will provide a set of
      normal values for interpretation of 2DSTE and minimize any influences from differences in
      data produced from different companies. This data may also assist other researchers
      investigate other cardiac diseases and abnormalities.
