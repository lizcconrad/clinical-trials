  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, comparative interventional human subject trial. Patients
      with a chronic venous ulceration of the lower extremity will be enrolled into this study.
      These wounds must be recalcitrant to the standard treatment regimen. There are a total of two
      arms in this study. One group will be randomly assigned to receive Vacuum Assisted Closure
      (V.A.C. or VAC) by means of the ActiV.A.C. + Compression therapy group consisting of the
      application of this device along with compression therapy. The other group will be randomly
      assigned into compression therapy only group. A total of 60 subjects will be enrolled into
      this 6 week study. There will be a 2 week run-in period (prior to the onset of the
      intervention) to ensure that the wound has not healed greater than 35% prior to intervention
      and randomization. Wounds that heal within the 6 week trial period will have an additional
      confirmatory visit 2 weeks after healing was identified.

      If within the 6 week intervention period the wound bed is determined to be ready for a Split
      Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) or Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue (BAT), the surgery or clinic
      application will be scheduled within 4 weeks. Subjects deemed not to be a surgical candidate,
      will have Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue (BAT) application in the clinic. This includes
      patients who are medically unstable to receive a medical clearance for surgery or otherwise
      not a candidate for Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) surgery (e.g. donor site skin is
      compromised). During this period between the scheduled STSG surgery or BAT application, the
      subjects will continue within the assigned treatment group. A confirmatory visit will also
      occur 2 weeks after the application of a Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) or Bio-engineered
      Alternative Tissue (BAT).

      Patients diagnosed with a chronic venous ulceration will be assessed for study eligibility
      during their initial clinical evaluation. Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will
      be asked to enroll into the study (see Subject Recruitment). Subjects will be asked to sign
      the informed consent form and receive a copy of the informed consent.

      Patients diagnosed with a chronic venous ulceration will be assessed for study eligibility
      during their initial clinical evaluation. Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will
      be asked to enroll into the study (see Subject Recruitment). Subjects will be asked to sign

      Application of Devices/Dressing

      The usual consent forms that are part of the Standard of Care will be utilized per the Center
      for Wound Healing at Georgetown University Hospital. All costs associated with the clinic
      visit consistent with the Standard of Care will be billed in the customary fashion.

      Standard of Care Wound Therapy (Debridement, Infection Control)

      The surface of the venous wound will be washed and rinsed with a wound cleanser at every
      visit per Standard of Care. The need for debridement (utilizing a scalpel and/or curette)
      will be dependent of the amount of nonviable tissue and/or biofilm detected on the surface of
      the wound. The decision to debride will be made by the individual investigator at each visit.
      The use of topical enzymatic debriding agents will be at the discretion of the investigator.
      Further, the investigator may use topical antimicrobials as needed. The use of oral
      antibiotics will also be at the discretion of the individual investigator. No other wound
      healing modalities including topically applied treatments will be allowed.

      ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System

      The ActiV.A.C.® Therapy System is an FDA approved device for the treatment of venous
      ulcerations. The ActiV.A.C.® System will be applied in a customary manner per manufacturer's
      recommendations. Acticoat Flex 7™ will be applied as the contact layer on the wound surface.
      Acticoat Flex 7™ is a fenestrated, silver-coated (anti-microbial), knitted polyester material
      that is routinely used as a contact layer dressing for chronic wounds. The open cell foam is
      then applied over the top of the Acticoat Flex 7™ (cut to shape of the wound). The adherent
      transparent occlusive material will be applied over the open cell foam. The tubing is then
      attached after cutting a small aperture through the occlusive material. Negative pressure
      will be set at 125 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) on continuous suction. The sponge and
      canister will be replaced 2 times per week. This dressing change will take place once in the
      clinic and once by the visiting home nurses. These nurses have had in-service training on the
      proper application of negative pressure therapy and have experience with its use.

      Compression Therapy

      Profore™ multi-layered compression bandaging system will be utilized. This includes the
      application of a contact layer dressing using Acticoat Flex 7™. The compression bandage will
      be applied per manufacturer's recommendations. The dressings will be changed 2 times per
      week. This dressing change will take place once in the clinic and once by the visiting home
      nurses. These nurses have had in-service training on the proper application of the
      compressive dressing and have experience with its use.

      Standard of Care Post Split-Thickness Skin Graft or Application of a Bio-engineered
      Alternative Tissue (BAT)-

      The application of a Split Thickness Skin Graft (STSG) or Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue
      (BAT) will follow the Standard of Care. This Standard of Care applies to both interventional
      groups. Split Thickness Skin Grafts will be applied in the operating room after debridement
      of the venous wound which will be conducted per Standard Of Care. After the placement of the
      Split Thickness Skin Graft onto the wound surface, a nonadherent dressing is placed onto the
      graft followed by a silver impregnated dressing layer. The ActiV.A.C.™ open celled foam will
      then be placed over the silver impregnated dressing in the customary fashion. Compressive
      dressing will then be placed over the ActiV.A.C.™ occlusive material. The postoperative
      dressings will be removed within 5-7 days. The wound site will then be redressed with a
      nonadherent dressing as the contact layer, silver impregnated dressing, and Profore™. The
      application of a BAT will take place in the outpatient clinic. This includes the debridement
      of the wound and the application of a Bio-engineered Alternative Tissue (BAT) onto the wound
      surface. The dressings include a nonadherent contact layer, followed by a silver impregnated
      dressing, and finally a Profore™ compressive dressing.

Adherent transparent occlusive material will be applied over the open cell foam. The tubing is then attached after cutting a small aperture through the occlusive material. Negative pressure will be set at 125mmHg on continuous suction. Sponge and canister will be replaced 2 time a week.
Compression Therapy Profore™ multi-layered compression bandaging system will be utilized. This includes the application of a contact layer dressing using Acticoat Flex 7™. The compression bandage will be applied per manufacturer's recommendations.</description>
