          -  Have intermediate-1, intermediate-2, or high-risk MF according to the Dynamic
             International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) plus; or

          -  Have symptomatic MF with spleen greater than 10 cm below left costal margin; or

          -  Have post-polycythemic MF (post-PV MF); or

          -  Have post-essential thrombocythemic MF (post-ET MF)

          -  Have given written informed consent prior to any study-specific procedures

          -  Have adequate organ function, including:

          -  Hepatic: Direct bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times upper limits of normal
             (ULN), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST) less than or equal
             to 2.5 times ULN

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times ULN

          -  Bone Marrow Reserve: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1000/mcL, platelets ≥25,000/mcL,
             platelets ≥50,000 for PV or ET participants.

          -  Have a performance status of 0, 1, or 2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
             (ECOG) scale

          -  Have discontinued all previous approved therapies for MF, including any chemotherapy,
             immunomodulating therapy (for example, thalidomide, interferon-alpha),
             immunosuppressive therapy (for example, corticosteroids &gt;10 mg/day prednisone or
             equivalent), radiotherapy, and erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, or granulocyte
             colony-stimulating factor (GSF) for at least 14 days and recovered from the acute
             effects of therapy. Hydroxyurea used to control blood cell counts is permitted at
             study entry if the participant has been maintained on a stable dose for at least 4
             weeks. Low dose acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; 81 or 100 mg) is permitted as well

          -  Are reliable and willing to make themselves available for the duration of the study
             and are willing to follow study procedures

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential must agree to use medically approved

             surgical procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential participants may not be included in the study if any of the following apply
        during screening:

          -  Have received treatment within 14 days of the initial dose of study drug with an
             experimental agent that has not received regulatory approval for any indication

          -  Have a QTc interval &gt;470 milliseconds (msec) using Bazett's formula

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would preclude participation in the study (for example, a gastrointestinal (GI)
             disorder causing clinically significant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and
             diarrhea, or malabsorption syndrome)

          -  Are currently being treated with agents that are metabolized by cytochrome P450
             (CYP)3A4 with a narrow therapeutic margin (for example, alfentanil,
             cyclosporine,diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and
             tacrolimus) or CYP2B6 (for example, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen,
             efavirenz, propofol, methadone, and bupropion)

          -  Have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant

          -  Have a second primary malignancy that in the judgment of the investigator and sponsor,
             may affect the interpretation of the results

          -  Have an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection including human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis (screening is not
             required)

          -  Have a history of congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA)
