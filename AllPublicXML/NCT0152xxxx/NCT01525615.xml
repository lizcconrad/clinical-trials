    <measure>Adjusted Mean Endurance Time During Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry (CWRCE) After 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Primary endpoint was endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 12 weeks of treatment. The endurance time in seconds was transformed using log10 scale to correct skewness in endurance time on original scale and then the MMRM model was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means and SEs were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the MMRM fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate for the log10 of geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SEs of the geometric mean.</description>

    <description>Key secondary endpoint was endurance time during endurance shuttle walk test to symptom limitation at 85% of predicted maximum oxygen consumption (VO2) peak after 12 weeks of treatment. The endurance time in seconds was transformed using log10 scale to correct skewness in endurance time on original scale and then the MMRM model was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means and SEs were obtained.

    <description>Secondary endpoint was the slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 1 day of treatment.
The intensity of breathing discomfort was rated on the Borg Scale with categories from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal). The slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort was defined as the Borg scale value of breathing discomfort at the end of exercise minus the Borg scale value of breathing discomfort at pre-exercise divided by the endurance time. A decrease in slope indicates slowing down in decline in breathing, i.e., favorable results.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Endurance Time During Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry (CWRCE) After 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>Primary endpoint was endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 12 weeks of treatment. The endurance time in seconds was transformed using log10 scale to correct skewness in endurance time on original scale and then the MMRM model was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means and SEs were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the MMRM fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate for the log10 of geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SEs of the geometric mean.</description>

        <title>Adjusted Mean Endurance Time During Constant Work Rate Cycle Ergometry (CWRCE) After 6 Weeks Treatment</title>
        <description>Secondary endpoint was endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 6 weeks of treatment.The endurance time in seconds was transformed using log10 scale to correct skewness in endurance time on original scale and then the MMRM model was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means and SEs were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the MMRM fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate for the log10 of geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SEs of the geometric mean.</description>

          <description>Secondary endpoint was endurance time during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 6 weeks of treatment.The endurance time in seconds was transformed using log10 scale to correct skewness in endurance time on original scale and then the MMRM model was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means and SEs were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the MMRM fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate for the log10 of geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SEs of the geometric mean.</description>

        <description>Secondary endpoint was the slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 1 day of treatment.
The intensity of breathing discomfort was rated on the Borg Scale with categories from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal). The slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort was defined as the Borg scale value of breathing discomfort at the end of exercise minus the Borg scale value of breathing discomfort at pre-exercise divided by the endurance time. A decrease in slope indicates slowing down in decline in breathing, i.e., favorable results.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Mean Slope of the Intensity of Breathing Discomfort After Week 12</title>
          <description>Secondary endpoint was the slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort during constant work rate cycle ergometry to symptom limitation at 75% of maximal work capacity after 12 weeks of treatment.
The intensity of breathing discomfort was rated on the Borg Scale with categories from 0 (nothing at all) to 10 (maximal). The slope of the intensity of breathing discomfort was defined as the Borg scale value of breathing discomfort at the end of exercise minus the Borg scale value of breathing discomfort at pre-exercise divided by the endurance time. A decrease in slope indicates favorable results.</description>
