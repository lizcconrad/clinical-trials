  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre study to be conducted in Sweden and Finland. Up to 24 male and/or
      female patients of non-childbearing potential aged 45 to 75 years (inclusive), with a
      clinical diagnosis Parkinson's Disease will be randomised in the study to allow for 20
      patients to complete this study.The study will evaluate the effect of 8 weeks treatment with
      AZD3241 on microglia activation as measured via PET examinations.

             trauma, brain neoplasm), Parkinson-plus syndromes or heredodegenerative diseases

          -  Patients who have undergone surgery for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (eg,
