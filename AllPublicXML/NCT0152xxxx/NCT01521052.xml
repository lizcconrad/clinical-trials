      Purpose: To evaluate the safety and anti-depressive response of the H1 Coil TMS Device in
      elderly patients suffering from major depressive episode.

      Twenty-seven (27) treatment resistance depressed-patients, 68 years of age and above,
      currently in a depressive episode.All subjects will receive prefrontal deep rTMS of H1 Coil
      (42 trains of 2 seconds, 10 Hz, with 20 seconds inter-train intervals, up to 120% of motor
      threshold), for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, overall 20 sessions.Safety and efficacy tests will be
      conducted before starting the trial (screening), once a week for the trial duration and one
      month following end of treatment.
