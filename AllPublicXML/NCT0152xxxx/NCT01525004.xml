  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial in which the both the safety and immunogenicity of the standard dose
      flu vaccine will be compared with high dose flu vaccine in children that have undergone solid
      organ transplantation (SOT).

    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized, double-blind phase 1 safety and immunogenicity study of the HD
      compared with the SD TIV in pediatric patients between the ages of three and 17 yr that have
      undergone SOT (Clin-Trials.gov. NCT01525004) was conducted. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1
      fashion to receive 0.5 mL of either the HD (60 μg) or SD (15 μg) TIV intramuscularly.
      Subjects &lt;9 yr of age received either one or two doses of the vaccine based on ACIP
      recommendations [19]. The study was approved by Institutional Review Boards at both
      institutions (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, and the University of Pittsburgh,
      Pittsburgh, PA) and conducted during the 2011-2012 influenza season. Subjects were randomly
      allocated to either the HD or SD group by a computer-generated allocation system.
      Participants, their families, and research staff who performed clinical evaluations remained
      blinded to the child's assigned dosage, while designated unblinded nurses administered the
      requisite vaccine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric SOT patients (kidney, liver, heart, lungs, intestine, and/or multi-visceral)

          -  Must be at least 6 months after transplant.
