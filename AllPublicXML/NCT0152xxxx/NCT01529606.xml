      The main objective of this entire research project is to develop a miniature atmospheric cold
      plasma brush (m-ACPB) for dental clinical applications. The objective of the clinical trial
      portion of the study is to compare the longevity and durability of dental composite
      restorations created using the plasma brush, to that of the standard care in dentistry for
      treating dental cavities, and effects on caries prevention.

      The study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and be approved by the institute review
      board of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. The study subjects will be
      composed of young adults 18-35 years old in order to control effects of age on caries. Also
      the subjects must be Caucasian or Africa American. Young adult patients will be recruited
      from the UTHSC dental clinics.The baseline visit include a dental exam by one of the
      investigators, standard preventive dental care (e.g cleaning, application of fluoride
      varnish), anthropometric measurements, oral health interview survey. 100 patients who meet
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited after they sign an informed consent
      form. These patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 study groups. Randomization
      assignment will be stratified by age and number of teeth with caries. Two study groups will
      be: 1.) plasma treatment group and 2) standard treatment group. For patients in standard
      treatment group, they will receive composite resin restoration for all decayed teeth and
      standard preventive treatment (cleaning and fluoride varnish application) at baseline. For
      patients in plasma treatment group, they will receive plasma treatment after cavity
      preparation, composite resin restoration, standard preventive treatment followed by plasma
      treatment for non-carious teeth. Standard preventive treatment and plasma treatment will be
      repeated on semi-annual (6-month) recall visits. All composite restorations will be placed
      according to the manufacturer's instruction. Only one composite commercially available will
      be used during the study.
