    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate prospectively whether concomitant administration
      of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers (namely ACE-I and ARBs') influence
      the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate or GFR (eGFR) after administration of
      contrast media in patients undergoing non-emergent coronary angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is defined as an absolute or relative increase in serum
      creatinine compared to the baseline values, together with exposure to a contrast agent and
      exclusion of alternative explanations for renal impairment. Most frequently the renal
      impairment develops 48 hours post exposure. Although RAAS blocking agents are widely used
      among patients requiring contrast studies, data regarding the effect of these agents on the
      development of CIN are sparse and inconsistent. Patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention are frequently treated with RAAS blocking agents. Despite the not infrequent
      occurrence of CIN following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) no guidelines are
      available on the topic of the cessation of the RAAS inhibitors prior to the procedure.
