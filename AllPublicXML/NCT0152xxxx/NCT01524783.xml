  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on Central Radiology Assessment Per Kaplan-Meier</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of randomization to progression or death up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression as per modified RECIST 1.0 or death from any cause, whichever comes first. Progression is assessed by cat scan (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Using Kaplan-Meier</measure>
    <time_frame>Every visit from randomization up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to date of death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Safety Evaluation of Everolimus Versus Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Every visit from randomization up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency and type of treatment emergent adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-determined ranges. Other safety data (e.g. vital signs) will be considered as appropriate. Safety events will be graded using the CTCAE V4.03 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>FACT-G Total Score Over the Duration of the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Every Visit from randomization up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-G is a self-assessed health-related quality of life questionnaire. The questionnaire is comprised of 27 questions, scored 0 to 4, examining physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well-being. Deterioration is defined as a decrease by at least 7 points compared to baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Every Visit from randomization up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be assessed per modified RECIST 1.0. ORR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The estimated average treatment duration is at least 5-8.5 months until disease progression. DCR will be assessed per modified RECIST 1.0. DCR is the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or stable disease (SD).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Chromogranin A (CgA) and Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) Levels During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Every visit from baseline up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The estimated average treatment duration is at least 5-8.5 months until disease progression. CgA and NSE are potential biomarkers for tumor response. Change from baseline will be noted and correlated with tumor response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Definitive Deterioration in WHO Performance Status Change During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Every visit up from randomization to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The estimated average duration is at least 5-8.5 months until disease progression. WHO Performance Status is a scale rated from 0 (normal) to 5 (dead) by a healthcare professional to assess the overall status of a patient. Deterioration is defined as an increase of at least one category compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics (PK)</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3 (Cycle 2, Study Day 29)</time_frame>
