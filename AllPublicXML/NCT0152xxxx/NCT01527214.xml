      Background: The primary investigation of lung cancer (LC) is for 85% of the cases conducted
      through General Practice, sadly it tends to take a relatively long time from first time the
      patient is seen by their General Practitioner and until they are diagnosed. LC symptoms are
      common, but usual because of benign diseases. Only 33% of LC patients presenting with alarm
      symptoms. On average a General Practitioner in Denmark sees only one patient with newly
      diagnosed lung cancer a year and the doctor will therefore get the clinical experience that
      when they refer a patient, test often come out negative and they therefore fail to refer and
      delay will increase - with a poorer prognosis as a result. Centrally in the diagnosis is
      conventional chest X-ray, which unfortunately is inefficient in many cases, while CT scanning
      has proven effective even for small tumors.

      Hypothesis and aims: The project has three main hypotheses to be tested 1) the GP's use of
      cancer fast-track and detection of suspected lung cancer can be optimized in relation to
      interpretation of symptoms and subsequent referral practices and radiological investigation.
      2) General Practitioners with special training can change the referral routines and 3) direct
      access to fast CT scanning leads to earlier diagnosis of lung cancer.

      Methods: The first part of the study is a register-based study of lung cancer patients' road
      to diagnosis, based on a database of newly diagnosed cancer patients in a year. Second part
      of the study is a clinical, randomized study of the effect of referral directly to fast chest
      CT scan. Primary endpoint is delay, secondary endpoints are referral pattern (use of
      fast-track packet), primary use of CT and 1-year mortality. Furthermore side effects,
      including patient groups with increased delay.

      The study will contribute new knowledge to the way GP's interpret symptoms, the way they
      refer their patients when they suspect cancer, their use of diagnostic imaging and cancer
      fast-track pathways. It will then provide a unique opportunity to create the necessary
      knowledge about the effects of direct referral to fast CT scan and it might be a decision aid
      whether to open for direct CT scan in General Practice for a group of patients.

    <description>All general practices referring to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital.Randomized 1:1. In the intervention group, GPs continue to refer to the lung cancer fast track when indicated. In addition, they are allowed to refer directly to a rapid chest CT scan in cases where they find reasons to examine the patient for lung diseases without having sufficient suspicion of lung cancer to refer the patient to the lung cancer fast track. The GPs will be offered special training related to the diagnosis of lung cancer in general practice before the new referral option is introduced. This will be done by offering training sessions and written material.</description>
