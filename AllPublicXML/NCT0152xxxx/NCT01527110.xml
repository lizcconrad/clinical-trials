  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, multi-center, single arm study to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of IV zanamivir 600mg twice daily for 5 days in hospitalized subjects with
      laboratory confirmed influenza infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects and adolescent subjects (≥50 kg) with normal renal function will receive 600mg
      per dose. Subjects with renal impairment will receive an adjusted dose based on calculated
      creatinine clearance. The initial 5 day treatment course may be extended for up to 5
      additional days if viral shedding is determined to be ongoing or if clinical symptoms warrant
      further treatment with IV zanamivir.

      The study duration is approximately 28 days for subjects whose treatment duration is 5 days,
      and up to approximately 33 days for subjects whose treatment duration is extended to a
      maximum of 10 days. The study will consist of Pre-dose Baseline Assessments (Day 1), During
      Treatment Assessments (Days 1 to 5, and up to Day 10), and Follow-up Assessments on the
      following days: Post-Treatment +2, +5, +9, +16 and +23 Days. For subjects who have been
      discharged from hospital, the Post-Treatment +2, +5, +9 and +16 Days Assessments can be made
      by telephone contact.

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as alanine aminotransferase &gt;=3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), and total bilirubin &gt;=2 x ULN or international normalised ratio &gt;1.5.

            <description>Eligible participants &gt;=18 years and adolescents &gt;=50 kg with normal renal function were administered an initial dose of IV zanamivir is 600 mg followed by BID maintenance dose administered at a constant rate over approximately 30 min for 5 days. The standard dosage for adolescent participants &lt;50 kg was 12 mg/kg. The BID maintenance dose regimen began 12 hours after starting the initial dose infusion. Participants with renal impairment received an adjusted dose based on calculated CLcr with the initial dose corresponding to a CLcr of &gt; =80 mL/min for adults and for adolescent participants &gt; = 50 kg (i.e. 600 mg) or to the appropriate weight-based dose corresponding to a CLcr &gt; = 80 mL/min for adolescent participants &lt;50 kg (i.e. 12 mg/kg). There was a delay of 24 to 48 hours after the initial dose before the BID maintenance dose regimen was initiated for participants with severe renal impairment.</description>

        <description>IC50 value is defined as the concentration of zanamivir required to achieve half maximal inhibition of the influenza viral enzyme neuraminidase of influenza A and B to prevent the release and spread of influenza virus in the respiratory tract. Susceptibility analyses were performed on nasopharyngeal swabs collected on Baseline (Day 1) up to Day 33 (follow-up) depending on the extend of continuation of treatment and duration of hospitalization. Endotracheal aspirates were used in participants who were intubated. Data is categorized for participants with influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Quantitative Viral Load Measured by RT-PCR From Nasopharyngeal Swabs Positive at Baseline Over Period</title>
        <description>Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on nasopharyngeal swabs collected on Day 1 up to Day 33 (last day) depending on the extend of continuation of treatment and duration of hospitalization. The baseline assessments were referred to assessments at Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Analysis was done for participants with positive Influenza A RNA and Influenza B RNA. Data is presented for Day 3, Day 5 and last day.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Quantitative Viral Load Measured by Viral Culture From Nasopharyngeal Swabs Over Period</title>
        <description>Quantitative viral culture as 50 % tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) defined as median tissue culture infective dose is that amount of a pathogenic agent that produces pathological change in 50% of cell cultures inoculated. It was carried out on nasopharyngeal swabs collected on Day 1 up to Day 33 (last day) depending on the extend of continuation of treatment and duration of hospitalization. The baseline assessments were referred to assessments at Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Any undetectable viral load values were calculated as x.x Log10 TCID50: x.x Log10 (1.5 or 7.5 was the lower or upper limit of quantification in TCID50). Data is presented for Day 3, Day 5 and last day.</description>
