      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome(OSAHS)affects at least 4% of males and 2% of
      females.

      OSAHS is the combination of excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring and apnoeas (stopping
      breathing at night). As well as affecting tiredness, mood, concentration and quality of life
      - there is growing concern that it can increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart
      problems, strokes and thromboses (clots in the veins).

      It appears that OSAHS may affect the thickness of the blood and cause it to clot more easily
      it also causes damage to the lining of the blood vessels (endothelial injury). These effects
      seem independent of other risk factors such as obesity, smoking, family history of clots etc.

      The investigators are testing new biomarkers: gel point and fractal dimension developed at
      the Swansea University to measure the 'clotting' of the blood in people with OSAHS and a
      similar group of people who snore and who are sleepy but do not have OSAHS on sleep studies
      (Controls) Also markers of vascular inflammation are being measured.

      Primary objective:

      The primary outcome of this study is to test the null hypothesis that no significant
      difference exists between fractal dimension (Df)and vascular injury markers including serum
      amyloid A (SAA), C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and
      intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)in patients with OSAHS and sleepy, snoring controls
      of similar age, gender and BMI.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in measured markers
           before and after a night's sleep in OSAHS and controls.

        2. To test the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in measured markers
           following 1 month of CPAP treatment, in those with OSAHS.

        Subjects are recruited prospectively from a specialist sleep-disordered breathing clinic in
        Prince Philip Hospital, Hywel Dda Health Board. They are referred from both primary and
        secondary care with varying degrees of symptoms suggestive of OSAHS (daytime sleepiness,
        snoring and/or nocturnal apneas).
