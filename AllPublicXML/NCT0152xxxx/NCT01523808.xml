  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interest in using L-asparaginase in pancreatic cancer arose from in vitro and in vivo
      studies data showing an anti-neoplastic effect on pancreatic tumor cell lines. Interestingly,
      these studies suggest an additional effect of L-asparaginase associated to gemcitabine.GRASPA
      is a suspension of red blood cells encapsulating L-asparaginase. The aim of this phase I
      clinical trial is to evaluate the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of GRASPA on locally advanced
      or metastatic pancreatic tumors, after therapy failure of first or second line chemotherapy
      using gemcitabine.
