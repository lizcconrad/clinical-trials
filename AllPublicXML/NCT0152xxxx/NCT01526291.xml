      This study evaluates a questionnaire designed to measure satisfaction and ophthalmic-related
      quality of life (QOL)in up to 550 active duty subjects prior to and six months following
      state-of-the-art laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

      The LASIK Quality of Life Collaboration Project (LQOLCP) is a government partnership among
      the FDA, the Department of Defense, and the National Eye Institute (NEI). This project
      examines patient-reported outcomes (PROs) following LASIK. This three-phased project is part
      of FDA's ongoing effort to better monitor and improve the safety and effectiveness of lasers
      used in LASIK surgery. PROWL-1 is the second phase of the larger LQOLCP project. This
      prospective, questionnaire-based study will be conducted by the Navy Refractive Surgery
      Center San Diego in collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Center
      for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the National Eye Institute (NEI). The primary
      purpose of this study is to explore the psychometric properties of a newly developed
      questionnaire assessing satisfaction and ophthalmic-related quality of life (QOL) in 550
      active duty patients over a period of six months prior to and following state-of-the-art
      laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Specific topics of interest include: functional
      limitations, dry eye symptoms, pre-operative expectations, depression, anxiety,
      post-operative symptoms, dispositional optimism, and satisfaction. Additionally,
      standard-of-care, non-invasive clinical data will be collected pre- and postoperatively
      (e.g., best corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction, wavefront aberrometry, corneal
      topography, and other clinical assessments), and analyzed. The questionnaire in this study is
      a newly developed instrument which, once psychometrically evaluated in this U.S. Navy/FDA/NEI
      collaboration, will be used in future large-scale, multicenter FDA clinical studies that
      include civilian refractive surgery centers throughout the United States.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female active duty service member, of any race, and at least 21 years old at
             the time of the pre-operative examination.

          -  Speak and read English fluently, and have the ability to give informed consent.

          -  Demonstrated refractive stability, confirmed by clinical records. Neither the
             spherical nor the cylindrical portion of the refraction may have changed more than
             0.50 D for myopes or 0.75D for hyperopes during the 12-month period immediately
             preceding the baseline pre-operative examination.

          -  Soft contact lens users must have removed their lenses at least 1 week before baseline
             measurements. Hard contact lens users (PMMA or rigid gas permeable lenses must have
             removed their lenses at least 4 weeks prior to baseline measurements, and have 2
             central keratometry readings and 2 manifest refractions taken at least 1 week apart
             that do not differ by more than 0.50D in either meridian; mires shall be regular.

          -  Express strong motivation and potential ability to return for all follow-up
             examinations through the 6-month follow-up exam under the care of the treating
             investigator, and have access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements.

          -  Reside in the greater San Diego, California metropolitan area.

          -  Have been determined to be a good candidate for the LASIK procedure based on the
             investigator's assessment of medical ophthalmic health, general cognitive function,
             and physical and social limitations.

          -  Have a treatment target of bilateral emmetropia or possibly slight hyperopia (+0.25D).

          -  Have access to a computer with internet service.

          -  Consent of the subject's command to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous introcular or corneal surgery of any kind in either eye, including any type
             of surgery for either refractive or therapeutic purposes.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or intend to become pregnant
             during the 6 month duration of the study.

          -  Concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including
             corticosteroids, antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane), amiodarone hydrochloride
             (Cordarone) and sumatriptin (Imitrex) or any other tryptan.

          -  Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1 mm of the
             intended ablation zone, clinically significant lens opacity, or clinically significant
             dry eye syndrome unresolved by treatment.

          -  Evidence of glaucoma or intraocular pressure greater than 22mmHg at baseline.

          -  Evidence of keratonconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in
             either eye.

          -  Corneal thickness insufficient to allow the residual remaining stromal bed to be no
             less than 300 microns in each eye. The residual stromal bed thickness will be
             determined by subtracting both the LASIK flap thickness and depth of the ablation from
             the total central corneal thickness measured by pachymetry.

          -  History of recurrent erosions or epithelial basement dystrophy.

          -  Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the
             medications used in the post-operative course.
