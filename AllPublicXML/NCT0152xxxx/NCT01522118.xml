  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since prostate specific antigen (PSA) was introduced as a clinical screening tool for
      prostate cancer, more men are diagnosed with small foci of cancers instead of the advanced
      disease. The present choice of treatment for men with localized prostate cancer lies between
      active surveillance and radical therapy. Thus, the option of treating only the cancer within
      the prostate gland and sparing the non-cancerous tissue is quite appealing, yet very
      controversial. At present there are no consistent scientific data on focal therapy and its
      major effectiveness.

      Focal therapy for prostate cancer is defined as therapy that selectively ablates known
      disease while preserving existing functions, with the overall aim of minimizing lifetime
      morbidity without compromising life expectancy.

      The aim of the investigators study is to test if Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound
      ablation can determine non-invasive necrosis of focal, locally non-advanced prostate cancer.

      The study i designed as Phase 1, treatment &amp; resection protocol. With this project the
      investigators further aim to evaluate the safety and identify side effects of Magnetic
      Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound in treating focal prostate cancer.

      This design will also expand knowledge of the effect of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused
      Ultrasound onto peri-prostatic environment and to determine if surgery can safely be adopted
      after this non-invasive treatment.

    <description>Patients with biopsy proven locally non-advanced T2 prostate cancer identified at 3T MR examination including dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE-with time to peak and mean transit time evaluation) and candidate to radical prostatectomy will undergo Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation. The procedure is carried out either under general anesthesia or spinal block.
MR images allow correct identification of the target as well as vital structure to avoid during energy delivery. Treatment safety and efficacy is monitored in real time using MR thermometry. Adjustments of energy direction and intensity can be made according to the real time monitoring. Pre- and post-ablative MR examinations will serve to analyze differences of DCE features of the neoplastic tissue; therapy-induced alterations will also be compared to histopathology findings from whole section prostate specimens</description>
