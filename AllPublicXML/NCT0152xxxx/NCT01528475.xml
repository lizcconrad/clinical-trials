  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing pre-hospital initiation of
      therapeutic hypothermia by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers to conventional
      post-resuscitation care. The goal of this trial is to increase the proportion of cardiac
      arrest patients that are appropriately treated in-hospital with therapeutic hypothermia to
      reach the target body temperature within 6 hours of hospital arrival. The investigators
      believe that EMS-initiation of cooling will be a powerful reminder to in-hospital clinicians
      to continue therapeutic hypothermia, and will lead to care improvements across a health
      system.

      This is a large pragmatic, randomized controlled trial comparing pre-hospital initiation of
      therapeutic hypothermia by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers to conventional
      post-resuscitation care. The goal of this trial is to increase the proportion of cardiac
      arrest patients that are appropriately treated in-hospital with therapeutic hypothermia to
      reach the target body temperature within 6 hours of hospital arrival. The investigators
      believe that EMS-initiation of cooling will be a powerful reminder to in-hospital clinicians
      to continue therapeutic hypothermia, and will lead to care improvements across a health
      system. This study builds on our previous work using large hospital networks hospitals to
      improve the delivery of evidence-based practice.

      The primary research question is as follows: Does pre-hospital initiation of therapeutic
      hypothermia by EMS providers increase the proportion of comatose out of hospital cardiac
      arrest patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) that are successfully cooled to
      a target temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius within 6 hours of emergency department
      arrival, compared to usual post-resuscitation care provided in the field? The primary outcome
      is the proportion of included patients that are successfully cooled to reach target
      temperature of 32 to 34 degrees Celsius within 6 hours of emergency department arrival.
