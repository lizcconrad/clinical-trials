  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2 is a protein that is over expressed in 20-30% of breast cancers. It is also found
      associated with lung, gastric, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. Although there are existing
      therapies that can target HER2, most patients will eventually experience progression of their
      disease even though their cancer continues to express HER2. Therefore, new approaches are
      needed for treating tumors that express HER2.

      This clinical trial will use an investigational cancer vaccine called HER2 VRP or AVX901. The
      vaccine is based on a virus called Venezuelan equine encephalitis but it has been changed so
      it cannot cause active infection. Instead, the virus has been changed so it tells the immune
      system to attack cancer cells which make HER2.

      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 VRP in
      patients with advanced or metastatic malignancies that express HER2, and to test whether
      immunization will causes a strong immune system attack against the cancer.

      Metastatic breast cancer continues to account for more than 400,000 deaths yearly with HER2
      positive breast cancers representing approximately one third of cases. Despite the efficacy
      of trastuzumab in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer, progression of metastatic disease is
      inevitable. Lapatinib, when combined with capecitabine, improves time to progression in those
      with trastuzumab resistant disease, but lapatinib resistance also develops in the majority of
      these patients. HER2 overexpression is also reported in lung, gastric, ovarian, and
      pancreatic cancers, all of which are also in need of improved treatment options. Because HER2
      continues to be expressed in patients with refractory disease, using an immune-targeting
      approach against HER2 remains a promising strategy. A number of clinical trials have
      confirmed the ability of vaccines to activate T cell and antibody responses against HER2. We
      propose using a propagation-defective, single-cycle, RNA replicon vector system that
      expresses HER2 as an antigen-specific cancer vaccine in a Phase I clinical trial in patients
      with advanced or metastatic malignancies expressing HER2. The vaccine was prepared from an
      attenuated strain of an alphavirus in which 3 of the 7 viral genes were removed and replaced
      with a HER2 gene to create a self-amplifying RNA (replicon) that expresses large amounts of
      HER2. The HER2 gene used includes the extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane (TM)
      regions of HER2 but not the ICD region. The HER2 ECDTM replicon is packaged into virus-like
      replicon particles (VRP) by providing the alphavirus structural proteins from separate RNA
      molecules. When VRP are used for immunization, the VRP infect individual cells and the
      replicon expresses HER2 which then induces an immune response.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of immunization with HER2 ECDTM
      VRP in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing malignancies. The study will also
      monitor immune responses to HER2. Preliminary data on tumor response rate will also be
      collected.

             (diaphragm with spermicidal gel or condoms with contraceptive foam), Depo-Provera,
             partner vasectomy, total abstinence, and willing to continue the effective
             contraception method for 30 days after the last dose of AVX901;

             to the first injection

          -  Patients on steroid therapy (or other immunosuppressives such as azathioprine or
             cyclosporine A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. Patients
             must have had 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid therapy prior to enrollment
             (except steroids used as anti-emetics for systemic chemotherapy which are permitted).

          -  Presence of an active acute or chronic infection including HIV (as determined by ELISA
             and confirmed by Western Blot) or viral hepatitis (as determined by HBsAg and
             Hepatitis C serology). Patients with HIV are excluded based on immuno-suppression,
             which may render them unable to respond to the vaccine; patients with chronic
             hepatitis are excluded because of concern that hepatitis could be exacerbated by the
             injections. .
