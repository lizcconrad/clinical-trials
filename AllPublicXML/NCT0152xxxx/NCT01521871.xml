  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By means of a prospective, randomised trial the investigators want to examine skin closure in
      living donors - subjected to laparoscopic, hand-assisted nephrectomy - by tissue glue
      (Cyanoacrylate (Liquiband)) versus conventional, intracutaneous suture and dressing (1 : 1;
      30 + 30 donors).

      Study hypothesis: (i) Latest generation tissue glue (Cyanoacrylate (Liquiband)) is at least
      as good as conventional suture regarding wound healing/complications. (ii) Peroperatively,
      tissue glue is faster than conventional suture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, the principal investigator have since 1998 been
      involved in developing minimally invasive techniques for living donor nephrectomy (LDN).
      Since 2009 all LDN's have been performed by laparoscopic, hand-assisted technique; by means
      of 'handport' and 3 laparoscopic ports (5/12 mm).

      The investigators consider use of tissue glue instead of suture as another small step towards
      less invasive surgery.

      Since 2000 there has been many reports, and even Cochrane reviews on the use/safety of tissue
      glue for skin closure. However, very few randomised studies have been performed with the
      latest generation tissue glue; Cyanoacrylate, with a critical mixture of
      octyl-:butyl-acrylate. And in Norway there has been no research in this field.

      On this basis, the investigators intend to examine skin closure in living donors, a very
      healthy/homogenous study population, subjected to laparoscopic, hand-assisted nephrectomy, by
      a prospective, randomised trial: Tissue glue (Cyanoacrylate (Liquiband)) versus conventional,
      intracutaneous suture and dressing (1 : 1; 30 + 30 donors).

      Primarily, the investigators will examine wound healing/complications by wound observation at
      postop. days 2 + 4 + 'at departure', with numerical scales for secretion, gaps, edema, rubor
      - as well as infection/bacteriology and complications/ reinterventions. In addition, the
      donors' self-satisfaction with the wound handling will be registered. Furthermore, the
      investigators will look at time consumption during surgery, price, stay in hospital and
      cosmesis judged at 2-3 months postoperatively.

    <measure>Patients´Self Satisfaction.</measure>
    <time_frame>These data were collected at the day of discharge from hospital (postoperative day 4-8).</time_frame>
    <description>The patients` self-satisfaction was evaluated by means of a questionnaire rating the following 3 domains on a numerical (1-5) scale:
Total satisfaction regarding wound healing/wound care. 1 (satisfied) to 5 (dissatisfied)
Satisfaction regarding wound discomfort; pain, itching, paresthesia, pressure etc. 1 (almost no discomfort) to 5 (lot of discomfort)
Satisfaction regarding wound care; suppleness, practicability versus mobilization, showering etc. 1 (almost no practical challenges) to 5 (lot of practical challenges)
Patients' Self Satisfaction score was the sum of three domains, ranges from 3 (completely satisfied) to 15 (completely dissatisfied).
These data were collected at the day of discharge, with guidance from two interviewers.</description>

Both arms/groups are evaluated day 2 postoperatively to measure any difference between the two skin closure methods. A high score is used as indicator of traumaticity towards the skin and a higher potential for wound infection.</description>

        <title>Wound Healing by Numerical Scales for Gaps Postoperative Day 2.</title>
        <description>The evaluation is performed by the use of a previously set numerical scale for gaps (0: no gap - 3: need for resuture/strips). Both arms/groups are evaluated day 2 postoperatively to measure any difference between the two skin closure methods. A high score is used as indicator of traumaticity towards the skin and a higher potential for wound infection.</description>

        <description>The patients` self-satisfaction was evaluated by means of a questionnaire rating the following 3 domains on a numerical (1-5) scale:
Total satisfaction regarding wound healing/wound care. 1 (satisfied) to 5 (dissatisfied)
Satisfaction regarding wound discomfort; pain, itching, paresthesia, pressure etc. 1 (almost no discomfort) to 5 (lot of discomfort)
Satisfaction regarding wound care; suppleness, practicability versus mobilization, showering etc. 1 (almost no practical challenges) to 5 (lot of practical challenges)
Patients' Self Satisfaction score was the sum of three domains, ranges from 3 (completely satisfied) to 15 (completely dissatisfied).
These data were collected at the day of discharge, with guidance from two interviewers.</description>
