  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using the NIH-funded Way to Health platform, the investigators will conduct this smoking
      cessation randomized controlled trial (RCT) among CVS employees. The investigators will be
      able to determine the comparative and absolute efficacy and effectiveness of 4 different
      incentive structures that are each grounded in behavioral economic principles. Additionally,
      the investigators will measure rates of and reasons for acceptance of each incentive
      structure, and examine participant characteristics that modify the efficacy and acceptance of
      different incentive structures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim I: Compare the efficacy and effectiveness of 4 financial incentive structures
      for improving &quot;quit rates&quot; (rates of prolonged smoking abstinence for 6 months): (a)
      individual financial rewards, (b) individual deposit contracts, (c) cooperative rewards, and
      (d) competitive deposit contracts

      H1: Compared with usual care, all 4 incentive structures will increase quit rates
      significantly.

      H2: Compared with individual financial rewards of equivalent size and schedule, individual
      deposit contracts, cooperative rewards, and competitive contracts will each increase quit
      rates significantly.

      H3: Group-oriented structures will increase quit rates significantly more than
      individual-oriented structures.

      Specific Aim II: Compare smokers' acceptance of these 4 financial incentive structures for
      smoking cessation

      H4: Uptake rates of reward-based structures will be higher than of structures involving
      deposit contracts.

      H5: Uptake rates of group-oriented structures will be higher than of individual-oriented
      structures.

      Specific Aim III: Identify individual characteristics that modify incentive structures'
      efficacy and acceptance

      H6: Incentives will promote relatively greater quit rates among participants with fewer
      substitute reinforcers.

      H7: Incentives will promote relatively greater quit rates among participants with lower
      incomes.

      H8: Higher-income persons will be relatively more likely to accept incentives requiring
      deposit contracts.

    <description>The primary measure of smoking cessation will be prolonged abstinence for 6 months, which will be measured by salivary cotinine testing or by urinary anabasine testing (for those participants using nicotine replacement therapy). Saliva samples will be analyzed using semi-quantitative immunochromatographic assay test strips at the University of Pennsylvania. Urine samples will be analyzed using gas chromatography at the Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Lab, at the University of Utah.</description>

    <description>Another secondary outcome variable will be the proportion of participants achieving point prevalence abstinence at 14 days, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months after the quit date.</description>

    <description>Participants will be offered free smoking cessation programs, and be provided web-based education regarding the health and economic benefits of smoking cessation. Participants will also have the opportunity to submit weekly reports on their smoking habits. They will be informed that they will receive reimbursements for completing the surveys that are part of the Way To Quit program and for submitting saliva or urine samples at 14 days, 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months (among those eligible).</description>
