        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject or subject's authorized representative must be able to understand, read and
             sign the study specific informed consent form after the nature of the study has been
             fully explained to them.

          2. For Group A,

               -  Males and females 18 - 95 years of age.

               -  Subject is confirmed to have fungemia as evidenced by a positive diagnostic blood
                  culture and subsequent species identification.

          3. For Group B,

               -  Males and females 18 - 95 years of age.

               -  Subject is hospitalized with a medical problem other than fungemia, or is being
                  treated as an outpatient for some non-infection-related condition, and

               -  Subject is confirmed to not have fungemia as evidenced by diagnostic blood
                  culture and subsequent species identification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any novel (i.e. not commercially available) drug compound within 30 days prior
             to the collection of T2 blood specimens.

          2. Subject has other co-morbid condition(s) that, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could limit the subject's ability to participate in the study or impact the scientific
             integrity of the study.
