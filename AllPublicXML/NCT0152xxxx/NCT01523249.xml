    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare accuracy of a new three-dimensional ultrasound (3D
      US) technique with the traditional palpation method for identification of the needle
      insertion site on patients' skin before epidural needle placement in pregnant women. The
      investigators hypothesize that the needle puncture site identified by 3D US is located within
      a 5 mm radius from the puncture site identified by palpation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, the manual palpation of lower back is used to identify the skin insertion
      point for the epidural needle placement in obstetric patients. Recently, two-dimensional
      ultrasound (2D US) scanning before the epidural needle insertion proved to improve an
      accurate determination of inter-vertebral levels and spine midline. 2D US is also useful in
      determining the depth to the epidural space and needle insertion angle. A three-dimensional
      ultrasound (3D US) technique is a new advancement in the ultrasound technology. 3D US allows
      for a real-time, visual guidance of the epidural needle insertion. This study will assess
      weather 3D US, compared to palpation, can accurately identify the skin needle insertion site
      for the epidural needle placement.

    <measure>assess quality of 3D US images</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>To obtain US images of the epidural anatomy with various settings of the image-processing system to determine the optimal 3D US parameters that give the clearest images. An experienced sonographer will analyze the US images in the UBC laboratory using a qualitative measure of clarity (scale of 1 to 5) of the depiction of the ligamentum flavum and laminae. This quality measure will be correlated to the image acquisition parameters to determine the optimal set of parameters.</description>
