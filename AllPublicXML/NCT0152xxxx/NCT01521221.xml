  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to assess the efficacy of hand-grip in preventing orthostatic hypotension
      in 20 patients diagnosed with autonomic failure. Five healthy subjects will be studied for
      comparison. The investigators will evaluate the subjects while on tilt table for 10 minutes
      and than while mounted from lying down to 70 degrees for additional 10 minutes. Blood
      pressure, heart rate and symptoms will be continuously measured. First study will evaluate
      the blood pressure changes. Second measure will include hand-grip maneuver 1 minute before
      the erect positon. Trans cranial Doppler will assess the intracranial blood flow during the
      position changes.

      Study 1:

      10 minutes lying on the tilt table. Performing TCD study at 10 minutes. Raising the tilt
      table to 70 degrees. Performing TCD study 5 minutes after tilting. Measuring blood pressure
      and symptoms for 10 minutes. Returning the tilt bed to supine position.

      Study 2. in continue with study 1:

      10 minutes lying on the tilt table. Performing TCD study at 10 minutes. Performing hand-grip
      at 50-70% grip force for 1 minute Raising the tilt table to 70 degrees. Performing TCD study
      5 minutes after tilting. Measuring blood pressure and symptoms for 10 minutes. Returning the
      tilt bed to supine position.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in orthostatic blood fall after tilting with and without hand grip.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes after tilting the subjects.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be tilted to 70 degrees twice. Hand grip maneuver will be performed 1 minute before the second tilt study and the differences in blood pressure changes [baseline-end tilt (mmHg)] will be compared between the two studies and to those obtained from a healthy control group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the intracranial blood flow after tilting with and without hand grip.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes after tilting.</time_frame>
    <description>Intracranial blood flow will be evaluated by transcranial doppler at baseline and after tilting. Differences will be compared [peak systolic flow (PSW) cm/sec], after tilting with and without prior hand grip and in comparison to tilting a control group.</description>
