  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, open-label Phase II clinical trial to determine the
      efficacy of combined plasma exchange (PEX), rituximab, and conventional corticosteroid
      administration, in comparison to corticosteroids alone, among patients with acute Idiopathic
      Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) exacerbations.

      The investigators central hypothesis is that antibody-mediated autoimmunity can play an
      important role in IPF exacerbations. The investigators propose to test our central hypothesis
      by establishing the efficacy of autoantibody removal by plasma exchange (PEX), in conjunction
      with B-cell depletion by rituximab to deplete immunoglobulins and minimize their further
      production, among patients with acute IPF exacerbations.

      The primary goal of this randomized, multi-center, open-label Phase II clinical trial is to
      determine effects of combined plasma exchange (PEX), rituximab, and conventional
      corticosteroid administration on selected, relevant immunological parameters, in comparison
      to effects of steroids alone, among AE-IPF patients. The investigators anticipate the
      findings of this will lead to larger incremental trial(s) to determine actual clinical
      efficacy of this treatment.

      A total of 40 subjects will be enrolled in this multi-center trial from 5 participating
      medical centers.
