    <textblock>
      Cholangiocarcinoma is one of the most common cause of cancer death in Thailand. Patients with
      cholangiocarcinoma are often diagnosed at advanced stage. Palliative therapeutic approaches
      consisting of percutaneous and endoscopic biliary drainage have usually been used for these
      patients, since there is no effective chemotherapeutic treatment for this type of cancer.
      Activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is frequently
      found in cholangiocarcinoma cells. It has been suggested to be a key step leading to the
      progression of cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, the investigators hypothesize that
      inhibition of mTOR may be useful in treating cholangiocarcinoma.

          -  Patients with at least one measurable lesion at baseline as per the RECIST criteria.

          -  The following laboratory parameters at screening (visit 1):

        WBC are equal to or more than 3,000/uL. Platelet are equal to or more than 100,000/uL
        Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN. Patients with
        known liver metastases: AST and ALT ≤ 5 x ULN Total Bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl* (after drainage)
        Serum creatinine equal to or less than 2.0 x upper normal limit
