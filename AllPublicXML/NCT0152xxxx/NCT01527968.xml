  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TXA and EACA have been reported to reduce blood loss in cardiac and neuro surgery, but there
      is no literature available comparing the two in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The
      investigators want to determine if TXA or EACA compared with placebo are effective and safe
      for blood loss prevention in TKA by comparing blood loss, transfusion rates, and total cost.
