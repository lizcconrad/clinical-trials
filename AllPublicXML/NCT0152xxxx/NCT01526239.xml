  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed and third leading cause of
      cancer-related deaths in the United States for both men and women. The American Cancer
      Society (ACS) estimates about 108,070 new cases of colon cancer and 40,740 new cases of
      rectal cancer will be diagnosed, and about 49,960 deaths will occur as a result of this
      devastating disease in 2008. Over the last 20 years, the death rate for this cancer has been
      dropping as a result of screening and early detection of cancer. In 2007, ACS reported that
      early-stage colorectal cancer had a survival rate close to 80%, and up to 9,632 deaths could
      be prevented each year if eligible patients received screening when necessary. However,
      despite the proven efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, only about 50% of eligible
      US patients are currently being screened.

      Specific Aims

      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patient-initiated prompting of primary care
      physicians of the patient's interest in screening will increase referrals for CRC screening.
      The following three areas will be investigated during this research:

        1. To determine whether a communication tool provided to patients will initiate a
           conversation with their primary care physicians about CRC screening, especially via
           colonoscopy.

        2. To determine whether this tool will impact referral patterns for screening, especially,
           although not primarily, among poor and underserved populations.

        3. To determine whether differences exist in regard to patient-physician communication
           patterns about screening among residents and faculties in the fields of internal
           medicine and family practice clinics.

      At the close of the investigators study, the investigators wish to organize quantifiable data
      demonstrating how patient-initiated prompting of primary care physicians for CRC screening
      increases early detection and decreases potential mortality from colorectal cancer. This data
      will inform a second, larger study to pursue the questions surrounding patient-initiated
      prompting in
