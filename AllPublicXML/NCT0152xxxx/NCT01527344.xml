  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a progressive disease of the coronary arteries in
      transplanted hearts which is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The broad
      objective of this research study is to advance our ability to diagnose as early as possible
      the presence of CAV and to non-invasively predict those patients at increased risk of CAV
      with novel techniques. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel intracoronary imaging
      technique using an optical analog of ultrasound with a resolution 10 times greater resolution
      than intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in peripheral blood
      have been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and peripheral arterial
      tonometry is a clinical tool used to predict endothelial dysfunction (a precursor of
      atherosclerosis) which has been validated in non-transplant patients. Patients scheduled for
      routine cardiac catheterization with IVUS at the Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota (MN) that
      reach inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study will be approached on the day to get
      informed consent to perform OCT, blood sampling and peripheral endothelial function testing.
      The investigators aim to 1) compare the frequency and plaque type of CAV as defined with OCT
      versus IVUS-Virtual Histology (IVUS-VH), 2) predict the presence and severity of CAV with
      absolute counts of EPCs and 3) with peripheral endothelial function scores.
