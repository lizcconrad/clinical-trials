  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to assess Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) according to physical
      function, as measured by a specific Questionnaire (Health Assessment Questionnaire), in
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients who begin therapy with subcutaneous Anti-Tumour Necrosis
      Factor alpha (TNFα) Certolizumab Pegol (CZP).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, prospective, and post-authorization observational study. This
      non-interventional study is designed to establish the importance of the measurement of HRQoL
      data and patient-reported outcomes in clinical practice in patients with RA, and to assess
      efficacy and safety use of CZP according to the summary of product characteristics.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a measure of function in Rheumatoid Arthritis. There are 20 items in eight categories that represent a comprehensive set of functional activities on a scale from 0 (without difficulty) to 3 (unable to perform without assistance). The category scores are averaged into an overall HAQ-DI from 0 to 3. Scores of 0 to 1 generally represent mild to moderate difficulty, 1 to 2 represent moderate to severe disability, and 2 to 3 indicate severe to very severe disability.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 measures the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). It is a 36-item survey that measures eight domains of health. Four of these domains belong to physical health and four domains to mental health. Domain scores are generated from the SF-36. In addition, two summary scores can also be derived from the SF-36: The Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS).</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Week 0) to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is used for assessing disease activity in RA. The number of swollen and tender joints will be assessed using 28-joint counts (tender 28 and swollen 28). The ESR is measured in mm/h. In addition the Patient's General Health (GH) is obtained and recorded on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 100 mm. Using this data, the DAS28 [ESR] can be calculated.</description>
