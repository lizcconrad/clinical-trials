  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were recruited if their healthcare provider decided that they needed treatment with
      a special Internal Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD) called a biventricular ICD. The investigators
      did this study to see if part of the nerve organ, called the sympathetic nervous system, may
      be responsible for the improvement seen in patients that receive biventricular pacing. The
      investigators had three ways to measure sympathetic nervous activity: 1) by using a special
      blood sample, 2) by monitoring heart rhythm, and 3) by performing a special heart scan.

      The Specific Aim #1 of this study is to assess, with 123iodine metaiodobenzylguanidine
      (123I-MIBG imaging), whether cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) rebalances and improves
      the integrity and function of sympathetic nerve terminals in the failing myocardium. The
      study will test the hypothesis that resynchronization of biventricular contractility
      attenuates excessive sympathetic drive, and improves autonomic function and cardiac
      performance.

      The Specific Aim #2 of this study is to determine the relationship between 123I-MIBG labeling
      of sympathetic activity and physiological measures of cardiopulmonary and autonomic function.
      This aim is to test the hypothesis that impaired cardiac sympathetic activity, determined by
      123I-MIBG imaging will be associated with poorer submaximal exercise gas exchange (higher
      ventilation - carbon dioxide (CO2) slopes, low end tidal CO2, reduced oxygen pulse and a more
      rapid frequency response) as well as reduced heart rate power spectral frequencies, a blunted
      response to positional changes and a delayed heart rate recovery.

    <measure>Change in submaximal exercise gas exchange</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will perform simplified low intensity cardiopulmonary exercise testing in our laboratory where they breathe for 1 min at rest, perform graded step exercise, increasing from 60, 90, 120 steps per minute until achieving a perceived exertion of 12-14 on the 6-20 Borg scale. This will be followed by a 1 min recovery. Subjects will be instrumented with ECG, pulse oximeter and breathe on a mouthpiece where ventilation, oxygen and carbon dioxide are measured continuously to calculate the desired parameters of ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2), PetCO2 and oxygen pulse (O2Pulse) on a breath by breath basis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autonomic function</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>In addition to the simplified submaximal step test, subjects will also perform a simplified battery of tests for autonomic function. This will include supine to upright measures of heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), paced breathing (slow to faster frequencies) as well as tracking HRV and responses to the increased metabolic demands of exercise and into recovery.</description>
