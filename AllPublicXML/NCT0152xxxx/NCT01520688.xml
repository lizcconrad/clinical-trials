  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with mild persistent asthma that have asthma symptoms once or twice a week and use a
      daily controller, while children with mild intermittent asthma rarely have asthma symptoms
      and do not use a daily controller. Inhaled corticosteroids are the standard treatment for
      mild peristent asthma. The purpose of this study is to measure children rate of growth while
      on different inhaled corticosteroids.

      A randomized, cross over study evaluating the effect of Flovent Discus 100 mcg BID vs QVAR 80
      mcg BID vs Pulmicort Flexhaler 180 mcg BID on short term growth in pediatric subjects with
      asthma.

      Objectives:

        1. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of Flovent Diskus 100 mcg
           BID versus Pulmicort Flexhaler 180 mcg BID on short-term lower leg growth velocity as
           measured by knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma.

        2. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the effect of Flovent Diskus 100 mcg
           BID versus QVAR 80 mcg BID on short-term lower leg growth velocity as measured by
           knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma.

      Aims:

        1. The primary aim is to show that there is a growth suppressive effect of Pulmicort
           Flexhaler 180 mcg BID versus Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID in children with mild asthma.

        2. The secondary aim to show that there is a growth suppressive effect of QVAR 80 mcg BID
           versus Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID in children with mild asthma.

      Hypotheses:

        1. The primary hypothesis is that treatment with Pulmicort Flexhaler 180mcg BID as compared
           to Flovent Diskus 100 mcg BID has a growth suppressive effect on lower leg length as
           assessed by knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma.

        2. The secondary hypothesis is that treatment with QVAR 80 mcg BID as compared to Flovent
           Diskus 100 mcg BID has a growth suppressive effect on lower leg length as assessed by
           knemometry in pediatric subjects with mild asthma.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will include females (6 to 9 years of age) and males (6 to 11 years of age).

          2. All subjects must have a history of physician diagnosed mild intermittent or mild
             persistent asthma as documented by PCP medical record or detailed history by study
             investigator.

          3. All subjects must have a height within normal limits (5th to 95th percentile) and no
             history of abnormal growth as assessed by medical history.

          4. All subjects must be pre-pubertal (Tanner Stage 1 Sexual Maturity) as assessed by
             physical examination.

          5. Subjects may be on current treatment with montelukast as this drug does not affect
             growth. If a subject is on montelukast at screening/baseline, they will remain on a
             stable dose throughout the study.

          6. Subjects must be willing to comply with study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects will be excluded if they have asthma greater than mild persistent severity as
             defined by NHLBI guidelines.

          2. Subjects will be excluded if they used any systemic or nasal steroids within the past
             60 days.

          3. Subjects will be excluded if they had more than one burst of systemic steroids within
             the past year.

          4. Subjects will be excluded if their baseline FEV1 is &lt; 80% predicted.

          5. Subjects will be excluded if they have any other serious systemic disease other than
             asthma.

             to chickenpox or measles.

          9. Subjects will be excluded if they have any history of tuberculosis of the respiratory
             tract.

         10. Subjects will be excluded if they have any active fungal, bacterial, viral or
             parasitic infections.

             eye.

         12. Subjects will be excluded if they have taken any immunosuppressive drugs within the

             health issues, such as autism, moderate to severe mental retardation or severe
             ADHD,that interferes with their ability to complete the knemometry measurements.

         15. Subjects will be excluded if an investigator deems they have any physical issues, such
             as inability to sit independently or amputation of lower leg, that interferes with
             their ability to complete the knemometry measurements.
