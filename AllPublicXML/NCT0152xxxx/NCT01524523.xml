      Background:

      - Many people feel pain during and after bone marrow aspiration (collection). Studies suggest
      that pain may be related to different kinds of inflammation, or the presence of nitric oxide
      (a normally occurring gas) in the body. Researchers want to study nitric oxide levels in the
      blood and breath before and after bone marrow collection. They will look at how these levels
      relate to feelings of pain.

      Objectives:

      - To better understand pain related to having a bone marrow collection.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are enrolled in a study that requires bone marrow
      collection.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood sample.

        -  Participants will provide study blood and breath samples to check nitric oxide levels.
           Participants will also have a test to measure skin sensitivity to heat and touch.

        -  During the collection, participants will keep track of their pain levels.

        -  After the collection, participants will keep track of any pain medications they take.
           They will also record if and when they eat any foods that contain nitrates for about 24
           hours.

      Abstract:

      This project will explore the biochemical mechanisms associated with acute pain produced by
      bone marrow aspiration in 36 healthy subjects by : 1) Evaluation of any strong relationships
      of NO metabolism (as measured by plasma nitrite, nitrosated proteins, cyclic GMP, plasma
      hemoglobin, reticulocytes, as well as markers of inflammation) with the levels of acute pain
      in healthy subjects and; 2) Identification of differentially expressed genes and proteins as
      markers for the nature and severity of pain from bone marrow aspiration. Elucidation of these
      relationships may identify novel targets for intervention leading to attenuation of pain,
      improved treatment and less impact on quality of life (QOL) and may identify potential
      mechanisms for the role of NO in other inflammatory or pain syndromes.

      Objectives:

      The first objective of the study is to characterize genetic expression during acute pain and
      pain free phases pre and post bone marrow aspiration (BMA). The second objective is to
      measure at multiple time points levels of exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO) and other biomarkers in
      subjects during pre- and post BMA. The third objective is to evaluate acute and experimental
      pain perception in these subjects.

      Population:

      This study will recruit healthy subjects (N=36) who have agreed to donate bone marrow.

      Design:

      This is a prospective, exploratory study of sensory and affective pain in healthy volunteers.
      Participants will undergo evaluations (eNO, blood collection, and quantitative sensory
      testing) during a clinic visit to undergo bone marrow aspiration.

      Importance:

      The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of the biochemical and molecular
      genetic mechanisms associated with acute pain in a healthy population by characterizing the
      leukocyte transcriptome of pain pre- and post BMA. It is hypothesized that analysis of the
      transcriptome will result in a panel of biomarkers that correlate with acute pain in a
      healthy population. The successful elucidation of these relationships may identify novel
      targets for intervention leading to attenuation of pain, improved treatment and less impact
      on quality of life and functional status.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR SUBJECTS:

        All subjects enrolled in the parent protocol are eligible for enrollment in this study
        provided they have met all the inclusion criteria in the parent protocol and if they meet
        all of the following criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years old.

          -  No chronic medication use that in the judgment of the investigators could confound the
             study or biomarker measurements.

          -  Can speak and understand English to complete assessments and scales

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ALL STUDY PARTICIPANTS:
