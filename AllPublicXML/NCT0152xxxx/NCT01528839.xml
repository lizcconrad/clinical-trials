  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that thyroid axis dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology
      of bipolar illness. Open-label studies have consistently demonstrated that the behavioral
      expression of bipolar disorder can be modified by a change in thyroid status, and in many
      instances the course of illness is improved through the use of adjunct thyroid hormone
      treatment. Recent evidence emerged from acute intervention studies that add-on treatment with
      supraphysiological doses of levothyroxine is an effective augmenting agent in patients with a
      major depressive episode. The primary goal of this international multicenter trial (5 sites)
      is to determine in a 13-week, randomized, placebo-controlled design (1 week single-blind
      placebo run-in, 6 week double-blind, 6 week open-label) the efficacy and safety of add-on
      treatment with levothyroxine (300 mcg/d) in combination with mood stabilizer/antidepressant
      therapy in the treatment of patients with bipolar depression. The main hypotheses is:
      treatment with levothyroxine will result in a significantly greater mean reduction of HRSD
      total score and in a higher number of responders and remitters compared to placebo treatment.
      This proposal will build on our pilot data and provide evidence for the use of levothyroxine
      as an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of bipolar depression.
