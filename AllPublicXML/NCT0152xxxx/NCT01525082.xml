      capecitabine, temozolomide and bevacizumab in the treatment of advanced pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate if the combination of capecitabine and temozolomide with bevacizumab for
      metastatic or unresectable neuroendocrine tumors will improve response rate (RR) by 62% over
      historical controls (null RR of 40% to true RR 65%).

      II. Assess the toxicities using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier
      analysis.

      II. To assess O6-methyl guanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) by
      central pathology (path) review.

      III. To assess serum hormone marker levels. IV. To evaluate computed tomography (CT)
      Perfusion as a tool to predict early therapeutic response. (Optional) V. To bank serum for
      future correlative analyses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15,
      capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14, and temozolomide PO once daily (QD)
      on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up patients are followed up for 1
      year.

    <description>RR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response + partial response (CR + PR] based on a patient's best response. The proportion of RR (CR+PR) will be estimated along with a one-sided lower 95% exact confidence bound to allow an informal assessment of the null hypothesis (RR=40%) based on binomial probabilities.</description>
