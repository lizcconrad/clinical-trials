      A randomized parallel-group clinical pilot study was designed to evaluate the impact of glass
      fiber reinforced composite posts compared to prefabricated titanium posts on long term
      survival of adhesively restored endodontically treated abutment teeth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to vital teeth the complication rate of restorations fixed on endodontically treated
      abutment teeth is higher. Endodontically treated teeth are more prone to fracture due to the
      higher amount of calcified tooth structure loss. To level the biological short coming the
      choice of the mechanically appropriate post material is still a major concern. There a two
      major approaches. One is to use a rigid material to stiffen the post-endodontic complex and
      the other is to use a material which shows dentin-like material properties to allow the
      post-endodontic complex to flex under load. It was aim of the presented randomised controlled
      trial to compare the survival rates of abutment teeth self-adhesively restored with either
      prefabricated glass-fiber reinforced composite posts or titanium posts.

      The null-hypothesis was that there is no difference regarding survival rate between
      glass-fiber and titanium post restored endodontically treated abutment teeth with two or less
      remaining cavity walls.

    <time_frame>84 months after post placement</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were recalled at 3, 6, 12 month and thereafter in al yearly recall up to 84 month after post placement for clinical examination. The clinical examination was performed by one blinded dentist.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>tooth loss, post debonding, post fracture, vertical or horizontal root fracture, endodontic or periradicular conditions requiring endodontic re-treatment, secondary caries and failure of core build-up and loss of restoration due to technical failures</measure>
    <time_frame>84 month after post placement</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical examination was performed by one blinded dentist. Follow-up examinations were performed with a dental probe to detect marginal gap formation of restorations. After 12 and 60 months radiographs were taken and examined by one operator (MN) to exclude the possibility of radiographic symptoms of failure, e.g. periodontal or periapical lesions.</description>
