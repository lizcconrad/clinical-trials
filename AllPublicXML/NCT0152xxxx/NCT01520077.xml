  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects, non pregnant/lactating and over 18years old, with 40% alopecia areata will take
      vytorin (statin/ezetimibe) for 24 or 52 weeks and be monitored for hair regrowth.

      The investigators hypothesize that Vytorin medication may have an effect on the inflammatory
      process of alopecia areata. Inactivating the inflammatory process may help in permitting hair
      regrowth in those subjects.

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of oral simvastatin + ezetimibe (Vytorin) in treating alopecia
      areata in subjects 18 years and older.

      Secondary objective:

      To investigate the presence of heat shock proteins in alopecia areata subjects, before and
      after treatment with oral simvastatin.

      Subjects will be asked to take vytorin 10/40 for a period of 24 or 52 weeks and monitored for
      progression of hair regrowth. They will have Lipids, creatinine kinase (CK), liver function
      tests (LFTs), obtained on baseline visit prior to starting the medication and at visit 2,
      week 8. LFTs will be continuously monitored at visit 4, 7, week 24 and week 40.

      In case of muscular pain or tenderness the medication will be stopped immediately. In most
      cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when simvastatin treatment was promptly
      discontinued.

      All adverse events will be recorded

      The investigators are going to exclude:

      oChildren less than 18 years

        -  Pregnant women

        -  Lactating women

        -  Subjects with kidney, liver or muscle disease

        -  Allergy to the drug or its components. Subjects with history of uncontrolled
           hypothyroidism, The investigators Hypothesize that this medication may have an effect on
           the inflammatory process of alopecia areata. Inactivating the inflammatory cascade may
           help in permitting hair regrowth in those subjects.
