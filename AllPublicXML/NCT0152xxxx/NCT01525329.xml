  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, intra-patient comparative study is designed to investigate the combination
      regimen of 5-FU and PDT, versus PDT alone, for its ability to generate significantly elevated
      levels of the target photosensitizer, PpIX, in lesions of actinic keratoses (AKs) and to more
      effectively treat and prevent recurrence of AKs. The target population comprises patients
      with solid organ transplants (renal, hepatic), as well as normal (immunocompetent) subjects
      to control for possible influences of immunosuppression.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will test a new combination of 5-fluorouracil cream (5FU) and
      methylaminolevate photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT), versus MAL-PDT alone, as treatment for
      actinic keratoses (AKs) in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients (OTRs) and an
      immunocompetent control group. Objectives: 1) Determine whether topical pretreatment with
      5-FU selectively increases the amount of photosensitizer (PpIX) produced within AK lesions,
      relative to non-pretreated lesions. 2) Determine whether the combination treatment improves
      lesion resolution and reduces the incidence of new AKs. 3) Determine whether biomarkers in
      tissue and blood are predictive of patient responsiveness to 5FU (PpIX induction, new lesion
      incidence, and clinical toxicity).

      20 organ transplant recipients and 20 normal patients, with AKs on face, scalp, ears,
      forearms or back of the hand are enrolled through Dermatology and Transplant Clinic at
      Cleveland Clinic. Women of childbearing age must use contraception and have a negative
      pregnancy test.

      Study participants will apply 5FU daily for 6 days; MAL/PDT is administered on 7th day. PpIX
      will be measured in lesions using a noninvasive dosimeter. Biopsies will be taken from
      selected lesions, and AKs will be photographed. Participants will be asked to complete a
      questionnaire to document adverse events. Patients are evaluated at day 14, and months 3, 6,
      9, 12, to document AK clearance and new lesion appearance.

    <description>All patients will receive one cream, 5-Fluorouracil, and will be instructed to apply the cream according to the randomization schema to AKs on either the right or left side of the face/scalp once a day for 6 days prior to PDT. A baseline measurement of the tumor's ability to produce PpIX will be done by applying methyl-aminolevulinic acid (Metvixia® topical cream) to the selected AKs and using the Aurora© dosimeter. Prior to Metvixia, and again 3 hours after application, surface measurements of the PpIX fluorescence will be taken. Then, the two largest precancer lesions (one on the left side, one on the right side) will be biopsied under local anesthesia, followed by red light PDT (lasting ~8 minutes). The biopsy sites will be shielded from the light with a circular spot bandage.</description>
