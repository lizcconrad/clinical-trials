      OBJECTIVE: The principal objective of the trial is to evaluate whether the addition of
      cetuximab associated with 5-fluorouracil in elderly patients with KRAS wild type advanced
      colorectal cancer (CRC) prolongs Progression Free Survival, compared with 5-fluorouracil
      alone.

      The primary efficacy analyses will be performed on the Intention-to-treat population.

      The safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population.

        -  Median PFS and OS in each treatment arm with its 95% CI, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
           technique

        -  Response rates by treatment arm with their exact 95% CI

        -  IADL sum score, G8 sum score and social situation by treatment arm at baseline and at
           each timepoint of assessment

        -  QoL scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-ELD14 modules by treatment arm at baseline and
           at each timepoint of assessment

        -  Safety data by treatment arm in the Safety population. Worst toxicity grade over all
           cycles according to the CTCAE criteria version 4.0 by treatment arm.

        -  Pharmaco-economics evaluation

      Summary of proposed Phase II trial characteristics:

        1. Total number of randomized patients: 150.

        2. Total number of events at phase II analysis for primary endpoint: 110.

        3. Total number of patients screened over the phase II: 250.

        4. Total number of patients treated with cetuximab for the Phase II study: 75.

        5. Maximum study duration: 19 months.

      In the present study, HRQoL is an important secondary endpoint. The objective of the HRQoL
      data collection in this Phase II trial is to assess the impact of the addition of cetuximab
      on patients' HRQoL during treatment.

      The hypothesis is that there will be no difference in patients' HRQoL between both treatment
      arms during treatment. The HRQoL domains (from the EORTC QLQ-C30 module) which are expected
      to be affected by treatment (to the same extent in both arms) are Global health status,
      Fatigue, Pain and Stool habits.
