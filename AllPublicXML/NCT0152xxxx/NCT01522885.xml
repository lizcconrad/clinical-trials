  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether if KatGuide (a new developed medical
      device) improves the placing of a large bore chest tube in the pleural cavity compared to the
      conventional method.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Chest tube placement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>X-ray examination of the chest is performed within 3 hours after the chest tube insertion, to evaluate if the placement of the chest tube is acceptable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of hospital stay</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>The hospital stay depends on how long time it takes to solve the chest tube related problem. In a few patients it takes only one day, but in severe cases it may take weeks before the patient can be discharged. We predict, that the patient will be in hospital for a mean time of 5 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time with chest tube</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days (mean time)</time_frame>
    <description>A few patients can have the chest tube removed in only one day, but some patients must have a chest tube for weeks. We predict that the patients will have a chest tube in a mean time of 3 days.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Infection in wound</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>4 weeks after the chest tube insertion, the patient is contacted and the patient is asked whether there are problems with infection of the wound.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of chest tubes</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days (mean time)</time_frame>
    <description>It is observed whether the patient has multiple chest tubes inserted in the pleural cavity at the same side. It is predicted, that these patients are hospitalized longer than patients with only one chest tube. We predict, that these patients are hospitalized for a mean time of 7 days.</description>
