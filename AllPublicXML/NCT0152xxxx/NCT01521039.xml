      Assessment of MicroRNA Expression in Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (GVHD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the expression levels of a novel class of
      molecules, called microRNAs, are associated with acute graft-versus-host disease frequency
      and severity. Acute graft-versus-host disease is a Acute GVHD is a medical condition that can
      become very serious. It happens when the donor cells attack and damage your tissues after
      transplant.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure miR-155 expression levels over time in the serum from patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplant, and evaluate if miR-155 expression can predict development of aGVHD (Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease)</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare miR-155 expression at the time of clinical suspicion of aGVHD in allogeneic recipients with aGVHD diagnosis with matched allogeneic recipients without aGVHD.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 weeks</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perform serum global microRNA analysis in allogeneic recipients at the time of clinical suspicion of aGVHD to identify other miRNAs that are associated with aGVHD diagnosis and severity.</measure>

    <measure>Collect and store serum/plasma and mononuclear cells from patients receiving allogeneic blood and marrow stem cell transplantation.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Perform the following: a) validation of the miRNA expression profiling signatures; b) correlation of miRNA expression among serum, plasma and mononuclear cells; and c) correlation of relevant miRNA targets or regulators expression (at the RNA or protein level) with miR-155 and other miRNAs expression identified in the aGVHD miRNA signatures.</description>
