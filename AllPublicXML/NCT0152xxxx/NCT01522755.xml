  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pacing leads are key elements of a pacing system as their proper functioning is one of the
      major factors affecting the long term performance of the whole system.

      Success of a pacing lead implant can be defined considering 3 items: ease of lead implant,
      lead stability and lead electrical performances.

      These factors may be related to the physician experience (global implant experience,
      experience with a given lead), to the implant procedure (lead access, lead position, implant
      time, scopy time) to the lead (handling and mechanical characteristics) and to the patient
      (ischemic history).

      Even though implant success rate is quite high with currently available leads, the weight of
      the different factors influencing success has never been studied systematically. The
      objective of the current study is then to define the predictive factors of an implant success
      with the CapsureFix MRI model 5086.

      This lead has been selected because it has been available for a short period, so the
      investigators have a limited experience of it and it has a unique design which makes it
      conditionally safe in an MRI environment and which may be associated with specific handling
      characteristics.

    <description>To define the predictive factors of a successful implant of the CapsureFix MRI lead model 5086 Influence of the following factors will be assesssed: physician experience parameters (i.e. number of annual implants, years of pacing experience, annual number of tined and screw-in atrial and ventricular leads implanted), handling characteristics score, fluoroscopy and implant time, vein approach, implant sites and patient history.</description>
