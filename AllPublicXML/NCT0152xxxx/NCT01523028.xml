      Data and knowledge gathered on bioavailability of coffee phenolics is becoming more and more
      important, hence underlying the importance of better understanding the fate of these
      potential health promoting antioxidants. However, some analytical barriers as well as some
      key aspects of metabolism still remain to be fully elucidated to get the full picture of
      coffee metabolism and bioavailability. One aspect addressed in the present study is the
      impact of food matrix in modulating absorption, plasma appearance and urinary excretion of
      coffee bioactives.

    <description>Amounts of chlorogenic acids will be normalized to body weight (3.1 mg CA / kg BW). Coffee will be reconstituted in 200 mL hot water and consumed 3 times in a row (min 1-week interval), alone or with a breakfast:

200 mL coffee + 2 bread rolls + honey
200 mL coffee + 1 bread roll + peanut butter</description>
