  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase II trial evaluating the antitumor activity and safety of the
      oral Histone Deacetylase (HDAC)-Inhibitor LBH589. The treatment consists of 20 mg LBH589
      three times a week in patients with chemo-refractory HDAC overexpressing.

      metastatic adenocarcinoma of stomach, esophagogastric junction or lower esophagus (Barrett
      carcinoma). One cycle lasts 21 days. A total of 28 patients will be enrolled in this trial.
      In patients experiencing LBH589-related toxicity requiring treatment rest or dose reduction
      dose may be reduced. Subsequent dose adjustment will be permitted based on outcome. Treatment
      will continue until disease progression or intolerable adverse events. Subsequently, the
      patients will be followed-up for one year.
