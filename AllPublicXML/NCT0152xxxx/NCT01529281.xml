  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well documented that exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) decreases muscle function
      and causes severe soreness and discomfort. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation
      has been shown to increase protein synthesis and decrease muscle protein breakdown, however,
      the effects of BCAAs on recovery from EIMD are unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to
      examine the effects of a BCAA supplement on markers of muscle damage.

    <time_frame>pre-exercise, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h</time_frame>
    <description>Vertical jump (VJ) performance was assessed using the Vertec instrument. Participants performed a counter movement jump.</description>

    <description>Muscle soreness - Participants were asked to perform and hold a squat (90Â° knee angle) whilst they rated their perceived muscle soreness on a 200 mm visual analogue scale. The scale consisted of a line from 0 mm (no pain) to 200 mm (unbearably painful).</description>

    <description>Supplementation lasted for a total of 12 days; this was based on previous research showing a positive with BCAA supplementation on markers of muscle damage. Participants ingested 10 g, twice per day (morning and evening) of BCAA . The BCAA supplement contained a ratio of 2:1:1 (leucine, isoleucine and valine, respectively). The BCAA was in powder form where each serving was mixed with ~300 ml of water.</description>

    <description>Supplementation lasted for a total of 12 days. Participants ingested an equivalent looking volume to 10 g of BCAA, twice per day (morning and evening) of placebo (aspartame based artificial sweetener). The BCAA supplement contained a ratio of 2:1:1 (leucine, isoleucine and valine, respectively). The artificial sweetener was in powder form where each serving was mixed with ~300 ml of water.</description>
