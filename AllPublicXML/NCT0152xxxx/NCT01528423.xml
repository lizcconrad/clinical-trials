  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research is intended to evaluate the short-term reproducibility of the XtremeCT device
      for measurements of peripheral bone density and bone structure in population-based volunteers
      from different age groups and to compare the XtremeCT with current peripheral quantitative
      computed tomography (pQCT) technology. The investigators will also assess the correlation
      between XtremeCT measurements of bone structure with hormones and biochemical markers of bone
      turnover.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators plan to perform high resolution-peripheral quantitative computer tomography
      (HR-pQCT) using the XtremeCT device in future research studies to investigate the structural
      changes that occur during adolescence and young adulthood to attain peak bone mass (peak bone
      strength) and to evaluate the structural effects of anabolic treatments for osteoporosis.
      This preliminary study will establish the short term precision of the device in the
      populations that the investigators are likely to study and whether the new device is superior
      to their current pQCT device. It will also provide information on how measurements from the
      new device relate to bone turnover markers, which are one of their standard assessments of
      bone metabolism. They will also determine whether hormones that influence bone metabolism
      have specific effect on different components of bone structure. By providing data on the size
      and variability of differences in bone structure by gender and at important stages of
      skeletal development (end of longitudinal growth, peak bone mass and aging) this study will
      also form the basis of power calculations for future longitudinal studies.
