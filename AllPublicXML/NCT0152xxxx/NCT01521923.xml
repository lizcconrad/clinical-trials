        <description>Erosions were assessed in 16 locations per hand and 6 joints per foot. Erosions for each hand location were scored from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion. Scores 1 to 5 may have included combinations of discrete erosion(s) and/or large erosions. Erosions for each foot joint were scored from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no erosions.
The minimum possible total erosion score for all 32-hand joints was 0, the maximum possible erosion score for all 32-hand joints was 160. The minimum possible total erosion score for all 12-feet joints was 0, the maximum possible erosion score for all 12 feet joints was 120. Thus, the minimum possible total erosion score for hands and feet was 0, the maximum possible total erosion score for hands and feet was 280. Higher values represent greater damage.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Previous Study RA0055 Period 1 in Disease Activity Score [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28 [ESR]) to Week 104 in RA0055 Period 2</title>
        <description>DAS28[ESR] is calculated using the Tender Joint Count (TJC), Swollen Joint Count (SJC) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (PtGADA-VAS in mm) using the following formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x PtGADA, where 28 joints are examined and a lower score indicates less disease activity. DAS28[ESR] ranges from 0-10 with higher values representing higher disease activity.
A negative value in DAS28[ESR] change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Previous Study RA0055 Period 1 in the Bristol Rheumatoid Arthritis Fatigue- Multidimensional Questionnaire (BRAF-MDQ) Total Score to Week 104 in RA0055 Period 2</title>
        <description>BRAF-MDQ total score ranges from 0 to 70 (with higher scores indicating worse fatigue), whereas the score for each dimension is different due to the varied number of questions (0 –22 for physical, 0- 21 for living, 0- 15 for cognition, and 0- 12 for emotion). A negative value in BRAF-MDQ change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Low Disease Activity (LDA) at Week 104 in RA0055 Period 2</title>
          <description>LDA is defined as achieving a Disease Activity Score 28 [Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate] (DAS28 [ESR]) &lt;= 3.2.
DAS28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0 with a higher value indicating a higher disease activity.</description>
          <population>FAS2 with NRI. FAS2 did not include subjects who had received PBO+MTX in Period 1 as this was not part of the study objectives for the Period 2 efficacy analyses
1 subject in the CZP+MTX/CZP Q2W+MTX and 1 in the CZP+MTX/PBO+MTX arm had post Week 52 assessments, but weren´t dosed in Period 2. They are included in the FAS2, but excluded from the SS2</population>

      <time_frame>Adverse events for Period 2 were collected from the date of the Week 52 study medication up to 70 days after the last (most recent) Certolizumab pegol (CZP) or Placebo (PBO) dose</time_frame>
      <desc>For the safety results, the main comparisons of interest are across the 3 CZP re-randomized groups; the PBO+MTX/PBO+MTX group is included for completeness.
For subjects induced/ re-induced with CZP due to flare, only AEs up to the time of induction/re-induction with CZP are included. Note that 3 SAEs occurred after induction/ re-induction.</desc>
