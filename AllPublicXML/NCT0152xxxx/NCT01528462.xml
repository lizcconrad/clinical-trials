    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators was to determine whether the immediate management of any
      detected sleep disorders can improve outcomes in patients who have had a transient ischemic
      attack (TIA) or minor stroke. This group of patients is at high risk for having a recurrent
      stroke or TIA, and the investigators would like to investigate new ways of preventing
      potentially avoidable events. The treatment of sleep disorders immediately after a stroke or
      TIA may prove to be a novel method of avoiding future strokes and improving outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Every year, thousands of people in Canada either die or are permanently disabled after
      suffering a stroke. This costs our society billions of dollars in physician services,
      hospital expenses, and decreased productivity. Some individuals are slightly more lucky;
      instead of having a severe stroke, they have either a very mild stroke or temporary stroke
      symptoms, also known as a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and do not experience any loss of
      abilities. However, mild strokes and TIA's can precede the onset of a more serious, disabling
      stroke. Most of the significant strokes that happen after a mild stroke or TIA occur within
      days of the original event; there is a need for early interventions that could prevent such
      occurrences.

      One of the goals of recent research has been to find ways to prevent major strokes after
      individuals have sustained a minor stroke or TIA. Up until now, stroke doctors have focused
      on treating elevated blood pressures and cholesterol levels, scanning the blood vessels in
      the neck for significant narrowings, and searching for irregular heart rhythms, all of which
      are treatable conditions that put patients at risk for having a stroke. Despite research
      which shows that sleep disorders such as sleep apnea (abnormal pauses in breathing during
      sleep) or restless legs syndrome (which can cause involuntary leg movements in sleep) are
      possible risk factors for stroke, these conditions are not routinely investigated by stroke
      doctors after a TIA or stroke.

      The investigators hypothesize that the study patients, who will all receive an expedited
      sleep assessment and expedited treatment of their sleep disorders, will have at the 3-month
      follow-up assessment: (i) Significantly improved quality of life at 3 months compared to
      baseline measurements (primary outcome); (ii) Improved outcomes on measures of sleepiness,
      psychomotor vigilance, daily function, depressive symptoms, cognition, and blood pressure at
      3 months (secondary outcomes).

    <description>Patients in this arm will undergo an expedited polysomnogram (if clinically necessary) and early treatment of any sleep disorders. Sleep-related disorders will be managed with the currently recommended therapies; patients with obstructive sleep apnea will be treated with positional therapy, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), etc., and those with restless legs syndrome will be treated with standard treatments such as iron, or dopaminergic agonists. Patients will also be counselled on improving their sleep hygiene and adjusting the timing of their medication administration to optimize efficacy. Furthermore, patients will receive information handouts.</description>
