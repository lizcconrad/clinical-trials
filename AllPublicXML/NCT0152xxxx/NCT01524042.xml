  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently colonoscopy has gained importance as screening programs for colon polyp, cancer and
      inflammatory bowel disease in the United States and other countries. The number of
      colonoscopy performed has been increased year by year. To make an increased compliance with
      colonoscopy in both screening and clinical surveillance programs, consideration of anxiety,
      shame and satisfaction in examinee is regarded to be important. During colonoscopy patients
      wear conventional single pants where there is no hole for insertion of scope. Patients take
      off the conventional single pants below the buttocks and expose their buttocks and perianal
      area during colonoscopy. Exposing perianal and perineal area during colonoscopy can make
      patients feel shameful and anxious and diminish satisfaction of colonoscopy. Recently
      considering the factors affecting satisfaction has been regarded to be important because
      patient satisfaction could be one of the quality indicators for colonoscopy. To diminish
      shame and anxiety by exposing perianal and perineal area of patients wearing conventional
      single pants during colonoscopy, we developed novel double pants with a hole in inner pants.
      Novel double pants are composed of double fabrics from hip to thigh and single fabric under
      the thigh such as common pants. In the inner pants of double pants, there is a hole for
      insertion of scope. The hole is 25 cm wide and 15 cm long. The outer pants are same as
      conventional single pants. If the patients dropped outer pants below hips, only hip and
      perianal area are exposed through the hole (25cm*15 cm) for insertion of scope without
      dropping inner pants. Therefore novel double pants minimized the exposed area of hips than
      conventional single pants because hips are exposed only the hole of inner pants. Smaller
      exposed area of hips by novel double pants can minimized the shame and anxiety by diminishing
      exposing perianal and perineal area during colonoscopy. Therefore advantage of novel double
      pants is decreasing shame and anxiety and increasing satisfaction by minimizing the exposed
      area of perianal and perineal area compared with conventional single pants. This study is a
      randomized controlled study. The investigators will survey the examinees older than 20 years
      who performed the colonoscopy at Severance Hospital from Feb. 2012 to Jul. 2012 to compare
      the effect on the satisfaction, shame, and anxiety during colonoscopy between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eighty examinees will wear conventional single pants and another eighty examinees will wear
      novel double pants randomly. Examinees who underwent colonoscopy within 3 years, with history
      of bowel resection surgery, cancer, colostomy or ileostomy, psychotic disease such as
      depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive disorder, treated with emergent colonoscopic
      procedure, and pregnant or lactating women, an illiterate person and foreigners will be
      excluded. Questionnaires before colonoscopy are educational background, martial status,
      indication of colonoscopy, examinee's preference of doctor's gender, and State-trait anxiety
      level of examinee. Questionnaires after colonoscopy are shame and trait anxiety level, and
      satisfaction of examinee during colonoscopy. We will also investigate colonoscopy specific
      quality Indicators such as the ASA status (American society of anesthesiologist's physical
      status), complications, procedure success. Finally we will compare the difference of
      satisfaction, shame, and anxiety during colonoscopy between examinees wearing novel double
      pants and conventional single pants
