  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine plus cisplatin is standard treatment for advanced urothelial cancer. Ipilimumab
      has shown intriguing activity as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with clinically localized
      bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy. The combination of gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus
      ipilimumab may build on the chemosensitivity of urothelial carcinoma to produce more durable
      responses and improved outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study

      Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8 Cisplatin 70 mg/m2 Day 1 Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg Day 1 (start
      cycle 3)

      Treatment during the induction phase will be administered in six 21-day cycles. During cycles
      1 and 2, gemcitabine plus cisplatin will be administered WITHOUT ipilimumab. During cycles
      3-6, combination therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus ipilimumab will be administered.
      Patients without evidence of disease progression (by irRC) after completion cycle 6 will
      continue single-agent ipilimumab maintenance every 3 months.

      Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥ 80% within 14 days prior to registration for protocol
      therapy.

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5k/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (except patients with Gilbert's
           Syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN. NOTE: If the patient has liver
           metastases present, then ≤ 5 x ULN

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 55 cc/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

      Cardiovascular: Not Specified

             conception throughout the study [and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product] in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.

          -  Prior Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease,
             including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's Disease, are excluded from this study, as are
             patients with a history of symptomatic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
             progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune
             vasculitis [eg, Wegener's Granulomatosis]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune
             origin (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis). Patients with other
             immune disorders should not be enrolled without discussion with the principal
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No active CNS metastases. Subjects with neurological symptoms must undergo a head CT
             scan or brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis.

             permitted.

          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to registration for
             protocol therapy.

          -  No underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab hazardous or obscure the
             interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.

          -  No non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab).

          -  No history of prior treatment with ipilimumab or prior CD137 agonist or CTLA 4
             inhibitor or agonist.

          -  No known active or chronic infection with HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C.

          -  No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating investigator.

          -  No chronic systemic corticosteroids (defined as the equivalent of prednisone ≥ 20 mg
             PO daily for &gt; 6 months during the past year)
