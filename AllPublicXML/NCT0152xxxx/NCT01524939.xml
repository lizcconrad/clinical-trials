      This clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, single-arm, and open-label clinical trial.

      Evaluate the incidence of coronary artery lesions in the 7th week of IVIG-SN administration,
      compared to the incidence of coronary artery lesions among untreated Kawasaki patients, to
      prove the superior efficacy of IVIG-SN.

             days), 4/5 standard clinical criteria

          3. Case definition for incomplete KD: Fever ≥ 5 days(but less than 10 days) and 3
             clinical criteria plus coronary artery lesion on echocardiogram.

          4. Subjects whose parents or legally acceptable representative (LAR) gave voluntary
             written consent to participate in this clinical trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those whose blood test results show abnormalities of significance as follows :

             hematocrit or red blood cell count exceed 30% of the upper limit of the normal range
             or are 30% below the lower limit of the normal range.

          2. Those who have been administered other clinical product in the last 30 days after this

             dysfunction, hemoglobinopathy, etc.)

          6. Those who have been administered an immunosuppressant or immune modifying drug in the
             last 3 months before the innoculation with the test product
