      Our study will enroll 644 randomly-selected Canadians who have been diagnosed with asthma by
      a physician within the previous five years. It will be determined what diagnostic tests were
      initially performed to make this diagnosis. Participants will undergo lung function testing
      over 6-8 weeks to determine their respiratory status and to confirm they have asthma.
      Participants may be followed up to one year depending on their test results.
