  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), saphenous vein from the leg is used to
      bypass the atherosclerotic blockages in the arteries of the heart. Unfortunately, vein
      bypasses themselves develop blockages over time, a process termed saphenous vein graft
      disease. By lowering cholesterol levels in the blood, statin medications are used after
      surgery to prevent the development of atherosclerotic blockages in the vein bypasses.
      Recently, higher doses of statin medications have been introduced, with some studies showing
      that they are more effective than traditional doses when used in heart attack patients.
      Furthermore, laboratory tests have shown that higher doses of statin medications can slow the
      development of atherosclerosis. Despite these benefits, very little is known regarding the
      use of high-dose statin therapy after bypass surgery in humans.

      The goal of this study will be to see if high-dose statin therapy will prevent the
      development of vein graft occlusion during the first year after bypass surgery. Patients will
      be randomized to receive either high-dose statin therapy or conventional moderate-dose statin
      therapy starting within 4 days of surgery and continuing for the duration of one year after
      the operation. The statin medication will be given in capsule form. During the course of this
      study, neither the patient nor the health care team will know which treatment each patient is
      receiving. One year after bypass surgery, a computed tomography (CT) coronary angiogram will
      be performed to evaluate the patency of the vein bypasses.

      The current clinical guidelines recommend treatment to achieve LDL levels &lt;100 mg/dL after
      surgical coronary revascularization. However, recent studies have illustrated that even more
      intensive lipid reduction with high-dose statins can further improve cardiovascular outcomes.
      Targeting LDL levels to 70 mg/dL after CABG with intensive statin therapy may prevent the
      process of postoperative saphenous vein graft disease and lead to improved graft patency.
      Therefore, in the ACTIVE Trial, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing
      high-dose (80 mg atorvastatin) to moderate-dose (10 mg atorvastatin)statin therapy in
      patients undergoing CABG with saphenous vein grafts. The effect of aggressive cholesterol
      therapy on the process of vein graft disease will be examined with computed tomography (CT)
      coronary angiography one year after CABG. This study will address the subject of
      postoperative high-dose statin therapy and help determine the optimal lipid-lowering strategy
      following CABG.
