  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the greatest cause of morbidity and mortality in the UK.
      Abnormalities in the concentration and/or composition of lipoproteins (the lipid carrying
      particles), in particular low density lipoproteins (LDL) in circulation, is one of the most
      important physiological defects contributing to the development of CVD.

      The LDL cholesterol (LDLC) response to fatty acid change is in part mediated by the APOE
      genotype, with E4 individuals (25% of the UK population) being most responsive to changes in
      dietary fats, showing greater reductions when low levels of saturated fats or fish oils are
      consumed and greater increases when high levels of these fats are consumed. Therefore the
      aims of the present study is to understand the mechanism that regulates the higher LDLC
      response associated with saturated fatty acids and fish oil consumption in healthy men
      prospectively recruited based on their APOE genotype.
