  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a special form of treatment which pinpoints
      high doses of radiation directly to cancer. Standard radiation (or photon radiation) is
      commonly used for SBRT to treat Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). Proton beam radiation is
      a special type of radiation only available at a few institutions in the US and has not been
      previously used in SBRT to treat NSCLC. The use of protons for SBRT may improve the accuracy
      of the treatment and may help to minimize the dose delivered unnecessarily to healthy tissue.

      In this study, the investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of proton-based
      SBRT for early-stage NSCLC located in the periphery of the lung.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo an electronic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) during which three
      markers will be placed around their tumor which will guide the delivery of proton beam
      radiation to their with more precision and accuracy.

      Subjects will receive a CT scan to obtain images to plan radiation treatment. Proton
      radiation will be delivered daily (4 or 5 consecutive days) on an outpatient basis at
      Massachusetts General Hospital.

      After the final dose of proton radiation subjects will be followed for 5 years. Subjects will
      be asked to return at 3 months, and then every 3 months until 2 years, and then every 6
      months until 5 years. Subjects will receive a chest CT, tumor assessment by CT or PET, chest
      x-ray, pulmonary function tests and a physical exam.
