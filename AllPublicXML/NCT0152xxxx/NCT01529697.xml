  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled medications are the mainstay of the therapeutic management of respiratory disorders.
      Considered by many to be 'simple' and 'easy' to use, clinicians are aware that inhalers are
      often improperly used. However, there is no tool that can detect and record errors in either
      the timing or the method dose administration

      The investigators designed a device that makes an acoustic record each time an inhaler is
      used. Opening the device makes an acoustic file which is recorded, this file is
      &quot;time-stamped&quot; which means that the timing of drug administration is recorded. When the
      device is retrieved and acoustic analysis performed, the steps involved in using the inhaler
      can be determined. Hence, the subjects inhaler technique is assessed and errors in the
      inhaler use identified. Together this means that errors in inhaler technique and timing of
      use can be quantified.

      In this study the investigators attached the device to a discus dry powder inhaler. In order
      to eliminate the behavioral component of adherence and identify the mechanical issues
      associated with effective inhaler use the investigators studied subjects who were already in
      Hospital and already prescribed a discus inhaler. The investigators hypothesized that the
      device would identify which errors in technique were the most common and that this would
      provide insight into how these errors might be eliminated.

    <measure>Adherence rate</measure>
    <time_frame>at three months</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of actual adherence at baseline and at the end of the study, which at the end of the 3 month of study will be assessed. The actual inhaler adherence, expressed as cumulative drug exposure, is calculated by combining the time of use along with the interval between doses (correct time is twice a day, in a period not less than 6 hours between the last dose and the subsequent dose or at a time greater than 18 hours apart from the previous dose.) and incorporating, by audio analysis, if the inhaler was used correctly.</description>
