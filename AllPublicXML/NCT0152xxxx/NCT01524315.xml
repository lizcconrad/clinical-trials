  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether preoperative parenteral thiamin
      supplementation does prevent the intra and early postoperative increase of lactate and
      whether this effect is related to the extent of thiamine deficiency in patients undergoing
      heart surgery. In addition the prevalence of major thiamin deficiency in patient undergoing
      heart surgery will be determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin and is involved in several stages of
      intermediate metabolism which are important for producing energy. Severe thiamin deficiency
      has been associated with severe lactic acidosis and clinical symptoms of life threatening
      heart failure.

      To date, no study has evaluated thiamine levels in patients undergoing heart surgery and the
      prevalence of thiamine deficiency is not known. Furthermore it is unknown whether moderately
      reduced thiamin levels are associated with mild forms of perioperative cardiac failure
      necessitating prolonged inotropic support.

      In this prospective double blind randomised controlled trial of the effect of a parenteral
      infusion of thiamin before induction of anaesthesia we will investigate the effect on
      perioperative lactate increase as primary outcome and extent and duration of inotropic
      support after cardiac surgery. In addition the pharmacokinetics of a intravenous infusion of
      300 mg of thiamin on erythrocyte thiamin content and the amount of thiamine excreted in the
      24 hours via the urine will be determined.

      Baseline thiamin levels in erythrocytes before surgery, as well as nutrition history and body
      composition will be evaluated as effect modifier.
