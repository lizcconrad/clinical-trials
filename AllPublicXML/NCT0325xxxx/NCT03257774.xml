    <description>The trans epidermal water loss is measured on the peristomal skin using a probe. Thrans epidermal water loss is a measure for the skins barrier function. There is always a loss of water from the skin du to natural evaporation. However, when the skin barrier is damaged more water can evaporate. Trans epridermal water loss is used to assess the damage to the skin.</description>
