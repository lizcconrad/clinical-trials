      The trial is an open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized trial in 2 parallel groups,
      evaluating at W48, the non-inferiority of antiretroviral treatment taken 4 consecutive days a
      week versus continuous therapy, in HIV infected patients with controlled viral load for at
      least 12 months and stable antiretroviral treatment since 4 months.

      Open-label, multicenter, prospective, randomized trial in 2 parallel groups, evaluating at
      W48, the non-inferiority of antiretroviral treatment taken 4 consecutive days a week versus
      continuous therapy, in HIV infected patients with controlled viral load for at least 12
      months and stable antiretroviral treatment since 4 months. The non-inferiority margin (delta)
      is 5%. The randomization will be stratified according to the family of the third
      antiretroviral agent (II, PI, and NNRTI). A minimum of 200 patients will be included in the
      integrase inhibitor strata to provide a sufficient power to assess the efficacy of strategy
      in this population.

      At W48, all patients with virological success in the continuous therapy group will switch to
      the 4/7 days therapy.
