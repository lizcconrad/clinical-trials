  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We used a parallel experimental design. Following an initial screening and familiarization
      session of study tests and procedures, eligible postmenopausal women were randomly assigned
      to a stair climbing (SC) group or non-exercising control group. SC training session was
      progressive program, and was performed 4 days a week for 12 weeks. Measurements were
      collected at baseline and after 12 weeks during the same time of day (Â±1 hour) in the morning
      following an overnight fast and abstinence from caffeinated drinks, alcohol, and between 48
      and 72 hours after the last exercise session.

    <description>Stair climbing (SC) training was 12 weeks of progressive SC program. Each training session consisted of a general warm-up (5 min: slow and fast skipping, stretching) followed by the SC training and was supervised by experienced personnel. The program began with two bouts of stair climbing four days a week in weeks 1 and 2, increasing by one climb a day every three weeks. By the last three weeks (10-12) of the study, all subjects were completing 5 climbs four days a week. During each climb participants ascended 12 flights (192 steps) divided into 3 sets of 4 flights, with a 2 min rest period between each set. There was a 5 min rest period between climbs that allowed the participants to reach the ground floor using an elevator. Subjects in the non-exercising control group did not participate in a supervised exercise program for the duration of the study.</description>
