  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 3-way crossover phase I study being
      conducted on healthy volunteers to investigate the effect of single dose of AZD6094 (600 mg)
      on cardiac repolarization under well-controlled conditions in accordance with the
      International Council for Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines. An open-label Moxifloxacin (400
      mg), a fluoroquinolone broad spectrum antibiotic will be used as a appositive control for the
      time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave (QT) prolongation in
      accordance with ICH E14 guidelines, to establish assay sensitivity. The core study consists
      of screening period, 3 treatment period (AZD6094, placebo and moxifloxacin; with a minimum
      washout period of 14 days between each treatment period) and follow-up. The study drugs will
      be administered orally. The study is planned to determine effect of AZD6094 at therapeutic
      dose, safety and tolerability. This study provides adequate and well-controlled mechanisms to
      deal with potential bias, facilitate identification of effects related to investigational
      product (IMP) administration and tolerability issues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned to include approximately 45 healthy non-Japanese vasectomized male
      participants aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) or male participants over 40 (and up to 55)
      years old not intending to father children will be enrolled. The study consists of 5 visits
      comprised of 3 treatment periods with 6 treatment sequences and will have a minimum washout
      period of 14 days between each treatment period.

      Visit 1: Screening period (28 days) - Assessments done on Day -1 of treatment period 1.

      Visits 2 to 4: 3 Treatment periods - Participants will be resident form day before IMP
      (single oral dose of AZD6094 (600 mg) tablet/AZD6094 matching placebo/moxifloxacin (400 mg)
      capsule) dosing (Day -1) until at least 48 hours post-dose and will be discharged on Day 3.

      Visit 5: Follow-up - Participants will have clinical visit 14 days after discharge from the
      treatment period 3.

      Participants will be randomized to 6 treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB and CBA).
      In each sequence, participants will receive single oral dose of all 3 treatments (A - AZD6094
      600 mg (3X 200 mg tablet), B - Placebo tablet, C - Moxifloxacin 400 mg capsule) with a
      washout period (14 days) between each treatment period.

      The study duration will be approximately 84 days.

             research. If a subject declines to participate in the genetic component of the study,
             there will be no penalty or loss of benefit to the subject. The subject will not be
             excluded from other aspects of the study described in this Clinical Study Protocol
             (CSP).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Participants must not be randomized if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        fulfilled:

          1. Healthy participants of Japanese ethnicity and any healthy subject that has 1 parent
             or grandparent (maternal or paternal) that is Japanese.

          2. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          3. History or presence of gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             drugs.

          4. Any clinically important illness, medical/surgical procedure or trauma within 4 weeks
             of the first administration of IMP.

             results as judged by the Investigator.

          7. Any positive result on screening for serum hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C
             antibody and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          9. Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of the
             12-lead resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval
             changes. These include healthy participants with any of the following:

               -  Abnormal ST-T-wave morphology, particularly in the protocol defined primary lead
                  (V2) or left ventricular hypertrophy.

               -  PR interval shortening &lt; 120 ms (PR &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 120 ms is acceptable if there
                  is no evidence of ventricular pre-excitation).

               -  PR interval prolongation (&gt; 200 ms). Intermittent second (Type 1 second degree
                  block [Wenckebach Phenomenon] while asleep is not exclusive]) or third degree
                  atrioventricular (AV) block, or AV dissociation.

               -  Persistent or intermittent complete bundle branch block (BBB), incomplete bundle
                  branch block (IBBB), or intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD) with QRS &gt; 110
                  ms. Participants with QRS &gt; 110 ms but &lt; 115 ms are acceptable if there is no
                  evidence of e.g. ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation.

               -  Prolonged QTcF &gt; 450 ms or shortened QTcF &lt; 340 ms or family history of long QT
                  syndrome.

         10. A history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (TdP) (e.g., heart
             failure, hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome or sudden death at young
             age).

         11. Known or suspected history of drug abuse as judged by the Investigator.

         12. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products within the previous
             30 days.

         13. History of alcohol abuse or excessive intake of alcohol as judged by the Investigator.

         14. Excessive intake of caffeine-containing drinks or food (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate,)
             as judged by the Investigator.

         15. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks
             prior to the first administration of the IMP.

             admission on Day -1.

         17. Use of any prescribed or non-prescribed medication including antacids, analgesics
             (other than use of ibuprofen up to 72 hours before dosing day), herbal remedies,

             approved for marketing) within 3 months of the first administration of investigational
             product in this study. The period of exclusion begins 3 months after the final dose or
             one month after the last visit whichever is the longest. Note: participants consented
             and screened, but not randomized in this study or a previous Phase I study, are not
             excluded.

         23. Involvement of any Astra Zeneca or study site employee or their close relatives.

         24. Judgment by the Investigator that the subject should not participate in the study if
             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the screening period) minor medical
             complaints that may interfere with the interpretation of study data or are considered
