        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Primary lung adenocarcinoma patients with stage I and less than 4 centimeter of
             primary tumor, whose tumor should be solid-predominant or micropapillary (&gt;5%) by
             postsurgical pathological examination.

               -  Note: The specific methods and principles of pathology results follow the WHO's
                  pathology guidelines. The institution uses diagnostic pathology results from the
                  institution.

               -  Note: Adenocarcinoma, solid-predominant subtype; This variant shows a major
                  component of polygonal tumor cells forming sheets that lack recognizable patterns
                  of adenocarcinoma, i.e., acinar, papillary, micropapillary, or lepidic growth. If
                  the tumor is 100% solid, intracellular mucin should be present in &gt;5 tumor cells
                  in each of two high-power fields, and confirmed with histochemical stains for
                  mucin.

               -  Note: Adenocarcinoma, micropapillary subtype; This variant has, as a major
                  component, tumor cells growing in papillary tufts forming florets that lack
                  fibrovascular cores. These may appear detached from and/or connected to alveolar
                  walls. The tumor cells are usually small and cuboidal, with variable nuclear
                  atypia. Ring-like glandular structures may float within alveolar spaces. Vascular
                  and stromal invasion is common. Psammoma bodies may be seen.

          2. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.

          3. No evidence of disease (NED) after surgical resection on baseline tumor imaging (chest
             CT, covering up to both adrenals). The following conditions are satisfied with the
             condition of the complete ablation(R0):

               -  free resection margins proved microscopically

               -  no evidence of nodal metastasis by ststematic and radical nodal dissection

          4. Be 20 years of age on day of signing informed consent.

          5. Be willing to provide tissue from surgical specimen or excisional biopsy of a tumor
             lesion.

          6. Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale.

          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in Table 1, all screening labs should
             be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.
