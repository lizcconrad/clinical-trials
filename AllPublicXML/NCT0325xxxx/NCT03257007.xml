  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MEANING trial is a randomized controlled mixed methods pilot designed to compare a novel
      mindfulness meditation-based intervention (MEANING) to usual care for adults with
      advanced-stage solid malignancies and their family caregivers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mindfulness meditation practices have reduced emotional distress, avoidant coping, and
      improved spiritual well-being in adult cancer patients. These beneficial effects may occur
      through present-moment acceptance of unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and circumstances and
      adaptive coping through self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence. Most
      mindfulness trials in cancer have focused on early-stage survivors; however, preliminary
      evidence suggests that mindfulness may help reduce distress in patients with advanced cancer
      and their family caregivers (FCGs).

      Sixty patients with an advanced-stage solid malignancy and their FCGs (60 dyads) will be
      randomized in equal numbers to receive either the 6-week mindfulness intervention or usual
      care. Both groups will receive standard cancer care throughout the study period. Dyads
      randomized to the mindfulness arm will learn mindfulness meditation practices (e.g., body
      scan, sitting meditation) and mindful communication practices to enhance quality of life,
      support advance care planning engagement, and improve a variety of secondary outcomes.

      The study will use a mixed methods 2-arm randomized design to examine the effects of the
      mindfulness intervention compared to usual care and seek to explain trial results using
      insights gleaned from post-intervention qualitative interviews.

    <description>The Mindfulness intervention sessions are designed to cultivate present-moment awareness in everyday life to facilitate adaptive and non-reactive relating to thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Participants will be provided with 10-20 minute audio recordings of each of 5 mindfulness practices covered in class, recorded in the facilitator's voice. Participants will be encouraged to practice mindfulness at home 10-20 minutes per day, 6 days per week. Participants will be provided with weekly diaries on which to record type and amount of home practice of mindfulness skills.</description>
