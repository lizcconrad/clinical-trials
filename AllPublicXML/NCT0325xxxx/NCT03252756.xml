  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to begin rigorous study of the clinically relevant
      effects of non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) in patients with severe
      alcohol use disorder (AUD). This double-blind, randomized proof-of-concept study (n = 40) is
      designed to assess feasibility and contrast effects of extended (8 weeks) treatment with CBD
      to those of placebo in AUD patients. Participants with AUD will be randomized to receive
      either placebo or 600mg CBD/day (PO) for 4 weeks, immediately followed by 1200mg CBD/day (PO)
      for an additional 4 weeks (8 total weeks). These doses were chosen to reproduce serum CBD
      levels reported to reduce alcohol-seeking behavior in animal studies. Measures will include
      circulating levels of CBD, safety measures (THC serum levels, adverse events, cognitive and
      motoric function), and physiological and psychological domains relevant to AUD (including
      self-reported craving, depression, and anxiety, and responses to personalized scripts
      designed to elicit stress- and cue-induced craving and anxiety). Assessments will be
      conducted following 1 day, 1 week, and 4 weeks of treatment with each dose of CBD vs.
      placebo, and 1 and 4 weeks after the cessation of treatment. Drinking outcomes across 8 weeks
      of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up will also be assessed as an exploratory outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing recognition of the roles of the endocannabinoid system in neurobiological
      processes and behavioral domains relevant to addiction. The non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid
      cannabidiol (CBD) has attracted considerable attention due to its lack of abuse potential,
      its excellent safety profile, its unique and complex pharmacology, and evidence that it
      affects anxiety and stress response in animal models and humans. There is a growing body of
      preclinical data demonstrating that CBD produces marked and persisting decreases in alcohol
      self-administration and preference for alcohol, and alcohol-, cue- and stress-induced
      reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior, yet there are few studies of the effects of CBD in
      humans with addictive disorders, and none in alcohol dependent patients.
