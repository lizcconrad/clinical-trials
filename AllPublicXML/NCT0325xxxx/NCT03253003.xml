  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A methodical evaluation of new CE-labelled Phonak Hearing Systems is intended to be conducted
      on hard of participants with a hearing loss to grant quality control prior to product launch.
      The aim of the investigation series is to ensure a stable overall performance of the new
      hearing systems, a good sound quality during phone calls as well as maximum benefit for the
      participant with the devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phonak Hearing Systems pass through different development and study stages. At an early
      stage, feasibility studies are conducted to investigate new algorithms, features and
      functions in an isolated manner. If the benefit is proven, their performance is then
      investigated regarding interdependency between all available algorithms, features and
      functions running in parallel in a hearing aid (pivotal/pre-validation studies) and, as a
      result, they get optimized. Afterwards, and prior to product launch, the Phonak Hearing
      Systems undergo a final quality control in terms of clinical trials in the way as planned for
      this study (&quot;phase of final inspection&quot;). This will be a clinical evaluation which will be
      conducted mono centric at Sonova AG Headquarters based in Stäfa (Switzerland).

    <description>The data, serving as primary outcomes are collected in a series of home trials, taking place between the lab trial appointments. The stable performance in daily life (that means: no significant interruptions, distortions, artefacts, feedback, system noise or other malfunctions) will be assessed with the aid of quantitative questionnaires. Descriptive statistics will be executed. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

    <description>The data serving as primary outcomes are collected in a lab appointment. The participants will be asked to have a phone call with the investigator in the lab. The sound quality will be subjectively assessed by the participants and additionally by the investigators on given scales. Descriptive statistics will be executed. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>
