      This open trial aims to evaluate feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of an
      internet-delivered CBT-program for children and adolescents with functional gastrointestinal
      disorders when implemented in regular care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain predominant functional gastrointestinal disorders (P-FGIDs) are common in children and
      adolescents and associated with impaired quality of life. Our research group have previously
      in a series of efficacy-studies shown that internet-delivered exposure-based CBT leads to
      reduced symptoms and increased quality of life in children and adolescents with P-FGIDs.
      There is therefore reason to investigate how the treatment should be disseminated in regular
      care. This open trial aim to evaluate feasibility and preliminary treatment effects in
      regular care of the internet-delivered CBT-program for children and adolescents with P-FGIDs.

      Method: Open trial with a pretest-posttest-design and no control group. The
      internet-delivered CBT-program is 10 week long and include weekly therapist support,
      consisting of online messages and telephone calls. Assessment points are baseline, weekly
      during treatment, post-treatment and follow-up at 3 months and 6 months after treatment
      completion.

      Analysis: Effect sizes and within-group differences will be calculated in an intent-to-treat
      analysis using Cohens' d and Student's t-test.

    <description>The main target in treatment is exposure for abdominal symptoms by reducing avoidance and provoking symptoms. Participants are encouraged to gradually increase the difficulty by combining multiple challenges.
The parents are taught how to reduce the risk for reinforcement of children's symptom behavior, and to support their child to complete the treatment.
All treatment content is delivered over the internet, containing texts, videos, audio-files and examples. The modules are unlocked sequentially as participants worked their way through the treatment.
Therapist support consists primarily of encouragement of any progress made in the treatment and support to find individual exercises.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 8-17 at date of inclusion.

          -  Fulfilling Rome IV-criteria for irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia or
             functional abdominal pain with a written statement from patient's physician confirming
             a diagnosis.

          -  Stable psychotropic medication for at least 1 month.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  concurrent serious medical conditions.

          -  a psychiatric diagnosis, judged to be a more important treatment target than the
             abdominal pain.

          -  on-going structured psychological treatment.

          -  absence from school exceeding an average of 2 days a week the last month is a cause
             for exclusion since high school absence demands more intensive interventions than can
             be offered in ICBT.

          -  on-going abuse or severe parental psychiatric illness in the family.

          -  since treatment format assumes normal reading and writing skills, pronounced language
             skill deficits and learning difficulties lead to exclusion from the study.

          -  lack of regular internet-access.
