  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occipital neuralgia and subsequent headaches are associated with significant morbidity and
      impact quality of life and ability to work. Treatment is primarily medical and consists of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and medications to treat neuropathic pain. Many
      patient exhaust medical management options and suffer from persistent symptoms.

      Surgical management of chronic headaches including occipital neuralgia is emerging as a tool
      to relieve pain and the burden of morbidity associated with this condition. Dr. Bahman
      Guyuron has been reporting positive results in the literature for the past 20 years. In a
      systematic review of 14 papers it has been demonstrated that peripheral nerve surgery for
      migraines is effective and leads to an improvement of symptoms for 86% of patients.
      Complication rates were low across all studies included. Additionally, Dr Ivica Ducic has
      reported success specifically treating occipital neuralgia headaches, with significant
      improvements in subjective pain outcomes post-operatively. The mechanism behind this is
      thought to be similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, whereby peripheral nerve compression causes
      nerve irritation and pain. The ensuing inflammatory response to tissue injury can cause
      sensitization of nociceptors, resulting in hyperalgesia or allodynia. Surgical release of
      tight surrounding soft tissues results in nerve decompression and relief of symptoms.

      Although there are multiple case series and empiric evidence supporting the safety and
      efficacy of occipital migraine surgery, there are no randomized controlled studies comparing
      surgical intervention with continued medical management.

      As part of the present study, the investigators intend to randomize patients who have
      exhausted maximal medical treatment of post-traumatic occipital headaches to either a
      surgical management group or a continued medical management group. Surgical intervention will
      consist of neurolysis, or release, of the occipital nerves.

    <description>The Migraine Headache Index (MHI) is a commonly used metric in the plastic and reconstructive surgery literature to assess pre- and postoperative headache severity. The score is a product of headache duration (in days), frequency (in days per month), and severity (on a scale from 1 to 10). The score ranges from 0 to 300, with higher scores corresponding to worse migraine symptoms. Change in MHI score between pre-operative and 6-month postoperatively will be assessed.</description>

          -  History of head or neck trauma as an inciting event for occipital headaches

          -  Occipital neuralgia headache, as diagnosed by neurologist, and as defined by the
             International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3). 13.4 - occipital
             neuralgia:

        Description:

        Unilateral or bilateral paroxysmal, shooting or stabbing pain in the posterior part of the
        scalp, in the distribution of the greater, lesser or third occipital nerves, sometimes
        accompanied by diminished sensation or dysaesthesia in the affected area and commonly
        associated with tenderness over the involved nerve(s).

        Diagnostic criteria:

          -  Unilateral or bilateral pain fulfilling criteria B-E

          -  Pain is located in the distribution of the greater, lesser and/or third occipital
             nerves

          -  Pain has two of the following three characteristics:

               -  recurring in paroxysmal attacks lasting from a few seconds to minutes

               -  severe intensity

               -  shooting, stabbing or sharp in quality

          -  Pain is associated with both of the following:

               -  dysaesthesia and/or allodynia apparent during innocuous stimulation of the scalp
                  and/or hair

          -  either or both of the following:

               -  tenderness over the affected nerve branches

               -  trigger points at the emergence of the greater occipital nerve or in the area of
                  distribution of C2

          -  Pain is eased temporarily by local anaesthetic block of the affected nerve

          -  Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

        Comments:

        The pain of 13.4 Occipital neuralgia may reach the fronto-orbital area through
        trigeminocervical interneuronal connections in the trigeminal spinal nuclei.

        13.4 Occipital neuralgia must be distinguished from occipital referral of pain arising from
        the atlantoaxial or upper zygapophyseal joints or from tender trigger points in neck
        muscles or their insertions.

          -  Age: 18-65
