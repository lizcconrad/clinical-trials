    <textblock>
      Background Major depression is associated with morbidity and increased mortality. Along with
      the psychological strain depression represents a high socioeconomic burden costing Europe
      more than €113 billion/year. About one third of patients do not respond to appropriate
      therapy. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a form of transcranial magnetic stimulation is an
      emerging treatment for patients for whom pharmacological treatment is ineffective or not
      appropriate. Based on two different theories of prefrontal dysfunction two TBS-protocols
      should have the most antidepressant effects. However, no study so far has compared the two
      approaches or systematically investigated their differential effects on brain function and on
      a symptom level.

      Objectives of the study The aim of this study is to test two TBS protocols on symptom
      improvement and associated brain function in patients with treatment resistant depression
      (TRD): iTBS over bilateral DLPFC and iTBS over left and cTBS over right DLPFC. As stimulation
      over non-motor regions offers no direct readout, fMRI at baseline and after treatment will be
      harnessed to quantify an effect on brain activity and functional network metrics.

      Study population 80 patients with TRD will be enrolled with 40 patients receiving the one,
      and 40 patients receiving the other TBS protocol for a treatment period of three weeks.

      Study design The study is designed as a longitudinal, randomized and double-blind clinical
      trial. At baseline and after treatment, patients will undergo psychiatric testing using
      several symptom scales including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI-II), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C) and the
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Changes in HAMD-17 scores are defined as primary
      endpoint. Moreover MRI scans before and after treatment will include structural and
      functional MRI sequences as well as diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequence. Functional
      connectivity and BOLD responses will serve as primary imaging endpoints. A follow-up visit 2
      weeks and a final examination 4 weeks after treatment will elucidate durability of effects.

      Relevance and implications of the study By investigating which approach is superior for which
      symptoms our study will contribute to the development of personalized treatment, the
      reduction of personal suffering and the reduction of costs and occupational disability.
