      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dose of TBI-1401(HF10) treatment in
      combination with chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel or TS-1) in Japanese patients
      with stage III or IV unresectable pancreatic cancer.

      A Phase I, open-label, multi-center study to determine the recommended dose of TBI-1401(HF10)
      treatment in combination with chemotherapy (Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel or TS-1) in Japanese
      patients with stage III or IV unresectable pancreatic cancer. Patients with stage IV must
      failed a gemcitabine based first-line chemotherapy.

      Patients with stage III will receive the repeated intratumoral injection of TBI-1401(HF10) at
      recommended dose at 2-week intervals in combination with intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/m^2
      Gemcitabine and 125 mg/m^2 Nab-paclitaxel at weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week rest.

      Patients with stage IV will receive the repeated intratumoral injection of TBI-1401(HF10) at
      recommended dose at 2-week intervals in combination with oral of 40 - 60 mg TS-1 at twice
      daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks rest.

      Patients will receive the combination therapy of TBI-1401(HF10) + chemo for up to 1 year if
      eligible for treatment.
