  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with EFGR gene sensitive mutations diagnosed by pathology or
      cytology, having a course of chest radiotherapy treatment and molecular Target Therapy for
      the treatment of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer have a risk of the tumour in the lung recurring or progressing after treatment.

      In this study, the investigators aim to verify the following hypothesis:

        -  whether in combination with concurrent or concomitant EGFR-TKI regimen chemotherapy,
           Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy can reduce the risk of the tumour in the lung
           recurring or progressing similarily.

        -  Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy concomitant with EGFR-TKI has a better normal
           tissue dose/volume tolerance than concurrent regimen.

        -  the survival can be improved by using this new molecular Target-radiotherapy method.
