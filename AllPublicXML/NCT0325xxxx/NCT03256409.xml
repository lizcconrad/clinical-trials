    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the surface roughness (Ra) of the implant retained
      mandibular bar overdenture (BOD) and the implant retained mandibular ball joint overdenture
      (BJOD) in jaw and its relation with the adhesion of molds and yeasts and mesophyll aerobe, in
      time 30 to 180 days in mouth. Five systems titanium bar CARES® and synOcta® Straumann® Dental
      Implant System, Holding AG Inc., Basel, Switzerland (BOD); and five systems joint ball
      Klockner® Implant System; Soadco Inc., Escaldes-Engordany; Andorra (BJOD), were used in two
      parallel groups of five participants, in an essay to simple blind person. To 30 to 180 days
      they were withdrawn and they were evaluated the Ra (Mitutoyo Surfest SJ-301® Mitutoyo
      Corporation Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) and the adhesion of microorganisms (CFU/ml).

      The Ra:um (the 30th and 180th): BOD, 0.965 - 1.351; BJOD, 1.325 - 2.384. Adhesion: molds and
      yeasts, BOD, 2.6 x 102 and 4.6 x 103; BJOD, 3.0 x 102 and 5.3 x 104. Adhesion: mesophyll
      aerobe, BOD, 3.8 x 106 and 5.8 x 106; BJOD, 4.3 x 106 and 7.1 x 107. The BOD and BJOD,
      present different Ra (P &lt; 0.05) to 30 to 180 days. To 30 days (P = 0.489) differences do not
      exist as regards the adhesion of molds and yeasts and mesophyll aerobe between both
      overdentures. To 180 days (P = 0.723) differences exist as regards the adhesion of mold and
      yeast and mesophyll aerobe, being major in BJOD.

      Adherence mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe to BOD and BJOD, Surface roughness (Ra), and
      Statistical Analyses Microbial populations have been controlled in the saliva at initial time
      and adherence at 30 to 180 days after the overdentures in the mouth. The saliva sample was
      obtained from the patient in a sterile sputum collection bottle through a sterile solution.
      The overdenture samples were extracted and processed for analysis. Each sample was submerged
      in ¼ sterile Ringer and subjected to vigorous ultrasound shaking. From each of the microbial
      suspensions, successive dilutions were made to determine the total number of viable
      microorganisms present. Total count of mold and yeast and total count of mesophyll aerobe
      were performed.

      The surface roughness of BOD and BJOD was determined with the rugosimeter the Mitutoyo
      Surfest SJ-301® (Mitutoyo Corporation Inc., Kanagawa, Japan), through a displacement force of
      4mN and of the tray to 0.5 mm/s and back to 1 mm/s (Murtra and Arcís,1999). The roughness
      profile Ra was evaluated and determined in microns (ųm) through five readings for each of the
      samples in the study respectively.

      The results of BOD and BJOD were compared for the determination of Ra and the adherence of
      mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe. For this, we used the statistics Shapiro-Wilk, T and the
      Pearson Correlation Coefficient to determinate the relationship between the study variables.

    <intervention_model_description>The study presents the results of a sample of ten patients randomly assigned to receive implant-retained overdentures and divided into two parallel groups of five participants in a single-blind trial at a follow-up period of 30 - 180 days permanence in the mouth. Five overdentures were made for each group: Group 1: BOD: five systems titanium bar CARES® and synOcta® Straumann® Dental Implant System, Holding AG Inc., Basel, Switzerland (BOD). Group 2: BJOD: five systems ball joint Klockner® Implant System; Soadco Inc., Escaldes-Engordany, Andorra were used in two parallel groups of five participants, in an essay to simple blind person.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The working protocol for determining the BOD Ra and BJOD Ra and the adhesion of molds and yeasts and mesophyll aerobics was carried out entirely by an investigator and the following working methodology was considered: Information to the patient and obtainment of clinical data and patient informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned to group 1 and group 2. The saliva sample was obtained in each patient for the microbiological before the installation of the overdentures. BODs and BJODs were installed in each patient and according to each case. The BOD and BJOD were removed at 30 days for surface roughness evaluation (Ra:ųm) and the evaluation of the adhesion of mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe (CFU/ml). For the study at 180 days the BODs and the BJODs were installed in each patient. BODs and BJODs were removed after this time to proceed to the evaluation of surface roughness and adhesion of mold and yeast and mesophyll aerobe under the same parameters mentioned above.</masking_description>
