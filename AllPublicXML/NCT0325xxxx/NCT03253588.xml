  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, salpingectomy has been the standard procedure for managing ectopic pregnancy.
      We would like to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic tubal preservation surgery
      in treating ectopic pregnancies (salpingostomy or salpingotomy) while preserving the
      fertility outcome of the patients, as well as to identify the factors predicting the presence
      of persistent ectopic pregnancy after the surgery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All surgically-treated ectopic pregnancies in women aged 20 and above between 01 January 2009
      and 31 December 2016 were identified. Cases receiving laparoscopic salpingostomy or
      laparoscopic salpingotomy were extracted from the database, patient characteristics and
      surgical outcomes (changes of serumÎ²-hcg, presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy and
      subsequent management, subsequent pregnancy) were reviewed from their medical records.
      Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to predict the
      presence of persistent ectopic pregnancy after laparoscopic tubal preservation surgery.

    <description>A 3-port technique (2 x 5-mm and 1 x 10-mm trocars) was implemented. A diluted solution of vasopressin (20IU in 100 mL saline solution) was initially injected into the mesosalpinx of the affected tube, followed by a linear incision which allowed the removal of the gestational tissue. In case of a ruptured tubal pregnancy, the ectopic mass was evacuated directly from the ruptured site using a combination of forceps and suction device. The tubal lumen was either closed with a single-layer of continuous absorbable suture (salpingotomy) or left to heal by secondary intention (salpingostomy).</description>
