      RATIONALE The translation into clinical practice of Primary Care (PHC) of effective and
      sustainable interventions to prevent of type-2 diabetes (T2D) remains an unresolved
      challenge. Leadership, active involvement of professionals, facilitation and adaptation to
      the local context and their determinants are known to be key components in the success of
      implementation strategies that seek to optimize clinical practice. However, one of the areas
      in which there is still no evidence is related to the effectiveness of different strategies
      to engage healthcare professionals in such innovation processes. Especially in real-world
      Primary Care clinical contexts characterized by work overload and limited time, with marked
      differentiation of professional status, both at the level of identity and competency.

      OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of PHC providers engagement procedure in the creation and
      execution of a facilitated collaborative modelling process, in the adoption, reach,
      implementation and effectiveness of the recommended clinical practice for the prevention of
      type-2 Diabetes

      METHODOLOGY

      Randomized cluster hybrid trial in which 9 PHC centres from Osakidetza will be allocated to
      two different strategies to engage professionals and create an inter-professional
      collaborative practice directed by a local leader and an external facilitator, to optimize
      the integration of a T2D primary prevention program:

        -  A strategy focused on the sequential activation: started in nursing, which finally
           manages to involve the whole center

        -  A global strategy with the participation of all professionals from the beginning

      All centres and PHC professionals will receive training on current guidelines and scientific
      evidence in primary prevention of T2D and effective interventions to promote healthy
      lifestyles. Headed by a local leader and an external facilitator, centres will conduct a
      collaborative structured process to model and adapt the intervention and its implementation
      to the specific context of professionals and centres, and the determinants of T2D prevention
      practice. One of the groups will perform this strategy globally, promoting the cooperation of
      all health professionals from the beginning. The other will perform it sequentially, centred
      first in nursing, who will lately seek the pragmatic cooperation of physicians and other
      professionals.

      All patients without diabetes aged ≥30 years old who attend at least once in collaborating
      centres at high risk of developing T2DM (FINDRISC&gt; = 14 points and / or intermediate
      hyperglycaemia) will be eligible for program inclusion. The main outcome measures focus on
      observed changes in T2DM prevention clinical practice at centre level after 12 and 24 months,
      as a result of the implementation of one or another engagement strategy. Secondary outcomes
      will compare their clinical effectiveness in changing exposed eligible patients' main
      cardio-metabolic risk factors (Weight, BMI, Cholesterol, Glucose, Triglycerides) and
      lifestyles behaviours (physical activity and diet) after 12 months.

    <intervention_model_description>The implementation strategy to facilitate the adoption of the recommended clinical intervention in primary prevention of T2DM will be common to both comparison groups. In order to differentiate and isolate the effect of the procedure of creation of the Multi-professional Community of Practice, the centers have been randomly assigned to two comparison groups: 5 centers assigned to the sequential procedure and the other 4 centers to the group procedure.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>3 actions for the prevention of DM2 in the clinical setting are recommended:
A screening strategy for people with impaired glucose regulation or high risk of developing DM2, with the following recommendations: screening for DM2 within the strategy of opportunistic screening for CV risk factors in population ≥45 years Or ≥30 years in the presence of a previous risk factor (eg, hypertension); Screening for DM2 based on the presence of a BMI ≥25 in the population aged 40-70 years; Or, risk screening for DM2-FINDRISC in a population of 45-70 years.
With those identified at high risk, perform a structured program of intensive intervention focused on the prescription of personalized plans on lifestyle modification (low calorie and low fat diet, and at least 150 minutes of physical exercise per week).
A follow-up intervention component to maintain the motivation of those interviewed, with more frequent contacts initially, with at least annual review visits.</description>
