  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The role of fishery diet and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the development of type 2
      diabetes (T2D) is heavily debated but evidence from large populations in China is scant. We
      aim to use data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) to assess the long-term
      association between fish, PUFA intake and T2D risk.

      The role of fishery diet and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the development of T2D is
      heavily debated but evidence from large populations in China is still lacking. We aim to
      utilize data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS, 1997-2011). We will calculate
      cumulative means of fish and PUFA intake based on 3-day food records in each wave.
      Sex-specific Cox regression models will be used to estimate relative risk of T2D. Results
      from this work will provide epidemiological evidence for improving recommendations on fish
      and PUFA intake for Chinese in dietary guidelines.

        CHNS is an ongoing, large-scale, household-based cohort starting in 1989. The survey used a
        multi-stage, random cluster process to draw a sample of 9 provinces and municipal cities,
        which take up about half of Chinese population.
