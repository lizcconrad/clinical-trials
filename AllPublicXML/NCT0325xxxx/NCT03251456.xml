  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visual development disorders are major public health problems among children especially in
      China. How to find an effective and economic way to manage the larger number of children in
      China remains exploring. The national basic public health services of China offer visual
      acuity screening for preschool children for free every year. The aim of this study is to
      demonstrate the feasibility, cost-effective and the influence factors of compliance of
      tertiary care for visual developmental disorders in pre-school children after screening, and
      whether this disease management model is more effective and superior than the current medical
      care in china.

      Visual development disorders including amblyopia , strabismus ,refractive error are an
      important public health problem among children, and the visual impairment caused by visual
      development disorders is lifelong and can be profound. Timely discovering and treatment of
      visual development disorders are significant for the recovering of visual function in
      children. The national basic public health services of China offer the basic visual acuity
      screening every year for free. In this study, the investigators try to explore the
      cost-effective and compliance of the national basic public health services based tertiary
      care model for the management of visual development disorders among preschool children. This
      Tertiary care based on disease management model among preschool children was conducted at
      Yudu county, Jiangxi province, in China. Preschool vision screening relied on the national
      basic public health services of China (refractive errors examined by the Retinomax
      autorefractor). Children who failed the screening were randomized into two group, one group:
      their parents will be informed and transferred to an ophthalmologist and optometrist at
      Ophthalmic Referral Center, receiving basic eye examination and therapy (visual corrected by
      glasses and periodic review); The control group: their parents will be informed and suggest
      them to take their children to the hospital for further examination by themselves. The
      cost-effectiveness of this disease management model and the compliance of the children and
      their parents will be evaluated.
