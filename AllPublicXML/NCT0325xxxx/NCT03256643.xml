    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether exercise or exercise with enrichment is
      beneficial in individuals who previously had a head injury. The enrichment will consist of a
      cultural educational program that will include ethnic food, music, slides and a talk. A
      series of tests that measure mental function and balance will be done before and after the
      exercise or the exercise/enrichment program will be done to measure efficacy.

    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in long-lasting physical and cognitive deficits. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether exercise or exercise with enrichment is
      beneficial in individuals who previously had a head injury. The environmental enrichment will
      consist of a cultural educational program that will include ethnic food, music, slides and a
      talk on 8 different cultures. Individuals will be evaluated using neuropsychological and
      physical tests before and after the intervention. Testing will consist of Repeatable Battery
      for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Trailmaking Test (TMT), Immediate
      Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT), Quality of Life in Brain Injury
      Questionnaire (QOLIBRI), 10 meter walk, and the NIH Toolbox Standing Balance Test. Initial
      testing will include the Disability Rating Scale to help balance groups (after random
      assignment) in terms of baseline ability.

      In rodents, exercise or an enriched environment after TBI improve cognitive function and
      motor function and the combination results in even greater improvement. The mechanism of
      cognitive improvement from exercise or environmental enrichment relates to increases in brain
      derived neurotrophic factor and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. An additional possible
      mechanism of the positive effects of exercise or enrichment is a reduction in inflammation.
      Our hypothesis is that exercise or exercise with enrichment will result in better motor
      performance and improved cognitive ability.
