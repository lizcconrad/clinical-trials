  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 works in treating patients with
      solid tumors with CCNE1 amplification that have spread to other places in the body and do not
      respond to treatment. WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients with the objective response rate (ORR) to WEE1
      inhibitor AZD1775 (AZD1775) in patients with advanced refractory cancers with CCNE1
      amplification.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients alive and progression free at 6 months of treatment
      with AZD1775 in patients with advanced refractory cancers with CCNE1 amplification.

      II. To evaluate proportion of patients with extended time to progression (time to progression
      on AZD1775/ time to progression on last line of therapy &gt;= 1.3).

      III. To evaluate time until death or disease progression. IV. To identify potential
      predictive biomarkers beyond the genomic alteration by which treatment is assigned or
      resistance mechanisms using additional genomic, ribonucleic acid (RNA), protein and
      imaging-based assessment platforms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and 8-12.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
