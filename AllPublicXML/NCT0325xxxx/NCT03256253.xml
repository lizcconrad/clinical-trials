      The proposed protocol is an open label outpatient pilot trial of the safety and efficacy of
      pregabalin (Lyrica) in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Pregabalin is commonly used for
      the treatment of pain issues such as fibromyalgia (chronic pain in your body), diabetic nerve
      pain, spinal cord injury nerve, and pain after shingles. We plan to enroll 20 participants in
      an 8-week trial.The ideal dosing, tolerability, and safety of pregabalin will be tested in
      outpatients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). The primary objective of the study is to
      determine the efficacy of pregabalin in promoting alcohol abstinence among individuals with
      an alcohol use disorder.
