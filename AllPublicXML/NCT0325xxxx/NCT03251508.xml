    <textblock>
      Salvage Peanut Oral Immunotherapy Study is a single-arm, open label trial of peanut flour
      with 6 month active treatment and 6 month follow-up on peanut food equivalent.

      The first stage with 6 months treatment will involve approximately 3 months of build up phase
      (desensitization) to a certain maintenance dose ( 300 mg peanut protein) then 3 months of
      maintenance phase where subjects take daily 300 mg of peanut protein. After that the subjects
      will start a food equivalent that contains 300 mg of peanut protein only.

      During both phases subjects will be monitored for adverse events including gastrointestinal
      side effects. They will also be monitored for any anaphylaxis or Epipen use. Data regarding
      compliance with the drug will be collected as well.

    <measure>Incidence rate of emergency epinephrine use during the 2‑stage study sequence (safety)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>As epinephrine is typically used only for more severe or potentially life-threatening allergic reactions, its use can be another measure of the safety of a protocol. This outcome involves an unblinded evaluation of the specific incidence of epinephrine use for the treatment of allergic reactions during a 2-stage peanut OIT and peanut food equivalent protocol.</description>

    <measure>Incidence rate of withdrawals during the 2-stage study sequence due to gastrointestinal adverse events (safety)</measure>

    <description>As GI side effects are the most commonly reported side effect of published oral peanut treatment protocols and have been reported to lead to treatment failure and withdrawal, this outcome involves an evaluation of the incidence of study withdrawals specifically due to GI adverse events during a 2-stage peanut OIT and peanut food equivalent protocol.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have completed an immunotherapy trial for peanut allergy within the last

          -  Current participation in an interventional study for peanut allergy

          -  History of a severe anaphylactic reaction to peanut, defined as hypoxia, hypotension,
             or neurologic compromise (cyanosis or SpO2 ≤ 92% at any stage, hypotension, confusion,
             collapse, loss of consciousness, or incontinence)

          -  Eosinophilic or other inflammatory (e.g. celiac) gastrointestinal disease

          -  Severe asthma (2007 NHLBI Criteria Steps 5 or 6 , Appendix 2)

          -  Use of B blockers (oral), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
             angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) or calcium channel blockers

          -  Significant medical condition (e.g., liver, kidney, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
             hematologic, or pulmonary disease) which would put the subject at risk for induction
             of severe food reactions.
