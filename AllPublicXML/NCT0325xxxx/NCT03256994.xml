      Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), also known as radioembolisation, is a minimal
      invasive, endovascular treatment for primary and secondary liver tumours. In France,
      SIR-Spheres are listed as reimbursable by the national health authorities (Haute Autorité de
      Santé [HAS]). In order to evaluate the reimbursement after five years, all patients treated
      with SIR-Spheres will be entered into a registry that collects data on the real-life clinical
      application of SIRT and reports to the national authorities.

    <textblock>
      Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also called radioembolisation (RE), with
      SIR-Spheres microspheres is an endovascular procedure, included within the interventional
      oncologic technologies to treat primary and secondary liver tumours. Using a microcatheter, a
      precise dose of resin microspheres is released in the hepatic artery, where they are carried
      into the arterioles and selectively lodge in the tumour microvasculature. The microspheres
      are loaded with the radioactive yttrium-90, a high-energy beta-emitting isotope with a
      half-life of 64.1 hours. Following administration, 94% of the radiation is delivered in 11
      days.

      In France, SIR-Spheres are listed as reimbursable by the national health authorities (Haute
      Autorité de Santé [HAS]). In order to evaluate the reimbursement after five years, all
      patients treated with SIR-Spheres will be entered into a registry that collects data on the
      real-life clinical application of SIRT and reports to the national authorities.

      The goal of the research project is to gain a better understanding of the real-life clinical
      application of radioembolisation with SIR-Spheres and the impact of the treatment in clinical
      practice. Secondary objectives will include, safety in terms of adverse events; effectiveness
      based on overall survival, progression free survival (PFS), hepatic free survival (liver
      specific PFS); SIRT in relation to surgery and ablation (before and after SIRT treatment) and
      quality of life.

      To better understand the palliative aspect of the treatment, acquisition of the change in
      quality of life is included by means of EORTC's validated quality of life questionnaire QLQ
      C30 with accompanying HCC module to measure quality of life in patients with hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

      Besides data collection on the initial treatment, it will be advised to collect follow-up
      data and quality of life data every three months for a minimum of 24 months after treatment.

      CIRT-FR is a post-market, prospective, non-randomized, observational study. Patients are only
      asked to be enrolled when they are treated with SIR-Spheres microspheres as part of their
      treatment determined by the treating clinician. In no way will participation of the patient
      in the registry impact their treatment plan, or influence the quality of the treatment.

    <description>In order to measure the palliative aspect of RE with SIR-Spheres microspheres, CIRT will incorporate a quality-of-life questionnaire. CIRT will be using EORTC's QLQ-C30 with HCC Module to measure changes in the quality of life of the patient. The quality-of-life questionnaire will be offered to the patient before the treatment, shortly after the treatment (as soon as possible) and at every follow-up. Filling out the quality-of-life questionnaire is entirely voluntary for the patient</description>

        In a general manner and according to the Intent-To-Treat principle, no subject will be
        excluded from the analysis. The primary and secondary endpoint analysis will include all
        enrolled subjects in CIRT-FR.

        However, patients who are considered for SIR-Spheres treatment but for whom it was decided
        that they would not be treated will not be included in the analysis.
