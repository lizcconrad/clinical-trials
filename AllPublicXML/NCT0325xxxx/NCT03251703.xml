    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is the second most common musculoskeletal disease in adults, and it often
      becomes chronic due to treatment difficulties.

      Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) therapy has become increasingly popular in the treatment of
      chronic shoulder pain due to its long duration of action and non-destructive method.

      These patients lacked pain control despite systemic analgesics and conservative therapy and
      applied to our pain polyclinics for shoulder pain lasting at least 3 months.

      The ultrasound-guided SSPRF was performed in those patients with a reduction of 50% or more
      VAS score and those that reported healing in the AROM in the diagnostic SNB.

      The resting, motion and sleeping shoulder pain assessments of the patients were done using a
      visual analog scale (VAS). The shoulder joint function was assessed using the Shoulder Pain
      and Disability Index (SPADI) questionnaire and the active range of motion (AROM) of the joint
      was measured using a goniometer In this study, investigators aimed to reveal the effects of
      ultrasound-guided suprascapular PRF (SSPRF) therapy applied to patients with chronic shoulder
      pain on both shoulder pain and function.

    <description>The ultrasound-Guided Suprascapular Pulsed Radiofrequency was administered under operating room conditions while the patient was monitored in a sitting position.An ultrasound-guided 22 G 5-mm active-tip 100-mm radiofrequency needle (SC-K; Top Neuropole, Tokyo, Japan) was pushed forward towards the suprascapular notch until it passed the transverse scapular ligament using an in-plane approach.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients 18 years of age or older who were diagnosed with at least one of the following:
        adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder (M75.0), rotator cuff syndrome (M75.1), and impingement
        syndrome of shoulder (M75.4) according to the ICD-10 classifications. These patients lacked
        pain control despite systemic analgesics and conservative therapy (like physiotherapy) and
        applied to our pain polyclinics for shoulder pain lasting at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with other diseases causing chronic pain, those with neuropathic pain, those who
        had undergone surgery on the same shoulder, those with an allergy history from local
        anesthesia, those with abnormal coagulation tests, and those with cardiac pacemakers were
        excluded from this study.
