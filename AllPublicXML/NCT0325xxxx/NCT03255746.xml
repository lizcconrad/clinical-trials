  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases
      worldwide. The escalating prevalence of inadequate sleep now parallels that of hypertension.
      Observational and experimental evidence favoring a causal relation between insufficient sleep
      and hypertension are particularly compelling - sleeping 6 hours or less per night is
      associated with a 20-32% higher probability of incident hypertension. Since sleep curtailment
      is largely voluntary, sleep deficiency may be corrected and the detrimental health
      consequences potentially reversed.

      In this study the investigators aim to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of sleep
      enhancement/extension vs health education in prehypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive
      subjects who report habitual short sleep (=6.5 hours/night).

    <description>This regimen combines education and behavioral skills to enable prolonging sleep in chronically sleep deprived subjects so as to better meet participant's sleep needs. This intervention emphasizes plain language communication of cognitive behavioral therapy strategies for initiating and maintaining health behavior change, primarily through using brief action plans (time-limited, personally relevant, behavioral goal setting with confidence), and collaborative problem-solving. Coaching will be provided to modify daily routines and adhere to sleep hygiene practices to allow for extended time in bed.</description>
