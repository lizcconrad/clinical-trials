  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to pilot test a non-pharmacological (behavioral) treatment program targeting
      improved cognition through improving 24-h sleep-wake cycle in people with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease. A treatment program incorporating bright light
      therapy and a modified cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia will be developed to address
      24-hour patterns of sleep. We will then pilot test its feasibility and explore its
      preliminary effects on improving sleep/napping and cognition in patients with MCI or mild
      Alzheimer's disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â‰¥65 years old

          -  Memory complaints verified by an informant

          -  Clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's Disease

          -  General cognitive performance sufficiently persevered such that a diagnosis of
             Alzheimer's disease cannot be made by the site physician

          -  No evidence (CT or MRI scans within 12 months prior to screening) of infection,
             infarction, or other focal lesions and no clinical symptoms suggestive of intervening
             neurological disease

          -  Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing

          -  Meets ICSD-2 criteria for insomnia or circadian rhythm disorders, or shows actigraphy
             evidence of sleep disturbances and excessive napping

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any major neurologic disease other than suspected incipient Alzheimer's disease, such
             as Parkinson's disease, multi-infarct dementia, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder,
             Huntington's disease, brain tumor or history of significant head trauma

          -  Any comorbid psychiatric conditions or severe personality disorder within the past 2
             years (by DSM-IV), such as major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and other
             psychotic features

          -  Any uncontrolled medical conditions or systemic illness that might lead to difficulty
             complying with the study protocol

          -  History of alcohol or substance abuse within the past 2 years

          -  Any inadequately treated primary or secondary sleep disorder (due to medical
             conditions) that might confound the association
