  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-disciplinary intervention will reduce inappropriate preoperative testing for cataract
      surgery. Despite multiple rigorous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses showing
      that pre-operative testing for cataract surgery does not improve outcomes, pre-operative
      testing has not declined. A quality improvement initiative, which includes gaining senior
      leadership support, changing the culture of care, and elimination of pre-operative
      consultation visits for cataract surgery, to reduce inappropriate pre-operative testing.
      Quasi-experimental difference-in-difference analysis comparing the intervention arm (LAC+USC
      Medical Center) with the control arm (Harbor-UCLA Medical Center), 6 months prior and 6
      months after the intervention. Generalized estimating equation models will adjust for age,
      gender, race/ethnicity, comorbidities and cluster by site.

    <textblock>
      Pre-operative testing for cataract surgery provides no discernible benefit to patients,
      increases risk of harm, and substantially raises healthcare costs—representing the
      quintessential example of low value care. Despite multiple randomized controlled trials
      demonstrating no benefit, physicians continue to routinely order pre-operative testing for
      most patients undergoing cataract surgery.

      Supported by the American Board of Internal Medicine's Choosing Wisely™ campaign to reduce
      low value care, a quality improvement (QI) initiative to reduce pre-operative visits and
      testing for cataract surgery at LAC+USC Medical Center, a safety-net health system serving
      Los Angeles County's under-resourced populations and control site, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center
      will be evaluated.

      Using Institute for Healthcare Improvement PDSA (plan, do, study, act) cycle techniques, the
      QI team implemented the following steps (1) review randomly sampled charts on cataract
      surgery patients, (2) show local data on over-testing to hospital leadership, (3) obtain
      buy-in from the chairs of anesthesia and ophthalmology, (4) recruit an ophthalmology resident
      champion, and (5) empower nurses to stop scheduling pre-operative visits for cataract
      surgery. On October 13th, 2015, at LAC+USC Medical Center but not Harbor-UCLA, the resident
      champion and department chairs emailed &quot;new&quot; clinical guidelines for pre-operative testing to
      faculty, trainees, and staff, and specifically promoted avoidance of pre-operative testing
      for cataract surgery, except for guideline-concordant point-of-care glucose testing for
      patients with diabetes and potassium testing for patients with chronic kidney disease.

      Evaluation of this quality improvement initiative will consists of a quasi-experimental
      pre-post time series analysis. Primary outcomes include pre-operative medical visits,
      laboratory testing, chest X-rays and electrocardiograms within 80 days of surgery (chart
      review revealed the maximum duration of pre-operative testing was 80 days) for patients
      undergoing cataract surgery before and after the intervention.

      Multivariable generalized linear models that account for clustering by clinician and adjust
      for patient and provider characteristics and time (in months) will be used.
