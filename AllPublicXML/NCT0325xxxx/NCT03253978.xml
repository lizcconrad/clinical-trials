  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), a new technique to
      deliver radiotherapy to men with prostate cancer. In addition to this, it will look at the
      effect of SABR on levels of markers of radiation exposure and bowel damage, along with other
      potential markers of outcome and side effects. Quality of life and any side effects that
      develop during and after treatment will also be assessed.

      The study will examine stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), a new technique to
      deliver radiotherapy to men with prostate cancer. In addition to this, it will look at the
      effect of SABR on levels of markers of radiation exposure and bowel damage, along with other
      potential markers of outcome and side effects. Quality of life and any side effects that
      develop during and after treatment will also be assessed.

      Participants will be treated with five treatments (instead of the standard 37). This is more
      convenient for them and also allows the treatment of many more people in the same time frame,
      which should improve the timely delivery of radiotherapy for all patients.

      Thirty men with high-risk prostate cancer will be enrolled into the study. They will all be
      treated with hormone therapy and radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles. In
      addition, half of the men will receive an additional dose of radiation to their pelvis. Gold
      markers will be placed in the prostate before radiotherapy to allow precise targeting of the
      prostate during treatment. CT scans are taken before and after each treatment to ensure the
      accuracy of its delivery.

      Blood urine and prostate tissue samples will be taken before, during and after radiotherapy.
      Side effects and quality of life will also by assessed during this time.

      Ultimately, this may allow us to predict which men are at increased risk of side effects from
      radiotherapy and allow closer monitoring, earlier intervention and perhaps alternative
      treatments in some cases. This should improve the control of prostate cancer and reduce the
      risk of serious treatment-related side effects
