  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. men. Radiation is an
      effective treatment for most patients with localized prostate cancer, but sometimes the tumor
      returns. Researchers want to see if a highly focused type of radiation can help. It is given
      in only 5 treatments. It is called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

      Objective:

      To study the maximum tolerated dose and side effects of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      in people with a local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiation.

      Eligibility:

      Men at least 18 years old who have recurrent prostate cancer after radiation therapy and no
      evidence of distant metastatic disease

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with blood tests, physical exam, and medical history. They may
      also have:

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate..

      PET/CT scan. Participants will get an injection of 18F-DCFPyL for the PET scan. They will lie
      very still on their back on the scanner table.

      Small samples of prostate tumor tissue will be taken by a needle through the skin or rectum
      to see if the cancer is in the prostate. Small metal seeds will be placed into the prostate
      at the same time to help guide the radiation.

      About 2 weeks later, participants will have a radiation treatment planning CT scan.

      Participants will answer questions about their urine function, bowel function, erectile
      function, and mood.

      Participants will receive SBRT. They will have 5 radiation treatments over 2 weeks.

      Participants will have follow-up visits. They will have a physical exam, blood tests, and
      questionnaires.

      Six months after ending SBRT, the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT will be repeated....

      Background:

      Prostate cancer that recurs after prior radiation treatment can be challenging to cure due to
      the side effects of available treatments such as surgery and cryoablation. Re-irradiation
      with brachytherapy or stereotactic approaches has shown excellent rates of prostate cancer
      disease control with tolerable side effects. Using image guidance to allow highly conformal
      focal reirradiation may potentially increase the efficacy of re-irradiation.

      Objectives:

      -Define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of image guided, focally dose escalated prostate
      radiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with a local recurrence
      of prostate cancer after prior radiotherapy.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histological confirmation of recurrent prostate cancer after prior irradiation (external
           beam or brachytherapy)

        -  No evidence of distant metastases of prostate cancer

        -  No prior prostatectomy

        -  Subject is greater than or equal to18 years old

        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to
           60%).

      Design:

      This is a Phase I trial of focal dose escalation with SBRT using image and pathologic
      guidance. Areas in the prostate shown to have tumor on biopsy or with advanced imaging
      studies will be treated with highly conformal SBRT over a period of two to three weeks.
      Treatment will be guided and gated by fiducials implanted in the prostate. Patients will be
      treated to escalating doses based on tolerability of the treatment. Quality of life and
      functional outcomes such as urine, bowel, and erectile function will be assessed with
      questionnaires. Up to 52 patients will be enrolled.
