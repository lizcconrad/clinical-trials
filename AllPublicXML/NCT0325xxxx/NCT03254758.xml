  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human Phase1/2 study of ADR-001, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
      (AD-MSCs). The safety and preliminary efficacy are evaluated in Phase 1 in patients with
      liver cirrhosis caused by Hepatitis C or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis and a recommended Phase
      2 dose is determined by the evaluation. The exploratory efficacy and safety are investigated
      against the same target population in Phase 2.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh score; Grade B) caused by Hepatitis C
      or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis are enrolled to the study. In Phase 1, one of 3 doses of
      AD-MSCs is administered by 1 hour single intravenous infusion. Patients are hospitalized for
      1 week and a recommended dose for Phase 2 is determined by the evaluation of the safety and
      efficacy. In Phase 2, patients with the same disease criteria are enrolled and dosed to
      investigate the exploratory efficacy and safety.

      The safety and efficacy are evaluated until 24 weeks after dosing both in Phase 1 and Phase
      2.
