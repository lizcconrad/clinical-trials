  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a high-intensity aerobic training and
      resistance training on fatigue in prostate, head and neck and rectum cancer patients
      undergoing radiotherapy.

      A three-arm randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Patients will be randomised into
      either a high-intensity aerobic training group or a resistance training group or a control
      group. Participants in the training groups will exercised for five to eight weeks. Exercise
      sessions will be take place 3 days per week under the supervision of an experienced
      therapist. Subjects will be assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The primary outcome
      will be fatigue measured using the FACIT-fatigue questionnaire. The secondary outcomes will
      be: functional capacity, quality of life, executive functions, sleep disturbances, somnolence
      syndrome, insomnia, depression symptoms.
