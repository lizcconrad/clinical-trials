  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Occipito-Cervical (OC) junction is the most cephalad portion of the spinal axis, with
      anatomical osseous complex that allows significant mobility while maintaining biomechanical
      stability. OC instability is a rare disorder with potentially life-threatening consequences.
      Instability may manifest as disabling pain, cranial nerve dysfunction, paralysis, or even
      sudden death. The most common acute presentation is secondary to major trauma. Other
      pathologic processes that may lead to chronic instability include rheumatoid arthritis,
      infections, tumors, and even congenital malformations; OC fusion in aforementioned cases each
      according is then indicated.

      Stabilization of the OC junction remains a challenge, owing to the regional anatomy and poor
      occipital bone purchase. OC stabilization techniques have undergone continuous refinement.
      Early techniques involving simple posterior only bone grafts demonstrated a high rate of
      failure and have largely been replaced by rigid posterior fixation systems using rods/screws
      or plates, providing superior biomechanical stability and higher rates of fusion. One of the
      very modern modalities of fixation methods is the Occipital Condyle Screw (OCS) as a sole
      cranial anchor; believing that decreasing the length of lever arm of the construct,
      increasing the length of the screw purchase, and decreasing stresses addressed on the rod
      with no need to excessively bend it for the occipital slope may enhance the construct
      rigidity, and leaving a greater clear metal-free area of the occiput for graft contact may
      have a real potential benefits in fusion rates.

      Clinical Evaluation: of patients with 1- Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 2- Neck Disability
      Index (NDI), 3- Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association Cervical Myelopathy Score
      (mJOA.CMS), 4- American Spinal Injury Association Score (ASIAs). Immediate preoperative
      functional scoring, and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperative.

      Surgical Technique: The patient is handled in prone position after successful general
      anaesthesia with supported head to ensure that the Occipito-Cervical junction maintains in
      neutral position. The Occipito-Cervical junction is then exposed through a traditional
      midline longitudinal posterior skin incision extends from the external occipital protuberance
      to the C3-C4 level. The nuchal ligament is divided in the midline, and the occipital and
      cervical musculature is dissected subperiosteally. The suboccipital and cervical paraspinous
      muscles are retracted laterally to expose the underlying bony architecture. The posterior
      arch of C1 is exposed and the dissection is continued laterally in a subperiosteal manner to
      identify the horizontal segment of the vertebral arteries (VAs) which is enveloped in a dense
      venous plexus. The atlanto-occipital joint capsule is to be approx. 3 mm. Cranial to the
      superior margin of tht VA. Attention is then focused on the foramen magnum. Using curettes,
      the atlanto-occipital membrane is gently dissected from the foramen magnum laterally until
      the medial aspect of the occipital condyle is reached. At this point, the dissection
      continues laterally, maintaining bone contact to prevent injury to the horizontal segment of
      the VA along the condylar fossa, until the posterior condylar foramen and emissary vein are
      identified. The condylar foramen and vein represent the lateral extent of the dissection. At
      this stage, the operative field is prepared for instrumentation. Inserting the cervical
      screws first provides useful information about the axial location of the occipital condyles.
      The condylar entry point (CEP) is defined using a combination of radiographic and anatomic
      landmarks. The CEP is located (4 to 5 mm) lateral to the posteromedial edge of the condyle,
      and (2 mm) above the atlanto-occipital joint line. Pilot hole is then made at the entry point
      using an awl with slight cranial angulation to avoid injury to the horizontal segment of the
      VA. The pilot hole is then drilled under image-guidance in a convergent trajectory with (12
      to 22 degrees) of medial angulation and (5 degrees) cranial angulation in the sagittal plane
      with the tip of the drill directed toward the basion, advancing slowly until the anterior
      cortical edge of the condyle is breached. The hole is tapped, and a (3.5 mm) polyaxial screw
      of an appropriate length (30 to 34 mm) is inserted bicortically into the occipital condyle.
      Approximately (12 mm) portion of the screw remains superficial to the posterior cortex of the
      condyle, allowing the polyaxial portion of the screw to lie above the posterior arch of C1,
      minimizing any chance of irritation of the VA by the rods.

      Radiological Evaluation: 1- Preoperative: Plain X-ray (PXR) Antero-posterior (AP) and Lateral
      (Lat.) views to study the upper cervical instability indices and measurements, Multi-Slice
      Computed Tomography (MSCT) to study the boney Occipito-Cervical architecture for any
      fractures or anomalies, CT Angiography (CTA) to study the vertebral artery for anomaly
      especially in the horizontal segment of the VA, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study
      the spinal cord for any compression signs. 2- Postoperative: Immediate (PXR) AP. and Lat.
      views for overall global assessment of the reduction and the construct installation. Then at
      3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery with flexion extension lateral view bending
      stress films for assessment of stability. Immediate (MSCT) to study the crucial screws
      placement estate for any breaches or successfulness, and after 1year for assessment of the
      fusion rate achieved.

      Serial Follow-Up: after 6 weeks for clinical evaluation and functional scoring. At 3 and 6
      months for radiological evaluation of stability, clinical evaluation and functional
      re-scoring. At 1 year for evaluation of fusion rate, clinical evaluation and over all
      resultant functional scores.

    <measure>CT based classification for assessment of biological graft fusion</measure>
    <time_frame>At 6 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>A new assessment method of bony union using high-speed spiral CT imaging is proposed which reflects the gradually increasing biological stability of the construct. Grade I (complete fusion) implies cortical union of the allograft and central trabecular continuity. Grade II (partial fusion) implies cortical union of the structural allograft with partial trabecular incorporation. Grade III (unipolar pseudarthrosis) denotes superior or inferior cortical non-union of the central allograft with partial trabecular discontinuity centrally and Grade IV (bipolar pseudarthrosis) suggests both superior and inferior cortical non-union with a complete lack of central trabecular continuity.</description>

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS Pain)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline measure, then at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Operationally a VAS is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.</description>

    <measure>Neck Disability Index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline measure, then at 2 weeks, 3 months and 6 months postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Each of 10 items, which are 1. Pain intensity 2. Personal care 3. Lifting 4. Reading 5. Headaches 6. Concentration 7. Work 8. Driving 9. Sleeping 10. Recreation, is scored from 0 - 5. The maximum score is therefore 50. The obtained score can be multiplied by 2 to produce a percentage score. Occasionally, a respondent will not complete one question or another. The average of all other items is then added to the completed items.
The original report provided scoring intervals for interpretation, as follows: 0 - 4 = no disability, 5 - 14 = mild, 15 - 24 = moderate, 25 - 34 = severe, and above 34 = complete.</description>
