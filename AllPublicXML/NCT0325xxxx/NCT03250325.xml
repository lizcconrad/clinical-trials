  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of TBI-1301 for NY-ESO-1
      expressing synovial sarcoma when administered following cyclophosphamide pre-treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide, NY-ESO-1-specific T cell receptor (TCR) gene
      transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02:01 or
      HLA-A*02:06 positive patients with synovial sarcoma expressing NY-ESO-1, which are surgically
      unresectable and refractory to anthracycline therapy. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the safety in the phase 1 and the efficacy in the phase 2.
