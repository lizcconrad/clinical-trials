      The aim of this study is to improve spasticity (a form of muscle rigidity) diagnosis through
      exploration of potential new diagnostic markers for spasticity that can assist in diagnosis
      and referral. This will be done by assessing the relatedness of comorbid conditions in
      patients with spasticity. Emphasis will be placed on urinary incontinence, as previous work
      has suggested a link between the two conditions. An additional aim of this study is to assess
      health-related quality of life measures in this population. A medical record review will be
      performed for all consenting participants residing in Tennessee State Veterans' Homes, which
      is a long-term care facility in Murfreesboro, TN. Participants will also be asked to complete
      a brief questionnaire assessing their perceived health-related quality of life, physical
      wellbeing, and mental wellbeing.

    <description>Prevalence of spasticity will be determined by recording the presence/absence of spasticity based on the neurological examination performed on all consenting residents of the long-term care facility. Prevalence of urinary incontinence will be determined by medical record review of all consenting residents of the long-term care facility. The research coordinator will report prevalence of comorbid spasticity and incontinence as a descriptive statistic.</description>

    <description>The subject will undergo elements of the neurological examination during which the movement disorders neurologist will look specifically for the presence of spasticity. If spasticity is found to be present during the examination, the neurologist will rate the severity of the spasticity in all affected limbs and record whether they would recommend treatment for spasticity, and if so, which treatment(s) they believe would be beneficial for the subject.</description>
