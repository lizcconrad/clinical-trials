  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Nutrition Study of the GA2LEN Follow-Survey was designed to investigate the association
      between usual dietary intake and allergic and respiratory outcomes in adults across Europe.
      Within this framework, a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was designed to ascertain usual
      dietary intake of 250 food items, which was translated into the languages of the participant
      centres. Information on daily intake of foods, nutrients, and flavonoids was derived.

      Within the GA2LEN Follow-up Survey, the Nutrition Survey was aimed at assessing dietary
      intake in adults across European countries and its association with various outcomes of
      allergy and respiratory health. In absence of an internationally comparable dietary
      questionnaire to ascertain usual dietary intake, a single and standardized food frequency
      questionnaire (FFQ) was design to be used as a common instrument in all participant
      countries. The FFQ is comprised of 32 food sections and 250 food items. The FFQ sections were
      designed following the recommendations by the EFCOSUM Group, which facilitate international
      comparisons of dietary intake. It also included several staple foods to capture locally
      representative dietary intake.

      Participants reported how often they had consumed each of the foods over the previous month,
      using eight predefined options (rarely or never, 1-3 times per month, once, 2-4, or 5-6 times
      per week, once, 2-3 times per day). Standard food portion sizes were used to quantify the
      intake following the recommendations from the UK's Food Standards Agency. Daily intake of
      foods (g) were estimated and macro- and micronutrient and flavonoid intakes were derived. The
      GA2LEN FFQ was validated in five EU countries, namely Finland, UK, Portugal, Germany, Poland,
      and Greece, and demonstrated to be a good tool to assess mid-term intake of foods,
      specifically essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The instrument has also been
      demonstrated to be an accurate tool to assess dietary sources of flavonoids.

      Various approaches were planned to derive dietary exposures and to examine their association
      with respiratory and allergic outcomes. These included the use of dietary patterns derived
      from Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dietary inflammatory index (DII), as well as
      single antioxidants, and individual food items.

    <description>Five questions on symptoms in the last 12 months (breathless when wheezing, woken with tightness in chest, shortness of breath while at rest, shortness of breath after exercise, woken by shortness of breath) were used to construct an asthma symptom score on a five-point scale</description>

    <measure>Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Last 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>defined following the EP3OS criteria, that is, the presence of at least two of the following symptoms for at least 12 weeks in the past year: (i) nasal blockage, (ii) nasal discharge, (iii) facial pain or pressure or (iv) reduction in sense of smell with at least one of the symptoms being nasal blockage or nasal discharge</description>

    <measure>Lung function</measure>
    <time_frame>Day</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometric lung function (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1), and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)) were measured pre- and post- administration of bronchodilator (salbutamol 200 mg). Spirometric restriction was defined by an FVC below the limit of normal, chronic obstruction by an FEV1/FVC below the limit of normal. All spirometries were checked centrally for quality. Only spirometry that met the ERS/ATS criteria was accepted</description>

    <description>Skin prick tests (SPTs) to grass pollen, grass mix, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, cockroach (Blatella), olive, Alternaria, dog, Artemisia, birch, cat and Parietaria were conducted. A SPT was regarded as positive where the allergen weal was &gt;1 mm more than the diluent control. Atopy was defined as any positive response to any of the allergens tested</description>

      Participants had serum taken which was stored frozen and subsequently analysed in a central
      laboratory to estimate concentration of several biomarkers including hormones (e.g. leptin),
      markers of inflammation (cytokines CRP, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Interleukin 8 (IL-8), Tumour
      Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α) Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) and Myeloperoxidase
      (MPO)), and serum levels of total and allergen-specific IgEs.

        The GA2LEN follow-up study was a multi-center case-control study with participants selected
        from the respondents to an initial cross-sectional survey of a general population of adults
        aged 15-74 years living in 17 European cities and completed between June 2007 and May 2009.
        A random sample of eligible participants who indicated a willingness to be re-contacted was
        selected based on their responses to the initial postal survey. The cases were participants
        who either had asthma, sinusitis or both and the controls (who lived in the same areas)
        were those who reported having neither. Each center recruited up to 120 cases each of
        patients with asthma only, CRS only, controls and 40 patients with both asthma and CRS
        based on the responses to the initial cross-sectional survey.
