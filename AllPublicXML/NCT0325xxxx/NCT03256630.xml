      A Laboratory Study to Evaluate Urine and Blood Biomarkers That Can Distinguish Between the
      Presence or Absence of Aggressive Prostate Cancer

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching goal of this study is to evaluate if biomarkers within the blood or urine of
      men with localized prostate cancer can distinguish between those with indolent cancer,
      defined as Gleason Grade Groups 1 and 2 and those with more aggressive disease (Gleason Grade
      Groups 3, 4, and 5).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has been diagnosed with Prostate Cancer and is planning on having a Radical
             Prostatectomy performed at the Global Robotics Institute.

          2. Diagnostic PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL.

          3. Pathology report from most recent positive biopsy, prior to Radical Prostatectomy, is
             available.

          4. Ability to read and understand the informed consent form.

          5. Patient must have signed informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any active therapy received (hormonal treatment, radiation, chemotherapy, biologic
             agents, surgery). 5-alpha reductase inhibitor treatment will not be considered to be
             hormonal treatment for this definition.
