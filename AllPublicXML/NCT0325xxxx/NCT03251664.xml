      Prevention of anemia among women, particularly pregnant women, is a priority nutrition agenda
      in Ethiopia. Anemia is a significant contributor to poor pregnancy outcomes, including low
      birth weight and maternal mortality. Anemia is of multiple influences, which in most of the
      cases include dietary factors. Consumption food items rich in iron and other nutrients
      involved in red blood cell production promotes optimal hemoglobin level. Dark green leafy
      vegetables, meat, and beans are some of the food groups reported to be associated with lesser
      risk of anemia. Studies on the relation of indigenous food items with health outcome are
      limited in developing countries. For example, teff, consumed only in Ethiopia and parts of
      Eritrea, is traditionally believed to be protective of anemia because of its high iron
      content, but Khat chewing, a pervasive social practice in Ethiopia, has been associated with
      restrictive eating pattern and anemia. In this study, the association of locally consumed
      food groups with anemia was investigated among pregnant Ethiopian women.
