      The investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of all measured concentrations performed
      in a large subset of laboratories located in the French Brittany from February 2010 the 17th
      to August 2015 the 30th, in adults over 20 years old.

      The investigators are aimed at studying physicians' use and eventually misuse of biomarkers
      dosage and the characteristics of a broad population based on some biomarkers concentrations.

      The rUBIDIuM study is a retrospective analysis that included all tests (but not including DNA
      analysis or HIV tests) performed in a large subset of laboratories located in the French
      Brittany from February 2010 the 17th to August 2015 the 30th. The area of study covers most
      of the Ille-et-Vilaine and a part of the Côtes d'Armor department in Brittany. The respective
      surface of these departments is 6775 and 6878 km2. All labs belong to the Biorance Laboratory
      group (consortium of 33 labs, Biorance Laboratoires Réunis) and are equipped with Roche
      Diagnostics instruments (Elecsys2010® analyzer, Roche diagnostics, Meylan, France).

      The main objectives are to study physicians' use and eventually misuse of biomarkers dosage
      and the characteristics of this broad population based on some biomarkers concentrations.

      For all adult patients &gt;20y that came to a participating lab during the study period, the
      investigators collected the following information: demographics data, data about the
      prescription (date of order, list of analysis recommended, the date of blood collection and
      analysis), about the prescribers and the results of the analyses. After a de-identifying
      process, data were aggregated.

      the initial analyses will 1) examine the biological tests (number, types…) ordered in a large
      cohort of patients, in the total population and the subgroups based on gender, age, time
      period, kind of lab and physicians' specialty, 2) examine the results/concentration of the
      analyses: blood chemistry, creatinin concentration, cardiac enzymes, natriuretic peptides,
      INR, lipid profile, hemogram…
