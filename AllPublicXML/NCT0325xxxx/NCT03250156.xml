      This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness training (MT) on cognitive and
      psychological factors when incorporated to the duty-day schedule of servicemembers (via
      proctored mindfulness practice). Based on prior literature, it can be hypothesized that the
      benefits of MT on measures of attention, working memory, and psychological well-being will be
      greater for servicemembers who engage in proctored mindfulness practice and receive duty-day
      support compared to servicemembers who practice independently, on their own time, with no
      structured duty day support.

      Background: Prior research on mindfulness training (MT) in military servicemembers showed
      that MT can effectively protect against degradation in attention and working memory over
      high-demand intervals. The benefits of MT in servicemembers were also linked to greater
      engagement in mindfulness practice. These prior MT programs delivered their training via a
      direct delivery approach, which involved a mindfulness training expert (TE) providing
      training to an end-user (e.g., military servicemembers). While successful, these programs are
      poorly suited for rapid, large-scale dissemination because these programs require direct
      training from a mindfulness training expert to an end-user and a considerable amount of time
      dedicated to training. To overcome these issues, the principal investigator together with a
      mindfulness expert developed a mindfulness training program contextualized for the U.S. Army,
      known as MBAT (Mindfulness-Based Attention Training), that is amenable to the train-the-train
      delivery approach and can provide rapid, large-scale dissemination to thousands of
      individuals. Specifically, Master Resilience Trainer - Performance Expert specialists (PEs),
      who have extensive experience working with soldiers but no mindfulness experience, were
      trained to deliver the MBAT course.

      Problem: While training PEs to deliver MBAT complies with the U.S. Army time constraints, it
      remains unclear what is the best way to incorporate daily mindfulness practice into the duty
      schedule of servicemembers, which has a pivotal contribution to the protection against
      decline over high-demand intervals.

      Project Goal: The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of proctored vs.
      non-proctored practice of MBAT delivered by a PE to servicemembers. To investigate this
      issue, a trained PE will deliver MBAT to two groups of soldiers who will differ in the amount
      of duty-day support received to complete out-of-class mindfulness exercises. One group will
      be assigned proctored practice incorporated in the daily physical training (PT) and another
      group will be assigned non-proctored practice during which participants will perform the
      exercise independently, on their own.

    <intervention_model_description>We aim to recruit three groups. Two groups will receive mindfulness training (MBAT), but will differ in their level of duty day support to engage in daily assigned mindfulness exercises. The Proctored group (n = 45) will receive mindfulness training and complete assigned exercises during the duty day, integrated into their daily physical training. The Non-Proctored group (n = 45) will receive identical mindfulness training, but complete their assigned exercises on their own time. These participants will not receive additional duty day support for their practice. A third group will receive no training and serve as a control group (No-Training Control, n = 45).
The design relies on group randomization at the level of individual platoons. This is due to the military requirement that organic unit structure be maintained during testing and course session scheduling. The number of participants is based on prior research (Jha et al., 2017).</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete the SART at three time points: Pre-intervention baseline (T1), post-intervention up to 2 weeks after the end of the 4-week training (T2), and follow-up up to two months after the end of the training (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The SART is used to assess attentional performance and self-reported mind wandering (i.e., off-task thinking which is typically self-generated and compromises the performance of the task at hand). The task uses a continuous performance paradigm involving button presses to frequently presented non-targets (numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) but requires the participants to withhold their response to the infrequent target (number 3). Withholding responses only to infrequent targets encourages a pre-potent response and mind wandering. Real-time subjective experience of mind wandering during SART is assessed through experience-sampling probes randomly presented throughout the task.</description>

    <measure>Change in Working Memory Task with Affective Distraction (WMDA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will complete the WMDA at three time points: Pre-intervention baseline (T1), post-intervention up to 2 weeks after the end of the 4-week training (T2), and follow-up up to two months after the end of the training (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>The WMDA is used to assess the ability to hold information in working memory while overcoming emotional reactivity and distraction. Specifically, participants are presented with a memory item that they need to memorize and hold in memory during a delay interval. During the delay, emotionally negative or neutral scene images are presented. The negative images are combat scenes from Iraq or Afghanistan (Morey et al., 2009) and the neutral images are non-combat scenes.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention baseline (T1), post-intervention up to 2 weeks after the end of the 4-week training (T2), and follow-up up to two months after the end of the training (T3).</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS assesses positive and negative affect. It consists of a list of descriptors of positive (e.g., 'interested', 'enthusiastic') and negative (e.g., 'irritable', 'upset') affects. Items are rated on a 5-point scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely), according to how participants feel. The Positive Affect scale reflects the extent to which a person feels enthusiastic, active, and alert; the Negative Affect scale reflects unpleasant mood states, such as anger, disgust, and fear.</description>
