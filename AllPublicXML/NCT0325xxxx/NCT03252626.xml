  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke has a variety of treatments and currently drug therapy is one of the main
      treatments.A number of clinical studies have proved that alprostadil (PGE1) has
      pharmacological effects of significant dilation of blood vessels, inhibition of plate
      aggregation, anti-atherosclerosis and increased cerebral blood flow.Evaluate the 90-days
      efficacy by comparing two groups of patients'(one with alprostadil,another with placebo) mRS.
