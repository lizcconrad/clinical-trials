  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial aims to investigate a potential enhancement of IMP321 immune-activating
      effects by new routes of administration: direct injection of IMP321 into the tumor tissue;
      intra-peritoneal therapy; combination of chemotherapy with active immunotherapy
      (chemo-immunotherapy)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, IMP321 is solely administered by sub-cutaneous injection (e.g. on the anterior
      face of the thigh). In this study, we investigate whether a direct injection of IMP321 into
      the tumor tissue will be a useful option to improve anti-tumor immune response by placing the
      immune-therapeutic agent in direct vicinity of immune infiltrates in the tumor bed. This
      bypasses processes necessary for drug delivery to cells of solid tumors following systemic
      administration, like transport within vessels, transport across vasculature walls into
      surrounding tissues, and - in cases of peritoneal metastases - transport through the
      interstitial space within a tumor. For the latter case, we will also explore if an
      intra-peritoneal therapy represents a feasible alternative by means of delivering high drug
      concentrations directly to tumors located in the peritoneal cavity.

      Furthermore, we will explore the possibility to extend the positive results obtained by
      subcutaneous injections of IMP321 in metastatic renal cell and breast carcinomas to further
      solid tumor entities. In this part of the study, patients will be treated with the
      standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy for their tumor entity along with subcutaneous injections
      of IMP321.
