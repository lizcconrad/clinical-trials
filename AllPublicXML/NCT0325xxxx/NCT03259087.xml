  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare plasma and urine PK parameters of MK-3866 between
      participants with impaired renal function and healthy control participants, to investigate
      the extent to which MK-3866 is removed from the plasma by hemodialysis (HD), and evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of MK-3866 in participants with impaired renal function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-part single dose study: Part 1 will include participants with mild,
      moderate, and severe renal impairment, and Part 2 will include participants with end stage
      renal disease (ESRD) undergoing HD. Participants in Part 1 will receive a single IV dose of
      MK-3866, and plasma and urine samples will be collected over pre-specified time intervals.
      Participants in Part 2 will receive a single IV dose of MK-3866 on two separate occasions: in
      Period 1 immediately following their normally-scheduled HD, and in Period 2 approximately 30
      minutes prior to their normally-scheduled HD. Plasma, urine, and dialysate samples will be
      collected over pre-specified time intervals for Part 2.
