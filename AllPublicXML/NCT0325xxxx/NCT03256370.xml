      Compare the HMO composition in breast milk of infants with allergic manifestation (atopic
      dermatitis and food allergy) in the first 3 years of life, healthy infants with allergic
      mother and healthy infants with non-allergic mother.

      -  Parents of breast-fed infant from general pediatric clinic and allergy clinic of King
           Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were approached for informed about the research and ask
           to join this project

        -  After completed informed consent, demographic data was collected and filled in case
           record form

        -  Milk of mother in both allergic and control groups were collected 60 ml then transferred
           to freeze at -80oc to for human milk oligosaccharide analysis
