  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the limitations caused by cerebrovascular accident (CVA), the upper limb (MS) undergoes
      changes that limit the individual in his ability to maintain an active social life. Mental
      Practice (MP) consists of the internal reproduction of an event, which is repeated
      extensively in order to learn or improve an already known skill. The objective of the study
      is evaluate the effects of the physical practice associated with PM, on paretic MS. Subjects
      with unilateral stroke over 6 months, age&gt; 18 years and who were able to hold objects will be
      selected. Subjects with painful conditions that affected exercise performance,&gt; 3 spasticity
      by Ashworth, and cognitive deficit suggested by the Mini Mental State Examination will be
      excluded.

      There are 3 study protocols. The MP protocol 1 comprise 4 steps: 1) 5 minutes of global
      relaxation; 2) Video therapy, being 2 minutes / task (4 distinct tasks: stacking cubes,
      opposition of fingers with precision gripping, passing water from one glass to another,
      sequencing of bottles); 3) MP: think about the tasks assisted in the video for 5 minutes /
      task. 4) Physical Practice: reproduce through the motor execution, the activities assisted in
      the video (5 minutes / task). The MP protocol 2 was the same, changing the order: first
      physical practice and after MP. For the protocol 3 without PM, step 3 was suppressed,
      remaining the remaining steps. There were 15 sessions, 2x / week, for 1 hour. The Fugl-Meyer
      (FM) Scales, Ashworth Modified Scale (EMA), Functional Independence Measurement (MIF), Action
      Research Arm Test (ARAt), Box and block task (BBT) and Theory of mind battery (ToM) will be
      applied before and after the sessions, and in 3 months follow-up.
