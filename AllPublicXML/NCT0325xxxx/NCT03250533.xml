      One of the important complications of DM is the diabetic foot that may present ulcers, which
      result from multiple risk factors, being diabetic peripheral neuropathy and ischemia due to
      peripheral vascular disease considered the main causes. In this way, the ulcers of the lower
      extremities of diabetics, have a complex and long cicatrization process. Faced with this, the
      treatment of chronic wounds is challenging, the diversity of treatments is great, however the
      search for new modalities of effective therapeutic resources, scientifically proven and
      financially feasible, that are available and easily accessible for clinical practice is still
      desirable . The aim of this study was to evaluate the responses of phototherapy with light
      emitting diodes (LED) and electrical stimulation with the fixed diphasic current (DF) in
      ulcers of diabetic patients. Diabetic volunteers who present with chronic skin ulcers will
      also be randomized (n = 13) to: Treatment group with LED 620 nm, Treatment group with LED 940
      nm, Treatment group with fixed diphasic current and Control group. Interventions will occur
      three times a week for 12 weeks and evaluations will occur on the 1st, 30th, 60th, and 90th
      day of the intervention, followed by follow-up after 30 days of treatment completion.

      Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease currently considered a worldwide
      epidemic and has become a major public health problem. One of the important complications of
      DM is the diabetic foot that may present ulcers, which result from multiple risk factors,
      being diabetic peripheral neuropathy and ischemia due to peripheral vascular disease
      considered the main causes. In this way, the ulcers of the lower extremities of diabetics,
      have a complex and long healing process, as they present a reduction in the angiogenic
      response and deficiency of growth factors, making difficult the action of conventional
      treatments. The treatment of chronic wounds is challenging, the diversity of treatments is
      great, however the search for new modalities of effective, scientifically proven and
      financially viable therapeutic resources that are available and readily accessible to
      clinical practice is still desirable. Objective: To evaluate the responses of phototherapy
      with light emitting diodes (LED) and electrical stimulation with the fixed diphasic current
      (DF) in diabetic patient ulcers. METHODS: Diabetic volunteers of both genders, aged 30 to 65
      years, who present chronic skin ulcers grade I or II will also be randomized (n = 13) in:
      Treatment group with LED 620 nm (G-LED 620) , Treatment group with LED 940 nm (G-LED 940),
      Treatment group with fixed diphasic current (G-DF) and Control group (GC). Interventions will
      occur three times a week for 12 weeks. The evaluations will take place on the
      pre-intervention day 1, 30, 60 and 90 days, followed by follow-up after 30 days of the end of
      the treatment, through the following instruments: numerical scale of pain, digital
      photography, infrared thermography, digital analgesimeter, Digital durometer, infrared
      plethysmography and bioimpedance. Statistical analysis: To analyze the data, normality test
      will be used to verify the distribution of the data and adequate statistical test for the
      appropriate inter- and intragroup comparisons, being thus considered two factors in the
      comparisons, time and group. A significance level of 5% will be adopted.

    <description>The light-emitting diode (LED) device consists of a soft 15 x 15 cm blanket, which allows the body segment curvature of the cutaneous lesion to be monitored. The LEDs are fixed equidistant to obtain uniform irradiation over the entire ulcer. The wound site will be surrounded by a PVC film (polyvinyl chloride), to avoid contamination, for posterior positioning of the LED device, applying light directly and perpendicularly, with energy density of 6 J / cm². All LEDs will be calibrated prior to the start of applications in the Laboratory of Photobiophysics of the Faculty of Sciences and Letters of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, in which the wavelengths will be checked, the angle of radiation, power and power density.</description>

    <description>The electrical stimulation treatment will be performed with the fixed diphasic current of the Dualpex 071 equipment (Quark®, Piracicaba, SP, Brazil), with the monopolar technique, 100 Hz, maximum intensity of 1 mA / cm² of lesion for 10 minutes. Autoclave sterilized aluminum electrodes will be used, one on the lesion (negative pole) and the other transversal to the segment (positive pole). The size of the electrode will be proportional to the extension of the lesion, having as a means of contact between the electrode and the ulcer, sterile gauze moistened with 0.9% saline solution.</description>
