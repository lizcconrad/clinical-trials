  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Protocol is a pilot, clinical interventional study to selected patients between five and
      fourteen years of both sexes, carriers of the diagnosis of glioma brain stem and high grade
      recurrent in the central nervous system tumors, in whom there has been no response to
      conventional-based surgery/radiation/chemotherapy treatment or whose location does not allow
      treatment with conventional measures, and that already have an indication for a neurosurgical
      palliative procedure. It will be a close pharmacovigilance on possible adverse effects
      related to the nanomaterial based on the profile of cisplatin (chemotherapeutic platinum
      derivative), since documented toxicity data are not counted for NPt-Ca. Quality of life will
      be documented with PedsQL Cancer Module© and tumor size by magnetic resonance brain images.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histopathological diagnosis or MRI of the brain stem or tumor of recurrent high-grade
             glioma.

          -  Indication of palliative surgical treatment by neurosurgery.

          -  Good general condition, enabling the realization of surgical treatment.

          -  conventional treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) failed or not
             applicable to the patient.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with emerging infectious diseases or fever in the last 72 hours prior to
             placement of the NPt-Ca.

          -  Patients whose parents/carers do not authorize expressly the realization of procedure
             with knowledge of its experimental nature, are not agreed or established their
             commitment to meet follow-up parameters established by this Protocol.

          -  Patients with surgical complications prior to placement of the NPt-Ca.

          -  Patients in which the size and location of the lesion do not allow their surgical
