  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators evaluated the spatial association between, cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
      and stroke mortality rate with average ambient temperature (Ta) , and then used this
      relationship to model future temporal trends in mortality from CVD and stroke till the end of
      century (2099) using different warming scenarios across the mainland USA.

      the investigators used data on mortality rate (per 100,000 individuals) for CVD and stroke
      (between 2011 and 2013, age&gt;35years) from the publicly available Centers for disease
      prevention and control (CDC) web site (www.cdc.gov). CVD mortality was defined as the number
      of deaths per 100,000 personyears due to circulatory causes (International Statistical
      Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes I00-I99).Oak Ridge National laboratory was
      the source of the ambient temperature data (http://www.daac.ornl.gov: files B01, B02 and
      C07).The investigators obtained data on prevalence of HTN (HTN was defined as systolic blood
      pressure (BP) of at least 140 mm Hg, self-reported use of antihypertensive treatment, or
      both) from county health rankings and roadmaps organisation (www.countyhealthrankings.org),
      which were estimated based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in five
      two-year waves from 1999-2008 including 26,349 adults aged 30 years and older and from the
      Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1997-2009 including 1,283,722 adults
      aged 30 years and older.
