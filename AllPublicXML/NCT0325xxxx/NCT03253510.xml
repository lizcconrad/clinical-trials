  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial to compare between biting force of mandibular complete denture
      constructed from two different materials; metal reinforced polyamide and conventional
      PMMA,The null hypothesis of the study that there will not be a difference between biting
      force of the complete denture constructed from metal reinforced polyamide and PMMA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polyamide resins used in dentistry exhibit high flexibility, physical strength, heat and
      chemical resistance and the exceedingly rare allergy response. Although flexural strength,
      modulus of elasticity and rigidity of nylon (polyamide) denture base materials are relatively
      low, they demonstrate great impact strength, toughness, and resistance to fracture. It was
      suggested that by adding glass fibers to polyamides, their stiffness and other mechanical
      properties could be increased. The flexural properties of nylon denture base materials has
      promoted their usage only in conditions like unyielding undercuts, pronounced tuberosities,
      tori and bulging alveolar ridges. In 2013 Wadachi etal compared rigidity of polyamide and
      PMMA when used as a denture base material and concluded that; the modulus of elasticity of
      polyamide was very low in comparison to PMMA and was lower than ISO standard, and so they
      recommended that polyamide to be used as a denture base material it should be reinforced with
      metal frame

    <description>Bite force will be measured for both types of complete denture after one month of denture insertion . The recorded force during maximal clenching was obtained with I-load sensor placed between pairs of opposing teeth at one side and wood tongue depressor at the other side. The meter and depressor were located at the area of premolar/molar where there is more number of occlusal contacts with strong determinant of muscle action and subsequent great bite force.</description>
