  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of anti-HIV medicines by HIV negative people
      in order to prevent them from becoming HIV positive if exposed to HIV.

      Currently, the combination drug containing tenofovir and emtricitabine is licensed in Europe
      for use as HIV PrEP. We know from previous studies worldwide that this combination drug is
      very good at reducing the risk of HIV infection and several countries have implemented PrEP
      programmes to provide PrEP to individuals at high risk of HIV.

      However, it is difficult to effectively plan for a national PrEP programme in England without
      knowing how many people will need PrEP, how many will want to take PrEP, and how long they
      will stay on PrEP.

      In order to find this out, the PrEP Impact Trial will make PrEP available to at least 10,000
      people over three years. HIV negative men and women attending sexual health clinics in
      England will have their risk of HIV assessed by their care team and be offered PrEP if they
      meet the eligibility criteria. Through the trial we will be able to measure how many
      attendees at sexual health clinics meet eligibility criteria for PrEP, how many of these take
      up the offer of PrEP and how long they remain on PrEP for.

      There will not be any additional tests other than those recommended for the safe delivery of
      PrEP. These include tests for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV as well as urine
      and blood tests to monitor kidney function. Information about attendances and test results
      will be anonymously collected through the existing data reporting system that sexual health
      clinics currently use to report to Public Health England.

        The participant populations for this trial will be men and women attending GUM clinics who
        belong to one of three populations recognised to be at high risk for HIV, namely:

        A. Men (cisgender and transgender) and transgender women who:

          1. Have sex with men

          2. Have had an HIV negative test during an earlier episode of care in the preceding year

          3. Report condomless intercourse in the previous 3 months

          4. Affirm their likelihood of having condomless intercourse in the next 3 months

        B. HIV negative partners of an HIV positive person when:

          1. The HIV positive partner is not known to be virally suppressed (&lt;200 copies/ml for 6
             months or more)

          2. Condomless intercourse is anticipated before treatment of the HIV positive partner
             takes effect

        C.HIV negative persons who:

        1. Are clinically assessed and considered to be at similar high risk of HIV acquisition as
        those with a serodiscordant partner who is not known to be virally suppressed
