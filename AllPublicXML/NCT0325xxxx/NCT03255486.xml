    <description>Blood samples will be taken by venipuncture during the initial assessment (4 tubes of 5 ml at diagnosis and 3 tubes of 5 ml to the following) These blood tests will be repeated after the first course, at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and after surgery and will be carried out jointly to levies motivated by the balance sheet or the treatment of CS to avoid additional puncture.
These samples will allow us to study the profiles of circulating tumor DNA, and miRNA tumor proteins (proteomics study).</description>
