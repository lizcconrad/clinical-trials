  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital malformation associated with
      significant mortality and respiratory morbidity, particularly related to prolonged mechanical
      ventilation. NAVA (Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist) is a recent technique that uses the
      recognition of the electrical activity of the patient's diaphragm (Edi) and delivers a
      synchronized proportional assisted ventilation. This technique has already been used in the
      newborn, especially premature and has shown many benefits. Only one study in the literature
      shows its feasibility in newborns with CDH. This technique seems interesting in the context
      of CDH because it would limit baro-trauma and improve synchronization. Before demonstrating
      the clinical benefits, it seems important to describe the effects on the respiratory
      physiology, in particular on work of breathing which can be estimated by the esophageal and
      trans-diaphragmatic pressure-time product obtained by an esophageal transducer. Our study is
      an innovative physiologic pilot study with the objective to describe work of breathing in
      neonates with CDH in post-surgical period in NAVA ventilation and in conventional ventilation
      using an esophageal transducer. It will provide the clinician with a physiological
      justification for the use of NAVA to rapidly improve the respiratory muscular dynamics of
      these patients. This study is a prerequisite for the realization of studies demonstrating the
      clinical benefit of NAVA ventilation on reduction of duration of ventilation and more
      generally on morbidity and mortality in the population of neonate with CDH.

    <description>While the patient is under respiratory assistance on the SERVO-I respirator, he will be included in the study and one esophageal transducer of 2,3 mm of diameter will be inserted through the mouth / nose in addition to NAVA's naso / Oro-Gastric tube( Edi Catheter, 6Fr, 49 cm, PHT free 5 pcs / pkg or Catheter Edi, 6Fr, 50 cm, PHT free 5 pcs / pkg). Measurements will be performed using the esophageal transducer under two conditions: 2 hours in conventional ventilation (pressure controlled), 2 hours in NAVA ventilation and then again 2 hours in conventional ventilation (PC) for a total duration of 6 hours.The parameters of conventional ventilation will be left free at the choice of the neonatologist and will be identical between the two periods of conventional ventilation. The initial NAVA level will be defined by the neonatologist using pre-visualization curves. All signals will be recorded via an amplification and acquisition system. Values will be averaged over 100 cycles.</description>
