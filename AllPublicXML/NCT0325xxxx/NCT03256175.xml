  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often associated with myocardial
      necrosis evidenced by peri-procedural troponin release. This is a surrogate for subsequent
      cardiovascular events. There is no study on the effect of peri-PCI oxygenation in in
      myocardial protection and cardiopulmonary fitness outcome. Patients with higher baseline
      cardiopulmonary fitness will have lower mortality.

      This study is to assess the utility of oxygen to reduce ischaemia in patients with
      significant stable coronary artery disease scheduled for elective PCI. The secondary
      objective is to evaluate further effect of peri- PCI oxygenation on cardiovascular fitness
      and autonomic response.

      OBJECTIVE: This study is to assess the utility of oxygen to reduce ischaemia in patients with
      significant stable coronary artery disease scheduled for elective PCI. The secondary
      objective is to evaluate further effect of peri- PCI oxygenation on cardiovascular fitness
      and autonomic response.

      STUDY DESIGN: Randomized double blinded prospective pilot study SAMPLE SIZE: 30 patients
      scheduled for elective for PCI randomized to 2 groups, oxygen group ( 15L/min) and air group
      METHOD: Patient whom fulfil inclusion criteria were recruited and randomized to 2 groups via
      computer allocation system. The assigned inhaled gas will be delivered via high-flow mask at
      15L/min for a minimum of 30 minutes immediately prior to and continued throughout the PCI
      procedure. Patients were blinded throughout the procedure but the practising cardiologist and
      staff nurses were not blinded. Routine care continued post PCI. Blood sampling for Troponin I
      was taken at 6 hours and 24 hours following stent implantation. Patients were discharged one
      day after the procedure as per current routine practice.

      Patients were given routine follow up with the cardiac rehabilitation clinic in 4 weeks time
      post discharge. EST was arranged 6 weeks post procedure PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Troponin I
      at 6 and 24 hours SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: METs, Heart Rate Recovery, Chronotropic Index

    <masking_description>Both medical air and oxygen were supplied in compressed liquid form and available throughout the hospital. During the study, the medical gas cylinders shielded using an opaque temporary cover.
