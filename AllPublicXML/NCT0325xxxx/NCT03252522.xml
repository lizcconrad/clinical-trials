        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Age inclusive of and between 6 and 12 years at the time of enrollment; 2) Verbally
             willing to agree to swallowing a maximum of 9-12 capsules/day with food, attend all
             study appointments and complete questionnaires; and 3) Meet criteria for ADHD as
             assessed by the clinical cut-off (6+ questions scored as 2s or 3s, &quot;often,&quot; or &quot;very
             often&quot;) on the Category A: ADHD questions from on the Child &amp; Adolescent Symptom
             Inventory-5 (CASI-5) with at least several symptoms present in more than 1 setting,
             based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) 5 symptom criteria, including
             significant impairment in functioning socially and/or academically 41; 4) Demonstrate
             at least one symptom of irritability or anger as assessed by a score of 2 or 3 on one
             question from Category B or Rz from the CASI-5; 5) Be medication-free, or washout with
             medical supervision to be provided by the child's pediatrician or primary care
             physician, reliant on the parent/guardian to work with that physician, for at least 2
             weeks prior to in-person study assessment. Washout will be recorded as occurring on
             the date reported by the parent/guardian, with a faxed copy of the progress note,
             visit summary or signed letter from participant's doctor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1) Neurological disorder involving brain or other central function (e.g., history of
             or suspected intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, multiple
             sclerosis, narcolepsy) or other major psychiatric condition requiring hospitalization
             (e.g. significant mood disorder, active suicidal ideation, or psychosis), based on
             parent/guardian self-report of child's condition and responses to category M on the
             CASI-5 subscale; 2) Any serious medical condition, including inflammatory bowel
             disease, history of cancer, kidney or liver disease, hyperthyroidism, diabetes Type I
             or II; 3) Known allergy to any ingredients of the intervention; 4) Any known
             abnormality of mineral metabolism (e.g., Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis); 5) Taking
             any other medication with primarily central nervous system activity, including
             stimulants, within the last 2 weeks prior to in-person assessment; participants must
             be off these medications for a minimum of two weeks prior to the screening 6) Severe
             separation anxiety that would preclude separating from parent/guardian to answer study
             questionnaires; 7) Any disability that would interfere with participant answering
             questions verbally; 8) Non-English speaking; 9) Pregnancy or sexually active at
             baseline. Exclusion criteria 1-6 and 9, will be based on parent/guardian self-report
             of child's condition. If the parent/guardian reports medical exclusion criteria, or
             concerns about eligibility, data provided by parent/guardian will be confirmed by
             review of medical records with release of information signed by parent/guardian.
             Potential participant may be reviewed in-person by a study physician in the case of
             any concerns about participation.
