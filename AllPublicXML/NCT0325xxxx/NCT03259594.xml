      Renal functional reserve may be improved in patients with simple renal cysts after
      laparoscopic deroofing.

    <textblock>
      Simple renal cysts (SRC) are the most frequent type of cystic renal disease. The prevalence
      rate of SRCs is about 10% and increases with age. Hypertension and decreased renal functions
      have been reported to occur more commonly among these patients with SRC and there are no
      clear guidelines for managing asymptomatic SRCs.Renal functional reserve (RFR) describes the
      capacity of the intact nephron mass to increase glomerular filtration rate(GFR) from baseline
      in response to stimuli (e.g., protein load).The investigators hypothesized that RFR may be
      improved in some patients with simple renal cysts after laparoscopic deroofing despite
      identical resting glomerular filtration rate (rGFR).The aim of this study is to examine
      whether there is improvement of RFR in patients with simple renal cysts after laparoscopic
      deroofing.
