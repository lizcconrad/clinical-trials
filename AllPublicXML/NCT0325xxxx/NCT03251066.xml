  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigation of the immediate effect on subjective relief of symptoms by Proponent - Nasal -
      Spray after a one time administration (following a single dose administration in each
      nostril) in an open, not randomised, non-blinded single centre observation study on 40
      volunteers between 18-75 years of age with an unspecific discomfort in the nose such as
      enhanced nasal discharge/ secretion (runny nose), congested nose, sneezing, itchy nose or
      feeling of a dry nose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By regularisation of environment of nasal mucosa and the following restitution and
      improvement of the ciliary function the efficacy of mucociliary clearance can be remarkably
      enhanced, pathogens from the environment can be physically removed and a bacterial or viral
      infection may be prevented on this way.

      Such an optimizing effect may be reached by the administration of an equilibrated saline
      solution with an optimal composition regarding osmolality, pH-value and buffer substance.

      In addition it would be very advantageous to support the efficacy of the local unspecific and
      specific immune mechanisms in the nasal respiratory mucosa (NALT) without any negative
      effects on the optimized mucociliary clearance.

      As demonstrated recently in airway mucosa sodium propionate is able to interact with
      macrophages, the interleukin system and other factors of the TNF receptor family.

      Sodium propionate could therefore have an ancillary effect on the genuine immune mechanisms
      of nasal respiratory mucosa. On this way the primary effect of administration of saline
      solution is supported.

    <time_frame>up to 48 hrs</time_frame>
    <description>This endpont is defined by the adverse events non-response rate based on the individual adverse events reported by the participant up to 60 min after treatment. The adverse events are specified and defined by scores. The sum score over time for all individual adverse event symptoms will be determined for each participant. Not more than 10 % of all participants of the study should report adverse events with a sum score &gt; 3 for one or more of the listed adverse events. Not more than 10 % of all participants of the study should report adverse events with a sum score &gt; 3 for one or more of the listed adverse effects.</description>

    <description>The first co-secondary endpoint of the study is the immediate response rate based on the &quot;Change of severity of general symptoms of unspecific nasal discomfort&quot; following the single administration of &quot;Proponent Nasal Spray&quot; up to 60 min after treatment. The second co-secondary endpoint is the immediate response rate based on the &quot;Change of severity of selected individual symptoms&quot; of nasal discomfort following the single administration of &quot;Proponent Nasal Spray&quot; up to 60 min after treatment - provided the respective symptom was identified by a participant prior to the administration of &quot;Proponent Nasal Spray&quot; as a nasal discomfort.</description>
