    <textblock>
      This research study is a sub-study within the Behavioral Activation for Smoking Cessation and
      the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain main study (NCT02906787). Participants who are
      eligible for the main study and meet certain MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) related study
      criteria (i.e. conditions) may also elect to complete a series of computer tasks inside a
      standard, closed MRI scanner to examine changes in brain activity associated with the smoking
      cessation counseling that participants will receive in the main study. In total, participants
      will be asked to complete 2, one-hour fMRI scans: 1 before completing their first counseling
      session and 1 during the final 7 days of the scheduled 8-week nicotine patch treatment
      period.

    <textblock>
      This neuroimaging sub-study will examine a sub-set (N=60) of the main study's (Smoking
      Cessation and the Prevention of Post-Cessation Weight Gain) randomized clinical trial
      participants (balanced sample between BAS+ and SC). Participants who meet MRI eligibility and
      elect to participate in the sub-study will complete two, 1-hour functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) scans while completing computer tasks inside an MRI scanner. fMRI can identify
      mechanisms underlying behavior change beyond self-report and behavioral measures. The
      investigators will examine neural responses in three parallel pathways including: cognitive
      control, food cue reactivity, and food reinforcement. The project's three aims address: 1)
      identifying putative brain mechanisms underlying BAS+ (vs. SC) treatment for smoking
      cessation and PCWG; 2) evaluating the relative contribution of treatment-induced changes in
      task related brain signal (Food Cue Response, Food Reinforcement/Choice) in prediction of
      post treatment food intake; and 3) testing whether BAS+ (vs. SC) induced change in neural
      responses to food cues and food reinforcement is a stronger predictor of food intake among
      smokers with greater cognitive control. The findings will address why BAS+ may be effective
      in managing PCWG and provide insight into which patients are best supported by this
      treatment. The investigators will also test whether cognitive control processes moderate the
      influence of BAS+ treatment on food intake.

    <time_frame>12-Week Follow-Up Visit</time_frame>
    <description>Smoking abstinence will be assessed and biochemically verified at the 12-week Follow-Up Visit (12 weeks post target quit date). Seven-day point prevalence abstinence (no smoking, not even a puff, for at least 7 days prior to the assessment) will be biochemically verified by a carbon monoxide (CO) reading &lt; 8 parts per million and by saliva cotinine &lt; 15ng/ml.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline food intake (kcals/day) at 12 weeks post target quit date</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline,12-Week Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Food intake will be assessed via 3 telephone-administered, 24-hour dietary recalls during the week after (or near) the Baseline Visit, Mid-Treatment 3 Visit (week 4), End of Treatment Visit (week 8) and the 12-week Follow-Up Visit. A trained member of the research staff will use a multi-pass method with an interactive computerized software program, the ASA24Â® (Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Recall), to determine total kcal/day (outcome variable).</description>

    <description>T2*-weighted Blood Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) images will be acquired using a wholebrain, single-shot gradient-echo (GE) echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence.

    <description>The goal of the BAS+ is to maintain a level of overall reward after cessation by structuring and enhancing opportunities for reinforcement to: (1) ensure that not smoking is as reinforcing as smoking; and (2) prevent an over-reliance on food as a substitute reinforcer for smoking so that PCWG does not precipitate smoking relapse.</description>

    <description>Overeating and weight gain are common concerns reported during smoking cessation treatment. Per convention, SC will address these concerns through standard recommendations to consume low-calorie snack foods, drink water, eat nutritious meals, and exercise, but will not include skills to shape the use of these suggestions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible to participate in the main study (See NCT02906787)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of claustrophobia.

          -  Being left-handed.

          -  Lifetime history of stroke.

          -  Having a cochlear implant or wearing bilateral hearing aids.

          -  History of notable head trauma. Although notable head trauma is typically defined as
             being knocked unconscious for a period of three minutes or longer, notable head trauma
             will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate personnel prior to an
             eligibility decision considering exceptions can be made based on the nature and
             severity of the trauma.

          -  History of brain or spinal tumor.

          -  Pacemakers, certain metallic implants or objects, or presence of metal in the eye as
             contraindicated for MRI.

          -  Any circumstances (e.g., exclusionary metal implants, certain dental work, and/or
             physical impairments) and/or conditions that may interfere with MRI and MRI-related
             study visit procedures. All potential exclusionary circumstances and/or conditions
             will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the appropriate personnel prior to an
             eligibility decision.

          -  History of gunshot wounds. Injuries from BB guns will be evaluated on a case-by-case
             basis by the appropriate personnel prior to an eligibility decision.

          -  History of epilepsy and/or recurrent or uncontrolled seizures.

          -  Weight greater than 250 lbs at Intake Visit or self-reported at phone screen. If a
             participant weighs less than or equal to 250 lbs at Intake, but presents with a weight
             greater than 250 lbs at either Scan 1 and/or Scan 2, the participant may be permitted
             to proceed with the scan as long as the participant's weight does not exceed 300 lbs.

          -  A positive urine drug screen (UDS) for cocaine, opiates, amphetamines,
             methamphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), ecstasy (MDMA), barbiturates, benzodiazepines,
             methadone, and/or oxycodone at either Scan Visit. Depending on the substance and
             circumstances, a subject may be deemed ineligible for the main study at the discretion
             of the Principal Investigator as well.

          -  A Breath Alcohol Reading greater than 0.010 at either Scan Visit. Depending on the
             circumstances, the Principal Investigator may permit the participant to remain in the
             sub-study and reschedule a neuroimaging scan to another day.
