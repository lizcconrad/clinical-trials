  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of care depends strongly on oral communication with patients. Stroke patients, who
      have language disorders, have understanding difficulties, but also have difficulties in
      expressing their needs and in being understood. Available tools do not allow a professional
      consensus on the assessment of patients' ability to answer reliably to questions asked by
      caregivers. The investigators propose an answer reliability assessment tool based on yes or
      no questions. The goal of the present study is to define an optimal score for defining the
      test positivity, as a compromise between sensitivity and specificity, and by emphasizing the
      negative predictive value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In France, about 130,000 persons per year are victims of stroke. Thirty percent of the
      victims suffer from aphasia during the acute phase. These language impairments have an impact
      on caregiving. In the context of post-stroke aphasia, the most relevant means of verbal
      communication is closed-ended questioning. However, the available tools do not allow a
      professional consensus and the comprehensive assessment tools for aphasia do not provide any
      indication of the reliability of patients' answers. The investigators have developed a tool,
      the yes/no questionnaire that consists of 10 closed-ended questions designed to assess the
      patient's ability to provide a coherent answer. During one year, successive patients taken
      care in the neurovascular unit at la Rochelle hospital will be assessed for eligibility to
      the study and their relative will be informed and ask for consent. Aphasic patients will
      therefore answer the yes/no questionnaire. Based on the speech therapist evaluation, patients
      will be classified as &quot;reliable respondent&quot; or &quot;unreliable respondent&quot;.
