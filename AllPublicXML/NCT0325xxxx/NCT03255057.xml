  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of using the Hemolung RAS to provide low-flow
      extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) as an alternative or adjunct to invasive
      mechanical ventilation for patients who require respiratory support due to an acute
      exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It is hypothesized that the
      Hemolung RAS can be safely used to avoid or reduce time on invasive mechanical ventilation
      compared to COPD patients treated with standard-of-care mechanical ventilation alone.
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive lung support with either the Hemolung RAS
      plus standard-of-care mechanical ventilation, or standard-of-care mechanical ventilation
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hemolung RAS provides low-flow ECCO2R using a single, 15.5 French dual-lumen catheter
      inserted percutaneously in the femoral or jugular vein. Low-flow ECCO2R offers an alternative
      or supplement to invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) for patients suffering from acute,
      reversible, hypercapnic respiratory failure. In contrast to invasive MV, low-flow ECCO2R
      provides partial ventilatory support independently of the lungs. The rationale for this study
      is that low-flow ECCO2R with the Hemolung RAS can be used to provide supplemental CO2 removal
      in COPD patients experiencing acute hypercapnic respiratory failure to either avoid or reduce
      time on invasive MV. In this patient population, avoidance or reduced time on invasive MV may
      have significant clinical benefit in reducing the many complications associated with invasive
      MV. The major complication risks of low-flow ECCO2R are associated with central venous
      catheterization and the need for anticoagulation during treatment. This study is designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hemolung RAS plus standard-of-care as compared to
      standard-of-care alone.
