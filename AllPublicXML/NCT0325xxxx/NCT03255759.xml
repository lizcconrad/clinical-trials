  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of rapid panel-based molecular assays for direct organism identification and
      resistance characterization in positive blood culture bottles are now commercially available.
      They have been shown to improve accuracy and decrease the time-to-result, allowing targeted
      treatment in hospitalized patients with bacteraemia, in high-income countries (HICs).
      However, these molecular assays are add-on tests performed in addition to conventional
      testing, increasing the complexity of diagnostic algorithms and costs of patient care.
      Conventional organism identification includes performing a Gram stain, biochemical
      identification and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing. The FilmArray Blood Culture
      Identification (BioFire, USA) is an example of a rapid panel-based molecular assay that
      combines nesting and multiplexing of PCR (nested multiplex PCR) to detect multiple pathogens
      simultaneously. There are limited data on how such tests impact patient management, health
      care costs and how they can better be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms.

      The aim of this study is to assess the added value and acceptability of a multiplexed
      molecular diagnostic assay in the identification of pathogens in patients presenting with
      bacteremia at hospitals in LMICs, and to assess health care providers' satisfaction with the
      assay.

      The study will address the following questions:

        1. What impact can we project if additional diagnostic information were to be provided to
           clinicians in terms of patient outcomes, costs, and antibiotic use?

        2. What are the workflow constraints on returning diagnostic results to clinicians and/or
           antibiotic stewardship programs? Overall, the aim is to assess the added value and
           acceptability of a multiplexed molecular diagnostic assay in the identification of
           pathogens in patients presenting with bacteremia at hospitals in LMICs and to assess
           health care providers' satisfaction with the assay.
