  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of
      pembrolizumab and idelalisib in NSCLC patients whose disease has stopped responding to immune
      therapy. This study is being done to see if adding another immune modulator (idelalisib) to
      standard pembrolizumab will increase response rates, compared to the response seen with
      pembrolizumab alone.

      This is a phase 1b/2 study to determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of
      pembrolizumab and idelalisib in NSCLC patients whose disease has stopped responding to immune
      therapy. Pembrolizumab is an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy that is given intravenously and is
      approved for treatment of malignant NSCLC. Idelalisib is the first-in-class oral PI3K-Î´
      inhibitor that is approved for treatment of certain forms of leukemia and lymphoma.

      Immune checkpoint inhibitors (such as anti-PD-1) are effective in treating NSCLC as a single
      agent, but overall response isn't optimal; overall response rates (ORR) are only ~20% on
      average. The goal of this study is to see whether combining standard therapy with additional
      immune modulators will increase response rates, compared to the response seen with
      pembrolizumab monotherapy.

    <intervention_model_description>This is an open labeled, single arm, interventional study combining standard pembrolizumab (MK-3475, trade name: Keytruda) with investigational agent, idelalisib (trade name: Zydelig) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study will enroll patients in two phases: a dose finding/tolerability assessment phase and an efficacy assessment phase.
The Phase 1b (modified 3+3 dose escalation) assessment will determine the safe dose of idelalisib in combination with pembrolizumab that down-regulates the activity of T-regulatory function (Treg).
The Phase 2 efficacy assessment will enroll patients to detect whether idelalisib added to pembrolizumab at the phase 2 recommended dose (P2RD) will result in further objective response.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Modified 3+3 dose escalation design will be used to determine whether the addition of idelalisib to standard pembrolizumab is safe and tolerable in checkpoint inhibitor refractory NSCLC patients. An initial cohort of 3 patients will receive 50 mg twice daily idelalisib with standard pembrolizumab. If none of the 3 patients develop a DLT, another 3 patients will be enrolled. Dose will be escalated or de-escalated based on the occurrence of DLTs. All events will be assessed for possible, probable, or definite relation to idelalisib.</description>

    <description>Determine the phase 2 recommended dose (P2RD) of idelalisib, in combination with pembrolizumab, in patients with checkpoint inhibitor refractory NSCLC. If no more than 1/6 patients in initial cohort develop a DLT, the patients will be tested for T-regulatory cell function suppression (80% suppression in 80% of patients). If dose is escalated or de-escalated, testing will continue to assess for optimal T-reg suppression. The dose at which the tolerability and suppression criteria are both met will be declared the P2RD and the study will proceed to phase 2.</description>
