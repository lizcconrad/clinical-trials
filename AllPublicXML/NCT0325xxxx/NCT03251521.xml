  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to analyze which step of the procedure of toxin botulinum injection
      is the most painful between skin break-in, electric stimulation, injection and needle
      withdrawal.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-stroke spasticity management by botulinum toxin injections may be limited by pain or
      discomfort at the injection side.

      Particularly tracking by electrostimulation, but also skin puncture, toxin injection or
      needle withdrawal may be painful.

      The objective of this study is to define an individual injection strategy in order to limit
      pain.
