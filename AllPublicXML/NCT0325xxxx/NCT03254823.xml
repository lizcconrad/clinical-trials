      This study investigates whether there is an immune response directed against gut microbes or
      food and parts of the body in severe Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
      (ME/CFS) patients.

    <textblock>
      Severe Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) patients will be
      identified by Epsom and St Helier CFS Service and the Clinical Research Network Eastern.
      Information sheets will be posted by health professionals to eligible patients. Interested
      patients are asked to arrange a telephone call with the research team to receive more
      information about the study. Volunteers still interested after the 72 hour consideration
      period arrange a home visit to be taken through the consenting process.

      Household controls will be recruited through patients participating in the study. Patients
      invited will be provided with information about household controls. The patient identifies
      and informs potential household controls of the study using information sheets provided by
      their health professional. Household controls willing to participate in the study will be
      taken through an eligibility questionnaire with GCP trained researchers.

      Six stool and blood samples will be collected over the three year study period. Stool and
      blood samples need to be collected within 24 hours of each other, during home visits. 48 hour
      food diaries will be completed prior to each stool sample collection.

      The study is based at the Quadram Institute and the University of East Anglia (UEA). The
      research is funded by the UEA and Invest in ME Research UK.

        Severe ME/CFS patient attending Epsom and St Helier CFS Clinic will be identified by the
        Director of the clinic, Dr Bansal. CRN Eastern will notify general practitioners and
        occupational therapists of the study. They will then identify severe ME/CFS patients in the
        East of England.

        Household controls will be recruited through severe ME/CFS patients participating in the
        study.
