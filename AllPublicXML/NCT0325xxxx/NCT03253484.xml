  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential clinical effect of targeting
      surgical wounds in all three wound healing phases by non ablative fractional laser (NAFL) to
      reduce scar formation in a randomized controlled trial. Thus, NAFL will be applied during 1)
      inflammation phase (0-3 days) as represented by NAFL-treatment adjacent to surgical wounding,
      2) proliferation phase (4-21 days) by NAFL-treatment immediately after suture removal and 3)
      remodeling phase (21 days-1 year) by NAFL-treatment six weeks after surgery.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, assessor - blinded, intra-individual trial
      comparing laser exposed skin lesions to untreated control skin lesions in a split scar set-up
      to investigate efficacy. The study will be performed on patients undergoing an excision at
      Bispebjerg Dermatological Department. One randomly allocated part of each included wound will
      receive three NAFL-treatments and the other part will serve as untreated control wound. Scars
      will be evaluated clinically on-site by blinded evaluator immediately before third treatment
      and 3 months after NAFL-treatments. The clinical data will be supplemented by blinded
      photo-evaluation, patients' evaluation and non-invasive measurements.
