  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2-year research plan will test the Put It Out Project (POP) in a pilot randomized trial
      (N=120) compared to TSP and two historical control conditions. Participants will be young
      adults who smoke, identify as sexual or gender minorities, and use Facebook. The primary
      outcome will be biochemically verified 7-day abstinence from smoking at 3 and 6 months.
      Secondary outcomes will be a quit attempt (y/n), stage of change, and thoughts about tobacco
      abstinence at 3 and 6 mos.

  <detailed_description>

      Participants will be randomized to one of two conditions: (1) a Facebook-delivered
      intervention addressing tobacco use, tailored to SGM young adults; or (2) a 3-month Facebook
      intervention targeting tobacco use. Both interventions will include 90 days of Facebook-based
      messages and activities tailored to participants' readiness to quit smoking.

      Assessments will occur at baseline, 3, and 6 months follow-up. Assessments will include
      measures on smoking, thoughts about abstinence, and SGM identity experiences. All
      participants who report no past 7-day smoking will be asked to give biochemical verification
      of smoking status with saliva cotinine test kits that will be mailed to participants.
