  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various factors affect the performance of the heart: The contractile properties of myocardial
      muscle cells are the fundamental devices for translating tension-generation and shortening of
      the cardiac muscle into pressure-generation and blood volume ejection from the heart into the
      body. On the other hand, the performance of heart can be analyzed with respect to input and
      output of blood to/from the hollow cardiac muscle and evaluated in terms of the performance
      of a pump: With every heartbeat blood is sucked from a low-pressure system (veins) and pumped
      to the arterial high-pressure system via one-way valves, whereas efficiency, ejected blood
      volume, blood flow and pressures are linked by hemodynamic laws.

      Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the &quot;gold standard technique&quot; to determine cardiac
      function and muscle mass, as well as for non-invasive diagnosis of myocardial
      necrosis/fibrosis. Furthermore, new CMR imaging techniques enabling the measurement of
      myocardial magnetic relaxation times for characterization of myocardial morphology and the
      acquisition of time-resolved, three-dimensional blood flow velocity fields in the heart and
      surrounding vessels, represent promising tools for the evaluation of the interaction between
      myocardial morphology and cardiac function.

      Aim of this explorative study is to 1. identify myocardial pathology-associated blood flow
      patterns in the heart and surrounding great vessels, and 2. correlate characteristic blood
      flow patterns in the heat (existence of vortices, vorticity, vortex formation, propagation
      dynamics …) with myocardial injuries.

        Patients referred to CMR investigation. If suitable and inclusion criteria are met, the
        patient will be asked if she/he is interested in participating in this study. Participation
        means, that aside from the respective routine CMR protocol, additional images will be taken
        within the investigation resulting in 15-20 minutes extra investigation time.
