  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period cross-over study in
      asthma patients. The study will consist of a screening epoch, followed by a treatment epoch
      which consists of three treatment periods, and will conclude with an end of study epoch.

      Each subject will be assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and will sequentially receive the
      investigational products and placebo during the trial.

             year prior to screening and who additionally meet the following criteria:

        Patients receiving daily treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid up to the maximum dose
        per day (as indicated in the package leaflet), on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks
        prior to screening.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 50 % and ≤ 90% of the predicted normal value for the patient
             during screening.

          -  Patients who demonstrate an increase in FEV1 of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after
             administration of 400 μg salbutamol/360 μg albuterol (or equivalent dose) at
             screening.

          -  Subjects must weigh at least 50 kg at screening to participate in the study, and must

        Sympathomimetic amines / adrenoceptor agonist agents Lactose or any of the other excipients
        of the study drug (including patients with history of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase
        deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption)

          -  Patients who have had an asthma attack/exacerbation requiring systemic steroids or
             hospitalization or emergency room visit within 6 weeks of screening.

          -  Patients who have had a respiratory tract infection or asthma worsening within 4 weeks
             prior to screening.

          -  Patients with a history of chronic lung diseases other than asthma

          -  Patients who have a decline in PEF from the reference PEF (taken at screening) of ≥30%
             for 5 of 6 consecutive scheduled PEF readings (readings taken at morning and evening)
             during at least 3 days of screening epoch prior to randomization.

          -  Patients who require the use of ≥12 puffs / 24 hours of rescue medication for 48 hours
             (over two consecutive days) during screening prior to randomization.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a
             positive hCG laboratory test.

          -  Patients with Type I diabetes or uncontrolled Type II diabetes (HbA1c &gt; 9%) at
             screening.

          -  Current smokers (urine cotinine &gt; than the laboratory's lowest level of quantification
             (LoQ of 500 ng/mL or lower)) and patients who have smoked or inhaled tobacco products
             within the 6 month period prior to screening, or who have a smoking history of greater
             than 10 pack years (Note: 1 pack is equivalent to 20 cigarettes. 10 pack years = 1
             pack /day x 10 yrs., or ½ pack/day x 20 yrs.).
