  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundreds patients with T2DM from the outpatient clinic of The First Affiliated Hospital
      of Chongqing Medical University will be enrolled in this study. Participating subjects will
      be randomly assigned into one of the 2 groups: Group A (n=100) will be placed on the
      short-term intensive education program alone while Group B (n=100) will be placed on the
      short-term intensive education as well as a holistic management for 6 months.

      Diabetes education: The patients of each group will undergo designated education programs in
      4 subgroups. Group A and B will be given the same education classes once a week in the first
      month (total 4 times), 5 hours per class. The education classes will be taught by a dedicated
      team of diabetes specialist doctors and nurses, with the contents including a basic
      understanding of diabetes, diabetic diet, exercise, drug treatments and blood glucose
      monitoring. At the conclusion of the education classes, the patients in Group B then will
      undergo a weekly telephone interview with specialist nurses for 6 months to help patients
      resolve self-management problems while patients in Group A will not. The specialist nurses
      will talk individually with the patients in Group B for 10-15 min per week. The nurses will
      ask the patients about their results of self-blood glucose monitoring, help them find the
      reasons of poor blood glucose control as well as answer the patient's questions.

      Clinical examination: All subjects will complete Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life
      (ADDQoL) before education classes commence (baseline), at 3 months and 6 months (endpoint)
      after education classes to evaluate their quality of life. All patients will be examined for
      height, weight, blood pressure, FPG, PPG and HbA1c at baseline, 3 months after education
      classes and endpoint. A diabetes specialist nurse will measure the height, weight and blood
      pressure, and assist the subjects to fill the questionnaire. FPG and PPG will be determined
      by the hexokinase method, while HbA1c by high performance liquid chromatography.
