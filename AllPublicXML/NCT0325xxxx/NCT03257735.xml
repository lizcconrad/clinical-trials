  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China, with 57 percent of
      patients being diagnosed at advanced stage. At present, advanced lung cancer has entered the
      era of precise treatment. So it is very important to determine the gene mutation status of
      the tumor and prescribe drugs at the targets. Liquid biopsy is a suitable alternative when
      tumor tissues are difficult to obtain. Liquid biopsy technique refers to the use of human
      body fluid as a sample source to detect the information of related diseases, including blood,
      urine, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. It is non-invasive, fast and simple, and can avoid the
      problem of insufficient sample size and support for repeated sampling to continuously monitor
      disease.

      With the increasing incidence of lung cancer and the development of diagnosis and treatment
      technology, the survival period of patients has been extended, and the incidence and
      diagnosis rate of the brain metastasis of lung cancer have increased year by year. The brain
      metastasis of lung cancer is the most common type of brain metastatic tumor. The incidence
      rate is about 40-50%, and the prognosis is poor——the natural median survival period is about
      1-2 months. Because of the impractical intracranial tumor biopsy and very low level of DNA in
      peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, which makes close contact with brain tumors, becomes
      potential available samples. Several studies have shown that genetic testing of cerebrospinal
      fluid is feasible. Therefore, this study aims to test the cerebrospinal fluid, blood and
      tissue by the latest second-generation sequencing technology at different time points, to
      dynamically monitor the gene mutation status of cerebrospinal fluid, blood and tissue, to
      explore the role of cerebrospinal fluid biopsy in the diagnosis and treatment of non-small
      cell lung cancer with brain metastases.

    <description>Patients' cerebrospinal fluid, blood and tumor tissue were collected within 3 days before treatment at diagnosis.
Patients' cerebrospinal fluid and blood were extracted at the time of first evaluation of efficacy after treatment (TKI began after 1 month or chemotherapy after 2 cycles).
Patients' cerebrospinal fluid and blood were extracted at first time of tumor progression，and re-biopsy of tumor tissue was done as much as possible.
All the samples were tested by next-generation sequencing.</description>
