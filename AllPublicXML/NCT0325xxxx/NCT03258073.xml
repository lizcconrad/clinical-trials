  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Uganda and many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, health providers have minimal training
      and intermittent opportunity to maintain skills in managing delivery complications and acute
      newborn and pediatric conditions. Interventions like effective resuscitation assistance at
      the time of birth are lifesaving. Every 30 second delay in establishing effective
      resuscitation at birth increases the risk of death by 16%. The purpose of this study is to
      test whether medical simulation can improve acute care skills and confidence related to
      maternal and pediatric care emergencies.

      A solid body of evidence now supports simulation-based learning as superior to didactic
      teaching and problem-based learning for the acquisition of critical assessment and management
      skills, particularly for clinical emergencies. Simulation-based training promotes skill
      acquisition and retention, enhances teamwork, and increases knowledge and understanding of
      key procedures. Simulation-based learning is now the norm in medical, nursing and paramedical
      training in most high income settings. There remains a critical need to operationalize
      simulation-based learning in resource-constrained settings

    <intervention_model_description>Investigators will conduct a cohort study among medical and nursing students and follow groups of students according to their rotation in the four major clinical disciplines. A cohort will represent a group of students who start a clinical rotation and complete their clinical year together. A total of 4 rotations exist concurrently every academic year in a year of study (Pediatrics, Internal medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics). During each rotation, a cohort will be exposed to at least 1 simulation scenario relevant to the discipline of the rotation. Investigators hypothesize that repeated exposure to simulation scenario execution will improve CTS scores. Therefore in this cohort study, investigators will measure CTS scores before and after exposure to simulation scenario training.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Skills using the Scenario-execution-group test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately Post scenario execution</time_frame>
    <description>This is a scenario specific score obtained from a multiple choice question (MCQ) test following execution of the scenario to measure. The MCQs are standard questions developed to accompany a given scenario. The maximum score is 100%. A scenario-execution-group test score of less than 60% will be a fail and a score of more than or equal to 60% will be a pass.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in knowledge scores at 4 months from Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge will be measured using multiple choice questions (MCQs) and Investigators will use the Retrospective pre-post survey (RPP survey) to assess performance confidence among participants. In the RPP, the participant is asked to compare their performance after the intervention with that before the intervention. This assessment removes the bias of over or underestimating how much the participant knew before the intervention.</description>

    <description>Study participants will be exposed to medical simulation using scenario execution. In this exercise, participants will be exposed to a scenario that simulates a medical emergency. They will be required to respond. Following their response, the participants will have a chance to share with the investigators their experiences and what they have learnt from the exposure in a debriefing session. The investigator will then provide feedback on their performance.</description>

    <description>Each team of students will be exposed to simulation two times in a semester totaling to four times a year. In a scenario execution, participants are placed in a simulated experience of a medical emergency. Participants are required to respond and their reactions are observed by the investigators. After the experience, participants will have a debriefing session to learn from their experience of handling this emergency.</description>
