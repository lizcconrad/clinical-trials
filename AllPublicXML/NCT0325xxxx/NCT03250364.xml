    <textblock>
      Despite different types of bandages are using in the lymphedema treatment, numerous of them
      have not been directly compared. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of five
      different kinds of bandages on limb volume and lymphedema-related symptoms. It was also
      measured as secondary variables the comfort of the bandage related by the participants and
      the directly cost of each kind of bandage during the treatment.

    <description>To assess the volume of the limb it will be used the circumference measurement. The assessment will be with the subject in upright position with the arm placed on a table, the forearm relaxed on the table, the shoulder in a neutral rotation, a flexion of 45ยบ of the elbow, and forearms in supine position. The reference will be the elbow fold where was measure the circumference of the limb in 5cm intervals. The circumference measurements will be converted into volume values with the truncated cone formula in each 5 centimeters long.</description>

    <description>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) + upper limb (UL) exercises + educational strategy + multilayer bandage consisting of three layers. The first was a 100% cotton tubular bandage which will be directly placed on the skin to prevent any injury (&quot;Tubinylex TM&quot;). The second layer is a paddle with the purpose of unify and increase pressure; and a final layer of short-stretch bandage of different sizes depending on the place of the upper limb (UL): 8 cm width for the forearm and 10 cm for the arm (&quot;ComprilanTM&quot;). All the bandage layers will be placed from caudal to cranial in a circular disposition, overlapping in one third the previous layer for a correctly cover of the limb and not to leave open spaces. The cotton tubular bandage and the short-stretch bandage could be cleaned without losing their material properties.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) + upper limb (UL) exercises + educational strategy + double compression bandage consisting of two layers, made up of a first rigid cotton bandage (11 cm X 4m &quot;MedicaTM&quot; 315 anti oedema; Thuasne, France) and a second elastic bandage (&quot;BiflexTM&quot; 16 light; Thuasne, France). The two layers will be placed caudal to cranial in a circular manner, overlapping in one third the previous layer. The elastic bandage have squares drawn to help to the physiotherapist to control the stretch they given to the bandage. The two bandages could be cleaning without losing their properties. If there was any oedema concentration or a fibrous place, a paddle pad will be put in these places (&quot;Mobiderm TM&quot;, Thuasne, France).</description>

    <description>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) + upper limb (UL) exercises + educational strategy + cohesive bandage consisting of a single short-stretched layer that will be put directly on the subject skin and stick on itself (&quot;Medi-Rip TM LF Hartmann&quot;, Germany. Measures: 7,5 cm x 4,5 m). It will be placed in a circular manner distal to cranial with a paddle pad in the elbow fold not to damage this moving part. This bandage will be reused twice in the same subject.</description>

    <description>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) + upper limb (UL) exercises + educational strategy + adhesive compression bandage consisting of an elastic bandage (&quot;BiplastTM&quot; Thuasne, France. Measures: 10cm x 2,5 m) which will put over a pre-tape bandage not to damage the skin. It will be placed in a circular disposition from distal to cranial. In each physiotherapy session, the bandage has to be replaced with a new one.</description>

    <description>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) + upper limb (UL) exercises + educational strategy + kinesiotaping bandage consisting of K-Active&quot; Tape. The k-tape will be pasted directly on the skin and put longitudinally in thin bands in a cranio-caudal disposition. The width of the bandage will be of 5cm, and will be cut in four bands that will cover all the upper limb cranial to caudal in a spiral way surrounded it. The bandage will be placed moving the limb into internal and external rotation for putting the skin in a little stretch without lengthen the tape.</description>

    <description>MLD using a modification of the strokes described by Leduc will be applied to lymphedema &quot;resorption&quot;. It will be included resorption maneuver in the oedematous areas of the affected limb, in cranial to caudal direction, since the physiotherapist seeing a change in the tissue qualities of the oedema. Then, the subjects will be received thirty minutes of Intermittent Pneumatic Compression (&quot;EureducTM&quot;) with a pression of 40 mmHg.</description>

    <description>After the bandage will be put, proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation exercises without resistance in two diagonal in asymmetrical reciprocal patterns with the affected limb will be taught. The first diagonal into flexion from hitch hike to swat fly, and into extension from swat fly to hitch hike, and the second diagonal from hand in opposite pocket to carry tray, and into extension from carry tray to hand in opposite pocket. These exercises must be done at home two times per day, ten repetitions each exercise.</description>
