  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired vitamin B12 (B12) status during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of birth
      defects and common complications (e.g. intrauterine growth restriction, neural tube defects),
      and possibly immune function impairment. The newborns and infants of B12-deficient mothers
      have low B12 stores at birth, further exacerbated by a very low concentration of B12 in
      breast milk that may hinder their growth and development. In regions such as Bangladesh, many
      women of reproductive age have inadequate B12 status, probably due to low intake of animal
      source food. Vitamin B12 intake and status in pregnancy and lactation is potentially
      insufficient to prevent impaired child development and immune function related to inadequate
      B12 status. The investigators hypothesize that prolonged vitamin B12 supplementation through
      fortified milk starting from early pregnancy up to 6 mo-postpartum will improve: (1)
      biomarkers of vitamin B12 status in mothers-infant pairs (2) vaccine specific adaptive
      immunity in infants; (3) neurological and cognitive function in infants.

      The investigators aim to conduct a double-blind, randomized trial, to investigate the effects
      of B12-fortified milk on maternal and infant B12 status, immune function and child
      development. Pregnant women (n=148) will be randomized to receive B12-fortified milk (100
      μg/day) or milk without fortification. The daily supplementation beginning at the baseline
      visit (GW 11-14) will continue until 6 mo-postpartum. Biomarkers of B12 status will be
      measured in mothers (GW 11-14 and 6-mo postpartum) and infants (3 and 6-mo). Infant
      development (6 and 12-mo) will be evaluated by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler
      Development. Immune responses will be measured in infant at 3 and 6-mo. Data on socioeconomic
      status, dietary diversity, and anthropometric indices will be recorded at baseline.
      Additional tests in mothers include screening for H. pylori and plasma gastrin.
