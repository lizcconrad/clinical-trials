  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of using autologous,
      engineered urethral constructs for the treatment of urethral strictures in adult males.

      The proposed study design is a prospective non-randomized and uncontrolled single-center
      investigation. Autologous urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), obtained
      from enrolled male subjects' bladder tissue samples, will be culture expanded in vitro and
      used to seed tubular PGA scaffolds to create autologous urethral constructs for the repair of
      urethral strictures.

      This is a Phase I clinical study to determine the safety and efficacy of using autologous,
      engineered urethral constructs for the treatment of urethral strictures in adult males.

      The proposed study design is a prospective non-randomized and uncontrolled single-center
      investigation. Autologous urothelial cells (UCs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), obtained
      from enrolled male subjects' bladder tissue samples, will be culture expanded in vitro and
      used to seed tubular Polyglycolic Acid (PGA) scaffolds to create autologous urethral
      constructs for the repair of urethral strictures.

      Male patients, aged 21-65 years old, seen in the Wake Forest Baptist Health urology clinic,
      referred to or self-referred to the study team, with recurrent urethral stricture, previously
      treated with dilation, internal urethrotomy, or urethroplasty, will be approached and offered
      consent to participate in in the trial. Up to 20 men may undergo screening procedures to
      identify 10 eligible subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible
      subjects will undergo full thickness bladder tissue biopsies at Wake Forest Baptist Medical
      Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to obtain UCs and SMCs, which will be cultured and
      expanded and then seeded on tubular PGA scaffolds. Approximately 6 weeks after biopsy, the
      subjects will return to undergo surgical removal of the stricture and implant of the urethral
      construct. Subjects will be followed through 36 months.

    <description>All subjects enrolled will undergo a full-thickness bladder biopsy as an out-patient surgical procedure. Urothelial and Smooth Muscle Cells recovered from the biopsy will be isolated and expanded over the next 4-6 weeks, and then seeded onto a tubular scaffold to create the autologous engineered urethral construct. Subjects will undergo a second surgical procedure to excise the urethral stricture and implant the urethral construct. All subjects will be followed for 3 years for safety and efficacy.</description>

                  least 6 months prior to study.

               2. Urethral stricture of 10-60 mm in length, as determined by urethrography.

               3. Contains at least 1 strictured segment through which a 16 Fr flexible cystoscope
                  cannot be atraumatically passed.

          2. Patients must be available for all follow-up visits.

          3. Ability to speak English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following is regarded as a criterion for excluding a subject from the study:

          1. Strictures of the meatus or prostatic urethra; any urethral stricture associated with
             or suspected to be urethral carcinoma, or strictures due to pelvic distraction
             injuries. Strictures &lt;10 mm or &gt;60 mm, as determined by urethrography, and criteria
             for bulbar urethral strictures excluding those with strictures &lt;20 mm and &gt;60 mm, as
             described by urethrography.
