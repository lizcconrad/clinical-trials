  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability based on the incidence of adverse
      experiences of buprenorphine sublingual spray (0.5 mg three times daily [TID]) compared with
      standard post-operative narcotic therapy in participants with postoperative pain. Standard
      post-operative narcotic therapy is defined as morphine intravenous injection (IV) (4 mg TID)
      followed by oxycodone hydrochloride tablet (10 mg TID).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product during the course of a clinical investigation. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not thought to be related to the investigational product. A TEAE is an AE with onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

             acetaminophen, aspirin, opioids, or any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs);
             history of NSAID-induced bronchospasm (participants with the triad of asthma, nasal
             polyps, and chronic rhinitis are at greater risk for bronchospasm and should be

             day of surgery.

          2. Has experienced any surgical complications or other issues that, in the investigator's
             opinion, could compromise the participant's safety if he or she continues into
             randomized treatment or could confound the results of the study.

          3. Has a known or suspected history of alcoholism or drug abuse or misuse within 2 years
             of Screening or evidence of opioid tolerance or physical dependence before dosing with

          4. Has any clinically significant unstable cardiac, respiratory, neurological,
             immunological, hematological, or renal disease, or any other condition that, in the
             investigator's opinion, could compromise the participant's welfare, ability to
             communicate with the study staff, or otherwise contraindicate study participation.

          5. Has long QT Syndrome, a family history of long QT Syndrome, or is taking Class IA or
             Class III antiarrhythmic medications

          6. Has a history or current diagnosis of a significant psychiatric disorder that, in the
             investigator's opinion, would affect the participant's ability to comply with the
             study requirements.

          7. Has tested positive either on the urine drug screen or on the alcohol Breathalyzer
             test. Participants who test positive at Screening only and can produce a prescription
             in their name from their physician for the medication producing the positive test may

             the investigator's opinion has significant periodontal disease of the oral cavity. In
             addition, recent (within 1 year) piercing of the tongue or anywhere in the oral
             cavity.

         10. Has a surgical or medical condition of the GI or renal system that, in the
             investigator's opinion, might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, or
             excretion of any drug substance.

         11. Is considered by the investigator, for any reason (including, but not limited to, the
             risks described as precautions, warnings, and contraindications in the current version
             of the investigator's brochure for Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray), to be an
             unsuitable candidate to receive the study drug.

         12. Is receiving systemic chemotherapy, has an active malignancy of any type, or has been
             diagnosed with cancer within 5 years before Screening (excluding squamous or basal
             cell carcinoma of the skin).

         13. Is currently receiving anticoagulants (eg, heparin or warfarin). Low-dose aspirin for
             cardioprotection is allowed.

         14. Has used drugs known to be a strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 within 1 week
             before surgery.

             allowed).

         16. Has a history of chronic use (defined as daily use for &gt;2 weeks) of NSAIDs, opiates,
             or glucocorticoids (except inhaled nasal steroids and topical corticosteroids) within
             1 month before study drug administration. Aspirin at a daily dose of ≤325 mg is
             allowed for cardiovascular prophylaxis if the participant has been on a stable dose
             regimen for ≥30 days before Screening and has not experienced any relevant medical
             problem.

         17. Has a significant renal or hepatic disease, as indicated by clinical laboratory
             assessment (results ≥3 × the upper limit of normal [ULN] for any liver function test,
             including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate
             dehydrogenase, or creatinine ≥1.5 × ULN).

         18. Has any clinically significant laboratory or 12-lead electrocardiogram finding at
             Screening that in the investigator's opinion contraindicates study participation.

         19. Has screening systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg
             (may be repeated one additional time after 5 minutes rest to verify). The investigator
             may, at his discretion, choose to exclude participants with hypertensive levels lower
             than these if he deems it in the best interest of the participant.

         20. Has a history of sleep apnea or other obstructive airway disease.

         21. Has a history of nausea and vomiting with buprenorphine products.

         22. Has significant difficulties swallowing capsules or is unable to tolerate oral
             medication.

         23. Previously participated in another clinical study of Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray or
             received any investigational drug or device or investigational therapy within 30 days
             before Screening.

        Post-surgical eligibility requirements:

        The participant will be assessed for the following postoperative eligibility criteria

          1. Participants must be awake, breathing spontaneously without significant respiratory
             depression.

          2. Participants must not be actively vomiting or complaining of severe nausea.
