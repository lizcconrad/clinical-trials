      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of BI
      685509 in healthy male subjects following oral administration of multiple rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics
      (PD) of BI 685509 in healthy Chinese and Japanese subjects.
