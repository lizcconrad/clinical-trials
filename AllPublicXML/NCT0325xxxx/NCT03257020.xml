      spectral domain optical coherence tomography, SD-OCT, (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg,
      Germany) is a widely used commercial device in ophthalmology field. For a long time, retinal
      nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured with OCT to detect and follow up glaucoma
      patients. Bruch's membrane opening - minimum rim width (BMO-MRW) is relatively new parameter
      which measures the minimum distance between Bruch's membrane opening to internal limiting
      membrane (ILM). BMO-MRW,a new parameter, is known to have better diagnostic performance than
      RNFL thickness and recently, many researches has been performed on this new parameter. SD-OCT
      can measure RNFL thickness and BMO-MRW at the same time. The test procedure is not different
      from RNFL thickness measurement but only software implemented in OCT device calculates
      BMO-MRW as well as RNFL thickness. The investigators are going to compare these two
      parameters and find out the relationship between two parameters.

    <description>SD-OCT was performed to all subjects to measure BMO-MRW and RNFL thickness by trained glaucoma specialist. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes. The foveal location was manually detected with a live B-scan, followed by defining BMO center. A radial pattern containing 24 angular, equidistant, high-resolution 15° B-scans centered on the BMO was used to compute the neuroretinal rim parameters. The BMO points and ILM were identified and marked in each B-scan with automated software (Glaucoma Module Premium Edition, version 6.0; Heidelberg Engineering). After radial scan completed, 3 consecutive circumpapillary B-scans were followed to measure RNFL thickness at diameter of 3.5, 4.1 and 4.7mm. BMO-MRW and RNFL thickness was automatically computed globally and sectorally.</description>
