    <description>Participant satisfaction will be assessed using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire- an 8-item self-report measure on which patients will rate their satisfaction with treatment on a 4-item Likert scale. Values will be summed for a total satisfaction rating (range 8-32), with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. Participants will complete the CSQ at week 4 and week 8, and the CSQ ratings from the treatment-as-usual will be subtracted from the ratings following the MedMinder &quot;Jon&quot; electronic pillbox phase as a measure of change in participant satisfaction.</description>
