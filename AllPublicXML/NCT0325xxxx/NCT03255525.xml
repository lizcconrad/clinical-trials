  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite DFM being a widely-used technique and the empirical grounding regarding the
      importance of the pressure applied, there is no study characterizing the pressure applied
      during DFM, remaining it a discretion of the physiotherapist. Additionally, it is not known
      how the amount of pressure applied may influence pain mechanisms and, consequently how it
      affects the time needed promote an analgesic response.

      Having this, our general objective is to establish a dose-response relationship between the
      pressure applied during DFM and time of onset of analgesia, in the asymptomatic patellar
      tendon.
