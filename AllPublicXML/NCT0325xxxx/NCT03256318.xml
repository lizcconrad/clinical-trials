  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten year longitudinal survey following children who have participated in CKRI Sports and
      Recreation from a young age (5 to 8), and the parents of children who have participated in
      CKRI Sports and Recreation at a young age (5 to 8). These children will be followed for 10
      years with surveys every 6 months, whether they are currently participating in sports and
      recreation activities or not.

      The purpose of this longitudinal study is to examine the effects of early participation in
      organized sports and recreation activities (S&amp;R) on self-reported health and health-related
      quality of life of children and youth (C&amp;Y) with disabilities and their parent-reported
      social participation. This project will examine child and parent reported differences
      between:

        1. C&amp;Y who participate in CKRI S&amp;R and those who have discontinued participation in CKRI
           S&amp;R programs

        2. C&amp;Y who participate in sports vs. those who participate in recreation, and

        3. C&amp;Y who participate in CKRI S&amp;R and normative data on C&amp;Y with disabilities and those
           without disabilities.
