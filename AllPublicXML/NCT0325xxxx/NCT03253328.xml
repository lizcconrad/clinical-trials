  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot clinical study the investigators propose to conduct a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial for 30 days for participants with critical
      limb ischemia (CLI) who undergo a major (above-knee or below-knee) lower extremity
      amputation. By exploring the primary endpoints we aim to determine whether NAC can affect
      amputation stump perfusion and healing. Based on preclinical data, the investigators
      hypothesize that NAC will augment both amputation stump perfusion as well as healing. The
      investigators will utilize the data from this trial to determine the true effect size that is
      necessary for a larger clinical trial to determine the clinical efficacy of NAC is healing
      surgical sites such as major lower extremity amputation stumps.

    <textblock>
      In this pilot clinical study the investigators propose to conduct a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, in 50 participants with CLI who have
      undergone a major (above-knee or below-knee) lower extremity amputation. 25 participants will
      receive NAC 1200mg intravenously twice a day for 6 consecutive days following amputation. 25
      participants will receive placebo saline intravenous infusion twice a day for 6 days
      following amputation. Post-amputation participants will be monitored for specific
      anthropometric parameters and stump perfusion assessments (using laser-assisted fluorescent
      angiography and transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement). The primary study endpoints are
      to determine if lower extremity stump healing and perfusion are affected by perioperative NAC
      administration. A secondary endpoint will be to determine the effect size that would be
      necessary to power a larger clinical trial to determine whether NAC treatment can affect
      tissue perfusion and healing at major lower extremity amputation stumps in participants with
      CLI.

    <measure>Stump Healing using the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>A validated scoring algorithm used to determine the degree to which a wound has successfully healed. We will use a modified version of this tool and score the following parameters: amputation stump skin color, epithelialization, amount and type of exudate, and the size and type of necrotic eschar tissue. Each feature was evaluated on a 1 through 5 scoring system, with lower scores indicating best healing, and higher scores indicating poor healing. Participants are given an overall aggregate score, with higher scores indicating poor healing. These measurements are taken at the participant's first clinical follow up appointment.</description>
