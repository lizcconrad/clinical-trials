  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study hypothesizes that early-onset neonatal Infections are related to premature rupture
      of membrane (PROM) and that early intervention can improve the prognosis of newborns. The
      objective of this study is to analyze the correlation between PROM and early-onset neonatal
      infections and to assess the prognosis of newborns. A cohort study is designed to implement
      the study. The subjects of study group are pregnant women who are diagnosed as PROM or
      chorioamnionitis and whose gestational age is ≥ 24 weeks. The subjects of control group are
      pregnant women without PROM and chorioamnionitis. Control group and research group are paired
      at 1: 1 ratio. The main contents of the study include three aspects. (1) The correlation
      between PROM and chorioamnionitis. (2) The correlation between PROM and early-onset neonatal
      infections. (3) The pathogenesis of intrauterine infection and neonatal infection.
