  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the efficacy of the MovinCog Intervention to enhance cognitive
      abilities in children 7-15 yrs. The intervention consists of two parts: a physical exercise
      regimen, based on high-intensity training, and a cognitive training component. The design
      will contrast the intervention with an active control group, matched for expectancy effects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specifically, the investigators will compare both components together (exercise and cognitive
      training) against either one of the components (exercise alone, or cognitive training alone)
      and against an active control group. The study will include measures of scholastic aptitude,
      as well as of working memory and cognitive control (primary outcome measures), two cognitive
      abilities that are critical to daily life activities, and that respond well to training. In
      addition, the investigators will measure physiological responses to training, to monitor
      changes associated with exercise (secondary outcome measures). Finally, the investigators
      will relate training-specific improvements with transfer gains, to better model the
      interaction between training and transfer. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of
      the dynamics associated with the intervention.

    <description>This intervention includes a combination of high-intensity exercise (10min/day) and computerized cognitive training (20min/day). The software for the latter has been developed by our group, and includes 8 mini-games targeting different cognitive abilities. Both are developed for the MovinCog intervention. The intervention is personalized, based on individual performance.</description>
