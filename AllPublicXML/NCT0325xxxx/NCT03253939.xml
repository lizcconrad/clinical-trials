  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer associated peritoneal carcinomatosis has a poor prognosis with a median
      survival of less than one year. Systemic chemotherapy including targeted agents has not been
      found to significantly increase the survival in Gastric cancer associated peritoneal
      carcinomatosis. Since recurrent gastric cancer remains confined to the abdominal cavity in
      many patients, regional therapies like aggressive cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been investigated for Gastric cancer associated peritoneal
      carcinomatosis. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been used for three indications
      in Gastric Cancer- as an adjuvant therapy after a curative surgery, hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival and reduce peritoneal
      recurrences in many randomised trials in Asian countries; as a definitive treatment in
      established PC, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy along with cytoreductive surgery is
      the only therapeutic modality that has resulted in long-term survival in select groups of
      patients. While the results of randomised trials of adjuvant hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy from western centres are awaited, the role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy in the treatment of Gastric cancer associated peritoneal carcinomatosis is still
      evolving and needs larger studies before it is accepted as a standard of care.
