  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rise of oral anticancer drugs favors outpatient care but exposes patients to new risks
      compared to injectable chemotherapy at hospital: non-adherence to treatment, inappropriate
      management of side effects and interactions with other co-prescribed drugs. Latrogenic risk
      of these treatments is reinforced in older patients with frequent comorbidities, taking
      multiple pharmaceutical treatments for long periods and followed by several prescribers.

      The literature reports an emergence of drug related problems (DRP) in more than 90% of
      patients, with an average number of 0 to 4 per patient. The clinical consequences (reduced
      efficacy and potentiation of toxicity) are all the more important that outpatient monitoring
      of treatments prescribed at the hospital remains underdeveloped due to default of
      coordination between these two settings.

      Medical care and prevention of these DRP are difficult because of a lack of information and
      tools shared between hospital and liberal actors. Experiments are developed according to
      different organizational models, frequently focused on the pharmaceutical analysis of
      prescriptions, the detection of DRP and their control, but they stay still undervalued. In
      this context, the French Society of Oncological Pharmacology (SFPO - Société Française de
      Pharmacie Oncologique) provides to hospital and ambulatory care pharmacists the Oncolien
      website and proposes to assess the impact of a program of pharmaceutical interventions named
      DROP. The hypothesis of the study is that the DROP program will secure the medical care of
      patients with oral anticancer drugs compared to the usual care.
