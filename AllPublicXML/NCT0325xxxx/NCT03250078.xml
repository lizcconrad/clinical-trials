  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to explore the relationship between new-onset diabetes
      mellitus and a subsequent diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and
      Magnetic cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) will be utilized to screen for early stage
      pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions. Individuals with a strong family history or genetic
      predisposition to pancreatic cancer will also be included. Participants will be asked to
      donate a blood sample at specific intervals for the creation of a bio-bank necessary for the
      development of a blood based screening test for Pancreatic Cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals between 50-80 years of age who have developed diabetes mellitus within the
      preceding year or who have a family history of pancreatic cancer will be recruited through
      the offices of primary care physicians and endocrinologists. Those meeting initial criteria
      will meet with a research nurse and will undergo a secondary screen to determine eligibility.
      Individuals enrolled in the study will undergo a ten-minute psychological survey and donation
      of a blood sample for bio-bank analysis every 6 months for 3 years. MRI will be performed
      annually for 3 years (4 in total). Any abnormalities on MRI will be reviewed by a
      multi-disciplinary tumor board and discussed with the participant. The costs of MRI will be
      covered by the study.
