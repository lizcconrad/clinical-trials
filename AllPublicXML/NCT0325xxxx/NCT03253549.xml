  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SMArTVIEW program evaluates the use of remote, automated monitoring in hospital and at
      home, on patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgery, to determine the effect on
      the 45-day risk of hospital readmission and emergency department visits. Half of participants
      will receive the SMArTVIEW intervention of increased monitoring, while the other half will
      receive standard care after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SMArTVIEW is an eHealth-enabled service delivery program that combines remote automated
      monitoring, education, and self-management training. SMArTVIEW is a two-stage intervention
      program. Stage 1 supports seniors after cardiac or major vascular surgery in hospital on the
      surgical unit (post-ICU). Participants are assigned automated, cableless, vital sign
      monitoring devices that are worn during their entire stay on the surgical unit (blood
      pressure cuff, respiration pod, and oxygen saturation probe). Any signs of deterioration are
      sent via handheld device to the primary care nurse for early intervention.

      With a view to seamless transition home, Stage 2 supports these individuals at home during
      the first 30 days of recovery. Participants are sent home with Bluetooth enabled monitoring
      equipment including a tablet, blood pressure cuff, thermometer, pulse oximeter and weight
      scale. From home, the tablet uploads patients' vital signs and measurements automatically and
      sends them, via secure cloud infrastructure, to the SMArTVIEW Nurse on the surgical ward back
      at the hospital. The tablet interface also prompts patients to respond to brief, easy to
      read, daily surveys in order to inform the nurse about their status. The tablet also supports
      secure daily video visits and daily interaction with the nurse for postoperative assessment
      and support, surgical wound photographs, as well as patient access to customized educational
      materials.
