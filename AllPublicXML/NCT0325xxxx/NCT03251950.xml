  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food insecurity increases the risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. American
      Indians (AIs) in Oklahoma are three times as likely as Whites to be food-insecure (21% vs.
      7%) and have burdens of obesity (42%), hypertension (38%), and diabetes (15%) that exceed
      those of the general US population. While individual-level obesity prevention efforts have
      been implemented with AIs, few environmental interventions to reduce food insecurity and
      improve fruit and vegetable intake have been conducted with tribal communities. Community
      gardening interventions have been shown to increase vegetable and fruit intake, reduce food
      insecurity, and lower BMI among children and adults; however, to date, no such interventions
      have been evaluated with AI families. The proposed study, entitled &quot;Food Equity Resource and
      Sustainability for Health (FRESH),&quot; will assess the impact of a tribally-initiated community
      gardening intervention on vegetable and fruit intake, food insecurity, BMI, and blood
      pressure in families living on the Osage Nation reservation in Oklahoma.

      The intervention will take place in the inaugural year of Osage Nation's Bird Creek Farm and
      Community Gardens, where 120 garden plots will be allocated to participating reservation
      families. The study is guided by the principles of community-based participatory research
      (CBPR) and the Indigenous food sovereignty movement, which seeks to revitalize seasonal
      growing and gathering practices and reverse the tide of unhealthy eating caused by the
      historical loss of tribal lands.

      Aims and Methods: Led by an AI (Choctaw) Investigator, the study will:

      Aim #1: Characterize the Osage Nation reservation's food environment by using both objective
      and perceived measures, and then examine the relationships between these measures and intake
      of vegetables and fruits, food insecurity, BMI, hypertension, and diabetes.

      Aim #2: Develop a culturally relevant community gardening intervention and conduct a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate its efficacy in increasing vegetable and fruit
      intake and reducing food insecurity, BMI, and blood pressure among Osage families.

      Aim #3: Create and disseminate a Web- based multimedia manual and documentary film, and
      evaluate their effectiveness in increasing tribal readiness and capacity to improve local
      food environments.

      Innovation: The proposed study will be the first RCT ever conducted of a community gardening
      intervention, as well as the first community gardening intervention with AI families. The
      study will also be one of the first environmental interventions o simultaneously address
      healthy food production, access, preference, and intake among AIs.

      Significance and Impact: The community gardening intervention will be developed as part of a
      larger Osage Nation initiative on food security and food sovereignty and as such, is likely
      to be sustainable if it proves effective. Research findings and products will be disseminated
      to AI/AN communities nationwide and will help to identify environmental strategies that will
      improve tribal food environments and the health and quality of life of AI families.
