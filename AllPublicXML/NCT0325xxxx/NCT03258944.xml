  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In several diseases in which muscle weakness is a determining factor for morbidity and
      mortality, inspiratory muscle training has been shown to be useful in improving the function
      of ventilatory muscles, delaying or minimizing the development of complications due to the
      reduction of inspiratory muscle strength.

      The breath-stacking technique emerges as an easily applicable alternative, and it can be used
      in poorly collaborative patients. The technique described in the literature aims to increase
      pulmonary volumes.

      This gain occurs with the coupling of a silicone mask on the patient's face, a unidirectional
      valve and with the expiratory branch occluded. Thus, inspirations occur sequentially in this
      medium, generating pulmonary hyperinflation and increasing the contractility power of the
      expiratory muscles, which are fundamental for coughing. This hyperinflation also improves the
      peripheral air distribution in the lungs by increasing intrathoracic pressure.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the breath-stacking (BS) technique
      on the ventilatory muscle strength of young and healthy individuals.

      Initially, participants will be submitted to a learning session on the evaluation of
      ventilatory muscle strength and the breath-stacking technique. Between 24-72 hours after the
      learning, the evaluation of the muscular muscular strength will be performed through the
      maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and the maximum expiratory pressure (MEP). PI max will be
      measured from a maximum expiration; While PE max will be measured from a maximum inspiration,
      using a digital manovacuometer (MVD 300®)

    <description>Participants will be seated, with their elbows resting on the table, holding the face mask attached to a T-tube and a one-way valve. They will be instructed to inspire and force the expiration inside the mask. The training will be conducted three times a week for a period of four weeks, totaling twelve sessions. The breath-stacking application protocol will consist of three three-minute series, with a three-minute recovery interval between each series, obtaining a total time of fifteen minutes in each session</description>
