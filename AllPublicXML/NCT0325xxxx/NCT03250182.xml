  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I open-label, single center study to assess the PK and safety of BGF MDI
      320/14.4/9.6 µg in subjects with moderate to severe COPD. Pharmacokinetics will be assessed
      following a single dose administration on the first treatment day (Day 1) and will be
      assessed again after 7 days of repeat dosing. This study includes a Screening Period of up to
      28 days and a single Treatment Period of 8 days. A follow-up phone call will be conducted at
      least 5 days but no longer than 7 days after the last dose of study drug.
