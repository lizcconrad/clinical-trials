      This is a single center open-label pilot clinical trial of patients 1-70 years of age with
      greater than 6 seizures per month diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,
      Tuberous Sclerosis, or focal seizures. Twenty patients will be enrolled and treated with a
      stable dose of orally administered turmeric oil daily for 3 months. Patients and caregivers
      will be asked to keep a seizure diary logging all clinical events during the course of the
      study. Serum comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count with differential, and
      antiseizure medication levels, will be monitored at baseline, 1.5 months, and at the end of 3
      months.
