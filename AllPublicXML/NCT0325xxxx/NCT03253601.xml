  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to rehabilitation interventions is associated with functional outcomes (e.g.
      independence in daily activities, return of motor function) after stroke. Low adherence to
      rehabilitation home programs is common after stroke. Interventions delivered via mobile
      health applications demonstrated positive effects on adherence to health behaviors (e.g.
      medication routines, smoking cessation). The investigators developed the iADAPTS mobile
      application to support adherence to Strategy Training. Strategy Training is an iterative
      rehabilitation intervention the promotes goal setting, planning, and self-monitoring after
      stroke. This study examines the effects of the iADAPTS mobile health application relative to
      a workbook on adherence to Strategy Training after stroke.
