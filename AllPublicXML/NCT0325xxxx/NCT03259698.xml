  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of traditional prevention efforts based on behavior change and condom use,
      Ontario has seen over 700 new HIV infections annually over the past 10 years. Post-exposure
      prophylaxis (PEP) is one such approach, in which uninfected persons use 28 days of
      antiretroviral medications (ARVs) shortly after an HIV exposure to minimize the risk of
      acquiring HIV. PEP is highly efficacious, is considered a standard of care intervention based
      on medical and ethical grounds, and is supported by treatment guidelines. Yet several
      implementation challenges have limited its clinical and public health impact in Ontario,
      where no formal PEP policy exists. Our proposal seeks to optimize two aspects of delivering
      PEP for sexual exposures (nPEP). Results will inform the development of a standardized
      approach to nPEP both province-wide and elsewhere.

      Thus study has pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial using a 2x2 factorial
      design to determine whether the proportion of nPEP patients that successfully complete
      follow-up:

        1. is higher among those receiving mobile phone-based text messaging support than among
           those receiving standard care; and

        2. is non-inferior among those receiving care from a sexual health clinic nurse compared to
           those receiving hospital-based physician care.

      The prospective, randomized, non-blinded, 2x2 factorial trial that will enroll 358 study
      participants in Toronto and Ottawa. In Intervention A, we will randomize half of study
      participants to a text messaging support service ('WelTel'), in which a trained,
      community-based research staff person provides standardized weekly 'check-in' messages during
      their 12-week course of PEP follow-up. The other half will receive standard care, which does
      not include any form of active outreach or reminders outside of scheduled appointments. In
      Intervention B, we will randomize half of participants to receive nurse-led care for PEP
      follow-up at a local sexual health clinic; the other half will receive standard care by a
      hospital-based ID physician. The specific activities for each follow-up visit will be clearly
      defined in a medical directive. In keeping with Ontario legislation on medical directives,
      nurses will review cases with their authorizing physician or nurse practitioner on a routine
      basis.
