  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this project was to implement Vitalize 360, a comprehensive assessment
      system and wellness coaching program for vulnerable, low income, community dwelling older
      adults, and to determine if this program is effective in promoting and sustaining
      self-management skills to increase well-being and functional health among this group.
      Designed specifically for community-dwelling older adults, Vitalize 360 provides a unique
      opportunity to guide elders in selecting personal goals that align with their assessment
      results and develop an action plan for goal achievement. This strategy holds potential as an
      effective mechanism to empower elders to implement behaviors that promote healthy aging.

      The purpose of this project was to determine if Vitalize 360, a comprehensive assessment
      system and wellness coaching program was effective in promoting and sustaining increased
      physical activity and improved mood, health status and quality of life. A repeated measures,
      secondary analysis design was the selected approach Data from 161 participants were used to
      test the hypotheses. After one year, the sample had improvement with increased socialization
      while physical activity level fluctuated over time suggestive of a seasonality effect. Paired
      t-tests and repeated measures analysis revealed no statistically significant improvement in
      physical activity level, mood, health status or quality of life. Vitalize 360 provides a
      unique opportunity to guide elders in selecting personal goals that align with their
      assessment results and develop an action plan for goal achievement. When used among
      vulnerable and frail elders, some modifications are needed to provide sustained, favorable
      outcomes.
