  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, 2-part, multicenter study in subjects with MSS
      relapsed/refractory colorectal cancer. The primary objective of Part 1 is to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of eFT508 in combination with a fixed dose of
      avelumab to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of eFT508 and to select a recommended
      dose for Part 2. The primary objective of Part 2 is to evaluate antitumor activity of eFT508
      at the recommended dose in combination with avelumab or eFT508 monotherapy. Parts 1 and 2
      will also evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics.

    <intervention_model_description>In Part 1, subjects will receive eFT508 in combination with a fixed dose of avelumab. Once the recommended dose of eFT508 in combination with avelumab is determined in Part 1, enrollment in Part 2 will begin. Subjects will be randomized in approximately a 2:1 ratio to receive eFT508 in combination with avelumab or eFT508 monotherapy.</intervention_model_description>
