  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, fixed sequence, open label, drug-drug interaction study of
      the effect of multiple doses of rifampin 600 mg daily, a strong CYP3A inducer, on the
      exposure of mifepristone at 2 dose levels.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be healthy

          -  Have a BMI of 18 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight more than 50 kg (110 pounds)

          -  Be judged to be in good health, based on the results of medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory findings

          -  Have suitable veins for multiple venipuncture/cannulation

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception with
             low user-dependency. The only acceptable method is an intrauterine device (IUD),
             provided that the subject has tolerated its use for at least 3 months before the first
             dose of study drug and undertakes not to have it removed for 1 month after the last
             dose of study drug. Use of hormonal contraception (by any route, including
             intrauterine hormone releasing systems) or hormone replacement therapy is NOT
             acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have multiple drug allergies, or be allergic to any of the components of mifepristone
             or rifampin

          -  Have a condition that could be aggravated by glucocorticoid blockade (eg, asthma, any
             chronic inflammatory condition)

          -  Have a history of unexplained vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia with atypia or
             endometrial carcinoma

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  In the 1 year before first study drug administration, have a history of drug or
             alcohol abuse

          -  In the 6 calendar months before first study drug administration, on average

               -  Have smoked more than 5 cigarettes/day

               -  Have consumed more than 21 units of alcohol/week for male subjects or 14 units
                  for female subjects (1 unit/drink = 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer, or
                  1.5 ounces of hard liquor)

          -  In the 2 calendar months before first study drug administration, have donated/lost
             blood or plasma in excess of 400 mL

          -  In the 30 days before first study drug administration, have participated in another
             clinical trial of a new chemical entity or a prescription medicine
