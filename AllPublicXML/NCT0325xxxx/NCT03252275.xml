  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test an intervention that has potential to improve acute care
      skills and confidence related to safe delivery and newborn care for mid-level health
      providers in Uganda by the development of a 'mobile' simulation package including scale-up
      materials based upon research evidence. In this randomized study investigators will compare
      the impact of a peer learning package on skills, knowledge and team work regarding newborn
      care among health workers in rural south western Uganda.

      The aim of this study is to test an intervention that has potential to improve acute care
      skills and confidence related to safe delivery and newborn care for mid-level health
      providers in Uganda by the development of a 'mobile' simulation package including scale-up

      the impact of a peer learning package on skills, knowledge and team work regarding newborn
      care among health workers in rural south western Uganda.

      The cluster randomized study will have two arms; intervention arm receives peer learning
      program. In this program, two health workers at the same health facility teach each other
      using case scenarios. The case scenarios will be based on common neonatal conditions such as
      neonatal sepsis, hypothermia and prematurity.

      The two study arms will both receive training on HBB and Essential care for every baby (ECEB)
