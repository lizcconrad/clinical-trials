  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is going to apply neuropsychological battery tests to measure cognitive function
      across multiple cognitive domains in our cohort of 600 maintenance hemodialysis patients and
      evaluate:

        1. The presence and patterns of cognitive impairment in domains of executive function,
           perceptual-motor function, language, learning and memory, and complex attention;

        2. Clinical characteristics of participants with and without cognitive impairment;

        3. the risk factors which might be related to cognitive impairment in this group of
           population;

        4. The association between cognitive impairment and all-cause mortality, stroke and
           non-fatal cardiovascular events;

      We hypothesize that hemodialysis patient is going to have cognitive impairment which might be
      associated with some risk factors. We also anticipate that cognitive impairment might have
      some kind of association with the clinical outcomes like all-cause mortality, stroke and
      other common clinical outcomes that we mentioned above.
