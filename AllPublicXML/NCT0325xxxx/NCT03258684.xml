  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective clinical study, the investigators compare the outcome and clinical course
      of consecutive septic participants treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone, and
      thiamine (treatment group) with a control group treated in the investigators' ICU. The
      primary outcome is hospital survival. A propensity score is generated to adjust the primary
      outcome.There is 70 participants in each group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized controlled trial is conducted.One hundred and forty severe sepsis or
      septic shock participants admit to the Department of Critical Care Medicine of Zhujiang
      Hospital,Southern Medical University from September 2017.The participants are divided into
      control group ( n = 70 ) and treatment group ( n = 70 ).The participants in both groups are
      treated according to &quot;2016 international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic
      shock&quot;,and the participants in treatment group receive intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone,
      and thiamine. The participants in control group receive normal saline.The patients' clinical
      and demographic data, including age, sex, admitting diagnosis, comorbidities, requirement for
      mechanical ventilation, use of vasopressors, daily urine output, fluid balance after 24 and
      72 h, length of ICU stay (LOS),and laboratory data (serum creatinine, White Blood Cell (WBC),
      platelet count, total bilirubin, procalcitonin(PCT), and lactate levels), are recorded.The
      primary outcome is hospital survival. Secondary outcomes include duration of vasopressor
      therapy,requirement for renal replacement therapy in patients with Acute kidney injury (AKI),
      ICU LOS, and the change in serum procalcitonin and Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment
      (SOFA score) over the first 72 h. Summary statistics are used to describe the clinical data
      and are presented as means±SD, medians and interquartile range, or percentages as
      appropriate.Statistical analysis is performed with NCSS 11 (NCSS Statistical Software) and
      SPSS Statistics version 24 (IBM).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A primary diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock (the diagnoses of sepsis and septic
             shock are based on the 2016 the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis
             and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3)) and a procalcitonin (PCT) level≥2ng/mL.

        Sepsis: Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated
        host response to infection.

        Septic shock: Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and
        cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &lt; 18 years of age, pregnant patients, and patients with limitations of care.
