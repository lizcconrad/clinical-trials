        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has had at least 1 episode of moderate or severe CE-COPD over the past 12
             months before screening.

          -  The patient must be able to demonstrate appropriate use of albuterol from the ABS
             eMDPI.

          -  The patient is currently using a SABA reliever plus at least one of the following:
             long-acting beta agonist (LABA), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/LABA, a long-acting
             muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or a LABA/LAMA.

          -  The patient is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance SABA or
             anti-muscarinic agents and replace them with the study-provided ABS eMDPI for the
             duration of the trial.

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study requirements as specified in
             the protocol, including the use of a wearable accelerometer for the subset of patients
             who consent to use of the device.

          -  The patient is willing to discontinue all other rescue or maintenance SABA or
             antimuscarinic agents and replace them with the study-provided ABS eMDPI for the
             duration of the trial.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or â‰¥2 years postmenopausal)
             must have exclusively same-sex partners or use a highly effective method of birth

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has any clinically significant medical condition (treated or untreated)

          -  The patient has any other confounding underlying lung disorder other than COPD.

          -  The patient has used an investigational drug within 5 half-lives of it being
             discontinued or 1 month, whichever is longer.

          -  The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman, or plans to become pregnant during the
