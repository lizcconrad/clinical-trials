  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is one of the most prevalent eye diseases and the second most common cause of
      blindness worldwide. The most common form is primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Glaucoma is
      a slowly progressing neuropathy of the optic nerve that causes loss of visual field and
      eventually blindness. Elevated intra-ocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor.

      Corticosteroids, which are often used for the treatment of many diseases in ophthalmology and
      other specialities, may cause an elevation of the IOP. It is estimated that corticosteroids
      induce ocular hypertension in approximately 18%-36% of the general population and in patients
      with POAG this percentage can be as high as 92%. When the treatment is sustained, this can
      cause a glaucomatous neuropathy of the optic nerve (corticosteroid-induced glaucoma).

      The precise pathogenic mechanism isn't clear yet. Genetic factors are likely to affect the
      susceptibility to corticosteroid response. Therefore, an overview of the genetic mechanisms
      of corticosteroid-induced glaucoma can give more insight in the pathogenesis. In this study
      the researchers investigate the occurrence of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in 150
      cases with a steroid-response in comparison with 300 controls exposed to corticosteroids
      without a steroid-response.

      Up to now, one small GWAS has been conducted comparing 32 patients with and without
      corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension after treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone.
      In this study, two SNPs proximal of the transcriptional start site (near the 5') of HCG22 on
      chromosome 6 were identified. However, this is a rather small sample population and the
      investigators didn't match for the underlying disease. Further, in another small study,
      Hogewind et al. performed SNP analysis in multiple genes (SFRS3, FKBP4, FKBP5, and NR3C1) in
      corticosteroid-induced ocular hypertension.

      This study enables the investigators to identify patients at risk for developing
      corticosteroid-induced glaucoma and to gain a better insight in the pathogenesis. This may
      also lead to the discovery of biomarkers that indicate an increased risk of developing a
      steroid-induced glaucoma and new prevention and treatment strategies, which are necessary as
      the treatment of corticosteroid induced-glaucoma now only focuses at lowering the IOP and can
      still be challenging.

        Patients who started topical, intravitreal or subconjunctival corticosteroids will be
        included at the University Eye Clinic Maastricht of the Maastricht University Medical
        Centre+, the Netherlands. The participants will be divided in two groups: cases who are
        corticosteroid responder (n=150) and controls exposed to corticosteroids who did not
        respond with an IOP increase (n=300).
