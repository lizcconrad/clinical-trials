      Use of ethanol injection in treatment of cystic thyroid nodule

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid nodules are common discreet lesions in the parenchyma of thyroid gland which can
      either be palpated or made out during imaging like ultrasonography (USG).Clinically palpable
      thyroid nodules have a prevalence of 4-7% in the general population . However, the prevalence
      increases to 20-76% when USG is used for detection.

      Goiter and the associated thyroid nodules result in anxiety, cosmetic disfigurement, and
      rarely compressive symptoms necessitating surgical removal, a procedure inherently associated
      with risks and complications Percutaneous sclerotherapy has been suggested to be an effective
      alternative, especially in patients with cystic nodules. Simple cystic (purely cystic)
      constitutes 6-28% of all thyroid nodules, are usually benign, filled with cellular debris or
      blood, and are a result of degeneration or hemorrhage into a hyperplastic nodule.

      Among the various compounds (sodium tetradocyl sulfate, hydroxypolyethoxydodecan,
      tetracycline, and ethanol) tried for sclerosis of cystic thyroid nodules, outcomes are best
      and most studied with ethanol. However, data on outcomes of percutaneous aspiration and
      ethanol injection (PEI) in resolution of thyroid nodules is highly variable in different
      studies (success rate: 38-85%), which may be due to different populations studied and the
      heterogeneous nature of thyroid nodules evaluated.
