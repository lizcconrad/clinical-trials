  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of percutaneous kirschner wire in
      management of Congenital Pseudarthrosis of Tibia in children younger than 1 year of age. This
      study was to determine the union rates of congenital pseudarthrosis in children operated
      before 1 year of age to identify growth abnormalities in the affected limb ,including ankle
      valgus,tibia valgus,and shortening.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the timing of surgery for congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia is a
      controversial issue. The investigators use percutaneous kirschner wire technique to manage
      the Congenital Pseudarthrosis of Tibia in children younger than 1 year of age.To investigate
      the effect of percutaneous kirschner wire in management of Congenital Pseudarthrosis of Tibia
      in children younger than 1 year of age. Bone uion rate,average time of healing, ankle valgus,
      limb length discrepancy, tibia axis alignment are recorded and evaluated.

    <description>measurement of the length difference of both tibia in AP and lateral X ray.Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) is used to measure the length of the tibia (The investigators measure the distance between the midpoint of the proximal tibial epiphyseal plate and the midpoint of distal tibia epiphyseal plate).</description>
