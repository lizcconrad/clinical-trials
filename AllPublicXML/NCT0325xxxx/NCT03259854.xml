  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional mechanical ventilation is a core feature of intensive care. Weaning and removal
      of endotracheal tube are crucial processes, which often account for a considerable part of
      Conventional mechanical ventilation total time. Unsuccessful extubation has been noted to be
      associated with an increase of both morbidity and mortality in adult and pediatric patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The documented rate of failed extubations ranges from 4.1 to 14% in pediatric intensive care
      units.Therefore, strategies preventing the need for reintubation are needed.

      Non invasive ventilation has been proposed as useful therapy to wean patients after
      unsuccessful weaning trials and to avoid reintubation in adults, though controversy exists at
      this concern.

      This technique is increasingly being used in pediatric patients over the last years. The
      objective of the present study was to determine post extubation Non invasive ventilation
      characteristics and to identify risk factors of post extubation Non invasive ventilation
      failure in children
