      Electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep is a condition in which the epileptic
      patient starts to develop neurocognitive deterioration, any type of seizures and continuous
      electrical activity in the EEG during non rapid eye movement sleep. It is an age related
      condition and will resolve spontaneously at around the age of puberty. However if left
      untreated or treatment is delayed, it may lead to permanent neurocognitive deterioration.
      Thus early diagnosis and treatment is essential in these children to preserve neurocognitive
      function.

    <textblock>
      Electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES), also known as continuous spikes and waves
      during slow sleep (CSWS), is an age related, self - limiting disorder characterized by:

        1. epilepsy with different seizure types,

        2. neuropsychological regression, and

        3. typical EEG pattern of continuous epileptiform activity during non-rapid eye movement
           sleep (NREM).

      During wakefulness, the EEG shows focal/multifocal spikes that increase in frequency during
      the acute stage. During sleep, ESES appears and is characterized by (1) marked potentiation
      of epileptiform discharges during non-REM sleep, leading to (2) a (near)-continuous,
      bilateral, or occasionally lateralized slow spikes and waves, (3) and these spikes and waves
      occur &quot;during a significant proportion&quot; of the non-REM sleep with a threshold ranging from
      25% to 85%

      The exact incidence of CSWS is not known. In pediatric neurology clinics, a reported
      frequency of 0.2% of childhood epilepsies most probably underestimates the incidence of CSWS.

      CSWS is a devastating syndrome, which requires prompt treatment, the efficacy of which is
      checked with regular intervals, e.g. three or six months. Although epilepsy resolves with
      time in most cases, many children are left with significant cognitive or language impairment.
      Longer duration of ESES appears to be the major predictor of poor outcome.

      So, early recognition and effective therapy are necessary to improve long-term prognosis in
      this condition.

      The goal of treatment is not only to control clinical seizures but also to improve
      neuropsychological functions and prevent potential cognitive deterioration. There was no
      agreement on best treatment, but potential candidates included high-dose benzodiazepines,
      valproate, levetiracetam, and corticosteroids.

        Those patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria attending the neurology unit at Assiut
        University Children Hospital will be administered the following treatment: 1. Nocturnal
        diazepam for three months 2. Corticosteroids tapered over one months 3. Antiepileptic drug
        other than sodium channel blockers which will be continued for at least two years. During
        the course of the treatment the patients will be followed up by sleep EEG and IQ before and
        at least one month after the start of treatment and regularly every three months for at
        least one year after discontinuation of benzodiazepines and steroids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All epileptic patients above 2 years of age presenting with neuropsychological
             deterioration, seizures and ESES in NREM sleep. The degree of epileptic activity
             during sleep will be measured and expressed as a spike wave index (SWI), which is
             defined as the total duration of continuous epileptic activity relative to total slow
             sleep duration. SWI must be at least 25% or more.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any epileptic patient not presenting with typical EEG findings and neurocognitive
             regression.
