  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unplanned hospital readmissions are associated with increases in morbidity, mortality, cost
      and patient dissatisfaction,. Policymakers continue to seek effective policy solutions to
      avoid readmissions in order to improve quality of care and reduce unnecessary expenditures,.
      One attempt to reduce readmissions was implemented on June 1 2012, when the Specialist
      Services Committee of British Columbia (a partnership of Doctors of BC and the Ministry of
      Health) introduced the new &quot;G78717&quot; fee code for physicians. The objective of the fee code
      was to create a financial incentive for physicians to provide a point-of-care supplemental
      discharge summary to patients and their primary care providers prior to discharge from
      hospital. Initially, only urgent hospital admissions were eligible for this incentive payment
      but on Nov 1 2015 the incentive was extended to include elective admissions as well. The
      other eligibility criteria remained unchanged.

      The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the fee code intervention is unknown. This study
      will address important questions relevant to this policy intervention using rigorous methods
      and empirical data.

      This study will employ two methods for measuring changes in readmission risk. First, we will
      use interrupted (multivariate) time series to measure whether there was a temporal change in
      provincial readmission risk associated with the implementation of the new fee code.

      We will complement the above analyses with a stronger design, comparing hospitalizations for
      which the fee code was charged (intervention group) with a cohort of clinically similar
      hospitalizations for which the fee code was not charged (control group). For this approach,
      multivariate logistic regression will be the primary statistical method. Using this analytic
      strategy, 30-day readmission risk between the intervention and control group will be measured
      over time, adjusted for patient-, provider-, and hospitalization-level covariates.

        Our study population will be representative of medical and surgical hospital admissions in
        BC.

        The Interrupted time series (ITS) cohort will be comprised of hospital separations eligible
        for submission of fee code G78717. We will include all urgent admissions to BC hospitals
        with discharge dates between 1 Jan 2002 and 30 June 2017 that had a length of stay (LOS) of
        &gt;4 days and are associated with a specialist Most Responsible Physician (MRP).

        The regression analysis cohort study will be identical to the ITS cohort but will be
        restricted to index hospitalization discharge dates between 1 Jun 2012 and 31 Jul 2017 (ie.
        the post-G78717 period).

        The unit of analysis is the index hospital admission (ie. the initial hospital admission of
        interest). Individual patients can contribute multiple hospital admissions to the cohort
        over time (although only hospital admissions occurring &gt;30 days after a prior discharge are
        eligible as index hospital admissions).
