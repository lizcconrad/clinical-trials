  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is described as a subgroup of orofacial pain with a set of
      signs and symptoms that involve the temporomandibular joint, masticatory muscles, ears and
      neck. TMD can occur unilaterally or bilaterally and approximately 70% of the population is
      affected with at least one sign. The disorder progresses with orofacial pain, muscle pain
      involving the masticatory and cervical muscles, joint noises (clicks and pops), joint block,
      mandibular dysfunction and headache. The etiology can be abnormal occlusion and/or posture,
      trauma involving local tissues, repetitive microtrauma, parafunctional habits and an increase
      in emotional stress. Studies have demonstrated that phototherapy is an efficient option for
      the treatment of TMD, leading to improvements in pain and orofacial function. The aim of the
      proposed study is to analyze the effects of low-level laser therapy and light-emitting diode
      (LED) therapy on pain and function in patients with TMD. Methods: A randomized, controlled,
      double-blind, clinical trial is proposed, which will involve 80 individuals between 40 and 70
      years of age allocated to either a laser group or LED group submitted to twelve sessions of
      phototherapy. The Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMDs will be used to evaluate all
      participants. Pain will be measured using the visual analog scale. Orofacial function will be
      measured based on maximum vertical mandibular movement and muscle tension (determined through
      palpation of the masseter, temporal, frontal, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipital and trapezius
      muscles). Electromyographic analysis of the masseter and anterior temporal muscles will also
      be performed.

    <description>This scale will be used for the assessment of pain and consists of a 10-cm line with 0 (absence of pain) printed at one end and 10 (debilitating pain) printed at the other end. The participants will be asked to mark a place on the line that represents their current pain intensity. The researcher will subsequently use a ruler to register the distance from zero to obtain a numeric representation of the pain level. These procedures will be performed before and immediately after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Maximum vertical mandibular movement</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Maximum vertical mandibular movement: The volunteer will be instructed to open his/her mouth a wide as possible. Maximum vertical mandibular movement will be measured as the distance between the maxillary and mandibular central incisors determined with the aid of digital calipers. The volunteer will then be instructed to exert pressure on the mandibular teeth with the mouth open and move the mandible to the right and left for the determination of excursion (distance between upper and lower mid points). These procedures will be performed before and immediately after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Muscle tension</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tension: Palpation will be performed of the masseter, temporal, frontal, sternocleidomastoid, suboccipital and trapezius muscle. The classification proposed by Jensen et al. will be used, with the following scores: 0 = absence of pain; 1 = mild discomfort; 2 = moderate pain; and 3 = severe pain. These procedures will be performed before and immediately after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Electromyography</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>The electrical signals of the right and left masseter and anterior temporal muscles will be captured. The EMG signal will be determined using a four-channel acquisition system (EMG System do Brasil Ltda.) with a sampling frequency of 2 KHz. The signal will be digitized using an analog-to-digital converter with 16 bits of resolution. The EMGLab (EMG System do Brasil Ltda) will be employed as the acquisition system. These procedures will be performed before and immediately after treatment.</description>
