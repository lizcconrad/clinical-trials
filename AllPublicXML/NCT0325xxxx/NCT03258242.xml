  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of Keluo Xin capsule in patients
      with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Two-thirds of
      participates will receive Keluo Xin capsules while other one third will receive placebo.

      This study composes two parts. The first is a 24-week period during which subjects receive
      designed treatment regimen; after that, subjects will be informed again for the next 24-week
      regimen (extention phase) and can choose whether or not to participate in the treatment (with
      the same regimen in the first period) voluntarily.
