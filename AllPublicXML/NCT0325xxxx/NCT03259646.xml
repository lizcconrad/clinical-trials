  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence against women is a major public health threat that carries significant consequences
      for women's health. Moreover, women experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual
      assault (SA) are more likely than non-abused women to seek certain forms of health services,
      such as for sexually transmitted infections, chronic pain and illnesses, depression and/or
      pregnancy-related concerns. As a result, the health sector is an ideal setting to identify
      and support survivors. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has identified the health care system,
      including the public health infrastructure, as key for identification of and support for
      survivors of violence, as well as for violence prevention. While some evidence-based models
      exist, no current national consensus has been reached on scalable best practices in screening
      and brief counseling for IPV/SA.

      This multi-level intervention includes integrating into the clinic setting IPV/SA screening,
      universal education, trauma informed counseling, warm referrals (e.g. provider/staff contact
      advocacy program with survivor) to local IPV/SA advocacy agencies, and access to the
      evidence-based myPlan safety decision aid app. The evaluation, using a cluster randomized
      trial design, will measure longitudinal outcomes (over 6 months) of patient self-efficacy,
      health and safety outcomes, as well as participant and provider perceptions of the
      intervention and clinic level changes in primary and reproductive health clinics in four
      states (Arizona, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and West Virginia) to achieve the following
      aims:

      Aim 1. Evaluate the effectiveness of an evidence-based screening, universal education and
      trauma-informed counseling with tailored safety action plan and referrals to partner IPV/SA
      programs compared to standard practice, on survivor health and safety outcomes over a
      cumulative period of six months.

      Aim 2. Examine longitudinal changes in clinic-level screening, universal education, trauma
      informed counseling, safety action plans and referrals to on-site and/or partner IPV/SA
      programs and improved standards for documentation through the electronic health record (EHR)
      and continuous quality measurement and reporting.

    <description>Measured by percent of safety behaviors the woman has tried and found helpful on the Safety Behaviors Checklist. The checklist was adapted from Sullivan and colleagues and Parker and colleagues. Includes use of community resources and safety steps (e.g. asked for help, hidden emergency money) and use of formal services (e.g., women's shelter, protection order, mental health services).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in decisional conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We have adapted questions from validated subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale as a measure of decision process. Measures whether the intervention helps a woman to understand the advantages and disadvantages of safety planning options and to know her values related to them. The Decisional Conflict Scale discriminates between people who make decisions and those who delay making decisions.</description>
