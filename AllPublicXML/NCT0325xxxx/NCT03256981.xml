  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HALT is a phase II, randomised multi-centre study with integrated seamless continuation to
      phase III trial following acceptable safety and feasibility assessment.

      HALT aims to recruit 110 patients with mutation positive advanced NSCLC with oligoprogressive
      disease (OPD) following initial response to a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomised to receive either SBRT or no SBRT at a ratio of 2:1
      (SBRT : no SBRT), with all patients continuing to receive background treatment with TKI
      therapy as clinically indicated and as per standard care. Patients randomised to receive SBRT
      will receive a dose and fractionation schedule dependent on OPD lesion site and proximity to
      critical normal tissues. All patients will be seen 8 weeks post randomisation, then 3 monthly
      in line with routine care.

      HALT aims to assess whether in patients with mutation positive advanced NSCLC the use of SBRT
      to ≤ 3 sites of OPD with continuation of TKI improves progression-free survival (PFS)
      compared with continuation of TKI alone.

New or existing intra-cranial lesions not amenable to radical surgery or Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
Development of new extra-cranial lesions or progression of existing extra-cranial lesions not meeting the criteria for
SBRT treatment (e.g. size &gt;5cm)
