  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is responsible in 20% of cases of acute adrenal insufficiency and in 50% of
      cases of chronic 'slow' adrenal insufficiency. Given the unpredictable nature of the response
      to the ACTH stimulation test, it is recommended to systematically start steroid replacement
      therapy with hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (HCHS) in patients in septic shock who do not
      respond to fluid resuscitation and who continue to suffer from haemodynamic instability
      despite increasing doses of noradrenaline.

      The interest of this corticosteroid therapy lies in its ability to reduce the duration of
      treatment with catecholamines, though the results are conflicting with regard to an eventual
      benefit for mortality.

      Steroid replacement therapy may be deleterious. It may increase the risk of sepsis and
      secondary septic shock. It is also implicated in critical-illness polyneuropathy and blood
      glucose dysregulation.

      Today, there is no way to identify a population of patients who respond to corticosteroid
      therapy.

      From a pathophysiological viewpoint, HCHS, as well as its glucocorticoid effects, may also
      exert mineralocorticoid effects able to compensate for the impaired renin angiotensin
      aldosterone system (RAAS), which is responsible for the refractory aspects of septic shock.

      This hyperreninism-hypoaldosteronism is found with a prevalence of around 50% of cases and is
      defined by a plasma aldosterone/ plasma renin ratio &lt; 2. It is associated with natriuresis
      &gt;30 mmol/l.

      We hypothesise that natriuresis &gt; 30 mmol/l will make it possible to identify patients who
      respond to steroid replacement therapy in terms of catecholamine use.
