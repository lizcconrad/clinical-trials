  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urethral hypermobility, which can be assessed with Q-tip test, has been considered to be
      partly responsible for pathogenesis of women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI).
      Nonetheless, Q-tip test has lost favor due to patient discomfort. Thus, the purpose of this
      study was to search a surrogate for assessment of urethral hypermobility by correlating the
      Q-tip angle and the urodynamic variables in women with SUI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All women with SUI and underwent Q-tip testing were reviewed. Patient characteristics, degree
      of prolapse determined by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification system, Q-tip angle, the
      results of urodynamic studies, the Urinary Distress Inventory (UDI-6) Questionnaire and
      Incontinence Impact (IIQ-7) Questionnaire were reviewed from their medical records. Spearman
      correlation test, and univariate and multivariate backward stepwise linear regression
      analysis were performed as appropriate.
