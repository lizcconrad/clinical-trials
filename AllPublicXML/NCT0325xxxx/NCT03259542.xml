  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, fixed-sequence, open label, drug-drug interaction study of
      the effect of multiple daily doses of oral itraconazole 200 mg, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A,
      given with mifepristone 900 mg QD, in healthy male subjects, where all drug administrations
      are given after a meal.
