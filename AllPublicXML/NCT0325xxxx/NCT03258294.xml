    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to investigate
      the effects of melatonin on the sleep disturbance symptoms of Parkinson's disease patients,
      symptoms which have a significant impact on the quality of life of these patients.

    <textblock>
      After selecting patients who satisfied the inclusion criteria and were not disqualified by
      the exclusion criteria, through a double-blind procedure the patients are directed to orally
      take either the investigational drug melatonin or a placebo(allocation ratio 1:1) for 4
      weeks, once daily, before going to sleep. The evaluation of efficacy and safety is performed
      at the first baseline and immediately after administering the drug for 4 weeks.
