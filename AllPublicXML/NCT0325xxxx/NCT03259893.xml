  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia affecting over 3 million Americans and
      about 33.5 million individuals globally. The lifetime risk of developing AF is 1 in 4 for
      adults over age 40 years. AF is associated with a major medical and socioeconomic burden
      including high cost, increased risk of stroke, heart failure, dementia, myocardial
      infarction, and death. Numerous studies have demonstrated that modifiable risk factors
      including hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle predict the
      development of AF.

      Recent studies have reported that secondary prevention interventions through aggressive risk
      factor modification can reduce the burden of AF. Structured, physician and nursing-led
      interdisciplinary AF programs have been shown to improve patient adherence to guideline
      recommendations and improve long term prognosis. Previous data, however, are derived mainly
      from white European and Australian cohorts and it is unclear whether such interventions can
      be effectively implemented in a racially diverse, safety net hospital in the U.S.

      This study is a randomized hybrid implementation-effectiveness study designed to investigate
      feasibility and effectiveness of an evidence-based innovative AF program, focusing on risk
      factor modification and AF education in a racially mixed population receiving care in a
      safety net hospital.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed as a Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation study. This
      study design will enable the investigators to primarily focus on core implementation outcomes
      while also assessing the effectiveness of the intervention on clinical outcomes. Since this
      is a Type 3 Hybrid trial, there are both effectiveness and implementation evaluation
      components, but the primary focus is on the implementation outcomes of feasibility,
      acceptability, adoption, and appropriateness. The specific aims, data collection, and
      analytic plans are grounded in the Proctor Conceptual Model of Implementation Research that
      posits improvements in outcomes are dependent not only on the evidence-based interventions
      that are implemented but on the implementation strategies used to implement those
      interventions. The model distinguishes between the intervention strategy (evidence-based
      practice), different types of implementation strategies (system environment, organizational,
      group/learning, supervision, individual providers/consumers), and three levels of outcomes
      (implementation, service, and client). The appropriate outcome measures in each category
      (implementation, service, client) depend upon the specific evidence-based practice and local
      context.

      AF patients with a BMI of â‰¥ 27 kg/m2, who are referred to outpatient cardiology clinic,
      inpatient cardiology service, or cardiology consult service at Boston Medical Center (BMC)
      will be screened until 50 participants are enrolled. Eligible participants will undergo 1:1
      randomization to standard of care (SoC -group 1) or to the interdisciplinary AF program
      (intervention- group 2). Randomization will be performed using a computer randomizer
      algorithm with 5 blocks of 6 and 5 blocks of 4 in random order for a total of 50
      participants. The rational for the randomization design is primarily for the purpose of
      feasibility and to establish effect sizes and guide the design of the future trial.

      All patients will be enrolled for a total duration of six months. Outcomes will be measured
      via 30-minute individual interviews at the end of 6-months. The implementation and service
      outcomes will be examined including acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility,
      and patient centeredness, as well as the client outcomes of satisfaction, function and
      symptomatology. Data will be collected using both quantitative and qualitative data methods
      to determine which aspects of the program achieved good patient adherence and acceptability.

    <description>Quantitative measure of willingness to enroll and attend nutrition clinic, cardiac rehabilitation clinic, and frequency of use of Alivecor device, smart Scale, Fitbit device will be aggregated to generate a single feasibility score to determine overall feasibility of the AF program.
The feasibility score will be generated by the following formula:
= 100 * average of { (actual nutrition clinic attendance/ expected nutrition clinic attendance) + (actual cardiac rehab clinic attendance/ expected cardiac rehab clinic attendance) + (actual use of smart phone enabled devices/expected use of smart phone enabled devices)}
A feasibility score closer to 100% indicates good feasibility.</description>
