      A randomized, multidisciplinary study, Phase II-III clinical trial.The study is opened to the
      incorporation of other centers that would increase the power of the obtained results . Our
      hypothesis considers that using Hyperthermic Intra-abdominal Chemotherapy,HIPEC, with
      gemcitabine after cytoreductive surgery ,will decrease tumor progression of pancreatic cancer
      by reducing the neoplastic volume and subpopulation of pancreatic cancer stem cells,
      improving the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer, and decreasing the recurrence of
      the disease

      According to the incidence in the area of the University General Hospital, Ciudad Real,
      HGUCR, authors will include a population of 42 patients, n = 21 in each group, I and II, with
      diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which will be surgically resected with curative
      intention, in the next two years, 2017-2018, with extended follow-up for at least two years
      more for survival study Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a bilateral
      contrast, 21 subjects were required in the first group and 21 participants in the second
      Group to detect as statistically significant difference between two proportions, for group I
      is expected to be 0.05 and for Group II 0.4, in relation to survival in five years. It has
      been estimated a rate of loss of patients of 10%

        -  Group I. After cytoreductive surgery, R0, and intestinal reconstruction, the patient
           after multidisciplinary study will receive adjuvant treatment with iv gemcitabine , 1000
           mg / m2 for at least 4 cycles

        -  Group II.After a R0 cytoreductive surgery, HIPEC is performed with gemcitabine, 120mg /
           m2 for 30' + adjuvant treatment with iv gemcitabine , 1000 mg / m2 for at least 4 cycles
           The aim is identifying morbidity and mortality associated to treatment by cytoreductive
           surgery and HIPEC with gemcitabine+ systemic chemotherapy,Group II, respect to a
           conventional treatment group that includes cytoreductive surgery with systemic
           chemotherapy, Group I,and identifying survival of the experimental Group with treatment
           with cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC with gemcitabine ,respect to the conventional
           treatment group,GI

    <masking_description>After explaining the treatment to develop once informed of the characteristics of pancreatic cancer to the patient, we will explain in detail the clinical trial that we are going to develop. After obtaining the informed consent, authors will start the randomly distribution of patients A list of randomization to 42 patients will be developed by a computer program that simulates the extraction procedure of numbered balls and the correlative allocation to each of the codes.
Randomization is by block, thereby ensuring a balanced number of subjects per treatment. Then a scrambling code in which randomly assigned treatment to each code will be developed.
The randomization code and study randomization list shall be kept only for the person that will carry the allocation of treatments.Randomization of patients will be performed centrally. Each patient is assigned to a sequential number of the centralized list of inclusion and appropriate treatment.</masking_description>
