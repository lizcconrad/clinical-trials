      It has been identified that nonadherence to immunosuppressant regimen may cause long-term
      graft failure and death in solid organ transplant recipients. Therefore, simplification of
      the immunosuppression regimen by reducing daily dosing frequency may improve long-term
      outcome. The investigators will examine pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of stable liver
      transplant recipients receiving twice-daily TAC with EVR (BID) regimen and then being
      converted to once-daily TAC with EVR (QD) regimen over a 6-month study period
      post-conversion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of everolimus (EVR) with reduced tacrolimus (TAC) regimen after liver
      transplantation has shown similar incidence of composite efficacy failure rate to a standard
      tacrolimus regimen, but with superior renal function for up to three years. Recent studies
      have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety profiles in liver transplant recipients
      receiving tacrolimus once-daily (QD) and tacrolimus twice-daily (BID) regimens. In kidney
      transplantation, once daily everolimus (QD) regimen has shown its safety and effectiveness.
      It has been identified that nonadherence to immunosuppressant regimen may cause long-term
      graft failure and death in solid organ transplant recipients. Therefore, simplification of
      the immunosuppression regimen (e.g. TAC with EVR) by reducing daily dosing frequency may
      improve long-term outcome. However, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of
      combined TAC and EVR once-daily (QD) regimen in liver transplant recipients. The investigator
      will examine pharmacokinetics and safety profiles of stable liver transplant recipients
      receiving twice-daily TAC with EVR (BID) regimen and then being converted to once-daily TAC
      with EVR (QD) regimen over a 6-month study period post-conversion.

        Key inclusion criteria

        Stable liver transplant recipients are eligible for inclusion in this study and have to
        fulfill all of the following criteria:

          1. Liver Transplant Recipients have received liver transplantations for at least 6+1
