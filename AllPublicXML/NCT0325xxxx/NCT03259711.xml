  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast
      cancer seems to have an impact on the cardio-vascular system. This study investigates reports
      of cardiovascular toxicities for treatment including Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
      classification: L02 in the European pharmacovigilance database, Eudravigilance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hormone replacement therapies and contraceptive pills are responsible of a wide range of
      cardio-vascular side effects, particularly thrombo-embolic disorders and ischemic heart
      disease. The difference of incidence and type of cardio-vascular events between men and women
      are strongly related to sex hormones. This study investigates the main characteristics of
      patients affected by cardiovascular side effects (of which ventricular arrhythmia's, QT
      prolongation and Torsade de Pointe) imputed to drugs classified as L02 according to ATC.
