      Objective: to determine nerve mobilization techniques effectiveness at improving shoulder
      mobility and arm sensitive disorders in the early breast cancer postsurgical period with
      axillary lymph node dissection. Design: prospective randomized and single blind trial where
      participants will be randomly allocated into two groups by EPIDAT 3.1 software. Follow-up
      will be conducted through six physical therapy assessments: one before surgery, the second
      one after surgery, the third one post-physical therapy intervention, the fourth one after
      three months, the fifth after six months and, the sixth one after twelve months, and the
      seven one after 24 months. Participants: one hundred and forty women, who are undergoing a
      unilateral breast cancer surgery with axillary lymph node dissection in the Gynaecology and
      Obstetrics Unit from &quot;Príncipe de Asturias&quot; Hospital. Intervention: Early physical therapy to
      control group and Early physical therapy plus nerve mobilization to intervention group during
      the three following weeks from surgery. Hypothesis: nerve mobilization helps brachial plexus
      sliding among its interface which improves sensitive disorders, pain and functionality of the
      inner arm. Key outcomes: range of motion, pain, sensitive disorder, functionality, quality of
      life.

      Data analysis: quantitative variables through t-student test and qualitative variable though
      Chi test through by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software.

    <description>To measure the intensity and get the information on the characteristics (type of feeling, duration, aggravating factors and mitigating, irritability, nocturnal behavior and activities with the UL ...) will be used a validated questionnaire shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI). Contains a numerical scale to collect each answer. The possible answers are 0 to 10, with 0 being no distress and 10 present such difficulty that needs help. The result of the questionnaire is between 0 (no pain) and 80 (the most pain possible).</description>

    <description>3 to 5 days after surgery, the participants assigned to this group will receive 9 sessions of early physical therapy plus educational program plus neurodynamic techniques consisting of neural tissue longitudinal glide using the Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test 1 (ULNT1), the neurodynamic test sequence for the median nerve, described by Butler. With participants in the supine position, the shoulder was abducted and externally rotated, the scapula depressed, the forearm supinated, and the wrist and fingers extended. Mobilization was applied by depressing the scapula, flexing the elbow, and elevating the scapula, extending the elbow, within a pain-free range. The mobilization was applied for 2 minutes. Each session will be of 40 minutes approximately and will be held 3 sessions a week for 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>3 to 5 days after surgery, the participants assigned to this group will receive 9 sessions of early physical therapy plus educational program consisting of physical therapy aimed at reducing postoperative edema, treatment of the scar, the muscle pain and / or joint and recovery and integration of the upper limb functional motor patterns plus instructions with printed material about lymphatic system, lymphedema, pain, movement &amp; pain; etc…. (educational strategy). Each session will be of 40 minutes approximately and will be held 3 sessions a week for 3 weeks.</description>
