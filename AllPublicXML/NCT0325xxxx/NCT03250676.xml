  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 of the study will be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of H3B-6545 in women with locally advanced or metastatic
      estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast
      cancer.

      Phase 2 of the study will be conducted to estimate the efficacy of H3B-6545 in terms of
      response rate, duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in all participants and in participants with and
      without the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mutation.

    <measure>Phase 1: Number of participants with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), as a function of the dose of H3B-6545 for determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days (Cycle 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD is the highest dose of a drug or product that doesn't cause unacceptable side effects. The Investigator will review all participants' safety and clinical data to jointly determine the MTD/RP2D of H3B-6545. During dose escalation if 2 out of 6 participants experience DLTs (side effects that prevent a dose increase) at a given dose level during Cycle 1 of the therapy, then the MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped. The RP2D is determined based on the MTD.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2: Objective Response Rate (ORR)</measure>

    <description>ORR is the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response (BOR) of confirmed partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. It is determined by investigator review. The BOR is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. CR is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.</description>

A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or (1) reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or (2) worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

               3. Are using hormonal contraceptives but are not on a stable dose of the same
                  hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks before dosing and who do not
                  agree to use the same contraceptive during the study or for 28 days after study
                  drug discontinuation.

               4. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
                  postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the
