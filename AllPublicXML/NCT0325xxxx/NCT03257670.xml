      This trial seeks to determine if therapy with a CO2 laser to the vagina is more effective
      than lidocaine to the opening of the vagina before intercourse to reduce painful intercourse
      in women who are breast cancer survivors. This study will also be looking at whether or not
      the CO2 laser improves pelvic floor function, bowel and bladder function, and sexual function
      before and after treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of the CO2RE laser
      device relative to topical lidocaine in treating dyspareunia among breast cancer survivors.
      The large and growing population of breast cancer survivors experience a significant burden
      of urogenital symptoms including dyspareunia. Several studies have evaluated the feasibility
      and effectiveness of CO2 lasers for the treatment of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy in
      postmenopausal women suggesting improvements in atrophy symptoms with favorable histological
      and microscopic changes. There is little know about the effectiveness of CO2 laser therapy in
      breast cancer survivors.

      Patients who are breast cancer survivors experiencing dyspareunia and desiring intervention
      will be randomized to two cohorts: (1) Treatment with the CO2RE laser or (2) application of
      4% aqueous lidocaine applied to the vulvar vestibule for 3 minutes before vaginal
      penetration. The primary outcome will be the overall as well as lubrication, satisfaction,
      and pain domain scores on the Female Sexual Function Index instrument. Secondary outcomes
      will be according to other validated pain and pelvic floor symptom instruments.

      Following initiation of treatment, both groups will follow up at one-week, 1-month, 3-months,
      and 6-months. At the 3-month assessment, subjects in the lidocaine arm will be given the
      option to undergo CO2RE laser therapy. A combination of validated and non-validated physical
      exam and survey instruments will be utilized at each visit in order to assess pelvic floor
      function, bowel and bladder function, and sexual function before and after treatment.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomized to two treatment cohorts (each with 35 patients): (1) treatment with the CO2RE laser or; (2) treatments of 4% aqueous lidocaine applied to the vulvar vestibule for 3 minutes before vaginal penetration. Both cohorts will have four follow-up assessments following initiation of treatment: (1) One-week post treatment initiation; (2) 1-month post treatment initiation; (3) 3-months post treatment initiation and; (4) 6-months post laser-only treatment initiation. At the 3-month assessment, subjects in the lidocaine arm will be allowed to try the CO2RE laser therapy. In doing this, an imbedded crossover trial is included that will allow assessment of subject decision-satisfaction between the two therapy approaches. The primary outcome will be the overall and lubrication, satisfaction, and pain domain scores on the Female Sexual Function Index instrument. Secondary outcomes will be other validated pain and pelvic floor symptom instruments.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score before and after treatment with topical lidocaine ointment or transvaginal CO2 laser among breast cancer survivors with dyspareunia.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a survey instrument used to determine the level of sexual function or dysfunction in females. It is comprised of a 19 item questionnaire focused on sexual functioning. There are six domains assessed: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The subject is to consider each of the questions in the context of the previous 4 weeks. The scores of each of the domains are then calculated into a final score.
Initial and follow-up assessments will allow comparisons across this instrument as well as all the secondary and other pre-specified outcome measures.</description>

    <measure>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score before and after treatment with topical lidocaine ointment or transvaginal CO2 laser among breast cancer survivors with dyspareunia.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a measure of pain intensity in adults.The NPRS is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of his/her pain. The common format is a horizontal bar or line. Similar to the VAS, the NPRS is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes. The 11-point numeric scale ranges from '0' representing one pain extreme (e.g. &quot;no pain&quot;) to '10' representing the other pain extreme (e.g. &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; or &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;).The NPRS can be administered verbally (therefore also by telephone) or graphically for self-completion. Scores range from 0-10 with higher numbers representing higher pain intensity.</description>

    <measure>Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) score before and after treatment with topical lidocaine ointment or transvaginal CO2 laser among breast cancer survivors with dyspareunia.</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Incontinence Severity Index (ISI) consists of two questions, regarding frequency and amount of leakage. It categorizes urinary incontinence (UI) into none, slight, moderate, severe, and very severe. It assess the frequency (from 0-4): (0-never, 1-less than once a month, 2-a few times a month, 3-a few times a week, 4-every day and/or night ), and amount (from 0-3) of urine leakage: 0-none, 1-drops, 2-small splashes, 3-more. The index value is from 0-12 obtained by multiplying the numbers responded in the two questions with categories of urinary incontinence severity of: None (0), Slight (1-2), Moderate (3-6), Severe (8-9), Very severe (12).</description>

    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 3 Incontinence Questions (3-IQ) is a survey instrument that is used to determine if a patient has stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), or mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). The subject is to consider each of the questions in the context of the previous 3 months.The first question asks if the patient has every leaked urine. The second question asks the patient to indicate if she has leaked urine with any of the following: activity, urge, or without activity or urge. The Third question asks which form of urinary leakage was most common. The response to question 3 is then used to determine if the patient has: 1) Stress only or mostly stress, 2) urge only or mostly urge, 3) other cause, or 4) mixed.</description>
