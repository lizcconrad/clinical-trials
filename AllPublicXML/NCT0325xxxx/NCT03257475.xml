  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the most common malignant in women with the average five-year overall
      survival rate as high as 70%. Radiation therapy is the main treatment for cervical cancer.
      Vagina is one of the important organ at risk and also a target organ in the treatment of
      cervical cancer patients. Vaginal radiation has serious related complications that affect the
      quality of life of patients and therefore needs much clinical attention. But due to lack of
      sufficient evidence, the clinical dose to the vagina is limited. ICRU-89 defined the
      recto-vaginal reference point (R-V) as a reference point for vaginal dose assessment.
      However, the R-V position is affected by applicator placement, vaginal packing and other
      factors hence the dose point only do not represent the entire vaginal radiation dose
      resulting in some clinical limitations. The latest research in Europe proposed that
      PIBS(Posterior-Inferior Border of Symphysis) / PIBS ± 2cm and VRL (vaginal reference length)
      may be more reasonable to use to assess vagina radiation doses, but it remains to be further
      clinically investigated. Therefore, this study intends to perform radical radiotherapy in
      cervical cancer patients and also by recruiting local and foreign hospitals into this study
      by recording its PIBS/ PIBS ± 2cm, VRL, R-V point dose, acute and chronic radiation injury
      incidence of vagina and other useful data. T-test and chi-square will be used to compare the
      data between Asian and European women. Correlation analysis will be used to determine if
      there is a relation between R-V and PIBS point dose. Furthermore, logic and or COX regression
      model to evaluate PIBS / PIBS ± 2cm and R-V point doses of vaginal radiation injury
      relationships, while exploring other relevant factors causing vaginal radiation injury. This
      is eventually expected to provide a scientific, simple and reliable reference point for
      vaginal dose assessment and clinical dose limit.

      1. a detailed record of the irradiation dose and R-V point dose for all patients PIBS /
           PIBS ± 2cm, VRL data were taken.

        2. according to CTCAE v3.0 standard, accurate and detailed record of patient treatment,
           after treatment of 2 years and the incidence of vaginal complications were recorded.

        3. COX regression model was used to find dose-effect relationship between the reference
           point and vaginal complications.

      Clinical Scheme:

      Inclusion criteria: Pathologically confirmed cervical cancer patients, FIGO stage ⅠA- ⅣA
      patients who underwent radical radiotherapy, Any pathological type

      Exclusion criteria: FIGO staging of cervical cancer ⅢA; Age &gt; 60 years due to vaginal
      stenosis during the treatment course

        1. pre-treatment: Abdominal and Chest CT scan before treatment. Patients were given pelvic
           MRI after EBRT to measure VRL before the start of brachytherapy.

        2. 3DCRT / IMRT was used and according to RTOG target outlined recommendation dose of
           46-50Gy / 23-25f; recording PIBS WP and R-V WP dose.

        3. Intracavitary irradiation starts at the end of the external beam radiation using
           image-guided CT / SIM. catheterization of full bladder. Patients were advice to have
           empty rectum before CT scan

           The first treatment method:

             1. Catheterization: placement of catheter inside bladder and injection of contrast
                agent-containing 7ml liquid

             2. Place uterine and vaginal applicator device (must double the bulb), vaginal
                orifices ball from 3cm, and record

             3. Vaginal packing with gauze is done to keep the applicator fixed.

             4. Barium into the rectum and anal canal.

             5. CT/SIM (transverse axis) is done to complete 3D / 2D treatment planning.
                measurement VRL, PIBS and PIBS ± 2cm, R-V were recorded;

             6. Brachytherapy plan: Point A: 24-30Gy / 4-5f, or 21-28Gy / 3-4f HR-CTV: ≥85Gy,
                IR-CTV 65Gy dose records;

        4. Concurrent chemotherapy: DDP 30-40mg / m2 * 5w or T 135mg / m2D1 + DDP 30mg / m2 d1-3;

        5. vaginal washing method is every day from the beginning of radiation therapy for six
           months. After 6 months, it was done twice per week for 2 years.

        6. vaginal radiation complications were recorded according to CTCAE 3.0 standard

        7. Gynecological examination and MRI was performed before radiotherapy and brachytherapy
           treatment and also after the entire treatment period. Patients follow-up was done on the
           1,3,6,9,12,18 and 24th month after treatment during which vaginal radiation complication
           were evaluated according to CTCAE 3.0 standard

        8. COX regression model was used to find dose-effect relationship between the reference
           point and vaginal complications.
