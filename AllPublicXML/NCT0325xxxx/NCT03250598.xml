  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, single-dose, open-label trial is to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and effect on QTc interval of AG-348 in healthy, adult Japanese and
      Non-Asian subjects. The study plans to evaluate 3 cohorts of a single oral dose of AG-348 in
      Japanese and Non-Asian subjects. Pharmacokinetic sampling will take place serially at
      specified times during conduct of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a male or female aged 18 to 55 years, inclusive.

          -  Have a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 18.5 to ≤ 29.0 kg/m2 at Screening.

          -  Be healthy overall with no clinically significant medical abnormalities, as determined
             by the Investigator through evaluation of the subject's medical history and Screening
             vital signs, ECG, physical examination, and laboratory assessments.

          -  Applicable to Japanese Subjects Only: Japanese subjects must have been born in Japan,
             have both parents and all grandparents of Japanese origin, and not have lived outside
             of Japan for more than 5 years with no significant changes in lifestyle, including
             diet, since leaving Japan.

          -  Applicable to Non-Asian Subjects Only: Non-Asian subjects must have both parents and
             all grandparents of Non-Asian origin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have undergone any major surgical procedure within the 3 months prior to Screening.

          -  Test positive at Screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibody (HCVAb), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Have a Screening systolic blood pressure (BP) reading of &gt; 140 mmHg (&gt; 150 mmHg in
             subjects &gt; 45 years of age) OR a diastolic BP reading of &gt; 90 mmHg after 5 minutes of
             supine rest.

          -  Have any of the following cardiac risk factors:

               1. Be taking any medication with a known effect of QT interval prolongation (see
                  list of medications in Appendix 1)

               2. Have a cardiac pacemaker

               3. Demonstrate on either the Screening ECG or the baseline ECG any evidence of
                  atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, complete right or left bundle branch block,
                  or Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

               4. Demonstrate on the Screening ECG any morphology that renders measurement of QT
                  interval imprecise (eg, neuromuscular artifact that cannot be readily eliminated,
                  indistinct QRS onset, low-amplitude T wave, merged T and U waves, prominent U
                  waves, arrhythmia)

          -  Have a history of a known risk factor for Torsade de Pointes, including any of the
             following:

               1. Personal or family history of congenital long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, or
                  sudden death

               2. Unexplained syncope

               3. Heart failure

               4. Myocardial infarction

               5. Angina

               6. Certain clinically significant laboratory assessment findings, including
                  hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia

          -  Have had, including by voluntary donation, &gt; 400 mL of blood collected within the 3
             months prior to Screening.

          -  Have taken within the 14 days prior to study drug dosing any prescription medication,
             over-the counter medication, or nonprescription preparation—including vitamins,
             minerals, phytotherapeutic/herbal/plant-derived preparations, or grapefruit
             juice—unless deemed acceptable by the Investigator OR have taken within the 28 days
             prior to study drug dosing any restricted product known to strongly induce CYP3A4
             metabolism (eg, St. John's Wort).

          -  Have participated in another clinical research study within the 3 months prior to
             Screening.
