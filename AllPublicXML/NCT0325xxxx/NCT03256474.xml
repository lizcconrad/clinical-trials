      Retrospective cohort analysis of children hospitalized for pneumonia comparing disease
      severity on admission, clinical course, treatment and outcomes and prospective telephone
      based Follow-Up assessement.

      The investigators will conduct a retrospective cohort analysis of children hospitalized for
      pneumonia at the Filderklinik between December 2006 and November 2010. The Bacterial
      Pneumonia Score, a validated composite laboratory, clinical and radiologic score developed by
      Moreno et al, will be retrospectively applied to define cases as either viral or bacterial
      pneumonia. The investigators will compare disease severity on admission, clinical course, and
      outcomes (in terms of complications, length of stay and readmission rates) between
      antimicrobial and non-antimicrobial managed bacterial pneumonia cases. Long-term Follow-Up
      will be assessed by telephone interviews with the parents.
