    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies how well the Sarcoma Treatment Guide works in
      improving self-monitoring in patients with sarcoma who are receiving chemotherapy. The
      Sarcoma Treatment Guide may help patients with sarcoma to be better informed, become more
      engaged with care, encourage communication, and to better manage side effects associated with
      chemotherapy treatments in order to improve quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether symptom management and communication are improved in patients who are
      chemotherapy naive who receive a Sarcoma Treatment Guide as compared to those that have not.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether patients who have previously undergone chemotherapy benefit from a
      Sarcoma Treatment Guide (STG) in regard to symptom management and have improved communication
      between patient and providers.

      II. To assess patient satisfaction with using the STG at the end of the trial.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive the STG before completing 4 courses of standard of care chemotherapy.

      ARM B: Patients complete 2 courses of standard of care chemotherapy and then receive the STG
      before completing 2 additional courses of standard of care chemotherapy.
