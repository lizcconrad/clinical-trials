  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache disorders (HDs), which are characterized by recurrent headache, constitute a
      public-health problem of enormous proportions, with an impact on both the individual sufferer
      and society. The stated goals of long-term headache treatment are to reduce the frequency,
      severity, and disability associated with acute attacks; decrease the reliance on poorly
      tolerated, ineffective, or unwanted acute pharmacotherapies; and avoid acute headache
      medication escalation. There is risk for adverse events, leading some patients to refuse
      prophylactic therapy. Acupuncture is widely used for the treatment of headaches and it may be
      applied as a single modality as well as part of a more complex treatment program. The
      objective of this study will be to investigate whether acupuncture in routine clinical
      practice ((Real World Data) is more effective than treatment of acute migraine attacks or
      routine care only in reducing headache frequency.

      A Cochrane systematic review published in 2016 concluded that acupuncture was at least as
      effective as, or possibly more effective than, preventive drug treatment for migraine
      prophylaxis with fewer side effects compared with conventional treatments . Cochrane reviews
      of tension-type headache conclude that acupuncture could be a valuable non-pharmacological
      tool in patients with frequent, episodic, and chronic tension-type headache.

      An observational, cross-sectional study, according to the STROBE guide, was conducted. The
      study was carried out in the Pain Service Unit of the Son Llàtzer University Hospital of
      Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

      Between January 2010 and December 2015, data from patients with chronic refractory headache,
      which did not respond to conventional treatment for at least 6 months, referred to the Pain
      Service Unit were examined to ascertain their eligibility.
