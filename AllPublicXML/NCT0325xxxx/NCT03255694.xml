    <textblock>
      After the first stage (52 weeks) of Phase II clinical trial, Pegylated recombinant human
      growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) injection of appropriate dose in compliance with ISS clinical
      treatment strategy is used to treat children with ISS (Idiopathic Short Stature). The
      long-term efficacy and safety of the investigational product are evaluated, which can provide
      more scientific and reliable medication guidance information for clinical diagnosis and
      treatment.
