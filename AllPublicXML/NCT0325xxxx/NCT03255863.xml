  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) refers to programs that help patients to manage life with
      a chronic disease in the best possible way. In spite of the effectiveness of Therapeutic
      Patient Education, few patients uptake TPE when it is proposed to them. Therefore, our main
      aim was to identify patients' beliefs that will predict patients' uptake of TPE. According to
      the Health Belief Model, patient will participate in TPE if they perceive their disease as a
      serious threat (with possible serious complications), but which can be controlled however,
      and that TPE is efficient and represents little burden.

      Secondary aims are as follows:

        1. To test whether the way TPE is presented to patients impact patients' decision to uptake
           TPE. The way TPE is presented comprises the time between diagnosis and the proposal of
           TPE, whether patient is a remission or crisis period in the disease, the time between
           the proposal and the next TPE session, and what is said by healthcare professionals to
           present TPE.

        2. To test whether healthcare professionals' empathy impact patients' decision to
           participate in TPE

        3. To test whether patients' intention to participate in TPE will predict their actual
           participation.

      The ultimate goal of the study is to identify patients whose beliefs will not favor
      participation in TPE in order to accompany those patients more carefully. Best practices will
      be proposed according the results.
