  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study based on collected video-clip data of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      for patients with suspected neck injury in multiple trauma between 2011 and 2015. The study
      aimed to compare all possible factors relating to ETI performance during CPR for truma
      patients between experienced video-laryngoscopy and direct- laryngoscopy users.

    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is considered to be the best method of airway management during
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However ETI during CPR is a highly skill-dependent
      procedure, then it should be attempted only highly trained physicians. Especially, cervical
      immobilization by neck collar in truamatic patients is a great obstacle to successful ETI
      during CPR.

      Because of technical difficulty in using direct laryngoscopy (DL), various types of
      videolaryngoscopy (VL) devices have been developed to overcome the problems of DL. VL may be
      more useful to perform ETI during CPR for trauma patients with cervical immobilization.

      This study tried to compare the success rate of endotracheal intubation (ETI), speed of ETI,
      incidence of complications, and chest compression interruptions during cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation for trauma patients with suspected neck injury between intubators using the DL
      and the VL in a real clinical setting.
