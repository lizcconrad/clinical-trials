  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In early clinical study investigators confirmed that berberine could prevent glucose and
      lipid metabolism disorder in schizophrenia, so investigators intend to verify the effect and
      safety of berberine in treatment for metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia.
