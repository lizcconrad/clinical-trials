  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and feasible to use cardiac
      rehabilitation (CR) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) after successful
      revascularization. This study will also test if CR improves quality of life and health
      outcomes in PAD patients.

    <measure>Vascular Quality of Life Questionnaire-6 (VascuQol6)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Up to 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The six-item Vascular Quality of Life (VascuQol-6) is a valid, practical, and responsive instrument for the assessment of health-related QOL in patients with PAD. The main advantage is the compact format that offers a possibility for routine use in busy clinical settings.
Range of scores and what they represent: Each question is scored 1-4. The total score is achieved by summarizing the score on each question, resulting in a score between 6 and 24. Higher value indicates better health status.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with PAD post-revascularization (stent, angioplasty, or bypass).

          -  Patients must have the ability to ambulate safely without assistance and should not
             have plans for undergoing further staged revascularization procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Below or above the knee amputation.

          -  Underlying cardiopulmonary or other co-morbidity that would be an exclusion under
             currently approved standard CR protocols at the University of Kansas Medical Center
             (KUMC).

          -  Unfavorable short term prognosis and limited life expectancy (&lt;2 years)

          -  Awaiting a planned staged revascularization in same or other leg (patients will be
             eligible once no further procedures are planned).

          -  Prior history of having dropped out of CR without completing.

          -  Unwilling to consent for all aspects of CR or study participation.

          -  Unable to come for CR (this will exclude patients who live far away or have no means
             to travel to the CR facility).

          -  Pregnancy
