  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal cancer is a common malignant disease worldwide especially in china. Though
      esophagectomy and definitive chemoradiotherapy are standard treatments, disease relapses in
      many patients and the prognosis of metastatic ESCC is still poor. For patients with
      unresectable or metastatic ESCC, chemotherapy is an important treatment alone or with
      radiotherapy. Taxane, platinum, and fluoropyrimidine have been reported effective in ESCC and
      is used as first-line treatment of ESCC. As for 2nd-line treatment, both irinotecan and
      taxane had been recommended based on data from clinical trials which were most enrolled
      esophageal or esophageal-gastric junction adenocarcinoma and with only small sample size.
      Therefore, it is still urgently needed to explore effective 2nd-line treatment for ESCC.

      Apatinib, also known as YN968D1, is an orally antiangiogenic agents. Preclinical and clinical
      data had shown that it is effective in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors including
      esophageal cancer. It had been approved as a 3rd-line treatment for patients with advanced
      gastric cancer by state FDA of China in 2014. And the safety data showed that hemorrhage is
      rare and non-fetal which is different from bevacizumab.

      Therefore, the investigators initialize this phase II study to explore the efficacy and
      safety of irinotecan and apatinib combination treatment in unresectable or metastatic ESCC
      patients who failed in 1st-line chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy.
