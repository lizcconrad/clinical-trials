      To assess the efficacy of a closed loop glucagon system to prevent and treat hypoglycemia
      occurring in patients with Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH) in response to meals and
      exercise.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A control system for sensor-guided delivery was previously developed and tested in a
      Proof-of-Concept (POC) study in a clinical research setting during 9 mixed meal tolerance
      tests in 8 unique patients with severe hypoglycemia following bariatric surgery. This
      optimized algorithm will now be implemented to deliver stable glucagon in a closed-loop
      system.

      A randomized, placebo-controlled, masked trial will be conducted to assess the efficacy of
      the closed loop system to prevent and treat hypoglycemia occurring in patients with PBH in
      response to meals (part 1). Part 2 will test whether the closed loop system can also prevent
      and treat hypoglycemia in patients with PBH in response to exercise. A manufacturing program
      from our collaborating team at Xeris Pharmaceuticals will continue to produce supplies of
      glucagon for the clinical trial in a cGMP facility, with continued shelf-life stability
      testing.
