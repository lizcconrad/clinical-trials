  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will improve the efficiency and quality of healthcare for persons with sickle
      cell disease, an under-served and at risk population by implementing a co-management model of
      care. Many patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receive care primarily from specialty
      physicians and emergency departments (ED), thus resulting in a lack of primary care and a
      high number of ED visits and hospitalizations. The goal is to improve PCP and SCD specialist
      co-management. The overall purpose of this dissemination project is to evaluate utilization
      data, as well as patient and provider reported outcomes associated with the dissemination of
      a toolbox of decision support tools to PCP's and ED providers across NC and SC.

      The investigators will achieve the goals stated above through three aims.

        1. Examine the effects of decision support tools on study outcomes during the 12 months
           prior to project start and across the 3.5 years of the project in NC and SC. The
           investigators will also determine which patient and practice level characteristics
           predict study outcomes.

        2. Evaluate individual provider-reported awareness, use and preference of health
           maintenance tables and algorithms amongst PCPs and ED providers in NC and SC at project
           start and yearly across the project. Additionally, the investigators will explore
           patient reported awareness of and satisfaction with co-management model of care in NC
           and SC.

        3. The investigators will conduct an exploratory cost analysis of the dissemination and
           implementation of the SCD co-management model and its effect on healthcare resource
           utilization.
