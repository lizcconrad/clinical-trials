      The main goal of this study is assess the effectiveness of a DA for patients with knee
      osteoarthritis candidates to ART

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of knee total arthroplasty (ART) interventions has increased in the last 10 years
      in European countries, partly due to the aging of the population and partly because of the
      increase in the use of these interventions to improve the quality of life among elderly
      patients. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 2012,
      from 2000 to 2010 in Spain the percentage of knee ART has doubled in recent years. .

      The role of citizens in decisions affecting their health is changing. Individual factors such
      as improving educational attainment and access to medical information, and collective factors
      such as training of patient groups and changes in legislation (informed consent, autonomy
      principle) have motivated the transition from a paternalistic model to a co-responsibility
      model. Shared decision-making (TDC) has been proposed in recent years as a model of care that
      promotes users' involvement in the decisions about their treatment, in those situations where
      there is uncertainty and / or the scientific evidence reports a balance between benefits and
      risks that is similar for two or more therapeutic options. Decision aids (DA) are tools
      designed to promote and facilitate patients' involvement in medical decisions concerning
      their health

      Objectives:

      To assess the effectiveness of a DA for patients with knee osteoarthritis candidates to ART

      Methodology:

      Cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the DA versus usual care
      in reducing decisional conflict, increasing knowledge of the disease/treatments, informed
      choice and the satisfaction with the decision making process, and decreasing decisional
      regret.
