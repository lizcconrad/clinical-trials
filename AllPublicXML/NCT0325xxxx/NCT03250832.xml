  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating TSR-033, an
      anti-LAG-3 Monoclonal Antibody, alone and in combination with an anti-PD-1 in Patients with
      Advanced Solid Tumors in a broad range of solid tumors. Patients with disease types selected
      for evaluation in this study are expected to derive clinical benefit with addition of an
      anti-PD-1. The study will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and cohort expansion.

    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, first-in-human, Phase 1 study evaluating the anti-LAG-3
      antibody of TSR-033 alone and in combination with anti-PD-1. The study will be conducted in 2
      parts, with Part 1 consisting of dose escalation to determine the RP2D of TSR-033 as a single
      agent (Part 1a) and in combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody (Part 1c). RP2D decisions will
      be based on the occurrence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), PK, as well as PDy data. These
      regimens will be evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors who have limited available
      treatment options as determined by the Investigator.

      Part 2 of the study will evaluate the anti-tumor activity of TSR-033 in combination with an
      anti-PD-1 in patients.
