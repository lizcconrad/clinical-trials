      1. To assess the effect of multistrain probiotics on abdominal pain using a validated
           symptom severity score in IBS patients.

        2. To assess the efficacy of a multi-strain probiotic supplement as a treatment option for
           IBS in a tertiary referral centre

      Background: Accumulating evidence supports the view that an imbalance of gut bacteria
      contributes to IBS, and that increasing the mass of beneficial species may reduce the numbers
      of pathogenic bacteria and help alleviate symptoms.

      Methods: In this double-blind trial 360 adult patients with moderate-to-severe symptomatic
      diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) were randomized to treatment with the multi-strain probiotic
      (Bio-Kult®; 14 different bacterial strains; 8 billion colony-forming units per day) or
      placebo for 16 weeks. The change in severity and frequency of abdominal pain was the primary
      outcome measure.
