      The objective of the CAPACITY-HFpEF study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 dose
      levels of IW-1973 compared with placebo when administered daily for approximately 12 weeks to
      patients with HFpEF. The study will evaluate the effect of oral IW-1973 on peak exercise
      capacity in patients with HFpEF, with or without permanent or persistent atrial fibrillation.
