  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of two dietary patterns on sleep outcomes and measures
      of reported appetite. Participants will be given two different diets on two separate stays.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Normal sleep consists of alternating periods of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye
      movement (REM) sleep. The deeper stages of NREM sleep are also known as slow-wave sleep
      (SWS). Genetic and environmental factors, such as age, gender, race, socioeconomic status and
      others contribute to high inter-individual variability in sleep quality.

      Current evidence from epidemiologic, clinical and experimental studies support a strong
      relationship between insufficient sleep and increased risk for obesity. A reciprocal
      connection between sleep and energy metabolism may exist between diet and sleep.

      It is also well known that diet greatly influences body weight and metabolic health. Numerous
      disease risk factors are known to be associated with dietary patters consisting low fiber,
      high saturated fat, and added sugar, but the effects of diet on sleep quality remains
      unknown.

      A small group of studies have indicated an effect of diet on sleep quality (assessed
      objectively by polysomnography [PSG]) under controlled laboratory conditions. However, none
      have experimentally tested sleep and appetite outcomes under different dietary patterns
      matched for macronutrients.

      The overall objective of this study is to compare the effects of consumption of unhealthy
      meals with low fiber, high saturated fat, and high added sugar content i.e. simulated fast
      food diet [SFF] to healthy meals with high fiber, low saturated fat, and low added sugar
      content i.e. healthy diet. We hypothesize that a healthy diet (as recommended by the Dietary
      Guidelines Advisory Committee and the American Heart Association) compared to SFF diet will
      promote better sleep quality (as assessed by PSG) reflected by higher sleep efficiency,
      increased SWS and increased REM sleep and other improved sleep variables. We will also
      evaluate subjective appetite, mood and sleepiness as secondary outcomes.

             at least 3 meals per day (as confirmed by food diaries) will be studied. Subjects will
             be required to have stable sleep habits for the past 6 months and stable dietary
             habits for the past 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Obstructive sleep apnea by laboratory polysomnography or history of any other sleep
             disorder, night or rotating shift work (current or in the past 1 year), habitual
             daytime naps, recent (&lt; 4 week) travel across time zones, extreme chronotypes, any
             acute or chronic medical condition, prediabetes or diabetes, prior or current eating
             or psychiatric disorders, claustrophobia, irregular menstrual periods, menopause,
             currently pregnant (screened with urine test), recently postpartum (within 1 year),
             currently lactating, alcohol abuse, excessive caffeine intake, smoking, illegal drug
             use, currently following a weight loss regimen or any other special diet or exercise
             programs, extreme food allergies or intolerances, and abnormal findings on screening
             blood testing. Participants will also be required not to take any prescription or over
             the counter medications, supplements that can affect sleep, metabolism, mood or
             appetite. Women will be required to not be on hormone replacement therapy.
