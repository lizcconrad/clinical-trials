  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how well subjects heal after surgery who receive
      standard dressings or incisional negative pressure wound therapy for non-traumatic amputation
      sites.

    <textblock>
      Incisional negative pressure wound therapy is an approved device used for wound healing of
      closed surgical incisions. This research is being done because incisional negative pressure
      wound therapy is a new application of negative pressure wound therapy that is applied over a
      closed incision area instead of an open wound. Negative pressure wound therapy is commonly
      used to help heal open wounds. It involves the use of a piece of foam, an adhesive drape, and
      a battery-powered device that places negative pressure on the wound. Currently, there are no
      trials utilizing incisional negative pressure wound therapy of closed wounds after below knee
      amputations (BKA), transmetatarsal amputations (TMA), Knee Disarticulations (KD), and Above
      Knee Amputations (AKA). This is a pilot study that compares incisional negative pressure
      wound therapy and standard dressings in patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Must be at least 18 years or older to participate.

          2. Requires closure of a nontrauamtic Transmetatarsal Amputation (TMA), Below Knee
             Amputation (BKA), Knee Disarticulation (KD), or Above Knee Amputation (AKA).

          3. Has at least one artery that feeds the closure site.

          4. Able to comply with clinical trial procedures and schedule.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients not receiving an amputation.

          2. The investigator/provider determines that the patient has an indication against
             incisional negative pressure wound therapy that would prevent them from participating.

          3. Surgical incision that is not completely closed.
