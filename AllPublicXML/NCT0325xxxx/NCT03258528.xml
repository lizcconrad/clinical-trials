  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: to evaluate the effect of right lateral positioning in comparison with supine
      positioning on tracheal aspirate pepsin levels as a marker of aspiration of gastric contents
      in ventilated preterm neonates. Study design: This randomized controlled trial was conducted
      on 60 ventilated preterm neonates &lt; 35 weeks. They were randomized into 2 groups; one group
      composed of 30 neonates that were nursed in right lateral position for 6 hours while the
      other group composed of 30 neonates that were nursed in supine position for 6 hours. Tracheal
      aspirate sample was obtained from each neonate in both groups just after the end of 6 hours
      and pepsin level was measured.

      intervention and neonates were followed up for development of bronchopulmpnary dysplasia
      (BPD).
