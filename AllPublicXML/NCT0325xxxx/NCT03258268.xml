  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A 26-week, multicenter, parallel two-arm, randomized controlled trial of the glycemic
      outcomes of individualized treatment support in patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary
      objective of the trial is to confirm the superiority of standard of care with EASY DSS versus
      standard of care without EASY DSS in terms of glycemic control in patients with type 2
      diabetes with ongoing treatment with any antidiabetic drug(s).
