  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, are increasing worldwide. Lifestyle changes
      (e.g., physical activity, healthy diet, sufficient sleep, managing stress, smoking cessation)
      are often recommended to prevent or manage these conditions, but changing habits is
      difficult. Mental health can play a role in the ability to seek out and follow through on the
      changes necessary to achieve or maintain a healthy lifestyle, yet this aspect is rarely
      addressed, and access to mental health services is often limited. Furthermore, individuals
      are influenced by factors at the individual, interpersonal, community and policy levels
      (e.g., lack of socialization, unsafe neighborhoods). These factors can act as barriers and
      need to be addressed in order for individuals to make sustainable lifestyle changes.

      A new year-long person-centered healthy lifestyles program is proposed to address the &quot;how
      to&quot; gap in making lifestyle changes through a combination of individual and group sessions.
      The feasibility and implementation of this new program will be evaluated through a pilot
      study looking at the full healthy lifestyles program compared to a less intensive version of
      the program. The study's hypothesis is that the full program will be feasible, acceptable and
      more effective for helping participants move across stages of change and for meeting their
      goals than the less intensive program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic mixed methods design including a randomized controlled trial and qualitative
      components will be used for this pilot study. The randomized controlled trial will include a
      1:1 allocation comparing a more intensive program (MIP - usual care plus healthy lifestyles
      program) with a less intensive program (LIP - usual care plus development of health goals).

      The qualitative components include semi-structured interviews of participants (exit
      interviews at 12 months), MIP staff and participants' healthcare providers (at 6 months and
      12 months). In addition, focus groups will be conducted with family members of MIP
      participants at 9 months. These elements will provide perspectives from multiple stakeholders
      for improving the healthy lifestyles program and on their roles in creating and maintaining
      healthy lifestyles.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and implementation of the healthy
      lifestyles program. Impact on participant experiences and outcomes will also be measured.
      Findings from this study will help inform a larger randomized trial to further look at
      effectiveness of the program and to determine health system implications.

    <description>Participants will receive the more intensive program, which combines usual care with the full version of the healthy lifestyles program. Participants in this arm will meet weekly for group health and wellness learning sessions or brainstorming group sessions. In addition, they will meet monthly for individual sessions with a multidisciplinary health team, including a family physician, physical therapist and dietician to tailor their health goal development and action plans to their particular needs and situations. They will be asked to maintain physical activity and nutrition journals for a week each every three months.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the less intensive program, which combines usual care along with health goal development. Participants in this arm will meet at baseline to set health goals with the support of a research assistant trained in theories of health behaviour and goal setting. They will also meet every three months to measure progress in achieving their goals. They will be asked to maintain physical activity and nutrition journals for a week each every three months.</description>

    <description>The health and wellness learning sessions provide a platform for concepts from a variety of health behaviour theories and CBT to be combined with evidence- and practice-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles. They provide the basis for participants' development of an individualized action plan. The sessions will last one hour and participants will receive them in a group setting, 18 times throughout the duration of the program. Specifically, the sessions will be delivered during weeks: 1-8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48.</description>

    <description>The brainstorming group sessions allow for facilitated discussions where individuals explore barriers and facilitators to achieving their goals and provide an interpersonal component to the program through the building of social interactions. Participants will also receive help in finding community programs to support healthy lifestyles. These sessions will last one hour and participants will receive them in a group setting, 30 times throughout the duration of the program. Specifically, these sessions will be delivered during weeks: 9-11, 13-15, 17-19, 21-23, 25-27, 29-31, 33-35, 37-39, 41-43, 45-47.</description>

    <description>Monthly individual sessions with a family physician trained in medical CBT, a dietician and a physical therapist help individuals tailor their action plans and recommendations to their particular circumstances and provide supports based on their needs. The initial session will last 3 hours and occur at baseline. The follow-up sessions will last 1 hour.</description>

    <description>Participants in both arms will develop health goals. Several components of these goals will be measured throughout the study, including the stage of change, self-efficacy and actual goal achievement. In the more intensive program arm, participants will develop health goals and learn about how to meet those goals through the group and individual sessions. In the less intensive program arm, participants will receive support in developing health goals from a research assistant trained in theories of health behaviour and in goal setting at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months. The initial goal setting session will be provided within a time period of 2 hours, and the follow-up sessions will be provided within one hour time periods.</description>
