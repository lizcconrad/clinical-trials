             should be completed within 4 weeks prior to the registration

          4. Treatment with an investigational product within 4 weeks before the first treatment

          5. Severe cardiopulmonary insufficiency, severe hepatic and renal dysfunction

         11. Artery or venous thrombosis occurred within 6 months before the study begins, such as
             cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attack), deep vein thrombosis,
             and pulmonary embolism, etc.

         12. Patient who has a history of psychotropic substance abuse and is unable to stop or
