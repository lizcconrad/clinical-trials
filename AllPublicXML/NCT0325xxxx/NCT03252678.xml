  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study verifies efficacy of Self-education program for advanced care planning. Half of
      participants will receive a book and videos about advanced care planning while the other half
      will receive a book and videos about pain control for cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study validates effectiveness of educational materials that the investigators developed
      due to the rates of completing Advanced care planning are considerably low, which is led by
      the lack of information available to patients; whether they elevate the preference of
      patients toward Advanced Care planning, reduce the burden of decision making, and support
      patients to overcome their crisis, compare to educational resources that are currently
      available.

      Previous studies inform that educational video about advanced care planning increases the
      knowledge of care for life prolongation, and affects the preference towards care for life
      prolongation and palliative care. However, being no resources are provided and orally
      explained, patients in the control group don't have enough time to fully aware of the
      information, also, since those studies are done mostly in the western countries, 'discussing
      with family members or guardians' part is missing, which is critical under contemporary
      Korean medical society. This study provides educational resources to both the intervention
      group and the control group and identifies if advanced care planning is discussed with family
      members or guardians.

      Primary outcome of this study is attitude and behavior change toward advanced care planning.
      Participants of this study will fill out the baseline questionnaire about end-of-life
      discussion and documentation, knowledge of ACP, etc. After that, participants will be
      allocated equally into the intervention group and the control group. The intervention group
      will receive a book and videos about advanced care planning which are based on Smart
      Management Strategy for Health(SMASH). The control group will receive a book and videos about
      pain control for cancer patients that were provided by Korea National Cancer Center. After
      reading and watching the educational materials, patients will get another questionnaire about
      knowledge of ACP, satisfaction on the materials, Advance Care Preference, and Decision role
      preference. Participants will read and watch the materials for about 6-8 weeks and then they
      will be asked to complete another questionnaire which includes every questions from the
      baseline and post-intervention. The result from all three questionnaires (baseline,
      post-intervention, 7-week questionnaire) will be compiled and be compared with one another.
