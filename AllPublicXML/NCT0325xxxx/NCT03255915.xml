  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have a 28-day pre-ring baseline assessment period (Stage 1) followed by
      randomization to order with 5 participants per study arm. All participants will sequentially
      receive both study products for 28-days with at least a 2-week washout period between
      products. Arm 1 will receive the TDF-FTC pod-IVR for Stage 2 followed by the placebo pod-IVR
      during Stage 3. Arm 2 will receive the placebo pod-IVR for Stage 2 followed by the TDF-FTC
      pod-IVR during Stage 3. During Stages 2 &amp; 3 participants will also complete brief phone
      surveys (&lt;3 min), computer-assisted self-interviews (CASIs), and in-depth interviews (IDIs)
      regarding perceptibility and acceptability. If willing, participants' male sexual partners
      will be invited to complete IDIs as well.

                  designee, would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe,
                  complicate interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with
                  achieving study objectives

                  Male sexual partner(s) who meet the following criteria are not eligible for
                  inclusion in the study:
