  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a common complication of luminal malignancies which is
      associated with substantial morbidity. Palliation of GOO has traditionally been through the
      surgical bypass of the obstructed lumen by creating an opening between the stomach and small
      intestine. However, In recent years, a less invasive approach, i.e. endoscopic stenting, has
      gained wide acceptance to treat unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction. In this
      study, the investigators are going to compare the safety and efficacy of the two different
      endoscopic techniques including Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE)
      and enteral stenting (ES).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, Enteral Stenting (ES) has commonly been used as the first line management of
      unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction. On the other hand, Endoscopic
      ultrasonography-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE) is the most recently described technique
      for palliation of malignant GOO, which has the theoretical potential to minimize the risk for
      stent occlusion while maintaining the less invasive endoscopic approach. This novel
      endoscopic treatment entails creating a gastroenterostomy under EUS-guidance thereby
      bypassing the occluded lumen. This endoscopic technique has been performed to treat patients
      with GOO since 2014, and recent retrospective studies have shown that EUS-GE was comparable
      to ES in terms of efficacy and safety; however, EUS-GE was associated with a significantly
      decreased risk of recurrent GOO and reinterventions.

      Based on the investigator's clinical experience for the last three years and the
      above-mentioned study results, the goal of this study is to prospectively compare EUS-GE with
      ES in the management of unresectable malignant gastric outlet obstruction. The investigators
      hypothesize that EUS-GE is associated with comparable technical and clinical success and
      safety profile while requiring fewer re-interventions.

Subscale scores range from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best and 0 being the worst quality of life.</description>
