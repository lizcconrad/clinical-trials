      Introduction and objective: The key to optimal diabetes management is tight glucose control.
      Hemoglobin A1c is the gold standard to assess glycemic control but in cases of unrecognized
      hypoglycemia, confusing nighttime events or in cases of large variations in blood glucose, a
      haemoglobin A1c can not detect specific movement of blood glucose. Continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM) provides informations of glucose levels in a real-time format and may be
      helpful for making the personalized therapy decisions desired in the era of precision
      medicine. Our aim is to analyse the benefit of tracking patterns of glucose values by using
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with T2DM in family medicine office.

      STUDY DESIGN: An observational, multicenter, cross-sectional study. A total of 20 GPs from
      four Croatian regions will recruit up to five subjects of both sexes from August 2017 till
      the end of September 2017, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus at least one year prior to
      study entry, aged ≥40 years, with no insulin in therapy and with clinical suspicion of
      hypoglycemia or with disproportion in actual glycemia na haemoglobin A1c findings.
      Sociodemographic, laboratory (HbA1c, fasting and postprandial glucose, total cholesterol,
      high density cholesterol, low density cholesterol, triglyceride and serum creatinine) and
      habits data will be collected. SETTING: Totally 100 of patients will be included. At primary
      care office each patient wear the device (iPro™2 Medtronic) subcutaneously for up to 7-days
      and return it to the office for download. Patients do not receive glucose alerts and only see
      the CGM data after it's been analyzed by the healthcare professional. A CGM device is to be
      set and take of by the GP. Before the study start all GPs will have a short education on CGM
      device by the diabetologist who use CGM on a daily base. Study period is seven days and
      includes screening before study entry and two visits. On Day 1, after screening and signing
      the informed consent, the CGM device is applied. Patient is instructed to keep a 7 day diary
      with four daily standard home blood glucose monitoring (SHBGM) along with the data on eating,
      physical exercise, drugs. Bayer's Contour® glucometer is used for the SHBGM. On Day 7, CGM
      device is took of and the data from iPro2 is uploaded to PC. At the end, each patient fill a
      short query on satisfaction while wearing CGM.
