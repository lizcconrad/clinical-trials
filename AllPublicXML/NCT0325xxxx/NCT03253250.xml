    <textblock>
      The current study is a prospective, randomized, open, multi-center investigation. The aim of
      current study is to investigate whether the Recurrence-free Survival Rate (RFS）of the
      hepatitis B related -hepatocellular carcinoma subjects who have been treated by resection can
      be improved by peginterferon alfa-2a
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects who have been treated by resection due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will be
      randomized into 2 groups: the subjects in group A will be treated by Nucleotide analogues
      (NAs)( ETV, 0.5mg，qd；tenofovir disoproxil fumarate(TDF)，300mg，qd；ADV，10mg，qd）for 96 weeks;
      the subjects in group B will be treated by peginterferon alfa-2a （135μg/week）combination with
      NAs (ETV\TDF\ADV)for 96 weeks.
