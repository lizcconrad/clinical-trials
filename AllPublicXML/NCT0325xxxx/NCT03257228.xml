  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus is among the most common chronic diseases, with significant and well
      documented impact on oral cavity health. Among the most common diseases of the oral cavity
      mucosa and complications in patients with impaired glucose metabolism and diabetes mellitus
      is oral lichen ruber (OLR), which according to World Health Organisation (WHO) is considered
      potentially malignant disorder. It was found that lichen ruber in diabetes mellitus has a
      much more aggressive clinical course in the form of atrophic-erosive and ulcerative lesions
      showing an increased tendency to malignant transformation. Although OLR etiology is unknown,
      evidence suggests cell-mediated autoimmune pathogenesis. OLR epithelial cells show anomalies
      in both enzymatic activity and carbohydrate metabolism, which may be related to hormones
      regulating carbohydrate, insulin and insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2)
      metabolism. The hypothesis of our research is that patients with diabetes mellitus and oral
      lichen ruber lesions will have a disturbance of insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 and hence
      a greater risk of malignant transformation, compared to patients with oral lichen ruber
      without diabetes and healthy patients without alterations in the oral mucosa.

      Oral lichen ruber (OLR) in the diabetes mellitus patients has more aggressive clinical course
      in the form of atrophic-erosive and ulcerative lesions showing an increased tendency to
      malignant transformation. OLR epithelial cells show anomalies in both enzymatic activity and
      carbohydrate metabolism, which may be related to hormones regulating carbohydrate, insulin
      and insulin-like Growth Factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2) metabolism. The role of
      insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) is of great importance in normal growth and cell
      development (cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis), and is involved in different
      aspects of cell transformation in malignant phenotype. A change in the expression of IGF1,
      IGF2 and IGF2R proteins is described in several types of malignant tumors including oral
      cancer. However, data on their role in the development of malignant lesions of the oral
      cavity are scarce, and the results are inconsistent. Our hypothesis is that patients with
      diabetes mellitus and oral lichen ruber lesions will have a disturbance of insulin-like
      growth factors 1 and 2 and hence a greater risk of malignant transformation, compared to
      patients with oral lichen ruber without diabetes and healthy patients without alterations in
      the oral mucosa.
