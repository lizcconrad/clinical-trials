  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to determine the thrombotic effects of YSS compared with salmon among healthy
      overweight subjects. It hypothesized that YSS may result significant, favorable thrombotic
      effects and the effects may be similar with salmon.

      The project was a randomized, two-period, crossover trial with 8-week treatment periods and
      8-week washout period. A total of 50 healthy overweight adults were recruited among staff and
      students in UPM. All the subjects were randomized into two groups. Each group was served with
      either cooked YSS (~265 g/ day) or salmon (~246 g/day) thrice per week. Blood and urine
      samples were collected for laboratory assessment.
