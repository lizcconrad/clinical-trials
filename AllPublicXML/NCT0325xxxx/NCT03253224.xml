  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With ongoing advancements in healthcare leading to prolonged life expectancy, orthopedic
      surgeries are increasingly performed in elderly patients. Total knee arthroplasty, in
      particular, has been increasing with the growing demand for improved mobility and quality of
      life. Total knee arthroplasty is performed on patients with advanced and painful
      osteoarthritis of the knees, but it can result in moderate to severe postoperative pain
      during the recovery period.

      To relieve anxiety or stress during surgery under regional anesthesia, sedation can be
      provided. Dexmedetomidine is a sedative-analgesic agent acting as Î±2-adrenergic receptor
      agonist, and its analgesic effect has been well established in various procedures or
      surgeries.

      Magnesium has been reported to produce important analgesic effects including the suppression
      of neuropathic pain, potentiation of morphine analgesia, and attenuation of morphine
      tolerance. Although the exact mechanism is not yet fully understood, the analgesic properties
      of magnesium are believed to stem from regulation of calcium influx into the cell and
      antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central nervous system. In this
      study, investigators will evaluate the reducing effect of magnesium on the post-total knee
      arthroplasty pain in patients sedated with dexmedetomidine under spinal anesthesia.
