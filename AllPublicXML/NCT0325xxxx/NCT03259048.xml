  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute abdomen can be defined as &quot;A syndrome induced by wide variety of pathological
      conditions that require emergent medical or more often surgical management&quot; [1].There are a
      plethora of causes that can lead to acute abdomen in children, they vary depending on the
      ages of the children and can be divided into diseases that can be treated with medical care
      and those in which emergency surgical intervention must be considered [2]. Ultrasonography is
      the initial choice in the diagnosis of the different causes of acute abdomen in children [3,
      4]. It is very useful as it is non-invasive, cost- effective, repetitive, with no radiation
      exposure, as good as laparoscopy, can be done even in patients with scarred abdomen [5].

      -Patient preparation:

        -  No specific preparation is needed.

        -  Demographic data including age, sex, detailed history, clinical presentation, laboratory
           tests, and data of any other investigations or operation will be obtained.

        -  Clinical examination will be done in emergency pediatric unit for provisional diagnosis.

           -Study instruments:â€¢ Patients will examined by Grey-Scale Ultrasonography (U/S) combined
           with Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDUS).

           3-Technique of examination

        -  will be in supine position.

        -  Patient First examination of whole abdomen will be done by Grey -Scale U/S using both
           3.5 MHZ and 7.5 MHZ transducers .It will be done in both longitudinal ( parallel to long
           axis of the patient ) and transverse ( perpendicular to long axis of the patient )
           orientation .

        -  Then finally examination by Color Doppler US will be done for assessment of organ
           perfusion and diagnosing inflammation.
