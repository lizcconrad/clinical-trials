      To evaluate azithromycin tear concentrations after one drop of azithromycin eyedrops
      (2.5ml/25mg) in healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, open, single-center study, 42 healthy volunteers will receive one drop of
      azithromycin into each eye. Azithromycin tear concentrations will be measured by LC-MS/MS at
      seven time points for 24 hours. Tolerability is evaluated.
