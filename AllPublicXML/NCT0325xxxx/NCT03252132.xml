  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a population-based study of type 2 diabetes patients with and without neuropathy
      recruited from the Danish National Type 2 Diabetes cohort (DD2).

      Diabetic patients with neuropathy may suffer from incapacitating symptoms such as pain,
      muscle weakness and impaired balance. Muscle weakness may cause reduced balance and postural
      instability increasing the risk of frequent falls and thereby increased morbidity and
      mortality. Thus, diabetic neuropathy is associated with significant disabilities having major
      impact on activities of daily living and quality of life.

      The effects of resistance training on neuropathy symptoms, muscle strength and muscle
      structure in patients with and with diabetic neuropathy will be examined.

      Perspective: The studies will likely improve the understanding of diabetic neuropathy and the
      relation between risk of falls in patients with and without motor dysfunction. The results
      may enable new and more precise recommendations for exercise in diabetic patients with
      diabetic neuropathy. In addition, the results may lead to a better understanding of the
      mechanisms underlying the effects of training. The improvement of motor function may lead to
      improved gait stability, fewer fall injuries and better quality of life for type 2 diabetes
      patients, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality.

    <description>Training will consist of a minimum of 5 supervised training sessions every 2 weeks and each session will be approximately 60 minutes in duration. Patients will be performing resistance training consisting of at least 3 exercises affecting the largest muscle groups of the body, training the most basic movement patterns that work the entire body as a coordinated system. Patients will train according to a linear progressive model with a slow increase in weight every training session focusing on the flexors, extensors of the ankle and knee and on flexors, extensors and abductors of the hip.</description>
