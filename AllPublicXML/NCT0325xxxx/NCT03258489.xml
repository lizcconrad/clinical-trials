  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is considered a serious public health problem. The imbalance in autonomic
      nervous system (ANS) activity is one of the main triggers in the development and maintenance
      of hypertension. The non-pharmacological management of this disease is an important resource,
      especially in refractory hypertensive patients or in hypertensive crises, where the
      pharmacological treatment does not present an efficient response. It is known that
      transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is capable of modifying the autonomic
      balance, however, the effects of Interferential electrical stimulation (IES) on this system
      in normotensive and hypertensive volunteers are not yet known. These electrotherapeutic
      resources may be a non-pharmacological tool supporting the management of hypertension. The
      objective of this research is to study the effects of different TENS and IC parameters on
      cardiovascular variables of normotensive volunteers and hypertensive patients.

    <textblock>
      Each volunteer will perform three assessments with a one-week interval. Each assessment will
      include assessment of autonomic balance, blood pressure, and blood collection
      (catecholamines). Interventions (placebo, low frequency TENS and IES) will be randomized.
      Volunteers will be accommodated in the supine position. With properly sanitized skin (70%
      alcohol) and self-adhesive electrodes (5x5 area) will be positioned in the cervical
      paravertebral region. All participants will be submitted to a placebo TENS session, a low
      frequency TENS session (TENS, 10 Hz/200μs) and an IES session (STEIN et al., 2012). The
      sessions will take place in the morning in a 12-hour fast, lasting 30 minutes, in an
      air-conditioned place (23ºC).

    <description>Systemic arterial pressure (SBP) will be evaluated by an Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor (ABPM) (NOBRE et al., 2011). Micromed and version 5.0.1.52 equipment will be used. Blood pressure monitoring using ABPM will be performed every 10 min throughout the experiment, which has an estimated time of two hours.</description>

    <description>Plasma levels of catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine) will be evaluated before and after HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) interventions. Blood with heparin will be homogenized and immediately transferred to a special tube containing 120 μL of EGTA/GSH (reduced glutathione) solution. After being centrifuged and the plasma transferred to a plastic tube, it is placed in a freezer (-80ºC).</description>

    <measure>Heart Rate Variability (n.u.)</measure>
    <time_frame>HRV will be evaluated 1 hours after the interventions</time_frame>
    <description>The autonomic balance evaluate by heart rate variability (HRV) and the heart rate signal will be purchased through a pulse frequency meter mark Polar model 810i (GAMELIN et al., 2006). The acquisition of ECG signal (sample rate-1 kHz) of the time series of RR will be purchased in continuous intervals (10 min). Data Will be transferred to a computer and RR intervals. They will be processed to calculate HRV parameter using the HRV analysis software KUBIOS. HRV will be analyzed in the time and frequency domain, using the area of greatest stability in RR intervals corresponding to 5 min of recordings (containing at least 256 consecutive beats) during controlled breathing. Volunteers Will remain in a supine position at rest for 10 min and afterwards, data will be collected with controlled breathing (12 breaths per minute; I/E:2/3) (STEIN et al., 2011). Values expressed in Total Power (ms2) and normalization unit (n.u.) (GAMELIN et al., 2006).</description>
