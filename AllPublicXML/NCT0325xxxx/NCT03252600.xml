  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and eotuzumab
      with or without cyclophosphamide work in treating patients with primary amyloidosis that has
      come back after a period of improvement. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as lenalidomide,
      dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as eotuzumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer
      cells to grow and spread. Giving lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and eotuzumab with
      cyclophosphamide may work better in treating patients with primary amyloidosis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the rate of hematologic response of very good partial response (VGPR) or better
      according to the International Society of Amyloidosis (ISA) hematologic response criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of hematologic response. II. To assess time to hematologic progression.
      III. To assess overall hematologic response rate. IV. To assess complete hematologic response
      rate. V. To assess organ response (according to ISA organ response criteria). VI. To assess
      overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone intravenously
      (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive elotuzumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 of courses 1 and 2 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and elotuzumab as in Arm I. Patients
      also receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: All patients receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21 and dexamethasone IV
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive elotuzumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.

             arrhythmias despite antiarrhythmic treatment, or severe orthostatic hypotension or
             clinically important autonomic disease; prior to study entry, any electrocardiogram
             (ECG) abnormality at screening has to be documented by the investigator as not
             medically relevant; NOTE: there is no lower limit of left ventricular ejection
             fraction below which patients are excluded from participation

          -  Any medical conditions that, in the investigator?s opinion, would impose excessive
             risk to the patient or would adversely affect his/her participating in this study,

             prostate cancer not requiring therapy

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding females

          -  Serious psychiatric illness, active alcoholism, or drug addiction that may hinder or
             confuse compliance or follow-up evaluation

             C viral infection

          -  Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with persistent neurologic deficits occurring within 6
             months prior to enrollment; persisting neurologic deficits from a CVA occurring over 6
             months prior to enrollment are not necessarily grounds for exclusion

          -  Concurrent multiple myeloma (defined according to 2015 International Myeloma Working
             Group [IMWG] guidelines)

          -  POEMS syndrome (plasma cell dyscrasia with polyneuropathy, organomegaly,
             endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein [M-protein] and skin changes)

          -  Previous cytotoxic therapies, including cytotoxic investigational agents, within 3
             weeks (6 weeks nitrosoureas) prior to start of study treatment; previous
             corticosteroids used with intent to treat amyloidosis within three weeks; (prednisone
             up to but no more than 10 mg orally once a day [q.d.] or its equivalent for symptom
             management of comorbid conditions is permitted but dose should be stable for at least
             7 days prior to study treatment)

          -  Residual side effects to previous therapy &gt; grade 1 prior to initiation of therapy
             (alopecia any grade and/or neuropathy grade 2 without pain are permitted)

          -  Prior autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant within 12 weeks of initiation of
             therapy

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant within 16 weeks of initiation of therapy, or at
             any time if patient has active graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)

          -  Prior major surgical procedure or radiation therapy within 4 weeks of the first dose
             of study treatment (this does not include limited course of radiation used for
             management of bone pain within 7 days of first dose of study therapy)

          -  Known intolerance to steroid therapy (defined as being unable to tolerate at least 20
             mg dex/week)

          -  Inability to tolerate prophylactic anti-thrombotic therapy
