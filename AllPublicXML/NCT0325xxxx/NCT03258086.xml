  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is so-called &quot;sunshine vitamin&quot;,it is synthesized in the skin during exposure to
      the ultraviolet rays in sunlight so it has been suggested that âˆ¼ 5-30 minutes of sun exposure
      between 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. at least twice per week on the skin of the face, arms, back,
      or legs (without sunscreen) is usually adequate for vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D is also
      found in plants (mainly mushrooms and yeast) and in a few foods such as fatty fish.

      Vitamin D supplement is recommended in all infants until enough formula, milk, or other food
      sources are ingested to sufficiently provide 400 IU/day to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Type
      1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, and the self immune system plays a central role in the
      destruction of the beta cell of pancrease.
