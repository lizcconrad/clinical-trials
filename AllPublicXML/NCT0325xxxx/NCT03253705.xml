      Background:

      This study is designed to provide samples to help us study the genes your blood cells are
      making as well as the proteins, sugars, fats, vitamins and other metabolites found in your
      blood or urine. Blood samples may also be collected to make special cells. These are called
      induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. Pluripotent stem cells are cells that can be
      converted into any type of cell. Researchers want to study in the lab iPSCs that are derived
      from blood samples.

      Objective:

      To collect samples to help study genes, proteins, sugars, fats, vitamins, and other
      metabolites found in blood or urine.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy volunteers and patients ages 18 and older

      Design:

      First-time research study participants at NIH will have an initial visit for this study that
      should last no more than 1 hour. All other visits should last 20 30 minutes.

      Participants will undergo a limited history and physical exam.

      Participants may have routine blood and urine tests.

      If participants are giving a blood sample, they must have a hemoglobin level checked in the
      past 12 months to make sure it is safe for them to give a blood sample for research.

      Participants may have a venous blood collection. They may do this at several visits. They
      will lie on a recliner or couch or sit in a chair. A needle will be placed into a vein in the
      hand or arm, using sterile techniques. Blood will be withdrawn into multiple syringes or
      tubes.

      Participants may be asked to provide urine in an appropriate container...

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating the role of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in cardiopulmonary and
      vascular disease states, such as, but not limited to, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and other
      pulmonary vascular diseases, arteriosclerosis, transplantation, inflammatory processes and
      sepsis. The collection of human blood and urine from both research subjects and healthy
      volunteers is necessary for the development of relevant laboratory assays and protocols, and
      to further research studies requiring such evaluations. In research subjects undergoing renal
      replacement therapy who produce limited urine we may also sample ultrafiltrate as a surrogate
      for urine. This protocol defines in general terms the purposes for which blood, urine and
      ultrafiltrate will be collected by members of the NIH s Clinical Center (CC), Critical Care
      Medicine Department (CCMD) and collaborating institutions and establishes general conditions
      under which sampling will be performed.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS WITH CARDIOPULMONARY AND VASCULAR DISEASES
             RELATED TO BUT NOT LIMITED TO ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, TRANSPLANTATION, PULMONARY
             HYPERTENSION, OTHER ADVANCED LUNG OR HEART DISEASE, AND OTHER DISEASES INVOLVING
             INFLAMMATION OR ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION:

               1. Males or females of age greater than or equal to18 years old.

               2. Subjects unable to provide informed consent must have a surrogate decision maker
                  or another legally authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or holder
                  of the DPA)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR RESEARCH SUBJECTS WITH CARDIOPULMONARY AND VASCULAR DISEASES RELATED
        TO BUT NOT LIMITED TO ARTERIOSCLEROSIS, TRANSPLANTATION, PULMONARY HYPERTENSION, OTHER
        ADVANCED LUNG OR HEART DISEASE, AND OTHER DISEASES INVOLVING INFLAMMATION OR ENDOTHELIAL
        DYSFUNCTION:

          1. Hemoglobin &lt;7.0 g/dL

          2. Currently receiving infusion of any dosage of norepinephrine, vasopressin, or
             epinephrine; or dopamine at an infusion rate &gt;2.5
