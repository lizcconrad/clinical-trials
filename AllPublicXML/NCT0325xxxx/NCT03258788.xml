  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Performance Status (PS) 0-2, not
      suitable for concurrent Chemo-Radiotherapy (CTRT), will be treated with standard radiotherapy
      (radical or palliative). Archival tumour biopsies will be analysed for baseline Programmed
      Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Some participants will have a biopsy before radiotherapy
      if the archive biopsy is not suitable. Participants will be required to undergo an additional
      mandatory post radiotherapy course biopsy of the irradiated site ideally during the last 7
      days of radiotherapy or within 7 days of completing the course of radiotherapy.

      The purpose of this prospective, multicentre, non-randomised translational study is to
      provide proof of feasibility, reliability and validity of achieving paired biopsies for PD-L1
      assessment in patients with NSCLC treated with palliative or radical radiotherapy. This is a
      non-CTIMP study.

      All participants will have a minimum of 1 mandatory biopsy (post radiotherapy [irradiated
      site]) and the potential to have a pre-treatment biopsy if archival biopsy does not meet the
      suitability criteria.

      Participants will have up to a maximum of 2 additional optional biopsies (post radiotherapy
      [within the RT field e.g supraclavicular fossa node], [outside RT field e.g. skin met]).

      Blood samples will also be taken on study at specified time points for immune monitoring
      (exploratory endpoints).

      The study will be carried out in two stages as follows:

      Stage 1:

      Following the enrolment of the first 15 eligible and consenting participants, an interim
      analysis will take place by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC will make a
      recommendation on whether recruitment should continue to the Trial Management Group (TMG).

      Stage 2:

      A further 15 participants will be recruited onto the study to achieve a total of 30 consented
      participants.

    <description>Archival tumour biopsies will be analysed for baseline PD-L1 expression. Some participants will have a biopsy before radiotherapy if the archive biopsy is not suitable.
Participants will be required to undergo an additional mandatory post radiotherapy course biopsy of the irradiated site ideally during the last 7 days of radiotherapy or within 7 days of completing the course. Patients must have completed more than 2/3 of the planned treatment before taking the biopsy.
Participants will also be asked for consent to donate 50ml blood pre and post biopsy as well as 10ml blood before #2 radiotherapy and weekly throughout treatment.</description>
