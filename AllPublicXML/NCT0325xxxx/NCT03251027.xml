  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well intensity-modulated stereotactic radiation therapy works
      in treating patients with grade II-IV glioma. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized
      radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and
      may cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of intensity-modulated (IM)-stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) on the
      incidence of wound infection (requiring oral/intravenous [IV] antibiotics or surgery), or
      wound dehiscence.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effect of IM-SRT on the incidence of titanium implants as palpable
      cranial defects due to scalp thinning.

      II. To determine the effect of IM-SRT on the incidence of hair loss and recovery rate.

      III. To determine the effect on quality of life (QoL) using European Quality of Life Five
      Dimension Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if treatment of Intensity-modulated stereotactic radiotherapy (IM-SRT) in
      patients with newly diagnosed grade II-IV gliomas can decrease the loss of scalp thickness in
      the coronal plane in T-1W magnetic resonance (MR) images.
