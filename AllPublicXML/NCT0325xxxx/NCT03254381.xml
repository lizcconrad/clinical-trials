  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with type 2 diabetes experience cognitive decline and are at higher risk for
      developing dementia. Consequently, older adults at-risk for developing type 2 diabetes (based
      on body mass, glucose levels) are at higher risk for cognitive decline, and intervening at
      this point may prevent or delay the onset of such decline. One promising lifestyle
      intervention that has been shown to improve cognitive function in other populations is
      exercise. However, before investigators can examine whether exercise will improve cognitive
      function and brain health (structure and function) in this at-risk population, a feasibility
      pilot study is needed to determine whether a larger-scale trial would be viable.

    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a six-month randomized control trial (RCT) exercise intervention.
      Thirty older adults (aged 60-80) at-risk for diabetes will be randomly assigned into one of
      three groups: 1) Aerobic training, 2) Resistance training, or 3) Balance and Tone training
      (control). All participants will engage in three one-hour exercise classes per week.
      Assessments will be made at baseline, midpoint (three months) and trial completion (six
      months), and will include cognitive testing, physical testing, and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI; to assess structural and functional brain changes). Throughout the study, investigators
      will examine data for trends in successful recruitment strategies and rates of recruitment
      and adherence to inform future clinical trials in this population.

    <description>An outdoor and/or indoor walking program (weather dependent) will be used for this group. Both programs will use a track on campus. Exercise intensity will begin at 40% of one's age specific target heart rate (i.e., heart rate reserve, HRR) and will progress to 60% of HRR over a 5 month period. Once the target of 60% of HRR is achieved, it will be sustained by the participant for the remainder of the intervention period. investigators will monitor heart rate during the exercise, but also subjectively monitor the intensity of workouts using Borg's Rating of Perceived Exertion and the &quot;talk&quot; test - participants will be asked to initially walk at a pace where they converse comfortably without effort and progress to a walking pace where conversation requires effort.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will use programmable weight machines along with free weights to target primary muscle groups. In addition, they will complete mini-squats, mini-lunges, and lunge walks. Participants will complete two sets of 6-8 reps. Training stimulus will be increased using the 7RM method - when 2 sets of 6-8 reps are completed with proper form and without discomfort. Investigators will record the number of sets completed and the load lifted for each exercise for each participant at every class.</description>

    <description>Exercises will include stretching exercises, range of motion exercises, basic core-strength exercises, balance exercises, and relaxation techniques. Only bodyweight will be applied (i.e., no additional loading). This group controls for confounding variables such as physical training received by traveling to the training centres, social interaction, and changes in lifestyle secondary to study participation.</description>
