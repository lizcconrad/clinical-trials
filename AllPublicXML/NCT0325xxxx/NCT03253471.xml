  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-part study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and antiviral activity (Part 3 only) of orally
      administered AL-611 in healthy volunteers (HV; Parts 1-2) and subjects with CHC (Part 3).

      Part 1: HV will receive 1 of 5 single ascending doses (SAD) of AL-611 Part 2: Eight HV from
      Cohort 3 in Part 1 are planned to receive a second single dose of AL-611 or placebo (as per
      their randomized assignment in Part 1) in a fed state after a washout period Part 3: Subjects
      with CHC infection will receive 1 of 3 planned multiple ascending doses (MAD)

             minutes of rest). One repeat measurement after an additional ~5 minutes of rest is
             permitted. In addition, a repeat measurement performed on a separate day is also
             permitted.

         11. Clinically significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic,
             hematologic, neurologic, oncologic (except adequately treated basal cell carcinoma and
             cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] I or II), autoimmune, or any other medical
             illness or psychiatric disorder, as determined by the Investigator. CHC with/without
             compensated cirrhosis acceptable for cohorts enrolling CHC subjects with/without
             compensated cirrhosis, respectively, but non-HCV related hepatic disease is
             exclusionary.

         16. From 14 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) prior to admission to the Phase 1
             Unit until randomization, use of any medications, including prescription, over the

             the investigator or as specified in the protocol.

             Additional exclusion criteria for subjects with CHC (Part 3):

         18. History of clinical hepatic decompensation, eg, variceal bleeding, spontaneous

             relapse after a complete course of, or premature discontinuation from,
             interferon-based treatment regimens (±ribavirin) is acceptable, but prior exposure to
             any direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) is exclusionary.

         21. Evidence on screening liver ultrasound of hepatic mass or lesion concerning for
             malignancy (subjects with cirrhosis only).

         22. For CHC subjects without cirrhosis, alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations ≤ upper
             limit of normal (ULN). If AFP is &gt;ULN, absence of a hepatic mass or lesion must be
             demonstrated by ultrasound within the screening period.
