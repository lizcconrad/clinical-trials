  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate that patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis
      who undergo ERCP only for patients with choledocholith in the EUS examination[EUS-ERCP group]
      have less negative outcomes (including false-negative results and procedure-related
      complications) than patients who undergo ERCP in all patients with high risk of
      choledocholithiasis[ERCP group]. The primary outcome is the incidence of negative outcomes
      (including false-negative results and procedure-related complications) in both groups. The
      secondary outcomes included days of hospitalization and diagnostic yield of EUS in the
      diagnosis of choledocholithiasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have shown that EUS testing prior to ERCP may reduce ERCP complications in
      patients with intermediate-risk choledocholithiasis. In other words, this results obtained by
      not performing ERCP in patients without choledocholith in the EUS examination. However, to
      the best of our knowledge, no prospective study has been conducted on the role of EUS in
      patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis. Therefore, we investigate the role of EUS
      screening in patients with high risk of choledocholithiasis. We compare the negative outcomes
      (including false negative and procedure-related complications of EUS and ERCP) of the
      'EUS-ERCP group' in which ERCP is performed when necessary after the EUS examination and the
      'ERCP group' in which ERCP is performed in all patients.

In the EUS-ERCP group, ERCP is used to remove bile duct stones diagnosed via EUS. Therefore, only ERCP is performed in patients with choledocholithiasis in EUS.
In the ERCP group, diagnosis and treatment of bile duct stones are performed with ERCP.</description>
