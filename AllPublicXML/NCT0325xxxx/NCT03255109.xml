      WEAN SAFE (WorldwidE AssessmeNt of Separation of pAtients From ventilatory assistancE) is a
      multi-centre, prospective, observational, 4-week inception cohort study being carried out by
      the Acute Respiratory Failure section of ESICM. Weaning represents a challenge for
      intensivists and patients spend a considerable amount of time in being liberated from
      mechanical ventilation. While guidelines do exist on the classification of weaning, a recent
      study has shown that these may not be applicable to all patients. Moreover, different
      practices exist in regard to weaning procedures. WEAN SAFE will prospectively assess the
      burden of, management and spectrum of approaches to weaning from ventilation, in patients
      that require invasive mechanical ventilation for any reason, for a time period of at least 24
      hours.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe, in a large population of ICU patients the burden
      of, management and spectrum of approaches to weaning from ventilation, in patients that
      require invasive mechanical ventilation for any reason, for a time period of at least 24
      hours. It will answer the following questions:

        -  What are the current approaches taken to wean patients from invasive mechanical
           ventilation?

        -  What is the frequency of delayed weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation?

        -  What are the factors that are used to determine when patients are in the weaning phase?

        -  What are the barriers to effective weaning from invasive MV?

        -  What factors (patient, institutional, medical practice) contribute to failed attempts to
           wean from invasive mechanical ventilation?

        -  What is the impact of premorbid conditions on weaning from invasive MV?

        -  What is the utility of existing classifications for weaning from invasive MV?

        -  What is the impact of early versus delayed and/or failed weaning from invasive MV?

      Patients will be screened for the study when undergoing mechanical ventilation and admitted
      in the ICU.

      Day 1 will be defined as the first day when IMV commences Day 2 commences at 6-10am (fixed
      time point each day per ICU practice) after IMV commences. Patients undergoing invasive
      mechanical ventilation on the morning of day 1 will be screened for the study Patients still
      undergoing IMV on Day 2, will be enrolled in the study Patients not undergoing invasive
      mechanical ventilation or liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 will be
      re-evaluated daily for the presence of inclusion criteria.

        Due to the observational nature of the present study, patients enrolled in other
        observational/interventional study CAN be enrolled in the present study.

        We aim to collect a large &quot;convenience sample&quot;, with &gt; 5,000 patients. Based on the LUNG
        SAFE data (NCT02010073; JAMA, 2016 Jul 19;316(3):347), we can estimate to enroll about 11
        patients invasively ventilated on Day 2 following intubation per participating ICU in a 4
        week period. We are therefore targeting the enrollment of 500 registered ICUs (considering
        a 10% dropout)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening: all patients admitted in the ICU and aged &gt;16 will be screened daily

        - A patient will be included if he/she is undergoing Invasive mechanical ventilation on the
        second morning (between 6am and 10 am) after initiation of mechanical ventilation or after
        ICU admission (if ventilation was already in place).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lack of informed consent (where required)

          -  Patients already present in the ICU at the beginning of the study, independently of
             the form of ventilatory support
