  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inflammation associated with COPD is characterized by a prominent infiltration of
      neutrophils in lung tissue and airways. The CXC chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) plays a
      pivotal role in neutrophil recruitment to the lungs resulting in progressive fibrosis, airway
      stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma characteristic of COPD. There is a paucity
      of novel therapies that target these symptoms, and there are no currently available therapies
      that modify disease progression in COPD. Danirixin (GSK1325756) is a selective CXCR2
      antagonist being developed as a potential anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD
      and influenza. This study is a mechanistic study which aims to evaluate the effect of
      danirixin in reducing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation (or NETosis). Subjects
      will be randomized (3:1) to receive danirixin hydrobromide (HBr) 35 milligram (mg) orally
      twice daily or matching placebo for 14 days. Subjects may continue to use rescue
      medication(s) and inhaled COPD maintenance medication(s) during the study. The study will
      consist of a screening period of up to 30 days, a 2 week treatment period, and a 1-week
      follow-up visit via phone call. Approximately 50 subjects will be screened to obtain
      approximately 24 subjects to complete the study.
