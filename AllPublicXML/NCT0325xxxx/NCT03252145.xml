  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a 4 to 6 week randomized, controlled, assessor blinded, trial comparing a
      negative pressure massage device (intervention group), to the standard manual lymph drainage
      massage (control group), in breast cancer patients with chronic upper extremity lymphedema.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lymphedema (LE) is a protein-rich interstitial swelling caused by reduced lymph transport
      secondary to lymphatic system damage from cancer treatments. 1 in 5 women will develop LE
      following breast cancer treatment. These women have greater restrictions in activity and
      poorer quality of life (QOL) and are more prone to cellulitis than women without LE. LE is
      incurable and progressive. Persistent lymph stasis creates a condition of chronic
      inflammation that contributes to fibrosis and fatty deposition in the subcutis of the
      affected limb. The fibro-adipose changes associated with chronic LE make it less responsive
      to treatments that primarily target limb volume. Treatments are needed that can improve these
      skin and subcutaneous tissues changes, as well as reduce limb volume.

      This 4 to 6 week randomized controlled pilot feasibility study will enroll 80 women with
      chronic arm LE, and will evaluate a novel negative pressure massage device that mobilizes
      skin and subcutaneous tissue. This negative pressure treatment provides vertical (lifting)
      and horizontal stretching of the skin and underlying fascial structures, which increases the
      subcutaneous space for lymphatic circulation, improves lymph flow, and has the potential to
      decrease fibrosis. This treatment will be compared to the standard of care massage: manual
      lymphatic drainage. Women will be randomly assigned to either the negative pressure massage
      device (intervention group), to the standard manual lymph drainage massage (control group)

      Objectives: To evaluate recruitment and retention rates; to determine rates of adverse
      events; and to determine effect sizes for limb volume, tissue induration; and patient
      reported outcomes of arm function, QOL, and body image in response to treatment

      An additional exploratory aim of the study is to evaluate for changes in circulating
      biomarkers of inflammation and fibrosis following treatment.

    <measure>Skin induration</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The SkinFibroMeter (Delfin Technologies, Finland) will be used to measure tissue induration. The SkinFibroMeter consists of a 1 mm long indenter and a force sensor. The device is gently pressed against the skin. The indenter imposes a constant deformation when the reference plate is in full contact with the skin. The skin and the underlying superficial subcutis resist the deformation. Measurements will be taken bilaterally at 5 locations: the first dorsal web space; the medial forearm halfway between the ulnar styloid and medial epicondyle; the lateral forearm halfway between the radial styloid and the lateral epicondyle; the medial arm 3 inches proximal to the medial epicondyle; and the lateral arm 3 inches proximal to the lateral epicondyle. Five recordings will be taken at each location and a mean score will be calculated.The induration value in Newtons (N) is recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire (SCQ) consists of 13 common medical conditions that were simplified into language that could be understood without any prior medical knowledge. Patients are asked to indicate if they had the condition using a &quot;yes/no&quot; format. If they indicate that they had a condition, they are asked if they received treatment for it (yes/no; proxy for disease severity) and did it limit their activities (yes/no; indication of functional limitations). For each condition, a patient can receive a maximum of 3 points. Because there are 13 defined medical conditions and 2 optional conditions, the maximum score totals 45 points if the open-ended items are used and 39 points if only the closed-ended items are used.</description>

    <description>The Norman Questionnaire (NQ) was originally developed and validated as a phone interview questionnaire to describe the signs and symptoms of breast cancer-related LE. Using the NQ, a woman reports subjective differences in the sizes of the hands, lower arms, and/or upper arms between sides. For each site difference, the reported score can range from 1 (very slight) to 3 (very noticeable). The total score can range from 1 (very slight difference at 1 site) to 9 (very noticeable difference at all 3 sites). The psychometric properties of the NQ are well established. Additional NQ questions relate to skin condition, and feelings of tiredness, thickness, or heaviness (but are not included in the NQ score).</description>

    <description>The PhysioTouch is a hand-held device that administers negative pressure under the treatment head, and gently pulls the underlying skin and subcutaneous tissue into the suction cup. This suction produces a stretch to the skin and in the subcutaneous tissue space. This action is thought to facilitate lymphatic flow from the interstitium into the lymphatic vessels, and mobilizes the superficial fascia.</description>
