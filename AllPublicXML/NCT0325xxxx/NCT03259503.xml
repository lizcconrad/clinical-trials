  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn about the safety and effectiveness of
      the combination of olaparib and high-dose chemotherapy (vorinostat, gemcitabine, busulfan,
      and melphalan, either with or without rituximab) in patients who have non-Hodgkin's or
      Hodgkin's lymphoma and are receiving an autologous stem cell transplant.

      This is an investigational study. Olaparib is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of ovarian cancer. Vorinostat is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of lymphoma. Melphalan is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment
      of myeloma. Busulfan is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of
      leukemia. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of
      lymphoma, breast cancer, and lung cancer. Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      The use of these study drugs in combination to treat non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Busulfan Test Dose:

      You will receive a test dose of busulfan by vein over about 60 minutes. Before and after you
      receive this low-level test dose of busulfan, blood will be drawn several times to check how
      the level of busulfan in your blood changes over time. This is called pharmacokinetic (PK)
      testing. This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach the correct
      blood level that matches your body size. You will most likely receive this test dose as an
      outpatient during the week before you are admitted to the hospital. If it cannot be given as
      an outpatient, you will be admitted to the hospital on Day -13 (13 days before your stem
      cells are returned to your body) and the test dose will be given on Day -12.

      Blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for PK testing about 11 times: once before
      your test dose of busulfan and 10 times over the 11 hours after the dose. The blood samples
      will be repeated again on the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment (Day -9). A temporary
      heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for
      these draws.

      If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for any reason, you will receive the
      standard fixed dose of busulfan.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose
      level of olaparib based on when you join this study. Up to 8 dose levels will be tested.
      Between 3-6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants
      will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group
      before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest
      tolerable dose of olaparib is found.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of vorinostat, melphalan, and rituximab
      (for those who receive it). The first participants enrolled on this study may receive a lower
      dose of gemcitabine, but all other participants will receive the same dose level of
      gemcitabine.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Starting 2 days before you are admitted to the hospital and on the day you are admitted, you
      will receive palifermin by vein over about 30 seconds each day to help decrease the side
      effects in the mouth and throat.

      On Day -11 through Day -3, you will take olaparib by mouth 2 times a day, about 12 hours
      apart, with or without food, with a glass of water. The olaparib tablets should be swallowed
      whole and not chewed, crushed, dissolved, or divided. Olaparib tablets can be taken with or
      without food.

      If you vomit after taking your olaparib dose, but you can see all the tablets are intact, you
      should retake that dose. If you miss or vomit a scheduled dose, you should take the scheduled
      dose up to 2 hours after that scheduled dose time. If more than 2 hours after the scheduled
      dose time, the missed dose should not to be taken and you should wait and take your next
      scheduled dose.

      On Day -10 through -3, you will take vorinostat by mouth. The study staff will tell you how
      many olaparib and vorinostat tablets to take. You will also receive dexamethasone by vein
      over about 3-5 minutes 2 times each day. Dexamethasone is a standard drug given to help
      decrease the risk of certain side effects.

      On Day -10, if you have a type of B-cell cancer, you will receive rituximab (a treatment used
      for certain lymphomas) by vein over about 3-6 hours as part of your standard care. The study
      doctor will tell you if you will receive rituximab.

      On Day -9, you will receive gemcitabine by vein over 4½ hours.

      On Days -9, -8, -7, and -6, you will receive busulfan by vein over about 3 hours.

      On Day -4, you will receive gemcitabine by vein over 4½ hours and then melphalan by vein over
      30 minutes.

      On Day -3, you will receive melphalan by vein over 30 minutes.

      On Days -2 and -1, you will rest (you will not receive chemotherapy).

      On Day 0, you will receive your stem cells by vein over about 30-60 minutes.

      You will receive 3 more doses of palifermin by vein, over about 30 seconds each time, on Days
      0, +1, and +2.

      As part of standard care, you will receive G-CSF (filgrastim) as an injection just under your
      skin 1 time each day starting on Day +5 until your blood cell levels return to normal. The
      study doctor will discuss this with you, including how filgrastim is given and its risks.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Length of Study:

      You will be taken off study about 100 days after the transplant. You may be taken off study
      earlier if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Study Tests:

      Within 7 days before starting study treatment, you will have an EKG to check your heart
      function. This may be repeated during the study, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      As part of your standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the
      transplant. While you are in the hospital, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn every 1-2
      days for routine tests. After you are released from the hospital until about 30 days after
      the transplant, you will need to stay in the Houston area to be checked for infections and
      side effects.

      Between discharge and Day 30, you will come to the clinic every 1 to 2 days for standard
      follow-up visits. The results of these routine tests will also be included in your study
      record.

      Between Days 30 and 100 after the transplant, you will come to the clinic about every 2 weeks
      for standard follow-up visits. The results of these routine tests will also be included in
      your study record. Every 2 weeks, or more often if your doctor thinks it is needed, blood
      (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. These blood tests may instead be
      performed by your personal doctor, as long as they agree to provide care as part of this
      study.

      About 100 days after the transplant:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to
           check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy, an area of
           the hip is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of bone marrow and bone is
           withdrawn through a large needle.

          9. Other malignancy within the last 5 years except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin
             cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ
             (DCIS), Stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma, or other solid tumors.

         10. Resting ECG with QTc &gt; 470 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or

             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,
             saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (eg.
             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 2 weeks.

         12. Concomitant use of known strong (eg. phenobarbital, enzalutamide, phenytoin,
             rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine, carbamazepine, nevirapine and St John's Wort ) or
             moderate CYP3A inducers (eg. bosentan, efavirenz, modafinil). The required washout
             period prior to starting olaparib is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3
             weeks for other agents.

         13. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia or with features
             suggestive of MDS/AML.

         14. Patients with symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastases. A scan to confirm the absence
             of brain metastases is not required. The patient can receive a stable dose of
             corticosteroids before and during the study as long as these were started at least 4
             weeks prior to treatment. Patients with spinal cord compression unless considered to
             have received definitive treatment for this and evidence of clinically stable disease
             for 28 days.

         15. Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery.

         16. Uncontrolled non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection.
             Examples include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent
             (within 3 months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable
             spinal cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral
             lung disease on High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) scan or any psychiatric
             disorder that prohibits obtaining informed consent.

         17. Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study
             medication.

         18. Breast feeding women.

         19. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to olaparib or any of the excipients of the
             product.
