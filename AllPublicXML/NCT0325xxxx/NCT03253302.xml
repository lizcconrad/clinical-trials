  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, surgical resection is still the main treatment for the potential cure of rectal
      cancer. Total mesorectal excision (TME) is the gold standard. The traditional laparoscopic or
      open surgery for some special patients is really difficult, especially for male, prostate
      hypertrophy, obesity, low tumor and pelvic stenosis patients to expose the gap around the
      mesorectum and separate to the pelvic floor. While transanal total mesorectal excision
      (TaTME) approach could be more directly separate the low mesorectum and relatively simple to
      complete distal rectal transection, which would bring some considerable advantages. Although
      active learning from abroad, laparoscopic assisted TaTME surgery is now in its infancy in
      China. It is urgent for clinical studies to obtain the results in China. This multicenter,
      observational study will help to encourage research in this field and to obtain data on the
      safety and efficacy of this procedure in Chinese patients with rectal cancer.
