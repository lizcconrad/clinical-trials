      Investigate whether supplementation with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) has a positive
      effect on cancer cachexia, as measured by the maintenance or increase in weight and lean body
      mass (LBM) based on body weight in kilograms (kg) and bioelectrical impedance assessment
      (BIA).
