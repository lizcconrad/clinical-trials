  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the CANscript™ sensitivity assay, which is a new and
      different assay developed to test the sensitivity of different cancer types to physician
      selected therapies (both drugs and/or drug combinations) indicated for the stage and type of
      cancer for treatment. CANscript™ tests how a patients specific tumor reacts to the therapies
      being considered by the treating physician. CANscript™ test results have been shown to
      closely correspond with actual clinical results, providing physicians with information that
      may help him/her develop a more personalized cancer treatment and care plan based on the
      patients specific condition. The researchers want to see if CANscript™ test results are
      helpful in selecting the treatments prescribed and provided. There will be about 800 people
      taking part in this study, across 5 different tumor types. The study is designed to assess
      the decision impact of the CANscript™ test results in informing physicians in therapy
      selection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational data collection study evaluating how physicians utilize therapeutic
      sensitivity information ascertained with CANscript, and subsequently describing clinical
      outcomes (clinical response and survival) resulting from their therapeutic selection.

      Potential patients presenting for study enrollment will provide written informed consent and
      will subsequently be screened per inclusion/ exclusion criteria. Once enrolled, a biopsy &amp;
      blood draw will be scheduled to obtain material for CANscript testing. Imaging will also be
      scheduled if a fresh image (obtained within 14 days of planned treatment initiation) is not
      available. Prior to submitting a fresh tissue sample for CANscript, the treating physician
      will select any number of therapies being considered for treatment, and will assign a
      priority ranking to those therapies (priority #1 through priority #N, with #1 representing
      their most preferred therapeutic option for the patient, and #N representing the number of
      their least preferred of the appropriate potential therapies). Prioritized therapies can be
      either single-agent therapeutics or combination regimens. All ranked therapeutic options must
      be available for individual patient at the time of selection. The prioritized list of
      preferred therapies will be sent to the testing laboratory (Mitra Biotech, Inc.) at least 2
      days before the biopsy and blood draw are performed. Fresh tumor and blood samples will
      subsequently be sent to the testing laboratory for receipt within 24 hours of biopsy.

    <description>CANscript is a predictive test that supports informed selection of cancer therapeutics for each individual patient. CANscript has the potential to predict the response of the patient under evaluation to either single-agent cancer therapeutics or combination therapeutic regimens. This is accomplished by using fresh tumor tissue from the patient in plates coated with a specific set of tumor matrix proteins (TMP). Further, patient derived autologous ligands are added to the culture. Angiogenic factors are added to maintain tumor vasculature along with autologous immune cells. In essence, CANscript recapitulates the tumor microenvironment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient ≥18 years old

          2. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2

          3. The patient's tumor must be amenable to a tumor biopsy sampling, so that CANscript can
             be performed

          4. The patient must have disease that is measurable by standard imaging techniques, per
             the RECIST 1.1 (For patients with prior radiation therapy, measurable lesions must be
             outside of any prior radiation field[s], unless disease progression has been
             documented at that disease site subsequent to radiation)

          5. Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed:

             A Locally advanced or metastatic HNSCC; B Locally advanced or metastatic TNBC; C
             Locally advanced or metastatic Stage 3b or 4 NSCLC after failure of appropriate 1st
             line therapy (i) Patients with EGFR or ALK mutations must have received previous
             appropriate therapy; D Locally advanced or metastatic epithelial ovarian, fallopian
             tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma, after failure of 1st line platinum-based
             chemotherapy (i) Recurrent or persistent stage 3 or 4 disease requiring relapse
             histologic documentation; E Stage IV metastatic CRC

          6. Patient has signed informed consent prior to initiation of any study-specific
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has persistent clinically significant toxicities (Grade ≥2) from previous
             anticancer therapy (excluding chronic Grade 2 chemotherapy-related neuropathy which is
             permitted, and excluding Grade 2-3 laboratory abnormalities if they are not associated
             with symptoms, are not considered clinically significant by the Investigator, and can
             be managed with available medical therapies).

          2. The patient has received treatment with chemotherapy, external-beam radiation, or
             other systemic anticancer therapy within 14 days prior to study entry (42 days for
             prior nitrosourea or mitomycin-C). (Patients could have received supportive care
             therapeutics as appropriate).

          3. The patient has an additional active malignancy that may confound the assessment of
             the study endpoints. Patients with a past cancer history (active malignancy within 2
             years prior to study entry) with substantial potential for recurrence must be
             discussed with the Sponsor before study entry. Patients with the following concomitant
             neoplastic diagnoses are eligible: non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ
             (including transitional cell carcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia),
             organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of progressive disease.

          4. The patient has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (e.g., uncontrolled or
             any New York Heart Association Class 3 or 4 congestive heart failure, uncontrolled
             angina, history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke within 6 months
             prior to study entry, uncontrolled hypertension or clinically significant arrhythmias
             not controlled by medication).

          5. The patient has uncontrolled, clinically significant pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension) that in the opinion of the
             Investigator would put the patient at significant risk for pulmonary complications
             during the study.

          6. The patient has known active or suspected brain or leptomeningeal metastases. (Central
             nervous system [CNS] imaging is not required prior to study entry unless there is a
             clinical suspicion of CNS involvement). Patients with stable, treated brain metastases
             are eligible provided there is no evidence of CNS disease growth on imaging for at
             least 6 weeks following radiation therapy or other loco-regional ablative therapy to
             the CNS.

          7. The patient is receiving immunosuppressive therapy for prophylaxis following a prior
             organ transplant (solid organ or allogeneic stem cell). Corticosteroid therapy is
             permitted.

          8. The patient has uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             uncontrolled infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          9. The patient is pregnant or breast-feeding. The patient has known positive status for
             human immunodeficiency virus active or chronic Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.
