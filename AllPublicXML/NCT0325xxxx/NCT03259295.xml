      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of using the Digiclamp device to remove
      achrocordons (skin tags). The hypothesis is that utilizing the device will result in low
      rates of re-occurrence, scars, scar tissue and discoloration at the site of removal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achrocorodons, or skin tags, are superficial cutaneous lesions that occur most commonly among
      middle aged adults, obese persons and those who suffer from Type 2 Diabetes. In most cases,
      the tags are not bothersome but there are instances when they can become infected or
      irritated. There are several skin tag removal options available, including suture ligature,
      freezing, cautery or excision. These procedures are often done in a dermatology office and
      are an out-of-pocket cost.

      The Digiclamp device was invented to make skin tag removal procedures more accessible. The
      Digiclamp represents a new option that when placed in the hands of primary care clinicians,
      it will allow them to remove skin tags without having to purchase expensive devices or to
      refer them to a Dermatologist. The device is disposable, and relatively painless when used
      correctly, and requires minimal training.

      The investigator is planning to enroll 100 subjects, who will have skin tags removed using
      the Digiclamp device. Subjects will return for follow up at 2-3 months after skin tag
      removal.
