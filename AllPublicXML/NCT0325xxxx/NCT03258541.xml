  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For advanced rectal tumors, the standard of care is neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) +/-
      chemotherapy followed by surgery 8-10 weeks later. Despite its proven efficacy in reducing
      local relapse, the neo-adjuvant treatment has been associated to non-negligible side effects,
      especially in terms of impaired sexual function. For females, pelvic RT is frequently
      associated to long-term complications such as vaginal stenosis (VS), vaginal dryness, and
      dyspareunia, while in men RT doses delivered to the neurovascular peri-prostatic bundles and
      penile bulb have been associated to the risk to develop erectile dysfunction.

      In prostate cancer, hydrogel spacers have been evaluated to create space between the target
      (prostate) and the organ (rectum) to be spared during radiotherapy treatments. Clinical
      studies have shown the ease of spacer application; patient tolerance and, good clinical
      outcomes (decrease in rectal toxicities).

      This pilot study wishes to investigate feasibility and efficacy of the injected hydrogel
      spacers TraceIT® in sparing vagina/prostate in the treatment of rectal cancer patients.

      This is a feasibility prospective pilot study. Ten patients (5 males and 5 females) with a
      histologically proven locally advanced rectal cancer with the indication of neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy will be recruited for this study. Prior to enrollment,
      potential candidates will undergo a thorough physical and clinical examination and
      documentation on medical and surgical history. If eligible, a baseline planning computed
      tomography (CT) simulation will be performed at the Radiation Oncology Department before the
      TraceIT® implant. Participants will undergo a transperineal injection of TraceIT® spacer gel
      between rectum and vagina or prostate performed by a trained radiologist under transrectal
      ultrasound guidance. A CT simulation will be repeated within 3 to 5 days post injection using
      the same imaging modality and treatment position used the pre- TraceIT® injection. Radiation
      treatment plans will be generated using scans realized pre- and post- TraceIT® injection and
      compared using dose volume histograms (DVH) analyses. Tolerance, side effects, and adverse
      events related to the procedure will be recorded prospectively from the injection until
      week-4 after EBRT (External Beam Radiation Therapy) completion. Radiological status of the
      spacer will be evaluated on the preoperative magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI).
      Histopathological results and any serious and/or unanticipated adverse events following
      surgery procedure will be recorded retrospectively.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  WHO (World Health Organization) performance status 0-1 at registration

          -  Locally advanced (T1-2 node positive or T3 N0/N+) histologically proven rectal
             adenocarcinoma located in the middle or in the high rectum. Patients with tumors
