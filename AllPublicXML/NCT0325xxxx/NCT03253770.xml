  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest is one of the most stressful situations to be managed. Our first study (MAX,
      accepted for publication BJA) clearly showed that it could not be compared to other urgent
      and stressful situations (malignant hyperthermia, anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local
      anesthetics, severe and symptomatic hyperkaliemia) whose management was significantly
      improved with the help of a digital cognitive aid.

      The present study exclusively deals with the management of cardiac arrest (recovery ward, or
      in the delivery room.) with the second generation of our digital cognitive aid, and explores
      new insights on how to better manage cardiac arrest with a digital cognitive aid in the hand
      of the leader.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot; Errare humanum est &quot;, to err is human. This Latin saying attributed to Seneca shows that
      since the dawn of time, human beings are aware that managing complex situations will always
      be an inexhaustible source of mistakes. This is particularly true in anesthesia and intensive
      care in which situations are often complex and stressful, thus leading to mistakes or
      inadequate management. Improvement might arise from the use of cognitive aids.

      In a first study (MAX, accepted for publication BJA) the investigators designed a smartphone
      application including 5 scenarios of anesthesia and intensive care crises (malignant
      hyperthermia, anaphylactic shock, acute toxicity of local anesthetics, severe and symptomatic
      hyperkaliemia, ventricular fibrillation), designed to be used in the hand of the leader
      managing the crises. Technical and non technical skills were improved in 4 out of 5
      scenarios. Cardiac arrest (ventricular fibrillation) clearly happened to be a different
      situation compared to other crises, and no improvement could be measured with our cognitive
      aid.

      The present study exclusively deals with the management of cardiac arrest (man in recovery
      ward, pregnant woman in the delivery room) with the second generation of our digital
      cognitive aid, and explores new insights on how to better manage cardiac arrest with a
      digital cognitive aid in the hand of the leader.
