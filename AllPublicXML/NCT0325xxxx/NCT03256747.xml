  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) chronic hyperglycemia is the main cause of
      complications, promoting several micro and macrovascular damages. In order to understand
      other mechanisms that could have an impact on the development of these diabetic
      complications, the assessment of glycemic variability have been widely used. Glucose control
      can be achieved with multiple interventions, including exercise training. Some individuals,
      however, especially those with autonomic neuropathy, can have exercise intolerance. In this
      context, physical therapy proposes neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) as a
      therapeutic that has been applied in research and clinical practice as an alternative to the
      training of patients who cannot perform conventional exercise. In patients with T2DM, NMES
      was shown to improve glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, but quality of these trials is
      poor. In addition, the effects of NMES on glycemic variability of T2DM patients have not yet
      been reported. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of NMES on glucose levels and
      glucose variability in patients with T2DM.

    <textblock>
      Patients with T2DM will be recruited from outpatient clinic of the Hospital de Clinicas de
      Porto Alegre. Patients will be randomized to NMES session, with maximal intensity tolerance
      by to induce visible contractions or to NMES-placebo, with minimal intensity to provide a
      sensory stimulus, but insufficient to elicit a tetanic muscular contraction. Subjects will
      attend to research facility four times. On the first visit clinical, physical examination and
      autonomic evaluation (Ewing test) will be performed and a blood sample will be collected. On
      the second visit CGMS will be placed for glycemic variability evaluation. On the third visit
      NMES or NMES-placebo will be performed in a randomized way. On the fourth visit the CGMS will
      be removed. Blood pressure and heart rate will be evaluated during the protocol each 5
      minutes and oxygenation tissue will be evaluated before, during and immediately after the
      protocol, through NIRS.
