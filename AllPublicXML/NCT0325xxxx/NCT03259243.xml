  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gynecologic laparoscopic procedures have become more common nowadays because of their
      benefits in less tissue trauma, less perioperative morbidity and shorter hospital stays
      compared with laparotomy. But postoperative pain still be the most concerning problems
      including discomfort at incision sites, Pain due to pneumoperitoneum stretching the
      intraabdominal cavity and dissection of the abdominal and pelvic viscera.

      Visceral pain is at maximal intensity during the first postoperative hours and is exacerbated
      by coughing, respiratory movements, and mobilization. Because the pain comprises of several
      factors, multimodal analgesic techniques are needed for effective postoperative analgesia and
      brought to this study to compare efficacy of Bupivacaine for pain relief postoperatively in
      women undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery divided into 4 groups including preincision
      and preclosure Bupivacaine injection collated with placebo group. The result is measurement
      in postoperative pain score and amount of drug that using to reduce pain
