             (according to subject);

          5. The subject has a Body Surface Area (BSA) affected by AD ranging from 1% inclusive to
             10% inclusive at Day 1, excluding scalp and genitals

             condition, that may either interfere with the interpretation of the clinical trial
             results (e.g. extensive scaring or pigmented lesion in a treated area), and/or put the
             subject at significant risk according to Investigator's judgment if he/she
             participates in the clinical trial (e.g. active cancer, AIDS, insulin-dependent
             diabetes…) at Screening or Day 1;

          3. The subject presents with an acute flare of AD at Day 1;

          4. The subject has active cutaneous bacterial or viral infection in any treated area at
             baseline (e.g. clinically infected AD) at Screening or Day 1;
