  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      B-cell lymphoma is a cancer of white blood cells that are found in lymph nodes. Some kinds of
      these cancers, such as gray-zone and extra-nodal, are rare and often aggressive. They are
      usually resistant to current treatments. Researchers want to see if a drug called
      pembrolizumab may treat these types of lymphoma.

      Objective:

      To collect data to see if it may be effective to give pembrolizumab to people with certain
      types of rare, aggressive B-cell lymphomas.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 14 and older who have a B-cell lymphoma, including gray-zone lymphoma or
      extra-nodal lymphoma

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      Scans. They will lie in a machine that takes images.

      A tissue sample from a previous procedure will be tested.

      The study will be done in 21-day cycles. During the study, participants:

      Will repeat the screening tests.

      Will get the study drug as an infusion into a vein over about 30 minutes.

      Will have a cheek swab and/or saliva sample collected.

      May have a bone marrow aspiration. A needle will be put into the hipbone, and a small amount
      of bone marrow will be taken out.

      May have a lumbar puncture. If cerebrospinal fluid is collected, researchers will study it.

      May have an eye exam.

      May provide tissue samples.

      May have tumor samples taken.

      Participants will have a visit about 30 days after the last dose of the study drug. They will
      then have 4 visits in year 1, 2 visits a year in years 2-5, and once each year thereafter.
      They will also be contacted by phone.

      Background:

        -  Gray-zone lymphomas (GZL) are rare, aggressive lymphomas that share clinical and
           biological features of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma

        -  Standard upfront therapy for GZL is dose-intensive chemotherapy, though disease is often
           resistant; consolidative radiation therapy reserved for patients who are relapsed or
           refractory, and patients who fail radiation therapy have a poor prognosis

        -  Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), primary testicular lymphoma (PTL),
           primary breast lymphoma (PBL), primary cutaneous DLBCL, leg-type, and intravascular
           B-cell lymphoma (IVBCL) are rare, aggressive extranodal subsets of DLBCL that usually
           have gene expression signatures of activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL

        -  ABC-DLBCL has cure rates below 40% after standard therapy, and is associated with late
           recurrences, often involving the CNS where treatment options are limited by chemotherapy
           resistance and an inability of many agents to cross the blood-brain barrier

        -  Molecular biology studies of GZL and extranodal DLBCL have identified potentially
           targetable genetic features involving the programmed death-1 (PD-1) signaling pathway

        -  A high proportion of GZL, PCNSL, and PTL cases have copy number alterations or
           chromosomal rearrangements involving the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2

        -  Pembrolizumab, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 receptor, is a
           rational therapeutic target for patients with relapsed and refractory GZL, PCNSL, PTL,
           and other extranodal DLBCL

      Objectives:

      -To determine the best overall response rate of pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed and
      refractory GZL and extranodal DLBCL

      Eligibility:

        -  Confirmed diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma, relapsed from or refractory to prior:

             -  Cohort 1: B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between
                diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (i.e., Gray-zone
                lymphoma or GZL)

             -  Cohort 2: Extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving one or more of the
                specified extranodal sites (i.e., extranodal DLBCL)

        -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function defined

        -  Age greater than or equal to 14 years

      Design:

        -  Phase 2 study of patients with relapsed and refractory GZL and extranodal DLBCL

        -  Patients will be treated with pembrolizumab 200 mg (flat dose) IV every 3 weeks provided
           they have clinical benefit and no unacceptable toxicity; patients who achieve a complete
           response (CR) will have the option stop after 1 year of therapy.

        -  All responding patients (CR, PR, or SD with clinical benefit) who subsequently relapse
           or progress within 1 year after discontinuation of study drug are eligible for
           re-treatment.

        -  At least 20 evaluable patients each with GZL and DLBCL will be evaluated on this
           protocol for the primary endpoint (overall accrual ceiling of 52 patients)

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have a diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma confirmed by Laboratory of
             Pathology, NCI, that is relapsed from or refractory to prior therapy as follows:

               -  Cohort 1: B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between
                  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (i.e., Gray-zone

        NOTE: For GZL, diagnosis will be in accordance with the 2016 World Health Organization
        classification of lymphoid malignancies. Patients diagnosed with other extranodal DLBCL
        subtypes or that are not otherwise specified (NOS) must involved at least 1 extranodal site
        and must be considered non-GCB by local immunohistochemistry algorithms. Cases that are
        non-GCB by the Hans criteria are considered eligible as well as cases of DLBCL that are
        both CD10+ and MUM1+.

          -  Evaluable disease by clinical exam (i.e., palpable lymphadenopathy, measurable skin
             lesions, etc.), laboratory assessment (i.e., lymphoma involvement of bone marrow or

             (measurable lymph nodes or masses on CT or MRI and/or evaluable FDG-avid lesions on
             PET)

          -  Adequate tumor tissue (archival or fresh) must be available for correlative studies.
             NOTE: Tumor tissue may be from any previously collected tissue and adequacy is at the
             discretion of the Principal Investigator. If prior tissue is not available, patient
             must be willing to undergo baseline tumor biopsy.

          -  Be 14 years of age or older on day of signing informed consent

          -  Adequate performance status (PS) as follows:

               -  Patients greater than or equal to 16 years must have ECOG 0-1 (and Karnofsky

               -  Pediatric patients &lt; 16 years must have Lansky play-performance of equal to or
                  less than 60.

        NOTE: Patients greater than or equal to 16 years with an ECOG PS of 2 and Karnofsky greater
        than or equal to 60 will be considered eligible at the discretion of the Principal
        Investigator if decreased ECOG performance status is felt to be related to residual
        neurologic deficits caused by CNS disease involvement that are not progressive or
        anticipated to cause clinical managemnt problems during study participation.

        - Adequate organ function as evidenced by the following laboratory parameters (unless
        related to lymphoma infiltration at the discretion of the investigator):

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 750 /mcL

             ULN if liver involvement)

             - The effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
             reason, the following measures apply:

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 72 hours prior to the first dose of pembrolizumab.

             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 120 days
             after the last dose of pembrolizumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately.

          -  Participants must not be planning to conceive or father children within the projected
             duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening/screening visit through 120
             days after the last dose of pembrolizumab.

          -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization or who is not postmenopausal.

               -  Ability of patient or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and

               -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent at any time

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may
             limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the
             discretion of the investigator:

               -  Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2
                  years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or
                  immunosuppressive drugs). NOTE: Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.

               -  History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of
                  interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

               -  Hepatitis B virus surface antigen or Hepatitis B core antibody positive

               -  Active hepatitis C infection. NOTE: Subjects who are hepatitis C antibody

                  positive PCR for hepatitis C are excluded.

               -  Uncontrolled and/or symptomatic thyroid disease

               -  Active graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) requiring treatment or any history of &gt;=

               -  Seizure activity within the past 4 weeks

               -  Known mental or physical illness that would interfere with cooperation with the
                  requirements of the trial or confound the results or interpretation of the
                  results of the trial and, in the opinion of the treating investigator, would make
                  the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab, breastfeeding must be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab

          -  Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. NOTE:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist ) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to pembrolizumab unless felt to be in the best interests of the patient in
             the opinion of the investigator

          -  Known additional malignancy that requires active systemic treatment
