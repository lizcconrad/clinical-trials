      BACKGROUND: More than a third of patients whom have been diagnosed with rectal cancer and
      treated with curative rectal surgery (low anterior resection) develop faecal incontinence
      also known as the low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). Faecal incontinence is a
      deliberating and stigmatized problem that can lead to impaired quality of life.

      There is limited evidence on efficacy of current treatment strategies for feacal incontinence
      in patients with LARS. Pelvic floor muscle exercise is a simple and non-invasive treatment,
      that has shown preliminary positive effects on faecal incontinence and quality of life.
      Pelvic floor muscle exercise has the potential to be a cost-effective treatment for faecal
      incontinence in subjects with LARS. Despite this, there is limited knowledge about the
      relationship between; severity of faecal incontinence and pelvic floor muscle function. To
      our knowledge no records exist on this relationship within the first 6 months after low
      anterior resection or stoma closure. This type on information is central for future designing
      and conducting of expensive randomized trials.

      PURPOSE: The purpose of the EDFI-Cohort study, is to determine the incidence, prevalence and
      causality of faecal incontinence, quality of life and anorectal muscle function from prior to
      stoma closure to 2 years after stoma closure, in subjects whom have been curatively treated
      for rectal cancer with low anterior resection.

      METHOD: Subjects for the EDFI-Cohort study will be recruited during autumn/winter of 2017 and
      throughout 2018, from Department of Surgery, Slagelse Hospital. Subjects should have received
      curative surgery for rectal cancer (low anterior resection) with/with-out adjuvant
      (radiation/chemo) therapy. Subjects for this study will have been treated with low anterior
      resection (e.g. total mesorectal excision (TME) or partial mesorectal excision (PME)) and
      scheduled for stoma closure. Prior to inclusion subjects must have received study information
      and provided written informed consent to participate in this study.

      Sample size: We need to examine a minimum of 50 subjects per year. With our broad inclusion
      criteria we aim to include a total of 150 subjects during the 1Â½ year inclusion period.

      Outcomes: Outcomes of patient characteristics (e.g. age, cancer stage and type of surgery)
      will be collected at baseline. Self-reported outcomes (e.g. feacal incontinense, quality of
      life and sexual function) and a clinical examination on anorectal muscle function will be
      collected/performed at prior to stoma closure and 3 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 52
      months and 104 months after stoma closure.

      Statistical analysis: The EDFI-Cohort study is expected to be analysed with both multiple
      linear regression and simple linear regression models for the continuous data. In addition we
      plan to dichotomize the LARS-score into no/minor or major LARS, and thus analyses on LARS
      will be handled with binominal tests.

      Patient involvement: Prior to planning of the EDFI-Cohort study, we have performed a single
      case-study (spring 2016) on examination procedure, questionnaires and pelvic floor muscle
      rehabilitation, this case provided us with valuable information on perspective of testing and
      possible evaluation of treatment effect.

      Research ethics: Examinations included in this study are all associated with very few if any
      adverse events, except from the mild discomfort related to the clinical anorectal examination
      itself. Subjects included in this study will receive 6 examinations, whereas care as usual at
      Slagelse hospital usually include one examination/contact to the local LARS clinic with no
      anorectal examination. Included subjects are more closely monitored and, if need be, might
      receive relevant treatment earlier compared to care as usual patients.

      Future implications: Results from the EDFI-Cohort study will help guide the design of
      randomized controlled trials on treatments of faecal incontinence in subjects whom have been
      surgically treated for rectal cancer. With emphasis on establishing the role of anorectal
      muscle function in the development faecal incontinence.

      Applicability of registrations and approvals: Prior to subject inclusion the EDFI-Cohort
      study will need to be approved by the regional research ethics committee of Region of Zealand
      including adhering to Danish legislation on 'processing of personal data'. The data
      protections agency will be notified prior to project start. Finally, the project will prior
      to start be registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.
