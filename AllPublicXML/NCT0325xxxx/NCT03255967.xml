  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (dementia) poses a significant challenge to our
      public health. While many persons with dementia are cared for by friends and family in the
      community with the assistance of home healthcare, most home healthcare clinicians and
      agencies are ill prepared to care for this population and therefore have difficulty assisting
      patients and caregivers in maintaining quality of life leading to adverse patient outcomes,
      increased caregiver stress and burnout, and healthcare utilization. This study will therefore
      utilize a cluster randomized controlled design at 3 study sites to examine the ability of a
      multi-component evidence-based practice primary palliative care quality improvement program
      for home healthcare registered nurses, occupational therapists and physical therapists to
      improve the quality of life and reduce healthcare utilization for persons with dementia and
      their informal caregiver.

    <time_frame>60 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will evaluate patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by proxy (caregiver) assessment using the 15-item Health Utilities Index (HUI2), a generic health state classification system with preference-based utility weights derived from the general population. The HUI is one of the more widely used utility measures and has been used in previous studies of elderly with dementia and their caregivers.</description>

    <measure>Change in Caregiver-Targeted Quality of Life Measure</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Days</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver-Targeted Quality of Life (CG-QOL) measure covers 10 dimensions of QOL relevant to caregivers of persons with dementia, incorporates non-health related issues as well as positive aspects of caregiving, and has demonstrated feasibility as a phone-based instrument in both English and Spanish. Eighty items are distributed across 10 scales: assistance with ADLs, assistance with IADLs, personal time, role limitation due to caregiving, family involvement, demands of caregiving, worry, caregiver feelings, spirituality and faith, benefits of caregiving.</description>
