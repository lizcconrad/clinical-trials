  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Late-life depression is a significant public health concern, and effective interventions for
      prevention and treatment are needed. Insomnia and inflammation are modifiable targets for
      depression prevention, and this study is significant in using an experimental approach (i.e.,
      inflammatory challenge) to probe acute inflammatory- and depression responses as a function
      of insomnia, which will inform identification of molecular targets for pharmacologic
      interventions, and improvement of insomnia treatments to prevent depression in older adults.

      This study will use an inflammatory challenge (i.e., endotoxin) to probe acute inflammatory-
      and depression responses (primary outcome) in older adults as a function of insomnia. Older
      adults with insomnia show chronic inflammation; sleep disturbance also activates inflammatory
      signaling; chronic inflammation primes acute inflammatory responses; chronic inflammation, as
      well as acute inflammatory reactivity, predict depression over the following year; and
      finally, endotoxin induces acute inflammation along with depressive symptoms, with
      preliminary evidence that &quot;two-hits&quot; (i.e., sleep disturbance and inflammatory challenge) are
      associated with exaggerated increases in depression, especially in women. In this
      placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study of low dose endotoxin in older adults
      (60-80 y; stratified by sex) with insomnia (n=80) vs. comparisons without insomnia (n=80),
      the investigators hypothesize that older adults with insomnia will show heightened
      inflammatory- and affective responding to inflammatory challenge as compared to those without
      insomnia. The investigation aims to: 1) examine differences in depressive symptoms and
      measures of negative affect responding as a function of insomnia and inflammatory challenge;
      2) examine differences in measures of positive affect responding as a function of insomnia
      and inflammatory challenge; and 3) examine differences in experimentally-induced inflammation
      in relation to depressive symptoms and measures of negative- and positive affect responding
      as a function of insomnia.

    <description>The Depressed Mood Subscale of the POMS is a self-reported assessment of depressed mood in which subjects rate severity of depressed mood using a visual analog scale from 1 to 5 (5 being most severe). Each timepoint is scored and analyses examine the temporal profile of change with assessment every hour</description>

    <measure>Emotion Facial Recognition Task</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is a computer-based test that includes color photographs of facial expression of evoked—or felt—emotions: happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, and nonemotional or neutral. Participants rate the emotional valence using a scale of 0-8 of each expression.</description>

    <measure>Reward Learning Task</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This is a probabilistic reward task that is administered using computerized reward-learning task rooted in signal detection theory that yields an objective measurement of participant's ability to modulate behavior as a function of rewards. The variable that will be scored is termed response bias (RB), which reflects participants' preference for the stimulus paired with more frequent rewards.</description>
