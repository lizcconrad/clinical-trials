  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and hemostatic effectiveness of
      EVARREST as an adjunct to controlling mild to moderate soft hepatic parenchyma or soft tissue
      bleeding during open hepatic, abdominal, pelvic, retroperitoneal, and thoracic (non-cardiac)
      surgery in pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study evaluating the safety and effectiveness
      of EVARREST in controlling mild or moderate bleeding in hepatic parenchyma or soft tissue for
      which standard methods of achieving hemostasis are ineffective or impractical.

      Eligible subjects will be treated with EVARREST. Subjects will be followed post-operatively
      through discharge and at 30 days (+/-14 days) post-surgery.

      Enrollment will be staggered by age. The first group will include 31 subjects ≥1 years to &lt;18
      years of age and the subsequent group will include 4 subjects from 1 month (≥ 28 days from
      birth) to &lt;1 years of age. Ongoing safety assessment will ensure adequate safety monitoring
      occur during the staged enrollment.

      At least thirty-five (35) qualified pediatric subjects with an appropriate mild or moderate
      bleeding TBS will be enrolled in this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Pediatric subjects aged ≥28 days (≥1 month) to &lt;18 years, requiring non-emergent open
             hepatic, abdominal, retroperitoneal, pelvic or thoracic (non-cardiac) surgical
             procedures; i) The first 31 subjects to be enrolled will be subjects aged ≥1 years to
             &lt;18 years.

             ii) The next 4 subjects to be enrolled will be subjects aged ≥28 days to &lt;1 year.

          2. The subject's parent/legal guardian must be willing to give permission for the subject
             to participate in the trial, and provide written Informed Consent for the subject. In
             addition, assent must be obtained from pediatric subjects who possess the intellectual
             and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the trial. If the
             pediatric subject is not able to provide assent (due to age, maturity and/or inability
             to intellectually and/or emotionally comprehend the trial), the parent/legal
             guardian's written Informed Consent for the subject will be acceptable for the subject
             to be included in the study.

          3. Presence of an appropriate mild or moderate bleeding soft tissue or hepatic parenchyma
             Target Bleeding Site (TBS) identified intra-operatively by the surgeon;

          4. Ability to firmly press trial treatment at TBS until 4 minutes after TBS
             identification.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or is unwilling to receive blood products;

          2. Female subjects, of childbearing age (i.e. adolescent), who are pregnant or nursing;

          3. Subject is currently participating or plan to participate in any other investigational
             device or drug study without prior approval from the Sponsor;

          4. Subjects who are known, current alcohol and/or drug abusers

          5. Subjects admitted for trauma surgery

          6. Subjects with any pre or intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may
             preclude conduct of the study procedure.

          7. Subject with TBS in an actively infected field (Class III Contaminated or Class IV
             Dirty or Infected)

          8. TBS is from large defects in arteries or veins where the injured vascular wall
             requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and which would result in
             persistent exposure of EVARREST to blood flow and pressure during healing and
             absorption of the product;

          9. TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;

         10. Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine.
