  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD9291 is an oral potent irreversible EGFR TKI selective for sensitizing EGFR mutation and
      T790M resistance mutation but sparing wild-type EGFR. Preclinical studies indicate that
      AZD9291 has significant exposure in the brain and activity against EGFR mutant brain
      metastasis. In addition, anti-tumor activities of AZD9291 in patients with advanced stage
      EGFR mutant NSCLC including patients with brain metastasis have been reported in an ongoing
      Phase I study. More recently, AZD9291 at a dose of 160mg also showed promising efficacy in
      heavily pre-treated patients with leptomeningeal disease from EGFR mutant NSCLC. Among 11
      evaluable for response, 6 patients had LM imaging improvement and 3 out of 7 patients with
      abnormal neurological exam at baseline had symptomatic improvement. Compared to AZD9291,
      other 3rd generation EGFR TKIs, rociletinib or HM61713 has not been reported to be effective
      in most of CNS disease of NSCLC. Further, previous studies with AZD9291 showed anecdotal case
      series or undetermined for T790M mutation status, indicating more systematic study is
      warranted.

      Based on these data, the investigators are going to conduct phase II study of AZD9291 in
      NSCLC patients harboring T790M mutation who failed EGFR TKIs and brain and/or leptomeningeal
      metastasis.

      1. Primary end points

             -  Overall response rate (ORR) in CNS -brain metastasis cohort

             -  Overall survival - Leptomeningeal with or without brain metastasis cohort

        2. Secondary end points

             -  Whole body disease control rate (DCR)

             -  Time to brain progression

             -  Progression free survival (PFS) in BM cohort

             -  Overall survival (OS)

             -  Adverse events (AEs)

             -  Exploratory analysis of EGFR mutation/T790M in tissue, plasma or cerebrospinal
                fluid (CSF)

        3. Treatment AZD9291 160mg po daily (1 cycle of 28 days)

        4. Total patient sample size Eligible patients will be divided into two cohorts, brain
           metastasis (BM) cohort and leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) with or without BM cohort. The
           two patient cohorts use different primary endpoints.

        5. BM cohort For the BM cohort, the primary outcome is overall response (CR+PR). Let P
           denote the overall response rate of AZD9291. From some preliminary data of response in
           the brain or leptomeningeal seeding with AZD 9291 in phase II AURA and BLOOM study, we
           hypothesized that H0:P= 10% and H1:P =30%. The BM cohort uses Simon's optimal two-stage
           design as follows.

           Stage 1: Treat n1 = 18 patients. If r1 = 2 or fewer patients respond, stop the BM cohort
           concluding that the study therapy is inefficacious. Otherwise, proceed to Stage 2.

           Stage 2: Treat additional n2 = 17 patients. If r = 6 or fewer patients respond among the
           cumulative n1 + n2 = 35 patients, then conclude that the study therapy is inefficacious.
           Otherwise, accept the study therapy for further investigation.

           This design has 1-sided alpha = 5% for P0 = 10% and power = 90% for P1 = 30%.
           Considering about 10%, of attrition due to ineligibility and dropout, a total of 40
           patients will be enrolled into the BM cohort.

        6. LM ± BM cohort

           The primary outcome of the LM ± BM cohort is overall survival (OS). Let μ denote the
           median OS of AZD9291 in this cohort. Based on some preliminary results (we need a
           reference), we hypothesize that H0: μ=3 months vs. H1: μ=5 months. Assuming an
           exponential OS distribution under H0, the investigators will conduct the 1-sample
           log-rank test. In this cohort, the investigators expect an accrual rate of 30 patients
           per year and about 10% of attrition, and will have an additional follow-up of 6 months
           after completion of accrual. Under these assumptions, we need N=40 patients (D=29
           deaths) for 90% of power by the 1-sample log-rank test with 1-sided alpha=5% (refer to
           Kwak and Jung 2013). The trial of this cohort is expected to take about 22 months (=16
           months for patient accrual + 6 months for additional follow-up).

        7. Statistical analysis plan

      The analysis is conducted separately for each cohort. OS, PFS, and time to brain progression
      will be summarized by Kaplan-Meier method. DCR and AEs will be summarized using contingency
      tables. Cohort specific analyses are conducted as follows.

      BM cohort

      Two-stage testing on ORR will be conducted as described in &quot;Target number&quot; section. If the
      final sample size is different from n1=18 or n1 + n2=35, then a 1-sided p-value will be
      calculated by Jung et al. (2006) and accept the experimental therapy if it is smaller than
      alpha = 5%. The ORR will be unbiasedly estimated by Jung and Kim (2004), and its confidence
      interval will be calculated by Jennison and Turnbull (1983).

      LM ± BM cohort

      The final analysis of this cohort will be conducted when D29 deaths are observed, which is
      expected to be about 22 months from the study open. The investigators will conduct a 1-sample
      log-rank test assuming the exponential OS distribution with a median of 3 months under H0.
