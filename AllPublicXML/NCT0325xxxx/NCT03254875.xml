      The aim of the study is to evaluate whether a screening-based individually tailored nurse
      navigator intervention compared to standard care significantly reduce psychological and
      physical symptoms among women being treated for breast cancer who had moderate-to-severe
      distress (score ≥ 7 on the distress thermometer).

      During a 2-year period, 758 patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer will be screened for
      inclusion at the Section of Breast Surgery at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen. Of these 324
      participants enter the randomized controlled trial (RCT) and are randomized in a
      computer-generated sequence of 1:1 to the intervention (nurse-navigation) or control group
      (standard care). A total of 432 participants will enter an observational questionnaire study.
      All participants are followed for 1,5 years.
