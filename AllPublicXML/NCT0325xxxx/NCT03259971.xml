  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric movement disorders comprise of a large number of different neurological diseases
      including Rett syndrome (RTT) and Tourette syndrome. Studies in the literature as well as our
      preliminary reports showed that Rett syndrome and Tourette syndrome/Tic disorders are
      associated with a dysbiosis of the gut microbiota compared to normal control. Probiotic
      Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 is a diet supplement that available for human consumption.
      Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 had showed psychotropic effects such as ameliorate
      anxiety- and depression-like behaviors as well as altered the level of neurotransmitters such
      as dopamine in the brain in animal models, which might be through microbiota-gut-brain axis.
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to access the possible neurobehavior effects of
      Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 in Rett syndrome and Tic disorders/Tourette syndrome.

      The study is a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized study, to determine the benefits of
      probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 vs placebo on symptoms for Tic disorders; and the
      symptoms, behavior, or cognition for Rett syndrome.

      Patients with the Rett syndrome and Tic disorders/Tourette syndrome will be recruited into
      our study.The study period will last 4 months for Rett syndrome patients, age one
      year-50years; while 2 months for Tic disorders/Tourette syndrome patient, age 8 years-18
      years.

      The study will be performed in National Taiwan University Children Hospital. The patients
      will have neuropsychological and gut microbiota evaluation before and at the end of the
      study. There will also be interim follow up evaluations each month after the patient start
      taking the probiotic or placebo.
