  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether eating breakfast or having no breakfast has
      subsequent beneficial health effects, specifically in relation to glycemic response
      throughout the day and postprandial insulin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) responses 6
      hours after breakfast/lunch.

      This will be a randomised, crossover study with two treatments in total. 1.) Subjects given
      with breakfast, 2.) Subjects not given breakfast. Each of the two test visits will last for
      approximately 9 hour (spanning over 3 days), during which the following will take place: On
      Day 1, subjects will come to have the continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS) system inserted.
      CGMS will be used to measure 24 hour blood glucose concentrations. On Day 2, an indwelling
      catheter will be inserted into the ante cubital fossa or forearm vein of one arm and will be
      kept patent. One fasting blood sample (baseline; 4 milliliters of venous blood) will be
      collected. Participants with breakfast treatment will then consume the test meal within 15
      minutes. Subsequently, blood samples will be taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180
      minutes.At time 180 minutes, participants will be given a standardized lunch to be consumed
      within 30 minutes. Blood samples will be taken after lunch at 210, 240, 270, 300, 330 and 360
      minutes. On Day 3, subjects will need to come for removal of the CGMS sensor. Subjects will
      come to the CNRC again for the 2nd test visit, with at least 3 days wash-out in-between
      visits.
