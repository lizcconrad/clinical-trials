  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systematic evaluation of pain, agitation and delirium in ICU-patients is recommended and deep
      sedation should be avoided. Sedation is still monitored with clinical assessments, like RASS.
      The Responsiveness Index (RI) is a recently described method for ICU sedation monitoring. It
      is based on processed frontal EMG and reflects the interaction between a patient's conscious
      state and the intensity and frequency of stimulations during treatment. RI has not been
      randomly compared to RASS to titrate sedation to target at a clinically adequate sedation
      state. In this open randomized controlled pilot study of 32 critically ill, mechanically
      ventilated adult patients, investigators will evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy
      of RI based sedation compared to standard RASS based titration of sedation. Investigators
      hypothesize first that RI controlled sedation will be safe and, second that RI controlled
      sedation will associate with increased number of ventilator free days alive in 30 days
      without excess adverse events.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation of intensive care patients is needed for patient's safety but deep sedation is
      associated with adverse outcomes. Frontal electromyogram based Responsiveness Index (RI) aims
      to quantify patient's arousal. RI monitoring together with staff education may have potential
      to improve sedation quality. Investigators will evaluate the safety of RI based sedation
      versus standard care using Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) for sedation.

      Methods: randomized study, critically ill adult patients with mechanical ventilation and
      administration of sedation to either RI- or RASS-guided sedation. Propofol (and midazolam
      combined with if needed) as a hypnotic drug and oxycodone as an analgesic drug. Investigators
      will follow standardized sedation protocol in both groups to achieve the predetermined target
      sedation level: either RI 40-80 (RI-group) or RASS -3-0 (RASS group). RI measurement is
      continuous in both groups, but blinded in the RASS group. Accordingly, RI group is blinded to
      RASS assessments. State Entropy (SE) will register in both groups.

    <description>Sedation is guided with RASS. Targeted sedation level is RASS -3 - 0. Propofol: an initial rate of 2.4 mg/kg/h for one hour. Thereafter, the infusion rate of propofol is 0.8-4 mg/kg/h to reach or maintain the target RASS score. Propofol bolus of 20-40 mg is allowed. Oxycodone as 3-6 mg boluses for pain management. Other opiates are not allowed. Midazolam may given if the maximum dose of propofol is reached and pain management by oxycodone restricted achievement of the target sedation level. Midazolam will supply intravenously in boluses of 1-2 mg (based on the weight of the patient), starting at 3 boluses/h for the first hour. Dexmedetomidine and other sedatives are not allowed.</description>
