      The investigators conduct a randomized controlled trial among 70 healthy college students in
      Shanghai, China. These students fulfilling the recruitment criteria will be randomly divided
      into two parallel groups to receive either fish oil [marine-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (PUFA)] or sunflower seed oil. Participants in fish oil group receive 2.5 g/day (two
      1.25-g capsules daily) in divided doses. The sunflower seed oil capsules are identical. All
      interventions started at 7:30 a.m.to avoid issues related to diurnal variation. Health
      endpoints, including blood pressure, fractional exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary function
      were evaluated and biological samples such as morning urine, fast blood, saliva sample,buccal
      cells and skin tape stripping will be collected at week 1 before supplemenatation, and week
      8, week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.The investigators
      measure personal real-time exposure to PM2.5 and personal temperature and relative humidity.

    <measure>Change in biomarkers of oxidative stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Venous blood,buccal sample, and saliva sample are obtained at week 1 before supplementation,and week 8,week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.</time_frame>
    <description>The biomarkers of oxidative stress, for example total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase(SOD), glutathione peroxidase(GSH-Px), malonaldehyde(MDA), oxidized LDL(Ox-LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA),8-Hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-isoprostane,will be measured.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in biomarkers of inflammation,coagulation,vasoconstriction</measure>
    <time_frame>Venous blood,buccal sample,saliva sample and skin tape stripping are obtained at week 1 before supplementation,and week 8,week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.</time_frame>
    <description>The inflammatory biomarkers, for example fibrinogen,interleukin-6,interleukin-8, interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The biomarkers of coagulation include plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and tissue plasminogen activator and D-dimer. The biomarkers of vasoconstriction include endothelin-1 and eNOS and so on, well be measured.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pulmonary function</measure>
    <time_frame>Pulmonary function is measured at week 1 before supplementation,and week 8,week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.</time_frame>
    <description>The pulmonary function includes forced vital capacity(FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood pressure is measured at week 1 before supplementation,and week 8,week 10, week 12 as well as week 14 during the supplementation phase.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators evaluate systolic blood pressure (SBP),diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP, the difference of SBP and DBP).</description>

    <description>Participants of this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial include 70 healthy Chinese adults. The investigators randomly assign participants to two parallel groups at baseline using a random-number table. Compliance is determined by directly observed supplement intake. Participants in fish oil group are assigned to receive 2.5 g/day in divided doses. Each capsule contains 60% n-3 PUFA [24% docosahexanoic acid (C22:6 n-3 DHA) and 36% eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5 n-3 EPA)].</description>
