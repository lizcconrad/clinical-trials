  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older hypogonadal obese veterans previously participated in a 6 month lifestyle change
      (diet-induced weight loss and exercise) study with or without testosterone replacement
      therapy before being followed for the following year at the clinic while receiving standard
      of care consisting of diet and exercise counseling (for healthy lifestyle change) and
      testosterone replacement therapy. This study will determine if long-term lifestyle change and
      testosterone replacement therapy with associated improvement in physical and metabolic health
      can be maintained in obese older adults.

      Background: There are studies on long-term testosterone replacement in older adults with
      hypogonadism showing benefits on body composition, sexual function and mood but not on
      testosterone replacement therapy in combination with lifestyle change (diet-induced weight
      loss and exercise) in the specific population of older adults with both obesity and
      hypogonadism.

      Purpose: To determine if long-term lifestyle change and testosterone replacement therapy with
      associated improvement in physical and metabolic health can be maintained in obese older
      adults .

      Design: Overweight/obese older veteran patients with obesity and hypogonadism who are being
      followed at the endocrine clinic while receiving standard of care consisting of diet and
      exercise counseling (for healthy lifestyle change) and testosterone replacement therapy will
      be recruited for testing of physical, metabolic, cognitive/mood, quality of life, and body
      composition testing.

    <description>The primary functional outcome is the modified physical performance test, which includes seven standardized tasks (walking 50 ft, putting on and removing a coat, picking up a penny, standing up from a chair, lifting a book, climbing one flight of stairs, and performing a progressive Romberg tests) plus two additional tasks (climbing up and down four flights of stairs and performing a 360-degree turn). The score for each task ranges form 0 to 4; a perfect score is 36.</description>
