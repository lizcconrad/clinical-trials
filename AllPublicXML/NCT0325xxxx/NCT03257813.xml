      Aim: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the PRO-122 ophthalmic solution manufactured by
      Laboratorios Sophia S.A. de C.V. versus Krytantek Ofteno® ophthalmic solution like
      hypotensive therapy in subjects with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

      Study design: a multicentric, prospective, crossover (2x2), double blind clinical study.
      Sample size: one hundred patients with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
      Patients in the period 1: In the first sequence 60 patients will be assigned to receive the
      ophthalmic solution: Krytantek Ofteno ® (timolol 0.5%%/brimonidine 0.2%/dorzolamide 2%) 1
      drop B.I.D. during 30 days and the second sequence 60 patients will be assigned to receive
      the ophthalmic solution: PRO-122 1 drop B.I.D. during 30 days in the same period. Washout
      period: 20 hours. Patients in the period 2: the pharmacological intervention change to the
      opposite therapy for 30 days

      The American Academy of Ophthalmology Glaucoma Panel: The primary open angle glaucoma (POAG)
      is a progressive, chronic optic neuropathy in adults in which intraocular pressure (IOP) and
      other currently unknown factors contribute to damage and in which, in the absence of other
      identifiable causes, there is a characteristic acquired atrophy of the optic nerve and loss
      of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. This condition is associated with an anterior
      chamber angle that is open by gonioscopic appearance.

      This is a multicentric, crossover, double blind and prospective clinical study. The
      investigators will include patients with confirmed diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma
      or ocular hypertension, with target intraocular pressure (TIOP) within a range at which a
      patient is likely to remain stable or at which worsening of glaucoma will be slow enough that
      the risk of additional intervention is not justified.

      Patients will be randomly divided into 2 groups, one of them treated with a known formulation
      of timolol 0.5%/brimonidine 0.2%/dorzolamide 2% (Krytantek Ofteno®, Laboratorios Sophia,
      Mexico) and the other one treated with PRO-122 ophthalmic solution. Patients will receive 1
      drop B.I.D. into the lower conjunctival sac of either formulations and were examined at days:
      1, 15, 30, 45 and 61 after initiation of treatment. A phone call security at day 75 will be
      performed.

      Primary efficacy outcome: To evaluate the efficacy of PRO-122 versus Krytantek Ofteno®
      instilled onto the ocular surface in subjects with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) or
      ocular hypertension (HTO), to control and maintenance of the target intraocular pressure
      (TIOP).

    <intervention_model_description>60 subjects with diagnosis of open angle primary glaucoma with mild, moderate or severe damage and / or with intraocular hypertension users of Krytantek Ofteno® at least two previous months and are under control Of the corresponding IOP target.
a study group A or B will be randomly assigned, in group A, therapy with Krytantek Ofteno® will be continued for 30 days, in which the subject will be evaluated again and switched from therapy to solution PRO-122 which will be used for 30 days until the 60th day, date of the final visit.
In the case of those assigned to group B on day 1, the change to PRO-122 solution will be made for 30 continuous days until the date of revision on day 30, the day on which treatment with Krytantek Ofteno® will be restored to continue until the Day 60 for the final evaluation.
The selected subjects will be observed for 60 days.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Masking will be carried out using identical boxes in the primary package in both groups.
Blinding for the research subject and the investigator will be carried out by using labels containing the assignation number, which will replace the original labels in the case of the comparator. Due to the nature of the primary containers of the research products, single-dose vials and multidose bottle, it is not possible to use identical labels.</masking_description>
