    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, open label, dose-escalation study of the mAb 3BNC117-LS administered
      intravenously in HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-uninfected individuals and HIV-infected
      individuals. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of a single infusion of 3BNC117-LS in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected
      individuals.

    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a Phase 1, open label, dose escalation cohort study of 3BNC117-LS
      administered intravenously in HIV-uninfected and HIV-1 infected participants.

      Study participants will be administered a single intravenous infusion of 3BNC117-LS at one of
      three increasing dose levels (3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) and will be followed for 48
      weeks after 3BNC117-LS administration.

      This trial will enroll 15 to 30 participants into 5 study groups.

      First, eligible participants will be enrolled in Group 1A (n=3-6; HIV-uninfected, 3 mg/kg)
      and participants will be administered 3BNC117-LS at least one day apart. No more than 2
      participants in Group 1A will be administered 3BNC117-LS in a given week.

      Enrollment in Group 1B (n=3-6; HIV-uninfected, 10 mg/kg) and Group 2B (n=3-6; HIV-infected on
      or off ART (antiretroviral therapy), 10 mg/kg) will begin after participants enrolled in
      Group 1A reach day 42 with ≤ 1 dose limiting toxicity (DLT: any adverse event of grade 3 or
      greater toxicity, if the study investigators recognize a probable or definite attribution to
      3BNC117-LS). Participants will be administered 3BNC117-LS at least one day apart.

      Enrollment in Group 1C (n=3-6; HIV-uninfected, 30 mg/kg) will begin after participants
      enrolled in Group 1B reach day 42 with ≤ 1 DLT. The first 3 participants enrolled in Group 1C
      will be administered 3BNC117-LS at least one day apart, and no more than 2 participants will
      be administered 3BNC117-LS in a given week. After the first 3 participants enrolled in Group
      1C reach day 42 with ≤ 1 DLT, the remaining 3 participants will be enrolled, and administered
      3BNC117-LS at least one day apart.

      Enrollment in Group 2C (n=3-6; HIV-infected on or off ART, 30 mg/kg) will begin after
      participants enrolled in Group 2B reach day 42 with ≤ 1 DLT. The first 3 participants
      enrolled in Group 2C will be administered 3BNC117-LS at least one day apart. After the first
      3 participants enrolled in Group 2C reach day 42 with ≤ 1 DLT, the remaining 3 participants
      will be enrolled, and administered 3BNC117-LS at least one day apart.

      Following 3BNC117-LS infusion, study participants will return for safety assessments at weeks
      1, 2 and 4 following infusion, then bi-monthly or monthly until the end of study follow up.

      Serum samples for PK (pharmacokinetic) measurements will be collected before 3BNC117-LS
      infusion, at the end of the infusion, and at multiple time points during study follow up.

      Samples will also be collected for measurement of HIV-1 plasma RNA levels before 3BNC117-LS
      infusion (screen, pre-infusion and day 0) and at all follow up visits in Groups 2B and 2C.

      All participants will be followed for 48 weeks after 3BNC117-LS infusion.
