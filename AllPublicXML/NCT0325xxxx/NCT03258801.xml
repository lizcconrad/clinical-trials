  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is currently one of the most common
      diagnoses for patients under evaluation for lung transplantation. In recent years, an
      absolute increase in prevalence/ incidence of IPF has been observed. There is evidence that
      patients with IPF on waiting list for lung transplantation might benefit from pirfenidone
      treatment. Until now, no data are published regarding this important issue in lung
      transplantation.

      Primary objective is to determine whether there is a difference in the duration time of
      mechanical ventilation (weaning) directly after lung transplantation between patients treated
      with pirfenidone and patients without pirfenidone treatment. The Secondary objectives are to
      determine whether there are differences between the pirfenidone treatment group and the
      control group regarding survival after LUTX, the score on the Saint Georges Respiratory
      Questionnaire and the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC%) In this Investigator initiated,
      non- interventional single center study , patients on the waiting list for transplant
      pirfenidone treatment receive oral pirfenidone at the standard dose of 2403 mg per day. The
      treatment duration will range from 6 to 12 months. A control group will be used to correlate
      the outcome-parameters for a descriptive comparison. The control group includes patients with
      IPF on the waiting list who were on another IPF specific (or no) treatment for IPF The Study
      Population are Patients aged between 40-70 years who are admitted to the lung transplantation
      department and fulfill the international criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (
      existence of a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern in the high-resolution computed
      tomography (HRCT) is necessary).

      Variables: Duration of mechanical ventilation after LUTX (hours), Forced Vital capacity
      relative to reference value at baseline (FVC0%), Forced Vital capacity relative to reference
      value after 6 months (FVC6%),Forced Vital capacity relative to reference value after 12
      months (FVC12%) Study Size: 30 patients in the Pirfenidone group, 20 patients in the control
      group.

      For the primary Endpoint, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum of the
      weaning time of patients who received a pirfenidone treatment, as well as of patients from
      the control group will be computed and presented in a table. Additionally, a Kaplan-Meier
      curve will be estimated and plotted alongside the respective 95% CI calculated using the
      method of Brookmeyer and Crowley. Furthermore, a stepwise linear regression using forward
      selection and Age, RBMI, FVC0%, (FVC6%-FVC0%), TLC, FEV1% and ECMO, as well as the
      pirfenidone treatment as predictors will be computed. The null hypothesis is that the
      pirfenidone treatment has no influence on the weaning time. The according model coefficient
      estimate and standard error will be used to test the null hypothesis using a t-test at
      significance level Î±=0.05.

      For the secondary endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum of
      patients who received a pirfenidone treatment, as well as of patients from the control group
      will be computed and presented in a tableStepwise Cox Regression using forward selection and
      Age, RBMI, FVC0%, (FVC6%-FVC0%) and ECMO, as well as the pirfenidone treatment as predictors
      will be computed in order to compare the treatment and the control group a . If p-values are
      calculated for the secondary endpoint analysis, they serve only descriptive purposes.
      Therefore no multiple testing corrections are applied.
