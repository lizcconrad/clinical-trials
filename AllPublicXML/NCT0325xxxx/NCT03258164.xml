  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to examine whether enrichment of a fat graft with
      autologous ex vivo expanded ASC injected into the breast tissue or face, both for cosmetic
      use, will significantly improve the results of conventional lipofilling and synthetic facial
      fillers, thereby being able to offer a safer, more natural and long-lasting alternative to
      current artificial solutions for cosmetic patients.
