      In the field of management of cancer, many approaches have been used since tens of years,
      particularly in regard of pain management, both in achieving surgical or invasive procedures
      in the pain induced by the disease itself. the investigators owe the first description in
      1829 Chapelin and col who used hypnosis in a patient with breast cancer in which a mastectomy
      should be performed. Meta-analysis (2000) showed the positive impact of analgesia obtained
      through hypnosis on the perception of pain intensity. In children in whom regular venous
      punctures is performed, using hypnosis seems indisputable on the management of anticipatory
      anxiety, leading to a better experience of the act itself. Regarding the nausea and vomiting
      induced by chemotherapy, numerous studies are old, not always randomized and performed often
      before the era of the setrons; but seems favorable impact on anticipated nausea and vomiting,
      the updated studies should emerge on the issue of delayed emesis which remain a serious
      adverse event and not completely resolved. Mark to improve the EORTC validated tools of
      quality of life measurement widely used for example in ovarian cancer.

      The impact of hypnosis on the quality of life or the side effects of treatment or
      rehospitalization for toxicity remains controversial (Judson, 2011). A meta-analysis
      combining the tests carried out before and after the era of setrons (Richardson, 2007)
      concluded that the effectiveness of the anticipated nausea and vomiting.

      In this context,the investigators proposed to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the
      role and impact of medical Ericksonian hypnosis on acute and delayed adverse event (incl
      nausea and vomiting) in female patients treated by adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      The main objective is to assess the feasibility of an intervention based on medical
      Ericksonian hypnosis as a complementary therapy in patients treated with surgery after a
      diagnosis of breast cancer, followed by an indication of adjuvant chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy

    <description>The main objective is to assess the feasibility of an intervention based on medical Ericksonian hypnosis as a complementary therapy in patients treated with surgery after a diagnosis of breast cancer, followed by an indication of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
Primary endpoint is the proportion of patients rated as being compliant to self-hypnosis sessions during adjuvant chemotherapy (6 sessions). A patient is considered as compliant if it achieves at least 2/3 of the planned self-hypnosis sessions, that is, 4 of 6 planned sessions.</description>
