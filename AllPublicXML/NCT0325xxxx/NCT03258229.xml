  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a 8 weeks, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 2×2 cross-over design
      human trial. Twenty subjects were randomly divided into Angelica gigas N. extract or a
      placebo group. Fasting and postprandial glucose profiles during oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) were assessed before and after the intervention.
