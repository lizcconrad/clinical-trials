  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to create predictive models of emergency care and metrics for
      population health that can be used to analyze how events like hospital closures or disasters
      like Hurricane Sandy affect health care utilization by patients in specific populations or
      geographic regions. Additionally, it will allow the development of metrics for population
      health that can act as surveillance mechanisms to measure disease prevalence and identify
      patterns in emergency department use that can be used to identify specific geographic regions
      where health care is either optimized to promote health or needs to be improve so that
      population health can be improved.

      The purpose of this study is to analyze the geographic patterns of emergency department
      utilization. This study will look at the relationship that geographic proximity and local
      population factors have on patient use of emergency departments. Geographic proximity of
      alternative hospitals and elicit other patient and hospital specific factors, such as
      demographic, insurance type, diagnosis, and socioeconomic factors that lead patients to
      choose specific hospitals for emergency care or generally lead to patients accessing
      emergency care will be compared.

      Patterns of emergency department utilization by patients will be identified in specific
      geographies such as Census tracts to determine clusters of high and low emergency department
      use. We also analyze the patterns of emergency care use based on specific disease
      conditions.Investigators will analyze the rate of emergency department use for patients with
      diabetes to determine population prevalence of diseases using emergency department data.
      Studying the pattern of use by specific geographies or disease conditions will also allow us
      to understand how emergency department use varies among populations by geographies and the
      socioeconomic and health care factors local to those regions.
