  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meclizine hydrochloride is an antihistamine widely used for treatment of vertigo and motion
      sickness. In HCC it has been used for anti-emetic effects, but it is used here as a CAR
      (constitutive androstane receptor) inverse agonist.

      The hypothesis of this study is that meclizine, a CAR inverse agonist, will have a beneficial
      therapeutic effect in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are candidates for surgical
      resection, ablation or TACE (trans-arterial chemoembolization) by blocking tumorigenesis and
      inducing apoptosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is a nuclear receptor that plays a central
      role in hepatic detoxification of potentially toxic compounds, or xenobiotics. Chronic CAR
      activation by specific agonists induces tumors in wild type mice, and strongly promotes
      hepatocarcinogenesis in combination with initiating mutagens. Both effects are absent in CAR
      null mice. These tumorigenic effects are associated with an acute induction of hepatocyte
      proliferation in mice. Preliminary results using partially humanized mice demonstrate a very
      similar proliferative effect of CAR activation in human hepatocytes.

      The transcriptional activity of CAR can be reversed by specific inverse agonists. These
      ligands are analogous to steroid receptor antagonists, converting the transcriptional
      activation of the agonist bound receptor into transcriptional repression. These compounds are
      termed inverse agonists because they do not depend on the presence of agonist ligands to
      exert their repressive effects. Mouse and human CAR proteins are more divergent than other
      nuclear receptors, and respond to quite different profiles of agonists and inverse agonists.
      Preliminary results demonstrate that the specific mouse CAR inverse agonist androstanol
      blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in mouse liver tumors. This raises the possibility
      that targeting CAR may represent a new modality of treatment for hepatocellular cancer (HCC)
      analogous to estrogen and androgen receptor antagonists in breast and prostate cancers.
      Meclizine, a widely used antihistamine medication for vertigo and motion sickness, is an
      inverse agonist ligand of human CAR. Investigators hypothesize that reversing CAR function
      with meclizine will have a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients with HCC by blocking
      proliferation and inducing apoptosis.

      Investigators therefore propose a novel window of opportunity trial in which biopsy proven
      HCC patients will receive oral meclizine daily for 28 days while awaiting surgical resection,
      radiofrequency ablation, or transarterial chemoembolization. The primary test of treatment
      outcome will be the predicted decrease in expression of downstream CAR target genes (CYP2B6,
      MYC and FOXM1) in pre and post treatment tumor specimens. Investigators will also measure the
      change in tumor proliferation and apoptosis by measuring Ki-67 proliferation index and TUNEL
      assays (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling assay), serum levels of
      AFP and GDF 15, and overall tumor response by imaging. HCC is the most rapidly increasing
      cause of cancer mortality in the United States and medical treatment options are limited.
      Successful completion of this study may identify a new approach to treatment of HCC.

    <description>Quantitative real time PCR(qPCR) can give change in expression level compared to control Delta CT value. Downstream target genes of CAR (CYP2b6,c-Myc, and FoxM) will be measured by qPCR in the pre and post treatment Hepatocellular cancer tissue specimens. The qPCR machine measures the intensity of fluorescence emitted by the probe at each cycle. The Ct measure is a determined PCR cycle and represents the basic result of a qPCR experience. The Ct is the value where the PCR curve crosses the threshold.</description>

          7. Patients should have life expectancy greater than/equal to 10 weeks.

          8. Willingness to Use Contraception: The effects of Meclizine on the developing human
             fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. Women of child-bearing
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             treatment with meclizine. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately. If a male participant impregnates his partner he should inform his
             treating physician immediately.

          9. Subjects must be informed of the investigational nature of this study, and must sign
             and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines.

         10. Patients taking medications with a narrow therapeutic index including warfarin,
             digoxin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and cyclosporine are not excluded but should be
             monitored carefully.

         11. Antiviral therapy for HCV and HBV is allowed, but patient should not be on interferon

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have no prior history of treatment for HCC (treatment naive).

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other anti-cancer therapy.

          3. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          5. Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions like anaphylaxis attributed to
             compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to Meclizine such as
             antihistamine drugs.

          6. Patient must not be a candidate for liver transplant.

          7. Child Pugh Class B (8,9) and Class C are excluded

          8. HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with meclizine.

          9. Patient must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within 6 months prior to
             registration, cardiac arrhythmia, glaucoma, asthma or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

         10. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because meclizine is a Class B agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with meclizine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with meclizine.
