  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive demyelinating disorder that damages white matter in
      the central nervous system. Although individuals experience mobility (e.g., walking, balance)
      impairments that lower quality of life and limit participation in daily activities, one of
      the most prominent symptoms is fatigue. Up to 92% of individuals report fatigue that
      manifests as lack of energy, exhaustion or worsening of MS symptoms and ultimately
      contributes to increasing disability. The currently available pharmaceutical treatments fail
      to fully control fatigue in the majority of individuals with MS; non-pharmacologic therapies
      such as exercise and behavioral therapies offer the best hope for combating MS fatigue in the
      majority of individuals.

      Exercise therapy is effective in reducing MS fatigue. However, access to exercise therapy is
      seriously limited for many individuals with MS due to geographical location, limited
      resources (e.g., financial, transportation), and/or disability. Thus, the development and
      evaluation of an alternative delivery method for exercise therapy to target MS-related
      fatigue that increases participation and reduces barriers is critical.

      In this study, the investigators will compare traditional in-person delivered exercise
      therapy to telephone-delivered exercise therapy to target fatigue in persons with MS.

    <intervention_name>Telephone-Delivered Exercise Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>A combination of aerobic and resistance training has been shown to be most effective for reducing fatigue in persons with MS.
Aerobic training will consist of: 30 minutes of either cycling, treadmill walking or overground walking, 2x/week. Participants will be given a wrist-worn pedometer with heart-rate monitor to track their heart rate during training. Participants will be progressed to reach 60-70% of their maximal heart rate during aerobic training over the course of the study.
Strength training will consist of hip extension, hip flexion, hip abduction, knee extension and knee flexion movements with resistance bands performed 3x/week.
This home exercise program will be paired with a 1x/week telephone call with an investigator.</description>
