  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) currently affects app. 2% of the western population and app. 10% of people
      &gt;75 years. In about 50% of patients with symptomatic HF ejection fraction (EF) is preserved
      (HF-PEF). Once patients develop symptoms, the prognosis is poor with 25% mortality at 1 year
      and 50% mortality at 5 years. HFpEF is one of the major unresolved areas in clinical
      cardiology. The diagnosis of HFpEF remains a diagnosis of exclusion and currently no
      non-invasive measure provides a clear diagnosis.

      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provides non invasive and radiation free evaluation
      of heart structure and function. New CMR parameters offer the possibility to describe the
      underlying pathological and physiological changes associated with HFpEF.

      The investigators propose to undertake the first systematic comparison between a CMR protocol
      and invasive haemodynamics as the best possible gold standard, as well as define the
      histopathological drivers in myocardial biopsies. The investigators will also examine the
      relations with tissue and serological biomarkers implicated in HFpEF and the role with
      standard and novel parameters by echocardiography. If successful, this study will provide
      tools for a reliable and accurate non-invasive characterization of patients with HFpEF,
      supporting the diagnosis and grading the severity of disease. This study will provide a
      reference basis for future diagnostic algorithms in HFpEF, both, for CMR and
      echocardiography, but also for their relative value in comparison to blood markers or
      invasive testing. In addition to a new pathway to acess the effects of current and novel
      therapeutic interventions, the investigators see the greatest potential in identifying a
      disease stage where the myocardial injury may be reversible.
