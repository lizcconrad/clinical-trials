  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis (inflammatory bowel disease, IBD) have
      increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC) when compared with that of the general
      population. Therefore patients with longstanding colitis undergo regular screening
      colonoscopy at varied time intervals depending on their individual risk. This is thought to
      detect early mucosal (interior bowel lining) abnormalities, known as dysplasia, which can
      progress to CRC. Until recently, IBD surveillance has relied upon colonoscopy with multiple
      (at least 33) random biopsies of the bowel lining to detect dysplasia, but now international
      guidelines recommended a technique called chromoendoscopy.

      Chromoendoscopy involves applying a dye, called indigo-carmine, to the bowel lining whilst
      performing colonoscopy which highlights more subtle abnormalities, therefore increasing
      dysplasia detection rate.

      There is no standard international concentration of the dye spray used during
      chromoendoscopy. Studies have used different concentrations of indigo-carmine dye ranging
      from 0.1 to 0.4%. We have recently shown that 0.2% dye improves detection rates compared to
      high definition white light. The recent international SCENIC guidelines suggest using 0.03%
      indigo-carmine via a foot pump. However there are no trials comparing the two methods and no
      previous trials have used the 0.03%. We therefore aim to perform a randomised control trial,
      comparing 0.03% indigo-carmine dye versus 0.2% in detecting dysplasia in patients undergoing
      surveillance colonoscopy in IBD. Any lesions seen will assessed using standard endoscopic
      appearance but also using optical biopsy forceps to further characterise the lesion, then
      manage the lesion as standard guidelines. We will also take two additional rectal biopsies,
      which will be snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then studied using Raman Spectroscopy, Infra
      Red spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance to develop optical markers to identify
      patients at higher risk of dysplasia.
