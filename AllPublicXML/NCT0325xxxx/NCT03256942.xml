      Primary objective:

      - To evaluate the sensitivity of the Merz Lip Fullness Assessment Scale (MLFAS).

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the clinical aesthetic improvement outcome in lips appearance four weeks
           after Etermis 4® injection.

        -  To evaluate safety/tolerability of Etermis 4® treatment in lips.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder rate for treated and for untreated lips at Visit 2 (Week 4), as assessed live by the blinded rater using the Merz Lip Fullness Assessment Scale (MLFAS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Response is defined as ≥ 1-point improvement on both the upper and lower lips compared to baseline. Upper and lower lips are to be assessed separately.
The MLFAS is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (very thin) to 4 (very full). A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline for treated and untreated lips at Visit 2 (Week 4) as assessed live by the blinded rater using MLFAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Upper and lower lips are to be assessed separately. The MLFAS is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (very thin) to 4 (very full). A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Agreement rate in treated subjects between MLFAS responders and Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (Investigator-GAIS) responders at Visit 2 (Week 4).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement for a subject is reached if he/she is a responder for both MLFAS and Investigator-GAIS or he/she is a non-responder for both MLFAS and Investigator-GAIS. GAIS response is defined as at least a &quot;+1 improved&quot; rating on the Investigator -GAIS.
The MLFAS is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (very thin) to 4 (very full). A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. The Investigator-GAIS is a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (very much worse) to +4 (very much improved).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Agreement rate in treated subjects between MLFAS responders and FACE-Q Satisfaction with Lips responders at Visit 2 (week 4).</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Agreement for a subject is reached if he/she is a responder for both MLFAS and FACE-Q Satisfaction with Lips or he/she is a non-responder for both MLFAS and FACE-Q Satisfaction with Lips. MLFAS is assessed by a blinded rater. MLFAS response is defined as ≥ 1-point improvement on both the upper and lower lips compared to baseline. FACE-Q Satisfaction with Lips is assessed by the treated subject at baseline and at Visit 2. FACE-Q Satisfaction with Lips response is defined as a positive change in the FACE-Q score.
The MLFAS is a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (very thin) to 4 (very full). A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. FACE-Q scores are derived from a questionaire of 10 questions relating to the satisfaction with lips appearance. Answers range from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 4 (very satisfied).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female study subjects with thin to medium lips volume (grade 1 to 2 on
             MLFAS), seeking for hyaluronic acid (HA) for lips volume augmentation in ≥1-point
             improvement on the MLFAS on both the upper and lower lips and fulfilling the criteria
             listed in the Instruction for Use (IFU) of the Study Medical Device to be injected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a medical condition and/or medication according to current IFU which is
             contra indicated for HA filler treatment, or prior facial surgeries or surgical
             permanent implants, lips augmentation treatment or other aesthetic procedure in the
             face that could interfere with performance assessment.
