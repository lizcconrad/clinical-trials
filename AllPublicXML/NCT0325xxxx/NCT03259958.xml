      Open label, randomized, 2-period, multiple-dose crossover study.

      Approximately 86 healthy, adult male and female subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences prior to the first study product
      treatment in treatment period 1.

      For each treatment period; subjects will receive donepezil for 5 consecutive weeks. Blood
      samples for donepezil PK will be collected pre-dose through week 10.

      Adhesion and skin irritation will be monitored throughout TDS treatments. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting, repeated clinical and laboratory
      evaluations.
