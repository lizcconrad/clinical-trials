  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation dose to interventional cardiologists performing transradial percutaneous coronary
      procedures is higher compared to those performing transfemoral exams. The radiation dose
      seems particularly high at pelvic level. We prepared an home-made protective extension of the
      leaded curtain under table that should reduce the operator exposure during interventional
      coronary procedures. The aim of the study is to evaluate the procedural efficacy of the
      protective extension on the operator radiation dose at pelvic level

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventional cardiologists are routinely exposed to x-rays during their activity increasing
      the risk of deterministic and stochastic effects. Consequently all the operators should be
      aware of the possible risks and they should apply all efforts to reduce the radiation dose
      according to the &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot; (ALARA) principle. Moreover interventional
      cardiologists have to utilise adequate protection devices (lead apron, protective thyroid
      collar, lead glasses).

      Operator performing transradial access procedures showed a significantly higher radiation
      exposure compared to those performing transfemoral interventions. So, transradial operators
      should use adjunctive protective shields (as leaded pelvic drapes placed on the patient
      abdomen) in order to reduce their radio-exposition.

      During transradial access a particularly high radiation exposure is observed at operator
      pelvic level and the use of the protective adjunctive drapes placed on the patient abdomen is
      only partially effective to control this exposition.

      Aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of a protective extension of the leaded curtain
      placed under the angiographic table in term of operator radiation exposure at pelvic level
