  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter dose escalation and extension study
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate
      safety / tolerability and preliminary effects of BEL-X-HG in patients with advanced
      refractory solid tumors. Dose escalation during the study will be made based on dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT).

      This study will be carried out in 2 parts:

      Part 1: A sequential Dose Escalation Part of four doses following a 3 + 3 design where dose
      escalation will be made based on dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), for a single cycle (28-days)
      of BEL-X-HG treatment

      Part 2: A Dose Extension Part of up to 5 cycles (28-days each) at the same dose level
      (starting dose) of BEL-X-HG treatment

      Up to 48 eligible subjects with confirmed advanced refractory solid tumors will be enrolled
      sequentially, in 3-patient cohorts, from the lower to the higher dose cohort into the study.
      Escalating dose levels of BEL-X-HG in 4 study cohorts will be as follows:

      Cohort 1: Dose level 1 - 0.5 g/day (0.25 g, bid)

      Cohort 2: Dose level 2 - 1.0 g/day (0.5 g, bid)

      Cohort 3: Dose level 3 - 2.0 g/day (1.0 g, bid)

      Cohort 4: Dose level 4 - 4.0 g/day (2.0 g, bid)

      BEL-X-HG will be administered orally at the assigned dose level for one cycle during the Dose
      Escalation Part to each subject. Thereafter, if eligible and willing, subjects can continue
      to Extension Part at the same assigned dose level of BEL-X-HG treatment.
