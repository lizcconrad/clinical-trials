  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of second-line treatment of
      apatinib in advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients and evaluate drug safety,
      progression free and overall survival. The primary endpoint of this study is objective
      response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).
