    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive and unpredictable disease of the central
      nervous system. In MS, various loss of strength, balance and gait disturbances arise in the
      central nervous system due to sensory and/or motor neuron degeneration. These disorders lead
      to limitations in individual activities and participation.

      Fatigue is as reported one of the most common first three symptoms among patients with MS and
      affects up to 80% of the patients. Fatigue is defined as the lack of physical and/or mental
      energy. Sometimes fatigue can reduce the quality of life by leaving other disorders behind.
      The most important effect of fatigue is that individuals reduce their physical activity
      levels. This can lead to the inactivity-related secondary problems being added to the
      findings of the disease. So the physical capacities of individuals may gradually decrease.

      In the literature, there are many studies showing that the level of physical activity of
      individuals with MS is lower than in healthy individuals. When the investigators analyze the
      studies that investigate the relation between fatigue and physical activity levels, it is
      seen that there is the single study about this subject in the literature.

      As a result, additional studies are needed to investigate the level of physical activity and
      the factors affecting it in individuals with MS. Therefore, the investigators planned this
      study to investigate the relationship between fatigue and physical activity levels in
      patients with MS.

      According to sample size calculation 37 diagnosed Multiple Sclerosis patients and 37 healthy
      individuals will be included.The demographic characteristics of the participants initially
      will be taken and Expanded Disability Status Scale score of those of MS will be recorded.
      Then, fatigue severity and perception, physical activity level, balance, peripheral muscle
      strength, functional mobility, functional exercise capacity will be evaluated. Primary
      outcomes are fatigue and physical activity level; secondary outcomes are balance, peripheral
      muscle strength, functional mobility, functional exercise capacity.

        Power analysis was performed using &quot;G * Powerversion3.1 program&quot; in order to determine the
        minimum number of subjects to be taken into operation. Accordingly, the number of
        participants in the study group (n) = 37 (α: 0.05, for power 80%) and in the control group
        (n) = 37).
