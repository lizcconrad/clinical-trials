  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A survey was conducted among physiotherapists and occupational therapists working with stroke
      patients. The survey consisted out of 30 questions enquiring personal information and upper
      limb specific topics divided in 3 sections: (1) Passive mobilization, (2) Active exercises
      and (3) Immobilization. The survey took approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete.

      The survey for stroke survivors was divided in seven sections: (1) Personal information (2)
      Motor recovery of the upper limb and expectations on upper limb recovery; (3) Comfort, pain
      and quality of life (QoL); (4) Immobilization ; (5) Physiotherapy; (6) Occupational therapy;
      (7) Nursing (only for patients less than 6 months after stroke). The length to complete the
      survey was also organized to be achieved in 20 to 30 minutes.
