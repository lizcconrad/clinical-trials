  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to validate our hypothesis that the magnetic ureteral
      stents have the same amount of adverse effects as the more commonly used non-magnetic
      ureteral stents. If this hypothesis would be confirmed then the usage of magnetic ureteral
      stents would be justified for both reducing patient discomfort by way of fewer cystoscopies
      and possibly also decreasing the overall expenditures of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many urological procedures involving the kidney and the ureters require a stent replacement
      to avoid un-wanted adverse invents caused by the procedure itself. The stenting, however,
      predisposes the patient to adverse effects of its own and the application and removal of the
      stent is a notable monetary expense. The use of magnetic ureteral stents that can be removed
      via catheter instead of requiring an additional cystoscopy for removal would reduce the
      discomfort to patients and also possibly decrease the expenditures of the overall treatment.
      However, the comparability of standard ureteral stents and the magnetic ureteral stents is
      largely unknown due to there being no published research on the subject as of this time. The
      specific aim of this study is to validate our hypothesis that the magnetic ureteral stents
      have the same amount of adverse effects as the more commonly used non-magnetic ureteral
      stents.

      The design is as prospective randomized, single-blinded, multi-institutional, non-inferiority
      study conducted in Hospital Districts of Southwest Finland, Päijät-Häme, Pohjois-Savo,
      Satakunta and Keski-Suomi. Using age and gender stratification, patients are randomised 1:1
      fashion into having a magnetic (n=85) or standard ureter stent (n=85). The primary objectives
      are the mean differences between the two groups in pain and urinary symptoms scores
      determined by the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire (USSQ) 4 weeks after stent placement.

      The patients will be recruited starting from the 3rd quarter of 2017 and ending during the
      3rd quarter of 2018. Preliminary analysis of all results will be available in September 2018
      and reports are expected to be written during December 2018.
