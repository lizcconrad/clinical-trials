      The endothelial cell layer is responsible for the control of vascular homeostasis, a process
      mediated by vasoconstricting and vasodilatory substances. The principal endothelium-dependent
      vascular dilator is nitric oxide (NO), and the reduction of its synthesis or bioavailability
      is the main cause for the development of endothelial dysfunction. The use of
      photobiostimulation may be beneficial in several clinical situations. At the endothelial
      level, the photostimulatory action on vascular endothelial growth factor, NO secretion,
      number of capillaries and proliferation of endothelial cells is outstanding.The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the effects of photobiostimulation on the arterial endothelial
      function of healthy individuals. The study design will be a cross-over trial and the sample
      will be composed of 12 healthy subjects selected by the eligibility criteria, and randomly
      randomized according to the order of intervention of the groups. The hypothesis is that at
      the end of the irradiation protocol with photobiostimulation an increase in endothelial
      function and blood markers of endothelial function occurs, and no tissue temperature
      variation. The research will be developed in room 709 of the Laboratory of Physiotherapy in
      building II, UFCSPA. Individuals will be randomly assigned to: group 1 (energy dose of 2J),
      group 2 (energy dose of 4J), group 3 (energy dose of 6J), and group 4 (placebo).

      Detailed Description: The endothelial cell layer is responsible for the control of vascular
      homeostasis, a process mediated by vasoconstricting and vasodilatory substances. The
      principal endothelium-dependent vascular dilator is nitric oxide (NO), and the reduction of
      its synthesis or bioavailability is the main cause for the development of endothelial
      dysfunction. The use of photobiostimulation may be beneficial in several clinical situations.
      At the endothelial level, the photostimulatory action on vascular endothelial growth factor,
      NO secretion, number of capillaries and proliferation of endothelial cells is outstanding. It
      has also been shown an increase in glutathione levels, antioxidant effect and angiogenic
      potential, which shows a potential vascular effect, and consequently, an improvement in
      endothelial function. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of
      photobiostimulation on the arterial endothelial function of healthy individuals. The study
      design will be a cross-over trial and the sample will be composed of 12 healthy subjects
      selected by the eligibility criteria, and randomly randomized according to the order of
      intervention of the groups. The hypothesis is that at the end of the irradiation protocol
      with photobiostimulation an increase in endothelial function and blood markers of endothelial
      function occurs, and no tissue temperature variation. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the effects of photobiostimulation on the arterial endothelial function of healthy
      individuals. The secondary objectives are: 1) To evaluate the effects of photobiostimulation
      on blood markers (hemogram) and endothelial markers (cGMP and L-arginine), and Nitric oxide
      (nitrite and nitrate). 2) To analyze associations between markers and metabolites with
      endothelial function due to the effects of Photobiostimulation. 3) Analyze the local
      temperature before and after photobiostimulation. 4) Analyze the local temperature before and
      after the measurement of Endothelial function. 5) Evaluate possible associations between
      blood and endothelial markers, nitric oxide pathway metabolites and Endothelial function with
      local temperature. 6) To compare the effects of energy doses of photobiostimulation on
      endothelial function, blood and endothelial markers, and metabolites of the nitric oxide
      pathway. The research will be developed in room 709 of the Laboratory of Physiotherapy in
      building II, UFCSPA and, for randomization, the simple technique will be used through numbers
      generated by a freely available software. The generation of the sequence of numbers will be
      done by blind researcher, after selection of the individuals by the eligibility criteria.
      Individuals will be randomly assigned to: group 1 (energy dose of 2J), group 2 (energy dose
      of 4J), group 3 (energy dose of 6J), and group 4 (placebo). The normality of the data will be
      evaluated by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data with symmetrical distribution will be presented as
      mean ± standard deviation, and data with asymmetric distribution as median and interquartile
      range (P25 - P75). The baseline characteristics of the patients will be compared by Student's
      t test or Mann-Whitney when the distributions are parametric or non-parametric, respectively.
      The categorical variables will be compared by the Chi-square test. Variance Analysis (ANOVA)
      will be used for repeated measures for pre and post-intervention data analysis, or the
      Mann-Whitney test (asymmetric distribution), followed by Bonferroni post hoc. The Pearson or
      Sperman correlations will be used for possible association between the analyzed variables.
      Statistical significance of 5% (p &lt;0.05) will be observed.

    <description>The low level laser therapy will be performed with the CHATTANOOGA® equipment and the probe cluster (head) from the same manufacturer. For the interventions in groups 1, 2 and 3 (photobiostimulation) will be used, respectively, the energy doses of 2, 4 and 6J. A 670nm wavelength with an output power of 10mW will be used. Group 4 intervention (placebo photobiostimulation) will be performed with the application of the device switched off. Each intervention will be performed in one day, with an interval of two days between each intervention. Photobiostimulation will be performed on the region of the radial and ulnar arteries of the left arm of each individual. The laser diode cluster probe will be placed in direct contact with the skin.</description>
