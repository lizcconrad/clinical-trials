  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of laryngeal mask (LMA) for the purpose of providing airway safety of patients is a
      common method in general anesthesia practice. This practice does not require laryngoscopy and
      there is no laryngeal and tracheal stimulation until endotracheal intubation, so an increased
      hemodynamic response is not expected in the patient. LMA is an airway control device
      consisting of a silicon mask commonly used in cases where endotracheal intubation (ETE) is
      not required and a silicone tubing connected by 30 degrees. The glottic settles around the
      entrance. There is no obligation for muscle relaxation as LMA is intubated. However, if a
      muscle relaxant agent is not used, pharyngolaryngeal side effects such as patient wounds,
      hiccups, coughs, involuntary muscle movement, hypoxia, laryngospasm can be seen when LMA is
      inserted. In these patients complications such as throat burning, sore throat, ear pain,
      voice anxiety, swallowing difficulties are seen depending on the difficulty of LMA placement
      in the postoperative period.

      Benzidamine is an anti-inflammatory analgesic agent that is not related to the steroid group
      as the structure. Benzidamine is different from other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
      in terms of base formation. Benzidamine has local anesthetic effect in concentrations used in
      topical treatment. Chlorhexidine grams (+) gram (-) bacteria are most effective in
      microorganisms such as yeast and some fungi and viruses. Chlorhexidine delays bacterial
      spread with delayed surface effect. It is absorptive from the microbial cell walls and causes
      membrane leakage.

      In this study, investigators aimed to reveal the effects of topical chlorhexidine and
      benzidamine containing spray (chlorobenzene 30 Ml Spray) used before LMA placement on
      hemodynamic response with postoperative throat and ear pain, swallowing difficulty, voice
      anxiety and soft LMA removal.

      50 participants with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical score I-II.
      laryngeal mask (LMA) will use in general anesthesia.

      all participants will be premedicated with 0.05 mg/kg midazolam 30 minutes before the
      operation. ASA, age, sex, body mass index (BMI) will record. peripheral oxygen saturation
      (SaO2) ,electrocardiography and non invasive blood pressure will monitored. A venous cannula
      will place on the back of the hand. participants will randomly divide into 2 groups by closed
      envelope method.

      before 15 minute anesthesia induction topical chlorobenzene 30 Ml Spray will use. Than LMA
      will placement on and record hemodynamic response and postoperative throat and ear pain,
      swallowing difficulty, voice anxiety and soft LMA removal.
