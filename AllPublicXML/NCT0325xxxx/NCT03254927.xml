  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the clinical benefit (how well the drug works), safety and
      tolerability of combining CDX-3379 and cetuximab. The study will enroll patients with
      advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who have previously received cetuximab and
      progressed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-3379 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 3 (HER3 or ErbB3) found on certain cells and may act to promote
      anti-tumor effects.

      Cetuximab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks EGFR, a protein receptor that regulates
      cell growth.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of CDX-3379 in combination
      with cetuximab.

      Eligible patients that enroll in the study will be given the dose of 12 mg/kg CDX-3379 once
      every 3 weeks in combination with 400 mg/m2 cetuximab on the first day followed by weekly
      doses of 250 mg/m2 cetuximab.

      Up to 30 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely
      monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side
      effects that may occur.
