  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to assess the relation between serum ferritin and hepatic fibrosis in
      patients with NAFLD. It included 83 patients with NAFLD with or without hepatic fibrosis, in
      addition to 30 healthy subjects included as controls. Measurement of serum ferritin and its
      correlation with steatosis and fibrosis was done.

      Background: many studies have found a relationship between hepatic iron, serum ferritin and
      NAFLD or its progress. Aim of the work: is to assess the value of serum ferritin as a
      non-invasive marker in prediction of hepatic fibrosis in NAFLD. Methods: This study included
      113 subjects who were classified into 3 groups. Group I: included 30 healthy subjects as
      control with no evidence of NAFLD by liver biopsy. Group II: included 31 NAFLD patients
      without fibrosis proved by liver biopsy. Group III: included 52 patients with hepatic
      fibrosis on top of NAFLD proved by liver biopsy. Serum ferritin was determined using Ferritin
      ELISA kit. FIB4 was calculated and liver biopsy was done for all patients.
