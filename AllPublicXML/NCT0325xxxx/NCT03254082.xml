  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the interest in gluten-free foods and discovering dietary means to prevent metabolic
      disorders, this study was designed to determine the glycemic responses of four (4) grains and
      flours (corn, rice, wheat, and sorghum). The grain products (gruel) will be eaten by subjects
      and blood glucose will be collected prior to and after eating over the course of two hours. A
      dextrose solution, dosed to provide a like amount of available carbohydrate, will serve as
      the control treatment.

      Gruel was formed via a 1:9 ratio of grain (30 g) to water (270 ml) and cooked until thickened
      by placing water and grain mixture in a beaker and placed in a hot water bath (cooked over a
      stove/heating unit). The gruel was allowed to cool for 3-5 minutes before eating. The
      consistency of the gruel was similar to oatmeal. Subjects had a resting blood sample
      collected for assessment of fasting blood glucose, then ate the gruel (or control sucrose,
      22g) that was assigned for that day -- they returned for the other gruel meals or sucrose
      control determined by Latin Square randomization. Finger stick blood samples where then
      collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after eating the gruel (or sucrose) began.
