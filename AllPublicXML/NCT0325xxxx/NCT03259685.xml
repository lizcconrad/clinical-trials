  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence suggest that artificial sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame and
      sucralose may not be as metabolically safe as they first appeared, and it has been proposed
      that their consumption may be linked to important disturbances in the gut microbiome. Some in
      vitro and in vivo studies suggest that the recently approved sugar substitute Stevia (eg.
      steviol glycosides) can also influence intestinal homeostasis. However, it is not clear
      whether this natural non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) could also cause metabolic and microbiome
      disturbances as proposed for their synthetic counterparts. In fact, steviol glycosides may
      even have a beneficial impact on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism possibly through a
      positive action on intestinal health and gut microbiome, but this has yet to be
      experimentally tested in a rigorous study.

      The main objective of this project is to evaluate whether steviol glycosides sweetened
      beverages (SGSB) or aspartame/acesulfame K sweetened beverages (AASB) exert beneficial,
      neutral or detrimental effects on metabolic health of regular consumers of sugar-sweetened
      beverages (SSBs), and whether modulation of the gut microbiome is involved in the resulting
      impact of these NNSs on metabolic health.

      As chronic overconsumption of SSBs is clearly associated with an increased cardiometabolic
      risk, this study will be the first to determine the metabolic impact of replacing SSBs by
      potentially &quot;healthier alternatives&quot; such as the increasingly popular stevia-based soft
      drinks and aspartame-based soft drinks. The investigators will further investigate whether
      these NNS can cause pernicious effects on intestinal health and the gut microbiome. It is a
      crucial concern since the importance of this unsuspected key &quot;organ&quot; has been ignored for too
      long and its important implication in many chronic societal diseases has just been
      discovered.

      Results of this study could have a direct influence on health, nutrition and even
      agricultural policies as well as dietary guidelines around the world. This project is also
      critically important as an increasing amount of health professionals such as physicians,
      nurses and registered dietitians seek to provide evidenced-based guidance to individuals
      looking for healthier alternatives to SSBs including stevia-based or aspartame-based soft
      drinks.
