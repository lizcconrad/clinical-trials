  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With IRB approval and informed consent, patients (n=10) (18-50 years old) with post-traumatic
      knee OA and requiring a tibial plateau and meniscus arthroplasty plus a femoral condyle
      arthroplasty will be enrolled in the study. Primary criteria for inclusion will be Grade IV
      changes in the articular cartilage of the femoral condyle and tibial plateau and meniscal
      pathology in the medial or lateral femorotibial joint as determined by physical examination,
      diagnostic imaging and knee arthroscopy by the PI. Exclusion criteria include Grade III or IV
      changes in any other compartment of the knee, acute injury to any other part of the affected
      lower extremity, or inability to comply with the protocol.

      After enrollment, patients will undergo standardized knee radiography, and complete
      assessments (described below). Size-matched (standard clinical methodology) proximal tibia
      with meniscus and distal femur allografts from the same donor will be obtained from a tissue
      bank (Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation, Edison, NJ) who has licensed the MOPS
      technology. The medial or lateral femoral condyle will be replaced using our novel
      instrumentation and technique described above. Tibial plateau-meniscus grafts will be trimmed
      and used to replace the entire medial or lateral tibial condyle while sparing the attachments
      of ACL, PCL and respective collateral ligament. The tibial plateau graft will be fixated
      using commercial available implants used for bone fixation. In the event that the meniscus
      has been detached from the tibial plateau during graft harvest, the periphery of the meniscus
      will be sutured to the capsule following standard meniscus transplant procedure.

      Patients will undergo controlled post-operative rehabilitation according to standard
      protocols for osteochondral with concurrent meniscus allografts.

      Range of motion, VAS pain score, SF-12, Tegner score, International Knee Documentation
      Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores, PROMIS Bank v1.2 - Physical
      Function-Mobility, PROMIS v1.1 - Global Health, PROMIS Bank v1.1- Pain Interference, PROMIS
      Bank v1.2 - Physical Function and Marx score as well as complete radiographs of the affected
      knee will be obtained prior to surgery and at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months
      after surgery to evaluate healing, function and evidence for arthrosis.
