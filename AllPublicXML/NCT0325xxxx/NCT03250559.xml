  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PNL) was accepted as a treatment modality for large renal
      stones since 1980. Although radiation exposure during PNL is within the safe limits for
      expert endourologist, the mutagenic hazard is still present especially in pediatric
      population. Therefore, employing an alternative imaging technique during PNL would be of
      added advantage. So, the investigators want to compare the efficacy of ultrasound guided PNL
      with the conventional (fluoroscopy guided) PNL in pediatric population. If ultrasound guided
      PNL was as effective as conventional one, this means that many children could be protected
      from the variable hazards of radiation exposure.

    <textblock>
      The incidence of pediatric urolithiasis varies by geographic area. Most cases of pediatric
      urolithiasis are associated with anatomic or metabolic abnormalities or urinary tract
      infection . PNL can be performed safely and effectively in children by experienced surgeons,
      resulting in a high stone-free rate and lower requirement for ancillary treatment. In adults,
      PNL is performed under fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance. In pediatric age group,
      fluoroscopic guidance was preferred in most of the reported studies. However, fluoroscopy
      exposes the patient to radiation. The International Commission on Radiological Protection
      recommends that whole body exposure in adults should be limited to an effective dose of 20
      mSv per year over 5 years. In young children, it is particularly important to protect the
      developing gonads and thyroid gland, as the long-term effects of exposing these organs to
      radiation are still unclear. In contrast to fluoroscopic guidance, ultrasound guidance does
      not expose the patient to radiation, it also can provide real-time monitoring during the
      puncturing procedure. The path and depth of the needle, and the anatomy in and around the
      kidney, are clearly visible on ultrasound examination
