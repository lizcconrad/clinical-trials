  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional simple-blind,randomized trial has included 90 children of American
      Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I or II aged between 1 to 12 years of
      either sex, scheduled for for outpatient minor surgery under general anesthesia. This study
      examined whether one should make iv attempts during the early induction period (at 60
      seconds) or lately (90 or 120 s) and waiting until the child receives additional sevoflurane
      inhalation anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      We conducted a prospective randomized study, after obtaining Institutional review board
      approval, which didn't require written parental consent. Children age 1-12 years, undergoing
      elective general anesthesia via an inhalation induction were randomized to one of three
      groups of 30 patients each one, for iv placement, either 60s (group E), 90 or 120 s (group L)
      following loss of lid reflex. Movement on iv placement and incidence of laryngospasm were
      determined. Difficulty with iv placement was also recorded. Statistical analysis included
      contingency testing, ANOVA, and non parametric testing. A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered
      significant.
