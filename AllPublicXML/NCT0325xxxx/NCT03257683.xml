  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data to determine if the medication, Ranolazine,
      effects heart muscle function in patients who have areas of non-revascularizable heart
      muscle.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cardiac patients with severe coronary artery disease have areas of ischemic LV
      myocardium that cannot be revascularized (Non-R). The investigators propose to identify such
      patients via retrospective case review of CMRI data, as well as identify the exact regions
      which specify Non-R coronary anatomy. This selected study group will have a specific
      echocardiographic imaging protocol performed, which includes the known ischemic regions. All
      segments will be collected and analyzed as a pre-therapeutic baseline using specialized STE
      software to derive strain values. Following eight (8) weeks of ranolazine therapy, each
      subject will be re-interrogated with the same echocardiographic imaging protocol and have
      identical measurements of regional strain performed. Ranolazine will be added to the
      patients' usual medical therapy. Each patient will serve as their own control, from baseline
      to post therapeutic state.

      It is the hypothesis of the investigators, that additional therapeutic dosing of ranolazine
      will improve regional and perhaps global myocardial function. Improvement in LV mechanical
      function (regional and global) will be quantitated and objectively elucidated by STE derived
      myocardial strain as described further in this document.

        Study population will be either male or female, age 18 or greater with stable GDMT for 60
        days prior to enrollment. They will be in normal sinus rhythm with coronary artery
        revascularization more than 60 days prior to enrollment, with a non-revascularizable area
        of myocardial ischemia as determined by stress MRI. They will be able to perform the
        bicycle stress echocardiogram and able to provide written informed consent.

             unwilling/unable to provide written, informed consent Concomitant use of QTc
             prolonging drugs, potassium channel variants resulting in a long QT interval, patients
             with a family history of (or congenital) long QT syndrome, and patients with known
             acquired QT interval prolongation Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors including
             ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir,
             indinavir, and saquinavir Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin,
             rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort
             Breast feeding Atrial fibrillation or frequent atrial or ventricular ectopy Moderate
             CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil, erythromycin) P-gp inhibitors (e.g.,
             cyclosporine) which increase ranolazine exposure Renal failure. Patients with
             Creatinine clearance less than 30ml/min . Safety Considerations for patients with the
             following drugs/conditions CYP3A substrates: Limit simvastatin to 20 mg when used with
             ranolazine. Doses of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A
             substrates with narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus)
             may need to be reduced with ranolazine OCT2 substrates: Limit the dose of metformin to
             1700 mg daily when used with ranolazine 1000 mg twice daily. Doses of other OCT2
             substrates may require adjusted doses Drugs transported by P-gp (e.g., digoxin), or
             drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants) may need reduced doses
             when used with ranolazine Renal failure: Patients with creatinine clearance less than
             30ml/min are excluded from participation in this study. Monitor renal function after
             initiation and periodically in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCL
             &lt; 60 mL/min). If acute renal failure develops, discontinue ranolazine.
