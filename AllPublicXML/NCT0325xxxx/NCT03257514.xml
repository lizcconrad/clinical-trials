      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of alpha lipoic acid on uterine scar
      healing after cesarean section by using saline contrast sonohysterography

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a triple blind randomized placebo controlled prospective clinical trial that will be
      conducted in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital.

      in which a consecutive series of participant attending emergency room 102 women undergoing
      cesarean section for the first time will be randomized into two groups.

      Group A (Study group): 51 women will receive alpha lipoic acid drug ( 600 mg twice daily) for
      6 weeks after cesarean section and saline sonohysterography will be done after that.

      Group B (Control group): 51 women will receive a placebo drug twice daily for 6 weeks after
      cesarean section and saline sonohysterography will be done after that.
