  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate whether autonomic shifts (dysautonomia, sympatho-vagal
      instability) that develop after SCI have value in predicting SCI-associated infections
      (SCI-AI). SCI-AI impair outcomes by (1) reducing the intrinsic neurological recovery
      potential and (2) increasing mortality. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data will be tracked in
      both the time and frequency domains to discriminate between the relative contribution of
      sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation to changes in HRV. The ability to predict
      infections will enable novel treatments thereby reducing infection-associated mortality and
      improving neurological and functional outcomes.

        Based on historical data of acute SCI patients admitted to OSU, we estimate enrollment of
        approximately 16 SCI patients per year to meet eligibility criteria. Consequently, a
        recruitment period of 36 months is scheduled to meet the anticipated need of n=50 subjects.
        There are more than 60 isolated vertebra fractures being surgically stabilized per year at
        OSU (personal communication, Dr David Evans, Traumatology, OSU). Based on the asymmetric
        recruitment populations we expect to complete the non-SCI referent cohort (n=10) earlier
        than the SCI cohort. The referent cohort will have sustained a vertebral fracture without
        myelopathy and will have undergone spine surgery, anesthesia and subsequent monitoring in
        the ICU. Investigators will evaluate patients after admission to the emergency ward for
        eligibility (Table 3). Before final inclusion into the study an interview will be conducted
        with the patient to verify the inclusion- and exclusion criteria and obtain written
        informed consent.
