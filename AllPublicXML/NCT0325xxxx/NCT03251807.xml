  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This experimental study will evaluate the effect of combined treatment with low-intensity
      pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and functional appliances (twin-block) on the correction of class
      II malocclusion, compared with the control group treated with functional appliances
      (twin-block) only.

      The study sample will consist of 40 patients with class II malocclusion. The sample will be
      allocated randomly into two groups: control group and experimental group.

      The functional appliance (twin-block) will be applied for all patients, while the
      low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) will be applied for the experimental group only. The
      skeleto-dental changes occurring after functional treatment will be assessed using
      cephalometric radiographs; pre and post- treatment changes for each group will be evaluated
      individually, and the two groups will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies of the etiologic factors of Class II malocclusions recognize that most Class II
      malocclusions are a result of mandibular deficiency and not of maxillary excess. For many
      patients, especially adults, optimal overall results are best obtained using a combined
      orthodontic-surgical approach. However, treating such cases early while the patient is still
      growing, using mandibular propulsive functional appliances, can produce satisfactory
      improvement in the facial esthetics, and minimizes the need for surgical intervention in many
      cases.

      Ultrasound (US), a form of mechanical energy that is transmitted through and into biological
      tissues as an acoustic pressure wave at frequencies above the limit of human hearing, is used
      widely in medicine as a therapeutic, operative and diagnostic tool. Therapeutic US, and some
      operative US. Previous studies on animals have found that therapeutic ultrasound (US) can
      stimulate and enhance mandibular growth when applied during the active growth period.

      This study will evaluate the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on the growth
      of mandible and the duration of functional treatment.

      Twin-block will be applied to the two groups. While the control group will receive the
      twin-block only, the experimental group will receive the twin-block combined with
      low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) region.

      Cephalometric radiographs will be obtained before and after functional treatment to evaluate
      the dento-skeletal changes.
