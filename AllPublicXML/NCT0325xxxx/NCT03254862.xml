  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of patterned distribution stimulation
      compared to conventional stimulation in reducing muscle fatigue during functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) following spinal cord injury (SCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a commonly used technique in rehabilitation and
      often associated with rapid muscle fatigue which becomes the limiting factor in its
      applications. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects on the onset of
      fatigue of conventional synchronous stimulation, as well as asynchronous stimulation that
      mimic voluntary muscle activation targeting different motor units which are activated
      sequentially or randomly via multiple pairs of stimulation electrodes. Three different
      approaches with various electrode configurations will be investigated, as well as different
      patterns of stimulation applied to the gastrocnemius muscle. In addition, the muscle changes
      during different patterns of stimulation will be evaluated in this study.
