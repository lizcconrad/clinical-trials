  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single blind, multi-center, phase two clinical trial. Inclusion
      criteria are consist of non-metastatic esophageal cancer who are going to receive
      chemo-radiotherapy. Sample size is 100 people (50 people in each group). In the intervention
      group, patients are going to inject an enoxaparin (40 mg) daily concurrent by
      chemo-radiation. Therefore patients with esophageal cancer are going to assign randomly to
      control group (only chemo-radiotherapy) and intervention group
      (chemo-radiotherapy+enoxaparin) using 1:1 allocation. Four to 6 weeks after treatment, all
      patients undergo upper GI endoscopy and then esophagectomy. Endoscopic and pathological
      findings (after esophagectomy) are considered as clinical and pathological response,
      respectively.

      This is a randomized, single blind, multi-center, phase two clinical trial. Inclusion
      criteria are consist of non-metastatic esophageal cancer who are going to receive
      chemo-radiotherapy. One hundred patients are going to assign randomly by blocked randomized
      allocation (1:1) to receive radiotherapy (median treatment dose will be 50.40 Gy in 25 to 32
      fractions) with weekly concurrent chemotherapy (paclitaxel [50 mg/m2] plus carboplatin [area
      under the carve=2]) with or without enoxaparin (40 mg daily). During radiotherapy and before
      each course of chemotherapy, all patients are going to visit by physician and complete blood
      count will be checked. All patients are going to undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy and then
      esophagectomy, 4-6 months after completion of chemo-radiotherapy.
