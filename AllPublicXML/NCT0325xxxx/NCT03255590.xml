      This study plans to determine whether training with concurrent non-invasive brain stimulation
      can change abnormal flexion synergy in chronic stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to investigate whether non-invasive brain stimulation
      (intervention) applied during motor training in chronic stroke patients can change their
      abnormal flexion synergy. The investigators will study chronic stroke patients , who are
      defined as patients that sustained a stroke at least 6 months prior to our testing date.

      Three functional aspects of each finger will be tested: maximal voluntary contraction (MVC),
      finger dexterity, and hand posture.

      Prior to intervention, participants will have a baseline assessment including clinical tests,
      MVC, the individuation task, and the configuration task. Following the baseline assessment
      patients will receive intervention, training on the configuration task paired with concurrent
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for 5 consecutive days. On the sixth day and
      as a one week follow-up after, subjects will have a post-intervention assessment containing
      the same tests performed in baseline.

      This design will allow us to determine speed and accuracy during the configuration task, the
      individuation index, and possible changes in abnormal flexion synergy.

    <description>Tests resistance to passive movement about a joint with varying degrees of velocity in order to assess muscle spasticity.
Scoring:
0 No increase in muscle tone
1 Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is moved in flexion or extension.
1+ Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the Range of motion (ROM).
2 More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved.
3 Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult.
4 Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension</description>
