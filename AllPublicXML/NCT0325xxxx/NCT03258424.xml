  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will consist of a single treatment group enrolling adult subjects with CF on
      background therapy with KALYDECO速. Approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The single treatment group will enroll adult subjects with CF currently on stable KALYDECO速
      background therapy for a minimum of 3 months at the time of randomization. Subjects will be
      randomized to either PTI-428 or placebo. Each dose will be administered once daily (QD) for a
      total of 14 Days. The subjects will continue treatment with KALYDECO速 throughout the study.
