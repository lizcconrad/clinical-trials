      Specific Aim: Implement an evidence-based diabetes prevention pragmatic trial for high risk
      pre-diabetic individuals of Caribbean-descent to reduce the incidence of diabetes.

      Hypothesis: This study seeks to test the hypothesis that implementation of a lifestyle
      intervention, with escalation to Metformin therapy will lower the incidence of diabetes among
      the highest risk pre-diabetic individuals of Caribbean-descent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a pragmatic trial that tests the effectiveness of
      lifestyle modification and Metformin use in minority populations. Our study population is
      Caribbean-descent individuals in Region 2, Trinidad and Barbados. The investigators will have
      five clinical intervention sites situated in New York - 2, Puerto Rico -1, Barbados -1,
      Trinidad -1 and US Virgin Islands -1. These sites were chosen because of the investigators'
      strong research network in these locations, and to enable us to address diabetes disparities
      due to geographic differences. The investigators will first modify an established lifestyle
      modification workshop series developed by the East Harlem Partnership for Diabetes Prevention
      (EHPDP) for use in the community, 10to target the population at the involved clinical sites.
      The investigators plan to adapt the D-CLIP protocol and escalate to Metformin therapy for the
      highest risk pre-diabetic patients whose hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has not improved or who
      remain morbidly obese.

      The investigators will leverage our existing robust research infrastructure and network at
      the five sites through our Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) and
      now the Yale Transdisciplinary Collaborative center for Health Disparities focused on
      Precision Medicine (Yale-TCC). ECHORN is a research collaboration funded by the NIMHD
      (U2458849938) to address the burden of chronic disease in USVI, PR and the Eastern Caribbean.
      The Yale-TCC (U54MD010711) leverages the infrastructure and knowledge of the ECHORN, expands
      to include New York and New Jersey and focuses on diabetes and hypertension. The
      investigators' network includes community advisory boards as well as policy delegations that
      are well suited to inform this project and its expansion into routine healthcare practice and
      policy.

    <intervention_model_description>Patient Recruitment:
The investigators are targeting the highest risk pre-diabetic patients for this study. Patient recruitment will occur through the involved health clinics.
Control Participants Control participants in existing ECHORN sites (Puerto Rico, Barbados and Trinidad) will be recruited from the ECHORN Cohort Study (ECS).
ECS does not have a recruitment site in New York; therefore, the New York LIME sites will need to recruit their own control participants, through random assignment of consented participants into the intervention and control groups. These participants will be offered a delayed intervention at the end of 2.5years, given the evidence supporting behavioral modification for diabetes prevention.</intervention_model_description>

It measures perceived comparative and environmental risk for developing diabetes. Scoring for the self-efficacy questions is done by an average and ranges from 1 to 4, with a higher score indicating more perceived risk.</description>

The newly launched East Harlem Diabetes Prevention (EHDP) project's mobile app, iHEED will be used by intervention participants to help reinforce the content they learn during the workshop series.</description>
