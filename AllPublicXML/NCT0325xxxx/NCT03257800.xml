  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This interventional double-blind, randomized trial has included120 children of American
      Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I or II aged between 1and 8 years of either
      sex, scheduled for outpatient minor surgery under general anesthesia.This study examined
      whether co-induction with ketamine-propofol enhance laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion
      conditions and preserve hemodynamic state in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare two anesthesia protocols: propofol induction with or without a
      prior injection of ketamine, in term of LMA insertion conditions(favorable= satisfactory or
      unfavorable= unsatisfactory ) and hemodynamic effects (decrease of 20 % from baseline of
      blood pressure and heart rate).

      The conditions of LMA insertion have been assessed in each study group by an experimented
      anesthesiologist, who was unaware of the treatment group assignment. Conditions were
      considered satisfactory, if the 4 following criteria were acceptable: the jaw was relaxed,
      there was no coughing, swallowing and no limb movement, and then the LMA was inserted. When
      the investigators save at least one unacceptable of these criteria, conditions were
      considered to be unsatisfactory and thereafter anesthesia was deepened with supplemental dose
      of propofol 1mg.kg-¹ and 1 minute later a reinsertion was attempted. The total number of
      attempts at LMA insertion was recorded. Children trachea was intubated after 3 failed
      attempts of LMA insertion, and then patient was excluded.
