  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EatWellUK study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a mobile web application
      (e-Nutri), capable of delivering automated personalised nutrition advice, in increasing diet
      quality.

      Dietary assessment is via the validated Food4Me FFQ (with an updated user interface that has
      been designed for better usability) and dietary feedback is derived according to adherence to
      an 11-item modified US Alternative Healthy Eating Index (m-AHEI).
