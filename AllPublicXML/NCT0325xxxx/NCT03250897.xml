      The aim of the study is to investigate by flow cytometry the phenotype of alveolar
      macrophages (AMs) isolated from patients with non-infectious lung diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although alveolar macrophages (AMs) represent the main immune cell population in the human
      lungs, consensus on their phenotypic characterization is still missing.

      Current translational protocols use human AMs obtained by invasive methods (broncho-alveolar
      lavage and lung biopsy) or differentiate macrophages from blood monocytes cultured in the
      presence of growth factors such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or
      granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The group has already published
      the phenotypic and functional comparison of human blood monocyte-derived macrophages
      differentiated with M-CSF or GM-CSF. Aim of this study is to use a multi-staining flow
      cytometry (FACS analysis) to better characterize the phenotype of AMs isolated from
      broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of patients affected by non-infectious lung diseases. The FACS
      profiles of AMs will be further compared to the phenotypic profile of blood monocyte-derived
      macrophages differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF or M-CSF. The results of this study will
      allow to define the most valid in vitro model of AMs in a non-infectious setting.
