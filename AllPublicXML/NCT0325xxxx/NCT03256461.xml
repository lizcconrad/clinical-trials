  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum lactate level is depended on the balance between lactate production and clearance. It
      is seen as a sensitive indicator reflecting not only the low systemic perfusion but
      microcirculatory dysfunction which cause global or regional tissue hypoxia (as a result of
      impaired mitochondrial oxidation). 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guideline stated &quot;We
      suggest guiding resuscitation to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels
      as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion&quot;, with weak recommendation and low quality of evidence.
      Several trials which evaluated the resuscitation strategy included lactate clearance as a
      target while based on 2.0 diagnostic criteria for sepsis, finally showed conflicting results.
      The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of lactate clearance guide resuscitation
      in sepsis that defined by The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic
      shock through multi-center, central-randomization clinical trial.

      Sepsis remains a great challenge for clinicians, early goal-directed therapy(EGDT), referring
      to a number of target-achieving indicators including systemic central venous oxygen
      saturation(ScvO2) after initial fluid resuscitation within 6 hours, has been one of the main
      treatment for sepsis. ScvO2 is the only indicator that reflects tissue oxygen metabolism.
      However, there're studies confirmed that ScvO2 oriented EGDT cannot reduce the mortality of
      sepsis. So it is important to find out a more effective indicator. Lactic acid is a product
      of anaerobic metabolism of the body, lactate clearance has been found to effectively predict
      the prognosis of sepsis. Few studies have shown that lactate clearance oriented fluid
      resuscitation can be of benefit in patients with sepsis. Nevertheless, whether lactate
      clearance could be combined with sepsis Bundle as a new marker to improve the prognosis
      remains a problem. The objective of this study is to discuss the feasibility of lactate
      clearance oriented sepsis treatment through multi-center clinical trial.
