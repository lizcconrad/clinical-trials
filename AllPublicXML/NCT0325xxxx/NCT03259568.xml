  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project investigates the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
      on neural circuits as a function of spatiotemporal parameters and brain state in order to
      better understand why the method works and how to improve its efficacy. Leveraging our
      expertise in application of TMS methodology during concurrent single neuron recording
      techniques in non-human primates and imaging and scalp potential techniques in humans (fMRI
      and EEG), the investigators aim to resolve three interlocking problems in the design and
      application of rTMS: stimulation frequency, spatial targeting, and interactions with brain
      state.

             stimulator); [TMS Adult Safety Screening (TASS) form].
