  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficacy and stability of an ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring
      system against the efficacy and stability of an existing outpatient-based electrocardiogram
      (ECG) and Holter monitoring system for arrhythmia detection after atrial fibrillation
      ablation, and to test whether such continuous monitoring can better detect arrhythmia that is
      undetectable by existing methods and how this may affect treatment outcomes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study in patients
      who are capable of using and consent to use a smartphone-based ECG monitoring after ablation
      for atrial fibrillation. The patients will be randomly assigned to either the Holter
      monitoring or ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system group in a 1:1 ratio and
      will undergo monitoring from immediately after the procedure to 12 months after discharge.

    <description>Continuous monitoring with ICT-based ECG monitoring will begin from the time of participation in the trial in the ICT-based monitoring group. Depending on the lifestyle pattern of the patient, the specific time will be set to allow 30 min of monitoring per day, even if there are no symptoms. If symptoms do appear, additional monitoring will be performed for at least 10 more minutes. 24-hr Holter monitoring will be implemented at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups in this group, as in the Holter monitoring group.</description>
