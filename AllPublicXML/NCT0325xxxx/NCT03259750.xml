  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sport activity induces a relevant risk for lower extremities especially ankle and foot
      structures. Athletes who participate in basketball, volleyball and soccer are predisposed.
      Self-reported outcome instruments have been used by clinicians to assess the treatment
      interventions effectiveness directed at patients with pathologies and identify impairments,
      disabilities and quality of life. The assessment of musculoskeletal injuries can be problem
      without clinical, radiological examination and on scores from patient-based questionnaires.
      The information from these questionnaires provides us good evidence if there is not
      interpretation of obtained scores. The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) is a
      self-reported outcome instrument for patients with foot and ankle disorders available in
      English, German, and French. The FAAM has a sports subscale and activity of daily living
      (ADL) subscale that can assess the activities that requires higher level. The aim of this
      study is to translate the FAAM into Turkish language, perform a cross-cultural adaptation,
      and investigate the reliability, validity of the translated version in athletic population

    <measure>FAAM-T questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The FAAM-T is comprised of separately scored 21-item Activity of Daily Living (ADL) and 8-item Sports subscales. Each item is scored on a five-point Likert scale from 4 to 0, item score totals can be varied from 0 to 84 for the ADL and from 0 to 32 for the sports subscale. The percentage scores calculated with the total score of each subscale is divided by the highest potential score and multiplied by 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) is used to represent pain and also functional limitation in sport. The VAS includes numbers, words, figures, to recognize the patients rate the pain or functional limitation level. Responses were converted to numerical scores by measuring the distance from the zero point to the vertical mark. This distance was recorded to the nearest millimeter.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>6 meters shuttle run</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants sprinted up and back twice along a 6 meters course. Participants were required to start with one leg forward on the start line. Time started from the initial forward movement of the athlete and stopped when the athlete crossed the line. Each participants was timed with a hand-held stopwatch and recorded in second.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Triple forward hop</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to face parallel down the test &quot;runway,&quot; and, when signaled, participant hopped as far as possible in the forward direction with 3 consecutive hops on the same leg. The distance between the starting line and the place where participant lands on the third hop measured at the heel was recorded in centimeters</description>
