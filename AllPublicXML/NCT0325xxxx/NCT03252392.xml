  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Co morbidity rates of hearing loss in children with autism spectrum disorder are high and
      increasing.

      Investigators are aiming to:

        1. evaluate peripheral auditory and brain stem auditory function in children with autism
           spectrum disorder.

        2. compare communication capabilities in autistic children having hearing abnormalities and
           autistic children with normal hearing.

    <textblock>
      Full audiological evaluation is carried out to all participants including:

        -  pure tone and speech audiometry.

        -  Tympanometry and acoustic reflex threshold evaluation.

        -  Threshold auditory brain stem response for threshold determination in non co operative
           children not respond to pure tone,speech audiometry.

        -  Auditory brain stem response for neuro-otologic diagnosis.

        -  Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in children proved to have normal hearing to
           detect minimal cochlear affection .

        -  Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions with contralateral masking. Communication
           evaluation is carried out to all participants using arabic language test(kotby et
           al,1995).

      Investigators use childhood autism rating scale for (CARS) for diagnosis of autism spectrum
      disorder.
