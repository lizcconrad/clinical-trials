  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, parallel randomized, double blinded comparison of the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of a single 0.57 mg/kg dose of SYN060 to a single 0.57
      mg/kg dose of adalimumab (Humira®) reference product from North American and European
      sources. The study is open to healthy individuals on no medications that might confound the
      results of this safety study.
