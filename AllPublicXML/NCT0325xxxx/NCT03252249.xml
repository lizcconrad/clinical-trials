  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite substantial evidence supporting the use of dual anti-platelet therapy in patients
      with acute coronary syndrome, there remains major uncertainty regarding the optimal duration
      of therapy. Recent evidence suggests that shorter durations of dual anti-platelet therapy are
      superior because the avoidance of atherothrombotic events is counterbalanced by the greater
      risks of excess major bleeding with apparent increases in all-cause mortality with longer
      durations. The investigators propose a Scotland-wide randomised controlled trial of 19,424
      patients with acute coronary syndrome allocated to differing durations of dual anti-platelet
      therapy. In collaboration with the Farr Institute, the investigators will exploit NHS
      Scotland's unique and innovative electronic health record linkage infrastructure to track
      duration of therapy and clinical outcomes in a real-world, real-time, efficient and highly
      cost-effective trial. This has the potential to define treatment duration, settle a major
      outstanding international controversy, and influence modern cardiology practice across the
      world.
