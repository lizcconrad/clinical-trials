      Background:

      The Human Motor Control Section does tests for people with movement disorders. In order to be
      sure when a test is normal or abnormal, normal values must be determined in a large group of
      healthy volunteers (HVs). Therefore, the researchers want to study the techniques in HVs.
      They will use the results as the standard of comparison in future clinical studies.

      Objective:

      To get enough normal results in movement tests to use in clinical studies.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 18 68

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical and neurological exams.

      Participants will have 1 or 2 visits. They may have:

      Small sticky electrodes attached to the skin on the hands/arms and neck. These will measure
      muscle activity.

      Tiny shocks given to a finger. Participants will be asked if they felt 1 or 2 shocks. This
      will be done to each hand over about 30 minutes total.

      A questionnaire about anxiety.

      Acoustic startle reflex test. Small electrodes will be stuck to the eye, hand, and leg.
      Sensors will be stuck to the palms. Small metal electrodes on the chest and inner arm will
      measure heart rate. Participants will wear headphones. Once everything is in place,
      participants will hear a low sound for about 10 minutes. They will hear a short louder sound
      every 45 60 seconds....

      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is to get adequate normal values to compare in clinical patient
      studies.

      Study population

      There will be two techniques developed in this study: Somatosensory Temporal Discrimination
      Threshold (STDT) and Acoustic Startle Reflex (ASR). For both studies we will collect data
      systematically in an adequate sample of normal subjects. We plan to recruit the following
      number of healthy volunteers (HV s) for each study.

      STDT: 50 HV

      ASR: 50 HV

      Design

      Subjects will come for up to 2 outpatient visits, during which they will participate in at
      least the STDT or the ASR. Before participation in any study, all participants will undergo
      screening for medical history and physical examination. For the STDT, the index finger in
      both hands will be stimulated. For the ASR, auditory stimulation will be administered at
      varying intervals. Subjects will also be asked to complete State Trait Anxiety Inventory
      (STAI) before participation in the study.

      Outcome measures

      STDT: discrimination threshold value

      ASR: EMG response from seven muscles, heart rate, and galvanic skin response
