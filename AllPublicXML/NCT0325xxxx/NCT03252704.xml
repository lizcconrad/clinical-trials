  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, comparator controlled trial evaluated the blood glucose and
      insulin responses in healthy adults, after consuming a high fiber or low fiber muffin top.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The fiber administered in this trial is a resistant starch type 4 derived from high-amylose
      maize starch. This product is high in dietary fiber (70% total dietary fiber (TDF), AOAC
      2009.01 method) and can be used in a variety of bakery applications. The objective of this
      study was to evaluate the post-prandial blood glucose and insulin responses of healthy adults
      (n=28) after consuming a muffin top made with resistant starch or control muffin top, in a
      randomized, double-blind, crossover study. The muffin tops were matched for total weight,
      total carbohydrate, sugars, protein, and fat. During each 24-hour study period, subjects
      consumed a standard evening meal, fasted for 12 hours, and arrived at the study clinic the
      following morning. Serum glucose, serum insulin, and capillary glucose were measured after
      muffin top consumption. The subjects completed a seven day washout between treatments.
