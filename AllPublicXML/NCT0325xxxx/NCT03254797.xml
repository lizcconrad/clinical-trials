  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Does a 4-week stepping training program with or without external feedback clinically change
      functional ability and reduce risk of fall of ambulatory patients with iSCI?

      Are there significant differences between 4-weeks stepping training with or without external
      feedback in ambulatory patients with iSCI?
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To compare effects of 4-week stepping training with or without external feedback on
      functional ability and incidence of falls in ambulatory patients with iSCI (between-group
      comparison).

      To compare the change of functional ability in a group of 4-week stepping training with or
      without the utility of external feedback (within-group comparison).

    <measure>Change of walking speed using 10 meter walk test (10MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to training, after 2 weeks, after 4 weeks, and 6 months after complete the training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures walking speed. Subjects will be instructed to walk at a prefer speed and fastest speed along a 10 meters walkway with or without walking device. The video recording will be captured over the 4 meters in the middle walkway in order to minimize acceleration and deceleration effects. Then the data will be converted to a walking speed using a formula; (v = (step length (m) × cadence (step/min))/60)</description>

    <measure>Change of walking stability using Timed up and go test [TUGT]</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to training, after 2 weeks, after 4 weeks, and 6 months after complete the training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test was designed to measure mobility and dynamic balance control related to walking. Subjects will be instructed to stand up from a standard chair, walk at a fastest and safe speed for 3 meters, turn around a traffic cone, walk back and sit down on the chair with or without a walking device. Then the average time required for the 3 trials will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Change of lower limb muscle strength using Five times sit-to-stand [FTSST]</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to training, after 2 weeks, after 4 weeks, and 6 months after complete the training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test has used to quantify lower extremity motor strength. The time taken to complete 5 chair-rise cycles at a fastest and safe speed will be recorded for each subject. Then the average time required for the 3 trials will be used for data analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of walking endurance using 6 minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>prior to training, after 2 weeks, after 4 weeks, and 6 months after complete the training program</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures the longest walking distance in 6 minute to reflect the responses of the cardiopulmonary and muscular systems. Subjects will be instructed to walk along a rectangular walkway as long as they can with a safety speed. They can walk with or without walking device in 6 minutes and are able to take a resting period as needed and continuing to walk. The distance covered after 6 minutes will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Subjects stand in a step standing position with placing one leg on the load cells of the device and the other leg at the posterolateral direction to the trained leg outside the load cells, look at the displayed section which will be positioned at their eye level. Then subjects will be instructed to shift/take their body-weight onto the trained leg until the green zone of the displayed section is lightened. When the subjects can take a proper level of their body-weight onto the trained leg, the beep sound will be alarmed to trigger the subjects and therapist that the subjects can step the other leg forward to the marker. Then they have to do the same when steps the leg backward.</description>

    <description>Subjects stand in a step standing position with placing one leg on the load cells of the device and the other leg at the posterolateral direction to the trained leg outside the load cells. Then subjects will be instructed to shift/take their body-weight onto the trained leg as most as they can. If the subjects can take a proper level of their body-weight onto the trained leg, the subjects can step the other leg forward to the marker. Then they have to do the same when steps the leg backward.</description>
