      Objective (s) : To Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Treatment of non-responding to
      conventional therapy inoperable liver cancers by in situ introduction of ImDendrim.

      Trial Design:

      Objective (s) : To Evaluate the efficacy and safety of Treatment of non-responding to
      conventional therapy inoperable liver cancers by in situ introduction of ImDendrim &quot;[188Re]
      rhenium complex coupled to a imidazolic ligand and associated with a dendrimer&quot;.

      Trial Design:

        1. Type of the clinical Trial:

           An, open-labeled and unicenter study in women or men with primary hepatocellular cancer
           or metastatic liver without standard therapeutic options for treatment including
           chemotherapy or surgery.

        2. Duration and method The trial will be comprised of 12 weeks of continued observation
           following in situ injection of ImDendrim into a subject suffering non-responding to
           conventional therapy inoperable liver cancers.
