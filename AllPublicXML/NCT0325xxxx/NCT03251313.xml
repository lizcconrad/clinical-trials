  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation trial to assess dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and MTD of
      JS001+GP in advanced/metastatic TNBC patients, and to determine the recommended Phase II dose
      and the best combination regimen.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 3 stages in this trial. Stage 1 is the dose escalation stage. JS001 will be
      tested in combination with GP in 3 dose levels.

      Level 1: 120mg Level 2: 240mg Level 3: 480mg Patients will receive JS001+GP for 6 cycles and
      JS001 maintenance therapy for up to approximately 2 years.

      JS001 will be given on d1 every 3 weeks with GP and every 2 weeks in maintenance therapy.

      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level of JS001 at 120mg. Each
      new group will receive a higher dose of JS001 than the group before it until 480mg.

      Stage 2 is the dose expansion stage. Dose expansion will be carried out to expand to 12
      patients in the highest dose level at which the patient can tolerate well. This dose will
      also be recommended as phase 2 dose(RP2D).

      Stage 3 is the sequential treatment stage. Patients receive 6 cycles of GP without JS001 and
      then receive JS001 maintenance therapy for up to approximately 2 years.
