  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an investigational drug can reduce respiratory
      complications in extremely premature babies through 12 months corrected age (CA), as compared
      to extremely premature babies receiving standard neonatal care alone

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Chronic Respiratory Morbidity (CRM) Through 12 Months Corrected Age (CA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 Months Corrected Age (CA)</time_frame>
    <description>CRM is a common adverse outcome of premature birth resulting in recurrent respiratory symptoms requiring treatment with pulmonary medications such as bronchodilators, need for supplementary home oxygen, frequent emergency room visits or hospital readmissions, especially during the first year of life. CRM will be measured by respiratory health care utilization and respiratory symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) at Postmenstrual Age (PMA) 36 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>PMA Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>BPD is a chronic lung disorder characterized by pulmonary immaturity, undifferentiated alveoli with the presence of hyaline membrane and atelectasis, dilated capillaries immersed in the mesenchyme, and a distorted deposition of the extracellular matrix. BPD results in residual effects on pulmonary function and is linked to neurodevelopmental problems during later childhood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Severe Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH) Grade III or IV Through Postmenstrual Age (PMA) 40 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Through PMA 40 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>IVH is characterized by hemorrhage into the germinal matrix tissues of the developing brain. IVH is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity and may result in long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. It has been attributed to changes in cerebral blood flow to the immature germinal matrix microvasculature and secondary periventricular venous infarction. It will be assessed by cerebral ultrasound.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) at Postmenstrual Age (PMA) 40 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>PMA Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>BPD is a chronic lung disorder characterized by pulmonary immaturity, undifferentiated alveoli with the presence of hyaline membrane and atelectasis, dilated capillaries immersed in the mesenchyme, and a distorted deposition of the extracellular matrix. BPD results in residual effects on pulmonary function and is linked to neurodevelopmental problems during later childhood.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Chronic Respiratory Morbidity (CRM) or Death Through 6 Months Corrected Age (CA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 6 Months Corrected Age (CA)</time_frame>
    <description>CRM is a common adverse outcome of premature birth resulting in recurrent respiratory symptoms requiring treatment with pulmonary medications such as bronchodilators, need for supplementary home oxygen, frequent emergency room visits or hospital readmissions, especially during the first year of life. CRM will be measured by respiratory health care utilization and respiratory symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Status as Assessed by PREMature Infant Index (PREMII) at Postmenstrual Age (PMA) 40 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>PMA Week 36</time_frame>
    <description>PREMII is a Clinician-Reported Outcome (ClinRO) assessment used to capture overall functional maturation of extremely preterm neonates. Functional Status is defined as what the infant can do with respect to 8 key functional areas (feeding, weight gain, thermoregulation, respiratory support, apnea, bradycardia, desaturation events, and oxygen administration), as a reflection of the infant's overall health and development.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)</measure>
    <time_frame>PMA Week 31 up to Week 40</time_frame>
    <description>The ROP examination will consist of a dilated fundus examination. Typically ROP is classified according to the International Classification (International Committee for the Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity 2005) and is subdivided into Stage 1 (demarcation line), Stage 2 (ridge), Stage 3 (ridge with extraretinal fibrovascular proliferations), Stage 4 (subtotal retinal detachment), and Stage 5 (total retinal detachment).</description>
