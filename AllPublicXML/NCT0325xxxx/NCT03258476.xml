  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teenagers are invited to take part voluntarily in a research study of a study drug known as
      guanfacine extended release (Intuniv™) and a type of psychotherapy called Mindfulness Skills
      Training which teaches people how to focus on the present moment in a nonjudgmental manner to
      help them cope with their stresses and worries. Teenagers are being asked to take part in
      this study if they have had traumatic stress related over arousal symptoms. He/she may also
      have difficulties with worries, anxiety, temper, aggression, quick mood changes, behavior
      problems, and/or difficulties with symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
      (ADHD) including inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity with or without Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD); and is not responding adequately to his/her current treatment.

      The primary purpose of the teenager's participation in this study is to help answer the
      following research question(s), and not to provide treatment for his or her condition:

        -  To investigate if Intuniv™ helps for the symptoms of traumatic stress and emotional and
           behavioral overarousal in children with a history of traumatic developmental stress with
           and without PTSD.

        -  To investigate if Intuniv™ helps your teenager engage with and benefit from Mindfulness
           Skills Training therapy

        -  To better understand how Intuniv™ works in the brain.

        -  To investigate how well your child tolerates Intuniv™ during the study.

    <description>Intuniv (guanfacine) is a prescription medicine used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children who are at least 6 years old. An open-label trail of guanfacine extended release (GXR 1-4 mg/daily; Intuniv™) suggested benefits in improving behavioral and emotional regulation in children and adolescents with symptoms of traumatic stress. However, to date no controlled clinical trial has been completed assessing the effects of GXR on traumatic stress symptoms in youths</description>
