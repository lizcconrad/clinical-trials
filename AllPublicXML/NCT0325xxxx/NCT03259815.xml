  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has recently been renewed interest in the measurement of post percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). Previous studies have suggested that
      post-PCI FFR values ≥ 0.90 are associated with better clinical outcomes for patients but the
      available data suggest that despite angiographically satisfactory results, this is actually
      achieved in less than 40% of cases.

      The main mechanisms for sub-optimal post-PCI FFR measurements have been proposed to be stent
      underexpansion, unmasking of a second lesion in the target vessel post PCI, residual diffuse
      disease in the untreated segments and pressure drift (a technical artifact of pressure wire
      technology).

      Using post-PCI FFR to guide stent optimisation and/or further intervention in the target
      vessel has been shown to increase the frequency of achieving optimal post-PCI FFR results
      (and therefore presumably better clinical outcomes). However, there are additional costs
      involved in the routine use of post-PCI FFR and it is not clear just how often it is even
      possible to increase the initial post-PCI FFR to ≥ 0.90. This uncertainty means that it is
      currently difficult to either recommend the routine use of post-PCI FFR or justify its cost.

      The investigators propose a prospective study to assess the feasibility of achieving post-PCI
      FFR ≥ 0.90 during standard PCI procedures in consecutive patients. The study would also
      attempt to elucidate the mechanisms for sub-optimal FFR results when they occur. The
      investigators anticipate using the data from this developmental study to support a subsequent
      funding application for a definitive phase 3 study of the impact of FFR targeted PCI on
      clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>

      Original hypothesis

      A simple Physiologically-guided Incremental Optimisation Strategy (PIOS) can increase the
      proportion of patients undergoing PCI in whom a post-PCI FFR ≥0.90 can be achieved from 40%
      to 60%.

      Experimental details and design of proposed investigation

      Overall aim:

      A randomised control trial of a physiologically-guided optimisation strategy to determine the
      feasibility of increasing the proportion of post-PCI FFR measurements ≥ 0.90 in a consecutive
      series of patients undergoing standard PCI procedures.

      Study Population:

      260 consecutive patients with stable angina referred for invasive management to the cardiac
      catheterisation lab who have been selected to undergo PCI based on either angiographic
      appearances or prior FFR assessment. Patients will be caffeine free for &gt;12 hours
      pre-procedure.

      Methods/Design:

      Informed consent will be obtained prior to cardiac catheterisation in all potential subjects
      conforming to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Patients will then be randomised to one of two groups (described below) and PCI will be
      performed, using a pressure guidewire, according to standard practice at the Golden Jubilee
      National Hospital (including lesion pre-dilation and post-dilation of the stented segment).

      Group 1 (PIOS Group):

      Operator-blinded coronary physiology measurements will be recorded pre and post PCI.

      If the post-PCI FFR is ≥ 0.90, no further intervention will be performed and the procedure is
      considered complete.

      If post-PCI FFR is &lt; 0.90, the result will be disclosed to the operator and a hyperaemic
      pressure wire pullback during either a standard peripheral intravenous adenosine infusion
      (140mcg/kg/min) or an intracoronary adenosine infusion (360mcg/min) via a microcatheter will
      be performed. Depending on the result the operator would then have the following options:

      A. If there is a step-up of ≥ 0.05 across the stented segment(s) further post-dilatation with
      a 0.25 - 0.50mm larger non-compliant balloon to at least 18 atmospheres should be performed
      followed by repeat FFR. Alternatively, the operator may choose to employ intracoronary
      imaging (IVUS or OCT) to guide post-dilation/optimisation of the stented segment.

      B. If there is a step-up of ≥ 0.05 across a relatively focal (&lt;20mm) unstented segment which
      is technically suitable for further stenting then a further stent should be implanted
      followed by repeat FFR.

      C. If the FFR remains &lt; 0.90 after steps A +/- B, a further FFR pullback will be performed.
      If the criteria for Step B are again met, one additional stent may be deployed and a final
      FFR pullback performed. Following this, the FFR result will be accepted.

      D. If the residual pressure gradient is interpreted to reflect diffuse atherosclerosis with
      no focal step-ups, the result is accepted.

      E. At the end of the procedure the pressure wire sensor will be withdrawn to the tip of the
      guiding catheter and compared with the aortic pressure. A pressure drift of ≤ 0.03 will be
      accepted and the final FFR result adjusted accordingly.

      F. If there is a drift of ≥ 0.04, the wire should be re-equalised and the final FFR
      measurement be repeated.

      G. The patients will have their demographics and procedure details recorded. All patients
      will receive 3-month telephone follow-up.

      Group 2 (Control Group):

      Pre and post-PCI coronary physiology measurements will be recorded but not disclosed to the
      operator. The angiographically defined result will be accepted. The patients will have their
      demographics and procedure details recorded. All patients will receive 3-month telephone
      follow-up.

      Expected value of results

        1. Confirmation that the proposed PIOS protocol significantly increases the proportion of
           patients obtaining a physiologically optimal post-PCI result will demonstrate the
           feasibility of this strategy and should lead to an increase in post-PCI pressure wire
           usage to achieve physiologically optimal results for patients.

           The investigators hypothesise that the PIOS intervention can increase the proportion of
           patients achieving this target from 40% to 60% and believe that an increment of at least
           this magnitude would be necessary to make a future larger study with both
           patient-oriented clinical (target vessel failure) and health care system (resource
           utilisation) outcomes acceptable to the interventional cardiology community and
           potential funders.

        2. The secondary outcome measures, albeit underpowered for clinical outcomes in this study,
           will hopefully still give a signal that achieving a target post-PCI FFR ≥ 0.90 does
           yield objective benefits for patients. This could then form the basis for a larger phase
           3 trial to confirm improved clinical outcomes and cost- effectiveness of FFR-targeted
           PCI
