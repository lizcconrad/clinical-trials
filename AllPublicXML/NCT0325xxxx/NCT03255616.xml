      The aim is to disentangle the supraspinal sensorimotor representation and its potential
      cortical reorganization of different thoraco-lumbar motion segments by using a novel
      computer-controlled, MR compatible pneumatic spinal indentation device (pneuSPID).

      Why doesn't my back pain stop? The efficacy of interventions for chronic back pain is known
      to be low to modest. This is especially true for non-specific chronic low back pain that does
      not have a known pathoanatomical cause and that creates an enormous burden on society.
      Despite a plethora of research efforts, the quality of back pain research is often low.
      Evidence suggests that the strict focus on structural and functional abnormalities of the
      spine has been unsuccessful. It is suggested that the understanding of the pathophysiology of
      back pain might be significantly improved by taking supraspinal neural mechanisms into
      account. In support of this notion, recent neuroscientific studies have revealed alterations
      in different brain regions of patients with chronic back pain, which are related to the
      chronification process. Of particular interest are somatosensory brain regions, which have
      been shown to undergo maladaptive changes in a variety of pain syndromes including chronic
      back pain. However, it is currently unclear under which circumstances brain representations
      of the painful back are altered and if these changes are associated with a modified
      somatotopic organization of the spine which might ultimately be linked to persistent back
      pain. Yet, only sparse evidence exists on the cortical somatotopic organization of the spine.
      Therefore, to establish an appropriate baseline, a systematic and detailed investigation of
      the spinal somatotopic cortical organization along the thoraco-lumbar axis in healthy
      subjects is mandatory in order to further unravel its role in chronic back pain. To reveal
      the brain representation of the spine, non-invasive methods such as high-resolution
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a newly developed MR-compatible stimulation
      method (pneumatic spinal indentation device, pneuSPID) will be used. PneuSPID is able to
      apply computer-controlled non-painful and painful mechanical pressure to different spinous
      processes of the lumbar and thoracic spine during fMRI. In addition, dynamic MR imaging of
      the spine will be performed to establish a model for pneuSPID-induced segmental motion. The
      respective model parameters will be used in multivariate decoding analyses to separate brain
      activity induced by segmental motion from other tissue movement. In addition, a topical
      anesthetic will be applied to control for the contribution of skin
      mechanoreceptors/nociceptors to brain activity. To conclude, this project pursues the
      identification of a specific neural population code representing the cortical
      somatotopic/proprioceptive organization of the thoraco-lumbar spine in healthy subjects and
      its potential change in back pain patients which forms a prerequisite for the identification
      of chronic back pain subgroups in order to develop novel intervention approaches.
