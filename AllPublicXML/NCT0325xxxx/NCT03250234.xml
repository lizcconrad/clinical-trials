  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will examine the impact of skeletal muscle glycogen stores on skeletal
      muscle and circulating microRNA expression and exogenous carbohydrate oxidation.

      Primary Objective Determine the influence of carbohydrate availability (e.g., glycogen
      depletion and repletion) on skeletal muscle microRNA expression, and if changes in
      circulating microRNA are reflective of changes in skeletal muscle microRNA.

      Secondary Objective Determine how initiation of exercise with adequate or low glycogen stores
      effects exogenous carbohydrate efficiency.

      Twelve, normal weight (BMI 18.5-30 kg/m2), healthy, physically active men and women will
      complete a glycogen depletion protocol, cycling at various intensities until failure.
      Participants will then consume a carbohydrate (CHO: 1 g/kg/hr) or an energy free control
      (CON) beverage matched for taste and color during the first 3-hr post glycogen depletion. For
      the remainder of the day participants will consume a diet designed to adequately (6.0 g
      CHO/kg/d) or inadequately (1.2 g CHO/kg/d) replenish glycogen stores. The following day
      participants will to complete 80-min of steady-state (~60% VO2peak) cycle ergometry consuming
      carbohydrate at a rate of 1.8 g/min enriched with a stable isotope of carbon to determine
      exogenous carbohydrate efficiency when glycogen stores are low or adequate at the onset of
      exercise.

      Following a minimum 7-d washout period volunteers will return to the laboratory to complete
      the second arm of the investigation. To ensure glycogen stores are similar between volunteers
      on testing day, 48-hrs prior to testing all volunteers will complete a glycogen depletion
      protocol and then consume a diet providing 6.0 g/kg/d carbohydrate to replenish glycogen
      stores.
