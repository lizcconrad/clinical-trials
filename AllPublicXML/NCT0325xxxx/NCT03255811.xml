    <textblock>
      The incidence of gastric cancer in China is high, and there is no standard first-line
      chemotherapy regimen for advanced gastric cancer. Second-line therapy usually involves
      first-line treatment, without the use of drugs for combination or monotherapy, and no uniform
      treatment. Apatinib approved provides a good solution to this problem, but this study is in
      limit of validity standard after all into the row, not very good reaction in clinical
      practice for APA imatinib reality in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Therefore, it
      is necessary to make a prospective product study to understand the gap between clinical
      practice and research results. This study can evaluate apatinib in treatment of advanced
      gastric or gastroesophageal junction safe and effective parts of adenocarcinoma in clinical
      practice, and the specific usage (such as dose and period). The results of this study can
      help the future clinical practice specification of apatinib parts for the treatment of
      adenocarcinoma with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal reflux, the advanced gastric or
      gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma patients with parts get treatment more safe and effective in
      the treatment of.
