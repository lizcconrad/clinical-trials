  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate and describe the feasibility of implementing a
      pharmacist-led pharmacogenomics service for the Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly
      (PACE), a community-based practice setting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if a pharmacogenomics (PGx) service can become a component of everyday practice,
      feasibility assessments are needed. While some researchers have begun to assess the
      feasibility of implementing PGx into pharmacy practice in community-based practice settings,
      none that we are aware have assessed such feasibility for the Program of All-inclusive Care
      for the Elderly (PACE). The primary objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the
      processes that were involved in implementing a pharmacist-led PGx service for PACE and to
      describe process-related challenges and solutions associated with implementation. Secondary
      objectives include: describe pharmacists' roles in the implementation process; report
      aggregate PGx test results, including genetic variants and drug-gene interactions; and
      describe pharmacists' recommendations to personalize drug regimens for PACE participants and
      prescribers' acceptance of these recommendations.

        In the United States, PACE is a medical home model for participants &gt;=55 years of age who
        are certified by their state as needing nursing-facility level of care but can reside
        safely in the community through PACE, as an alternative to institutionalization.
        Participants enrolled in PACE who underwent pharmacogenomics testing as part of their
        medical care and also consented to the use of their de-identified data for research
        purposes were eligible for inclusion.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant enrolled in PACE contractually receiving pharmacy services from Tabula
             Rasa Healthcare (CareKinesis Pharmacy) during the project time period (May 2014
             through June 2016); and

          -  PACE prescriber ordered a pharmacogenomics test for the participant as part of
             clinical care; and,

          -  PACE participant consented to a pharmacogenomics test; and,

          -  CareKinesis pharmacist provided a consultation directly to PACE prescriber based on
             the participant's pharmacogenomics test results.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant dis-enrolled from PACE prior to receiving pharmacogenomics test results
             and/or prior to CareKinesis pharmacist providing consultative services; or,

          -  Participant did not complete the pharmacogenomics test.
