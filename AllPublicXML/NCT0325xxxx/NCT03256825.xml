  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess the accuracy and impact of rapid diagnosis and rapid diagnosis
      decision support on different aspects of antibiotic consumption when implemented alone or
      together.

      This interventional study in two centers compares two groups with each other and with a
      pre-intervention control group. In group 1 rapid techniques for handling urine cultures will
      be the only intervention. In group 2 rapid diagnostics will be supplemented with real-time
      antimicrobial stewardship decision support (RADS). In each center two departments will be
      involved.

      Urine samples present at the laboratory at opening on weekdays will be screened using urine
      flow cytometry and microscopy of centrifuged gram stained urine. Samples found positive for
      significant mono microbial bacteriuria will be investigated further by using direct automated
      phenotypic identification and antimicrobial susceptibility determination and screened for
      inclusion in the interventional study.

      In one of the centers, rapid techniques will be coupled to real-time antimicrobial
      stewardship decision support (RADS). RADS will be given by telephone to a designated
      clinician with the aim of:

        1. Switch to active treatment if non-working empirical treatment

        2. De-escalate broad spectrum empiric treatment when feasible

        3. Promote early intravenous to per oral switch

        4. Shorten treatment duration
