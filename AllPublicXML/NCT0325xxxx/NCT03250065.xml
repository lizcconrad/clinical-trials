  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal describes the development of a 'Sensing ET Tube'. This device will replace the
      standard endotracheal (ET) tube used in anaesthesia and in ventilated intensive care patients
      and provide key vital signs monitoring utilising optoelectronic sensors. Continuous
      monitoring of patients' arterial oxygen saturation is essential during surgery, however pulse
      oximeters often misread or fail altogether as a result of peripheral vasoconstriction,
      hypotension or hypovolaemia. The Sensing ET Tube will allow continuous measurement of oxygen
      saturation and other parameters, such as pulse rate, from a single internal site, and will
      reduce the number of surface sensors placed on the skin and the number of electrical
      connections to the patient. The applicants have already developed similar sensor technology
      in the oesophagus and other internal locations. A pilot clinical evaluation of the device
      will be completed in anaesthetised patients undergoing surgery. The project will lead to
      further development of a multi-sensor tracheal platform for comprehensive anaesthesia and
      intensive care monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate a novel medical device known as the
      'Sensing ET Tube' for measuring oxygen levels in patients undergoing surgical operations. The
      device replaces the standard breathing tube used in surgery and incorporates photonic sensors
      for measurement of the patient's oxygen level and other vital signs. Currently this
      information is supplied from finger probes, which can fail often, for example when the
      patient is cold or when the blood pressure is low. The new device is completely harmless and
      allows the anaesthetist to monitor the oxygen level from the central region of the body using
      minimal connections. If successful, future work is planned to incorporate other sensors into
      the system, providing a complete overview of the health of the patient. This will greatly
      simplify the process of patient monitoring while reducing the number of failures, improving
      patient safety and reducing operating costs.

      A clinical trial is planned in up to 50 patients undergoing general anaesthesia, which will
      quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the measured clinical variables and
      the device's expected performance in mainstream operation. This information will provide the
      basis for further commercial development, most likely through partnership with a medical
      device manufacturer.

      To summarise, the main aims of the project are:

        -  Investigate photoplethysmographic signals from the human trachea and identify viability
           to measure heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation by comparison with &quot;gold standard&quot;
           techniques.

        -  Evaluate custom-designed endotracheal sensor for operation and determine ideal
           electrical characteristics for optimal operation (current supply, detector amplification
           etc.)

    <description>Raw optical electrical signals related to the absorbion of red and infrared light from the prototype sensor by the tissue in the trachea will be assessed for their viability to reliable determine pulse rate and oxygen saturation compared to the standard clinical devices during surgery. The signals will be further analysed to look for correlation with recorded blood pressure measurents and respiration rates.</description>
