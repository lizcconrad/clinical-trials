  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      The drug Nivolumab has been approved to treat some cancers. Researchers want to see if it can
      slow the growth of other cancers. They want to study its effects on cancers that may have not
      responded to chemotherapy or other treatments.

      Objectives:

      To see if Nivolumab slows the growth of some types of cancer or stops them from getting
      worse. To test the safety of the drug.

      Eligibility:

      People 12 and older who have Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)-positive lymphoproliferative disorders
      or EBV-positive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with no standard therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Blood and urine tests

      CAT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

      Tumor and bone marrow biopsies (sample taken)

      Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain

      Lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap)

      Positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan with a radioactive tracer

      Every 2 weeks, participants will get Nivolumab by vein over about 1 hour. They will also
      have:

      Physical exam

      Blood and pregnancy tests

      Review of side effects and medications

      During the study, participants will repeat most of the screening tests. They may also have
      other biopsies.

      After stopping treatment, participants will have a visit every 3 months for 1 year. Then they
      will have a visit every 6 months for years 2-5, and then once a year. They will have a
      physical exam and blood tests.

      Background:

        -  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a chronic viral infection associated with a heterogeneous
           group of lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL)

        -  The shared pathobiology of EBV-positive LPDs and NHLs includes a defect in host
           mechanisms of immune tolerance and immunosurveillance.

        -  Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a surface protein present on T cells, B cells, and
           macrophages that serves a co-inhibitory role to negatively regulate immune responses

        -  PD-1 and its ligands, PD L1 and PD-L2, are overexpressed in EBV-positive lymphomas and
           are markers of aggressive behavior.

        -  Blockade of the PD-1 pathway induces T-cell responses against tumor antigens in a
           variety of cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma, that lead to clinical remissions.

        -  Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal anti-PD-1 receptor antibody with clinical
           activity in both indolent and aggressive lymphomas.

      Objective:

      -To determine the best overall response rate of nivolumab in subjects with EBV-positive LPD
      and EBV-positive NHL

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects must have a confirmed diagnosis of an EBV-positive B-cell LPD or an EBVpositive
           NHL confirmed by Laboratory of Pathology, NCI

             -  Cohort 1: LPD subjects may be previously untreated or relapsed from prior therapy

             -  Cohort 2: EBV-positive B-cell NHL subjects must have relapsed from previous
                treatment with an anthracycline and rituximab-based regimen or be considered not
                eligible for the same.

        -  Adequate bone marrow function (unless disease-related) defined as:

             -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 750/mcL

             -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9g/dL (transfusion permitted)

             -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 50,000/mcL (transfusion not permitted)

        -  Age greater than or equal to 12 years

      Design:

        -  Phase II study of subjects with EBV-positive LPD and EBV-positive NHL, both relapsed and
           untreated.

        -  Subjects will be treated with nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every 2 weeks for up to 2 years if PR
           or SD with clinical improvement and no unacceptable toxicity and clinical benefit;
           subjects with CR will stop.

        -  All responding subjects (CR, PR, or SD with clinical benefit) who subsequently relapse
           or progress within 1 year after discontinuation of study drug are eligible for
           re-treatment.

        -  An optimal two-stage phase II trial design will be used to rule out a best overall
           response rate of 20% in each cohort. If fewer than 3 of the first 17 subjects respond,
           that cohort would accrue no more subjects.

        -  37 subjects with EBV-positive LPD and 37 subjects with EBV-positive NHL will be enrolled
           on this protocol.

          -  The toxicity profile of nivolumab in patients with disease involvement of the central
             nervous system (CNS) is unknown. For this reason, we will introduce early stopping
             rules.

          -  The effects of nivolumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             the following measures apply:

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine
                  pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) during
                  screening and within 48 hours prior to the first dose of nivolumab.

               -  WOCBP and men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use adequate contraception
                  (e.g., hormonal or 2 barrier methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year
                  or abstinence) prior to study entry and throughout study drug administration.
                  WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a
                  period of 23 weeks after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving
                  nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to
                  contraception for a period of 31 weeks after the last dose of investigational
                  product.

               -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or
                  surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception.

               -  WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not
                  undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
                  ligation, or bilateral ophorectomy), and who is not postmenopausal. Post
                  menopause is defined as:

                    1. Amenorrhea greater than or equal to 12 consecutive months without another
                       cause, and a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35
                       mIU/mL or

                    2. Women with irregular menstrual periods and a documented serum follicle
                       stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL or NOTE: FSH level testing is
                       not required for women greater than or equal to 62 years old with amenorrhea
                       of greater than or equal to 1 year

                    3. Women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab is an IgG monoclonal
             antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.

          -  Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with nivolumab, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab.

          -  Ability of subject or Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) to understand and sign
             the written informed consent document.
