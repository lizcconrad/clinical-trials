  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the most common cause of death in the clinical critically ill patients. We have
      successfully screened the sepsis biomarkers by clinical proteomics approach and found that
      Vimentin (VIM) played an important role in the occurrence and development of sepsis. However,
      the exact mechanism is remaining unclear. In this study, the relationship between the changes
      of peripheral circulation VIM expression and different stages of sepsis development will be
      further verified in lager clinical trials, as well as the relationship between VIM expression
      and apoptosis of immune cells (e.g lymphocytes) will also be clarified. This may indicate
      that the role of VIM in the cell-mediated immunity apoptosis and inflammation-related
      pathways. Through the implementation of this study, we can clarify the clinical value of VIM
      and the mechanism of VIM-mediated immune cell apoptosis during the sepsis development from
      the molecular level, and determine whether the VIM as a new target for sepsis diagnosis and
      treatment.

    <description>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.
Organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in total SOFA score ≥2 points consequent to the infection.
The baseline SOFA score can be assumed to be zero in patients not known to have preexisting organ dysfunction.
ASOFA score ≥2 reflects an overall mortality risk of approximately 10% in a general hospital population with suspected infection. Even patients presenting with modest dysfunction can deteriorate further, emphasizing the seriousness of this condition and the need for prompt and appropriate intervention, if not already being instituted.
In lay terms, sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to an infection injures its own tissues and organs.</description>

    <description>Patients with septic shock can be identified with a clinical construct of sepsis with persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥65 mm Hg and having a serum lactate level &gt;2 mmol/L (18mg/dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation.</description>

      Within 24 h (the first day of study) after ICU admission, blood samples was collected.Blood
      was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatants were transferred to Eppendorf
      tubes and stored at -80°C.
