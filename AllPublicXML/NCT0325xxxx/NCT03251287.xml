  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inorganic nitrate, which is found at high levels in green leafy vegetables, is reduced to
      nitrite by bacteria in the mouth, swallowed, and absorbed in the stomach into the blood.
      Studies have shown that increasing the blood levels of nitrite improves the way that muscles
      use oxygen and energy during exercise, and potentially blood flow.

      Some people (~1 in 500) suffer from a type of genetic heart condition known as hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy (HCM). This condition means that the muscle in the heart does not use energy
      well and becomes larger than average, meaning that they have to tap into the heart's 'energy
      reserves'. It is not known if nitrite has the same beneficial effects on heart muscle as on
      other muscles in the body. Our study will explore the mechanism by which nitrite may improve
      the function and energy status of the heart in HCM.
