      The objective of the study is to compare children at low risk for obesity (two healthy weight
      parents) to children at high risk for obesity (two overweight parents) in their response rate
      to food taste and in their rate of learning using fMRI.

      The primary aim of this project is to conduct an adequately powered study that compares
      children at low risk for obesity to children at high risk for obesity on their brain
      responses to food tastes during a pavlovian learning task. Seven assessment visits will be
      conducted at three separate time points; baseline, 1-year follow up, and 2-year follow up.
      Assessments will include anthropometry, interviews, computer tasks, questionnaires, and an
      fMRI scan. This program of research tests a novel hypothesis regarding overeating and the
      development of obesity in children, and could provide critical data on individual
      vulnerabilities to overeating for further research. Furthermore, this study could provide
      mechanisms for intervention with regards to cue-reward learning in children, to ultimately
      prevent obesity in youth.
