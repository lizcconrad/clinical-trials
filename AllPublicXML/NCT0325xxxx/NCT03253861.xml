  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute pancreatitis is a common reason for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and is
      associated with prolonged hospital stays and high morbidity and mortality rates. The Atlanta
      classification differentiates mild, moderate, and severe acute pancreatitis, and each of
      these categories correlates with morbidity and mortality. Mortality remains high, between 10%
      and 39%, in severe and moderately severe acute pancreatitis. After the first week, about 30%
      of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis develop infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN). IPN is
      a risk factor for mortality.The treatment of IPN combines antibiotics with interventions to
      remove the infected intra-abdominal material, preferably using minimally invasive techniques
      such as percutaneous and endoscopic drainage, which have been proven beneficial. In several
      studies biological markers such as procalcitonin and interleukin 8 were effective in
      predicting IPN. However, few clinical risk factors for IPN have been reported. Identifying
      risk factors may help to improve standardized strategies for early diagnosis and treatment,
      and then patients outcome. Our primary objective was to identify risk factors for IPN in
      patients admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis. Our secondary objective was to describe
      the management and outcomes of IPN

      Using electronic patient data monitoring systems, the investigators reviewed all patients
      with a diagnosis of acute necrotizing pancreatitis admitted to digestive liver disease unity
      or ICUs at the Nantes University Hospital, from January 1, 2012, to december 31, 2015. For
      enrolled patients, general clinical characteristics were collected. Patients were categorized
      into two groups according to the development of an infected pancreatic necrosis (highly
      suspected or proven), and the differences of these characteristics between two groups were
      evaluated. Potential risk factors were collected and studied by using multiple logistic
      regression analysis.

    <description>Potential risk factors included patient demographics, disease severity, complications, morphology on CT, and details of the drainage procedure. Univariate analyses examined potential risk factors on outcome (catheter drainage failure). Then, using multiple logistic regression analysis, factors achieving P≤0.1 in univariate analyses were entered into the model predicting the risk of catheter drainage failure</description>
