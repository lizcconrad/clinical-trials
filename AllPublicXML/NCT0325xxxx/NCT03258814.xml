  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-interventional, longitudinal and non-confirmatory study to compare an
      active supervised training (AST) with standard of care (SOC) physiotherapy in patients with
      axial spondyloarthritis and stable response to adalimumab (HUMIRA®) with respect to
      health-related outcomes. The primary objective is the improvement in spinal mobility after a
      6 month training program. SOC physiotherapy will be prescribed on physicians and performed on
      physiotherapist's discretion. Further objectives are the improvement in physical function,
      health-related quality of life, disease activity, pain, psychosocial risk factors and
      workability.
