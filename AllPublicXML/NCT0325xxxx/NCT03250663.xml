  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis will be asked to participate in helping the
      study team determine how well the medication works for atopic dermatitis. Participants will
      not be told that adherence will be monitored. Patients will be dispensed topical crisaborole
      2% ointment (EucrisaÂ®) in a medication tube fitted with a Medication Event Monitoring System
      (MEMS) cap if they agree to participate. This cap records dates and times the bottle is
      opened and this data can be downloaded and tabulated with the associated software.

      Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence data until the final treatment
      (12 month) session. The study subjects will be randomized to two groups. After baseline
      visit, both groups will come for a follow-up visit at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12
      months. The intervention group will also be asked to complete an online treatment response
      survey designed to improve adherence at weekly intervals for 6 weeks, then monthly
      thereafter.

      The study will consist of a 12-month Treatment Phase. Study subjects will be instructed to
      apply the medication twice daily (morning and evening) to all of their AD lesions. They will
      be instructed to apply the smallest amount of study medication possible that is sufficient to
      cover all lesions. These instructions are standard-of-care for patients with AD.

      Subjects will be asked to bring their medication tubes with them at each visit. At each
      visit, the study coordinator will weigh the medication tube and download the MEMS cap data.
      Disclosure of the adherence monitoring will occur at the 12 month visit (or end of
      treatment), at which time the results of the subject's adherence behavior will be used to
      supply individualized treatment options for each subject (feedback session).

      At each visit, drug tubes will be measured for weight to determine the amount of study
      medication used. This data will be correlated with the extent of BSA involved and the
      response of the disease. The MEMS caps will be downloaded at each visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic Dermatitis (AD) affects between 10% and 30% of all children, making it one of the most
      common childhood diseases. Recent epidemiological studies report a trend toward the
      increasing prevalence of AD in children. Symptoms of AD include dry, scaly, and intensely
      itchy skin. A number of treatments are available for these patients. Topical corticosteroids
      are commonly prescribed. Topical immunomodulators without the potential for steroid atrophy
      are also used. A non-steroidal topical, Eucrisa (crisaborole) ointment, is specifically
      indicated for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and was approved for marketing in the U.S.
      for the treatment atopic dermatitis in December 2016. The 2% ointment is approved for use in
      patients ages 2 and older. Unfortunately, many people with atopic dermatitis do not
      adequately respond to topical treatment.

      It is widely recognized that adherence to oral medications is poor. Adherence to medication
      in chronic disease is worse. Adherence to topical medication for chronic disease in children
      is horrible. In a previous study, the investigator found that the adherence of children to
      topical triamcinolone for atopic dermatitis was poor. Adherence dropped by roughly 60-70%
      over the first 3 days of treatment. While that study analyzed adherence over 8 weeks, the
      long-term adherence to topical treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis is not well
      characterized.

      Measures to improve adherence have the potential to improve treatment outcomes. Adherence to
      topical treatment tends to improve around the time of office visits (so called, &quot;white coat
      compliance&quot;), much as tooth flossing behavior improves around the time of dental visits.
      Standard-of-care treatment of atopic dermatitis generally involves having patients return in
      roughly 4 weeks to assess treatment efficacy. Clinical trials generally have more frequent
      visits. The investigator's recent studies have suggested that adherence may be improved with
      virtual medical visits, alleviating the need for more frequent in-person office visits that
      can be costly and negatively impact access to care.

    <description>Difference in adherence between standard-of-care and intervention with use of MEMS Caps: The Medical Events Monitoring System (MEMS) by MWV formerly Aardex Corporation in Switzerland will be used. The MEMS incorporates a microprocessor into the cap of a standard medication tube. Each time the tube is opened for at least 3 seconds, the time and date are recorded. The Eucrisa 2% ointment will be fitted with a MEMS cap using a specially designed adaptor. Subjects will be asked to bring the unused portion of the medication tube to each visit so that the medication can be &quot;checked and redispensed&quot;. At each visit the information is downloaded via the MEMS communicator onto a computer database by the study staff to ensure the blinding of the primary physician performing the severity measures.</description>

This measure is a commonly used and well-validated instrument of eczema severity. It is weighted for area in each of the four body regions (which differs for adults and children under 7) and scores erythema, excoriation, induration/papulation, and lichenification. The total scores range from 0-72.</description>

VAS data is recorded as the number of mm from the left of the line with the range 0-100mm. The Visual Analog Scale is anchored with the verbal descriptions of &quot;no itching&quot; on the left and &quot;the most intense itching imaginable&quot; on the right. VAS is considered a useful tool for the measurement of symptoms such as itch.</description>
