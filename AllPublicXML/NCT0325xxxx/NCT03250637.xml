  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the interaction between diet - primary meat and fiber
      - and polymorphisms in Toll-like receptors in relation to risk of colorectal cancer in a
      Danish prospective cohort.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Meat and dietary fibers have been associated with increased and decreased risk of colorectal
      cancer (CRC), respectively. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate intestinal immune response in
      a complex interplay between the mucosal epithelium and the microbiota and may therefore be
      important modulators of diet-induced CRC and interact with other inflammatory mediators.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the association with functional TLR polymorphisms in
      relation to risk of CRC and their interaction with dietary factors. Additionally,
      interactions with previously studied polymorphisms in IL10, IL1B, PTGS2 and NFKB1 will be
      assessed in order to examine possible biological pathways in meat-induced CRC.

      Data are retrieved from the Danish prospective &quot;Diet, Cancer and Health&quot; study encompassing
      57,053 persons which were recruited between 1993 to 1997. Between 1994 and 31th December
      2009, 1038 CRC cases has been diagnosed. A sub-cohort of 1857 persons has been randomly
      selected within the full cohort at time of entry into the cohort. The study design is a
      nested case-cohort study.

        The Diet, Cancer and Health study is an ongoing Danish cohort study designed to investigate
        the relation between diet, lifestyle and cancer risk. The cohort consists of 57,053
        persons, recruited between December 1993 and May 1997. All the subjects were born in
        Denmark, and the individuals were 50 to 64 years of age and had no previous cancers at
        study entry. Blood samples, anthropometric measures and questionnaire data on diet and
        lifestyle were collected at study entry.

        The present study uses a nested case-cohort design. Follow-up is based on population-based
        cancer registries. Between 1994 and 31th December 2009, 1038 CRC cases were diagnosed. A
        sub-cohort of 1857 persons has randomly been selected within the full cohort at time of
        entry into the cohort.
