  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies, in which the perception threshold and / or sensory evoked potentials at
      different points of the lower urinary tract were examined and measured by means of electrical
      stimulation, a clear increase in the volume of the bladder and thus the urine excretion under
      the stimulation could be observed. This observation is now to be investigated more closely in
      a separate study, in order to strengthen the observation with further measured data and to
      find possible physiological connections. A detectable influence of electrical stimulation in
      the lower urinary tract on renal urine production would have a significant relevance both
      therapeutically and for the neurophysiological understanding of interactions between the
      lower and upper urinary tracts.
