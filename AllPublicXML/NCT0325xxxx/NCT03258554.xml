  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II/III trial studies how well radiation therapy works with durvalumab
      or cetuximab in treating patients with stage III-IVB head and neck cancer who cannot take
      cisplatin. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab and cetuximab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not known if radiation therapy with durvalumab will
      work better than the usual therapy of radiation therapy with cetuximab in treating patients
      with head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent and adjuvant anti-PD-L1
      therapy (MEDI4736 [durvalumab]) is safe in patients with locoregionally advanced head and
      neck cancer (HNC) who have a contraindication to cisplatin. (Lead-in) II. To test the
      hypothesis that concurrent RT and anti-PD-L1 therapy improves progression free survival (PFS)
      compared to standard therapy (RT with concurrent cetuximab) in patients with locoregionally
      advanced HNC who have a contraindication to cisplatin. (Phase II) III. To test the hypothesis
      that concurrent RT and anti-PD-L1 therapy improves overall survival compared to standard
      therapy (RT with concurrent cetuximab) in patients with locoregionally advanced HNC who have
      a contraindication to cisplatin. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and
      Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE between patients treated with RT + anti-PD-L1 therapy
      versus RT/cetuximab.

      II. To test the effect of anti-PD-L1 therapy in the subpopulation of patients with tumors
      that overexpress PD-L1.

      III. To compare overall survival, response (at 4-month fludeoxyglucose F-18 [FDG]-positron
      emission tomography [PET]-computed tomography [CT]), locoregional failure, distant
      metastasis, and competing mortality in the two arms by known risk factors, including p16
      status and omega score.

      IV. To test the hypothesis that MEDI4736 (durvalumab) therapy arm will have less decline in
      the physical function domain of European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
      Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0) based on the change in score from baseline to
      12 months from end of RT, compared to the cetuximab-RT arm in patients with locoregionally
      advanced HNC who have a contraindication to cisplatin.

      V. To test the hypothesis that MEDI4736 (durvalumab) therapy arm at 1 year (from end of RT)
      will have less decline in swallowing related quality of life (QOL) using the M. D. Anderson
      Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) total composite score, based on the change in score from baseline
      to 12 months from end of RT, compared to the cetuximab-RT arm in patients who are medically
      unfit for cisplatin.

      VI. To compare swallowing related performance and function short and long term using the
      Performance Status Scale for Head &amp; Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN).

      VII. To evaluate gastrostomy tube retention rates between arms.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the hypothesis that radiation combined with MEDI4736 (durvalumab) enhances the
      adaptive immune response using three types of immunophenotyping compared to radiation
      combined with cetuximab.

      II. To compare overall QOL short term (end RT-8 months) and long term (12-24 months from end
      of RT) between arms using the EORTC QLQ-C30 version 3.0/HN35.

      III. To evaluate swallowing related QOL short term (end RT-8 months) and long term (12-24
      months from end of RT) using the EORTC Head and Neck (HN)35 swallowing domain and MDADI
      (subscales) between arms in patients with locoregionally advanced HNC who have a
      contraindication to cisplatin.

      IV. To evaluate patient reported fatigue using the fatigue items in the EORTC QLQ and
      PRO-CTCAE.

      V. To compare clinician and patient reported toxicity using CTCAE and PRO CTCAE.

      VI. To explore health utilities between cetuximab and MEDI4736 (durvalumab) RT using the
      European Quality of Life 5 Dimensional-5 Level (EQ5D-5L).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes weekly. Treatment
      repeats every week for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Beginning 5-7 days after first cetuximab dose, patients undergo intensity modulated
      radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 fractions per week for up to 7 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes every 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every
      4 weeks for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Beginning week 2, patients undergo IMRT 5 fractions per week for up to 7 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month, every 4 months for
      1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.

    <description>Will perform multiparametric flow cytometry on peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patient-derived blood samples to quantify changes in immune cell frequency and activation status before, during and after radiation combined with cetuximab or radiation combined with durvalumab. To assess the statistical significance of pre- to post-treatment changes in levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs as well as other markers, normalized signal intensities (log2) will be tested using a paired t test within an arm and two sample t test between the two arms. If the distribution assumption is violated for the t tests, nonparametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be considered. Lastly, the association between PFS and OS and post-treatment changes in frequency and activation state of T-cells, clonality and diversity of T cell receptor (TCR), and IgG levels will be evaluated using a two-sided Wald test at 0.05 level on the basis of Cox models.</description>

          -  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or other severe interstitial lung disease that requires
             oxygen therapy or is thought to require oxygen therapy within 1 year prior to step 1

          -  Clinically apparent jaundice and/or known coagulation defects

          -  Active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders (including

             or Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypophysitis, uveitis, etc.])

               -  The following are exceptions to this criterion:

             required for entry into this protocol; the need to exclude patients with AIDS from
             this protocol is necessary because the treatment involved in this protocol may be
             immunosuppressive; patients with known HIV, CD4 counts &gt;= 200/uL, and undetectable
             viral loads who are stable on an antiretroviral regimen may be included

             for 6 months after the last dose of cetuximab or MEDI14736 (durvalumab); this
             exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be
             significantly teratogenic; women who are breastfeeding are also excluded

          -  Prior allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to cetuximab or MEDI4736 (durvalumab) or
             any of study drug excipients

             surface antigen [HBsAg] result), hepatitis C; patients with a past or resolved HBV
             infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence
             of HBsAg) are eligible; patients positive for hepatitis C (hepatitis C virus [HCV])
             antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for HCV
             ribonucleic acid (RNA)
