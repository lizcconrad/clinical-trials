    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of two body acceptance programs for
      women. Participants may experience reduction of eating pathology and prevention of future
      obesity and eating disorders; may derive a sense of altruism and contribution to furthering
      understanding of a public health problem.

    <description>Counter-attitudinal therapy (CAT) is dissonance-based group intervention. CAT consists of behavioral, written, and verbal exercises in which participants discuss the costs of pursuing the thin ideal and behaviors that are used to pursue the thin ideal. The intervention is 8 sessions long (1-hr each) and is administered by a trained facilitator who uses an intervention script. Participants will be asked to complete weekly home exercises throughout the course of the intervention.</description>

    <description>The educational support group intervention that is representative of typical treatment groups offered at universities and community settings. For the current study, the educational support group was designed to match the dissonance group on treatment modality (group-based), duration (8 1-hr sessions), and use of an intervention script administered by a trained facilitator. In the intervention sessions, participants will be provided with a basic education about eating disorders, support for themselves and fellow group members, and learn mindfulness techniques.Participants will be asked to complete weekly homework assignments.</description>

    <description>Young women with body dissatisfaction will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) an educational-support group condition; or 2) a counter-attitudinal therapy condition. We will test if a brief dissonance-based eating disorder prevention program produces intervention effects when delivered to participants with sub-threshold and threshold eating disorders.</description>
