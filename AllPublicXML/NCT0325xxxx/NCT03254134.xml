  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a comparative effectiveness and safety study of clinical events among patients taking
      either dabigatran or warfarin. There is no formal hypothesis to be tested, but rather to
      provide the estimates on the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism (effectiveness) and
      bleeding events (safety) using 95% confidence interval for comparison between those
      non0-valvular atrial fibrillation patients taking dabigatran vs. warfarin using a large,
      nation-wide claims data in Japan.

        Any patients with atrial fibrillation contained in the Medical Data Vision (MDVI) database
        which is a Japanese, nationwide claims data containing approximately 16 million patients
        cumulatively. The data cut is between March 2011 to June 2016, and the patients in the MDV
        database are those who have visited DPC hospitals (diagnostic procedure combination, a
        lump-sum payment system based on disease diagnosis to be treated similar to
        Medicare/Medicaid in the USA) hospitals which provide acute in-patient, as well as
        outpatient care.
