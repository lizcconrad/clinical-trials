  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing lay Lady Health Workers with Lady Health
      Visitors on quantitative measures of safety and effectiveness of Depo Provera and Sayana
      Press provision in a clinic setting. This comparative trial will test the non-inferiority
      hypothesis that Lady Health Workers are just as competent as clinically-trained Lady Health
      Visitors in screening and counseling first-time injectable users. These first time users will
      also be randomly assigned to receive intramuscular or subcutaneous injections of DMPA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FHI 360 and Jhpiego in collaboration with USAID, Aga Khan University (AKU) and the Government
      of Sindh province propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to provide evidence that could
      change current policies in Pakistan that forbid initiation of DMPA by Lady Health Workers
      (LHWs). Positive findings on the safety and effectiveness of LHW-initiation of DMPA may also
      prompt the WHO to consider modifying the recommendation for targeted M&amp;E for lay health
      worker provision of intramuscular injectable contraceptives. The trial will compare the
      screening and counseling of (LHWs)—the main lay health worker cadre--with that of Lady Health
      Visitors (LHVs) who are clinically-trained. The Government of Sindh province also expressed
      interest in introducing Pfizer's subcutaneous form of Depo Provera, Sayana Press® (SP) in
      Pakistan, which could simplify administration of injectable contraceptives. As such, an SP
      arm will be included in the trial, which will be facilitated by relevant training of LHWs and
      LHVs by Jhpiego and stocks provided by a special USAID procurement, since the registration
      process for SP in Pakistan is ongoing. A successful RCT demonstrating the non-inferiority of
      LHWs vis á vis LHVs on first-dose initiation of Depo Provera IM (DMPA IM) and (SP) would
      facilitate efforts to expand CBA2I in Pakistan, and in turn improve access to family planning
      services for a potentially large number of underserved women.
