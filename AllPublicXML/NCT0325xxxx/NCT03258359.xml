  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of autologous T cells that have been immunized ex vivo
      with patient-specific MDS stem cell neoantigens in patients with MDS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PACTN is manufactured by a novel method to employ cancer-specific somatic variants
      (mutations) as a means to immunize autologous T lymphocytes to specifically kill cancer cells
      bearing the protein products of the mutations.

      The PACTN method is based on the premise that somatic DNA mutations that cause cancer often
      give rise to proteins with an altered amino acid sequence. Peptides derived from these
      proteins, if expressed in the context of MHC Class I or II may be perceived as &quot;non-self&quot; by
      the immune system; that is, they may be perceived as neoantigens (aka, neoepitopes). Such
      neoantigens could therefore serve as immunogenic targets for the development of
      patient-specific, personalized T cell mediated immunotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of MDS according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria.
             Subjects with MDS must have intermediate, high, or very high risk IPSS-R scores and
             cytopenia of at least one lineage.

          -  Relapsed/refractory disease, or inadequate response to at least 6 cycles of
             hypomethylating therapy. Subjects must not have received any MDS or MAL directed
             therapy for &gt;28 days prior to receiving the study treatment.

          -  Subjects who have opted not to undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation and who are not deemed eligible for high intensity chemotherapy.
