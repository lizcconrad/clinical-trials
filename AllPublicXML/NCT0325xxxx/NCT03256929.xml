  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The propose of the study is a multi-disciplinary project connecting nutritional and health
      sciences with social and behavioral sciences, and aimed at understanding the microbiota
      changes related to the third age and their effects on mood and mental health. The research
      aims are primarily practical: They will explore the influence of the gut flora on depression,
      which could help us to recommend diets that might reduce the risk of developing depression.
      The novelty of this proposal is in the design of personalized diet-driven microbiota
      alterations and health status to modulate depression in elderly. For the first time the
      improvement of mental health in the elderly will be studied through a nutritional and food
      habits approach based on microbiota changes upon ageing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in older populations, is one of the most serious
      public health problems faced by modern societies. The problems caused by depression, such as
      functional impairments, lead to decreased quality of life, poor recovery from illnesses and
      increased mortality in the elderly. Researchers have found that there are many possible
      connections between personal or physical variables and the risk of developing depression; it
      can be caused by sociodemographic factors, or cognitive and functional impairment,
      nutritional status is also related to development of depression.

      Recent studies have suggested that depressive symptoms are more prevalent in individuals with
      impaired nutritional status. The intestinal microbial population (microbiota), known
      influenced by several factors including nutrition, age, and stress.

      The microbiota is essential to human health, changes in composition microbiota play a role in
      metabolic, nutritional, physiological and immunological processes in the human body, recently
      reported also behavioral changes associated with anxiety and depression. The aging process is
      characterized by a decrease intestinal transit time, as a result of dental problems, decrease
      in saliva activity, and efficiency of digestion and absorption leading to changes in the
      microbiota composition, which causes an increase in sensitivity to the development of chronic
      and inflammatory diseases. Although other factors undoubtedly contribute to mental health
      decline in the elderly, the association of the intestinal microbiota of older people with
      inflammation, the clear association between diet and microbiota and the recent report on the
      correlation between changes in microbiota and depression have led us to hypothesize that diet
      can shape microbiota, which then affect mood status in older people and decreased depressive
      symptoms.

      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of a custom diet based on the composition
      of the intestinal bacterial population (compared with a diet for a healthy lifestyle that is
      not based on a microbiotic profile), on moods and depression among the elderly.

      Before and after the intervention, several tests will be carried out, using stool sample for
      microbiota analysis, salivary cortisol measurement and clinical information (GDS, life style
      habits, CEBQ, FFQ), These measures will indicate participants' clinical, nutritional and
      mental situation before and after in order to probe the diet intervention impact on
      microbiota and its correlation to mental health.

      The infrastructure of this research includes several aspects - mood, health and nutrition
      status that are main parameters in life quality of the third age, and the research is based
      on the complementary cooperation of social and behavior sciences and nutrition and life
      sciences experts.

    <description>Microbiota composition will be characterized from feces. The stool specimens will be collected and immediately put in buffer and stored at -20ºC for analysis and then will be kept at -80ºC in a locked freezer. The very low temperature is of significance to avoid variability in the stool bacterial composition and to preserve bacterial DNA in fecal samples. Total microbial DNA will be extracted using the PowerSoil DNA extraction kit (MoBio) and then submitted to 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using paired end Illumina technology.</description>

On the day of the assay, Salivette™ samples can be thawed and then centrifuged at low speed to separate the saliva sample from the gauze. The cortisol in saliva is remarkably stable and will be measured by the salivary cortisol kit.</description>
