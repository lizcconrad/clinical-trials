  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label phase IIA study that investigates the preliminary
      efficacy of TATE treatment of liver cancer followed by a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (either
      nivolumab or pembrolizumab). At least two cohorts will be enrolled, one for patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the other with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to investigate whether tumor necrosis induced by TATE treatment can
      boost anti-tumor immunity and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint
      inhibitor. Patients with advanced HCC or metastatic CRC with liver lesions will be enrolled
      in the study. Liver lesions will be treated with up to 4 TATE treatments for optimal
      debulking, which also serve as a vaccination process toward tumor. Lesion not treated with
      TATE will be used for monitoring the response toward a PD-1 inhibitor (either Nivolumab or
      Pembrolizumab per investigator decision). If a patient subsequently develops an &quot;escape&quot; to
      the PD-1 inhibitor, patient can have another 2 TATE treatments of the escaped tumor lesion.
      Dosing of the PD-1 inhibitor is per standard FDA-approved dosing schedule and continues until
      progressive disease. The efficacy will be assessed by the response rate (RR) using RECIST and
      irRC for the non-TATE treated lesion, and compared with the historic RR of the PD-1 inhibitor
      in HCC (~16%) and mCRC (almost 0% for those without mismatch repair defect).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with either a confirmed diagnosis of (1) metastatic colorectal cancer in
             liver based on histopathology of either a prior resection of primary lesion or a
             biopsied liver metastatic lesion, or (2) advanced HCC (BCLC-stage C) with a
             characteristic 3 or 4-phase CT or dynamic contrast enhanced MRI finding showing
             arterial uptake followed by &quot;washout&quot; of contrast in the venous-delayed phases per
             American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) criteria.
