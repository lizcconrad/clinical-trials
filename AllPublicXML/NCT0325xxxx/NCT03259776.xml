  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2011, people who have had a serious accident in England are no longer looked after at
      the hospital nearest to them. Instead, they are cared for at a specialist hospital called the
      regional major trauma centre. This is so that they can get the best possible care from
      specialist professionals.

      St George's is the regional major trauma centre for the 2.6 million people living in South
      West London and Surrey County. This area stretches about 40 miles across.

      About one fifth of major trauma patients who come to St George's live more than one hour's
      journey away. Their visitors often travel a similar distance or even further. Family members
      and friends play an important part during the patient's stay. It is important to support
      visitors.

      The aim of this study is to describe the experiences of visitors whose family member or
      friend has been admitted to the major trauma intensive care unit at St George's. In
      particular, the aim is to describe the experiences of visitors who travel from far.

      First, ten visitors will be interviewed to find out more about their experiences. From these
      data, a survey questionnaire will then be developed and approximately 150 visitors who have
      been to St George's in recent months will be surveyed. This will give in-depth insights to
      understanding peoples' experiences of visiting at St George's, and what people thought was
      going well and things that could be better. The study will end with a service improvement
      workshop with representatives from the team at St George's and visitors. Study findings will
      be discussed and decisions on what should be improved will be made.

      This study is being funded by St George's Hospital Charity. The study runs from August 2017
      to October 2018.

    <description>This study uses mixed-methods in a two-staged approach, to provide both depth and breadth in capturing data on visitors' experiences.
In the first stage, a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews will capture in-depth data on visitors' experiences. Participants will be asked questions such as &quot;Can you talk a bit about visiting your relative/friend here at St George's&quot; and &quot;How has your daily life been since you started visiting here at St George's&quot;. These in-depth qualitative data will inform the content and structure for a bespoke visitor experience questionnaire, which will be newly developed as part of the study and copyrighted.
In the second stage, the newly developed, bespoke visitor experience questionnaire will be used to survey a larger number of visitors, gathering both quantitative and qualitative data to describe the experiences of visitors, areas of good practice and needs and opportunities for service improvement at the study site.</description>
