      bronchitis. The new drug, Ivacaftor (KALYDECO), is a drug that has recently been approved by
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with a lung disease called Cystic
      Fibrosis (CF). It has not been approved for use in patients with bronchiectasis or chronic
      bronchitis.
