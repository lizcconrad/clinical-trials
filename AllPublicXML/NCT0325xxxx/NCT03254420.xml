      The Calypso® System (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) is a recent technology
      using electromagnetic transponders implanted within the prostate. It is a real-time target
      tracking system that takes into account both inter- and intrafractional target motion. So the
      exact position and movement of the prostate can be determined during radiation therapy
      treatment.

      The aim of this study is to assess pelvic late toxicity rate after intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) when using the Calypso® System with a reduction of treatment margins. In
      this randomized study, patients will receive IGRT treatment using the Calypso system or a
      conventional IGRT treatment.

      Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in men. Radiotherapy is one of the reference
      treatments for localized prostate cancer. Prostate was initially thought to be a non-moving
      target, but the newest reports have raised the contrary as evidence. Image-guided
      radiotherapy (IGRT) is a current standard treatment for localized prostate cancer which
      enables to take into account interfractional prostate motion before treatment.

      The Calypso® System (Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) is a recent technology
      using electromagnetic transponders implanted within the prostate. It is a real-time target
      tracking system that takes into account both inter- and intrafractional target motion. So the
      exact position and movement of the prostate can be determined during radiation therapy
      treatment.

      As Planned Target Volume (PTV) margins integrate set-up margins and the management of organ
      motion, margin reduction can reasonably be considered in case of target motion management
      improvement.

      To date, no prospective randomized clinical data is available using this technique for the
      treatment of low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients with modern standard
      fractionation radiotherapy and image guidance.

      The aim of this study is to assess pelvic late toxicity rate after intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) when using the Calypso® System with a reduction of treatment margins. In
      this randomized study, patients will receive IGRT treatment using the Calypso system or a
      conventional IGRT treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Localized prostate cancer, histologically proven.

          -  No evidence of metastases (M0). No evidence of lymph nodes involvement (N0) (bilateral
             lymph node dissection is not mandatory if lymph node involvement risk is low according
             to the Partin tables).

          -  Low-risk or intermediate clinical stage according to the D'Amico classification (T1-T2
             and Gleason &lt; 8 and PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml) (appendix 3).

          -  No grade &gt; 2 urinary or rectal clinical sign or symptom according to the CTCAE V4.03
             scale.

          -  Performance status ECOG ≤ 1.

          -  No hip prosthesis or metallic vascular graft near the prostate.

          -  No endopenian stent.

          -  No pace maker, implanted defibrillator or neurostimulator.

          -  Dated and signed written informed consent available.

          -  Patients must be affiliated to a French Social Security System.
