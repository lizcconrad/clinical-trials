  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, cross over study will assess the effects of ingestion of high and low volumes
      of water on REE over 90 minutes. The high volume of water 500ml and the low volume of water
      250ml. Participants will be computer randomized to determine which volume of water to receive
      first. Participants will arrive at the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory between 7:00 and
      7:30am following a 9 hour overnight fast. Participants will be instructed not to consume any
      food or drink after 10pm the night before the assessment. Participants will also be asked to
      abstain from alcohol and caffeine for 3 days before the assessment. After verification of
      eligibility, baseline REE will be measured for 30 minutes followed by administration of first
      assigned dose of water. REE will be monitored for the next 90 minutes. Blood pressure and
      heart rate will also be monitored, simultaneously to REE. After a 7-10 day washout period,
      participants will return for their second test day where the second dose of water will be
      administered. A 7-10 day washout period was selected to allow participants time to resume
      normal diet and hydration between visits.

    <description>After an overnight fast participants' RMR will be measured by indirect calorimetry for 30 minutes after which either a low (250ml) or high (500ml) dose of water will be consumed followed by an additional 90 minutes of indirect calorimetry. The test day will be repeated after 7-10 days with the second dose of water. The order in which the dose of water will be consumed will be randomized</description>
