        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For total shoulder arthroplasty, subjects must meet a, b, or c below:

               1. Severely painful and/or disabled joint resulting from osteoarthritis, traumatic
                  arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis

               2. Fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus where the articular surface is
                  severely comminuted, separated from its blood supply or where the surgeon's
                  experience indicates that alternative methods of treatment are unsatisfactory

               3. Other difficult clinical problems where shoulder arthrodesis or resection
                  arthroplasty are not acceptable (e.g. -revision of a failed primary component)

          -  For shoulder hemiarthroplasty, subjects must meet any of the sub-criteria a - g below:

               1. Severely painful and/or disabled joint resulting from osteoarthritis, traumatic
                  arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis

               2. Fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus where the articular surface is
                  severely comminuted, separated from its blood supply or where the surgeon's
                  experience indicates that alternative methods of treatment are unsatisfactory

               3. Other difficult clinical problems where shoulder arthrodesis or resection
                  arthroplasty are not acceptable (e.g. -revision of a failed primary component)

               4. Ununited humeral head fractures

               5. Avascular necrosis of the humeral head

               6. Rotator cuff arthropathy

               7. Deformity and/or limited motion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absent, irreparable or nonfunctional rotator cuff or other essential muscles.

          -  Have an active local or systemic infection.

          -  Have inadequate bone stock in the proximal humerus or glenoid fossa for supporting the
             components.

          -  Have poor bone quality such as osteoporosis where there could be considerable
             migration of the prosthesis and/or a chance of fracture of the humerus or glenoid.

          -  Have a muscular, neurologic, or vascular deficiencies that compromise the affected
             extremity.

          -  Have a known sensitivity or allergic reaction to one or more of the implanted
             materials.

          -  Have a condition that may impair proper wound healing.
