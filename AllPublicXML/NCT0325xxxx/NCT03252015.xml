  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how much lasmiditan, study drug, gets into the blood
      stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it.

      When drugs are taken together, one or all of the drugs used in combination may be affected.
      This study will also evaluate how much lasmiditan and its breakdown products get into the
      bloodstream after taking one dose alone and after taking lasmiditan together with a probe
      drug cocktail. Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.

      The study has two parts. Participants will only enroll in one part. This study will last
      about 25 days for group 1 and 22 days for group 2, not including screening. Screening is
      required within 28 days prior to the start of the study.

      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
