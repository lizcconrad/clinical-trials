    <textblock>
      Background: The plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3-n-3) may
      reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including incident myocardial
      infarction, ischemic stroke and peripheral artery disease. However, the results of previous
      studies have been inconsistent.

      Objectives: To investigate the associations between dietary intake of ALA, adipose tissue
      content of ALA, and the risk of the major atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases incident
      myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and subtypes, and peripheral artery disease.

      Methods: This project will be based on data from the Danish cohort study Diet, Cancer and
      Health which consisted of 57,053 men and women at recruitment between 1993 and 1997. Dietary
      intake of ALA will be assessed using a validated semiquantitative food-frequency
      questionnaire and adipose tissue content will be determined with the use of gas
      chromatography analyses of adipose tissue biopsies collected at baseline. Also, detailed
      information on lifestyle factors, medical history and anthropometri was collected at
      baseline.

      Incident cases have been identified through national registries and the diagnoses have
      previously been validated.

      Analyses of dietary intake of ALA will be analysed using a traditional cohort design, whereas
      analyses on adipose tissue content of ALA will be analysed based on a case-cohort design.
      Hazard ratioes with 95% confidence intervals will be used to describe the associations
      between the exposure variables and the outcome variables of interest.

    <description>Exposure to dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) will be assessed using a detailed food frequency questionaire filled in by participants included in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort at baseline. Exposure to adipose tissue content of ALA will be determined by gas chromatography in all incident cases and in subcohort of 3500 participants randomly drawn from the total cohort.</description>

      Subcutaneous adipose tissue, serum, plasma, ''buffycoat'', erytrocytes and urine is stored in
      nitrogen vapour at the biobank of the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study. Also, whole blood

        The Diet, Cancer and Health cohort was established over a period of 3.5 years between 1993
        and 1997 by inviting 160,725 men and women to participate. All eligible participants were
        native Danish citizens without a previous diagnosis of cancer, aged 50-64 years, and living
        in the areas of Copenhagen and Aarhus. A total of 57053 accepted to participate in the
        Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study.

        A subcohort of 3500 participants were drawn randomly from the cohort at baseline.
