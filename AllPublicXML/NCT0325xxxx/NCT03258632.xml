      This project aims to help Veterans who are in the hospital and have untreated alcohol
      problems. First, the investigators will adapt a Decision Aid that explains alcohol-related
      treatment options and their risks and benefits. Then, the investigators will determine the
      effectiveness of an intervention called DO-MoST (for Drinking Options-Motivate, Shared
      Decisions, Telemonitor), whereby a Decision Coach helps Veterans make decisions about
      alcohol-related behaviors and treatments they prefer, and keeps in contact by phone to
      continue to help with drinking and treatment decisions. DO-MoST is designed to increase rates
      at which Veterans decide to reduce or quit drinking, and begin and remain in treatment, and
      to improve drinking- and medical-related outcomes over time. It may also decrease Veterans'
      use of expensive health services such as hospitalizations and emergency visits. Finally, the
      investigators will study how VA can use DO-MoST on an ongoing, more widespread basis. The
      project should increase patient-centered health care for Veterans with alcohol problems to
      benefit their recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In fiscal year 2014, over 57,000 Veterans with diagnosed alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
      received VHA inpatient medical-surgical services. This likely underrepresents the prevalence
      of AUDs among Veteran inpatients, because these conditions often go undiagnosed during
      hospital stays. The high prevalence of AUDs among VHA medical-surgical inpatients is of
      critical concern because AUDs and medical conditions exacerbate one another, and their
      co-occurrence increases the use of costly health services. Yet, there are no evidence-based
      strategies that improve outcomes in this patient population by means of increased utilization
      (initiation, engagement) of AUD treatment services. The investigators have identified
      Drinking Options: Motivate, Shared Decisions, Telemonitor (DO-MoST) as a potential solution
      to the critical need for evidence-based strategies.

      This project will evaluate DO-MoST as a new and innovative intervention to facilitate the
      transition from inpatient medical-surgical care to AUD treatment in primary and specialty
      care settings, thereby improving Veterans' AUD and medical outcomes. DO-MoST entails use of
      motivational interviewing and a decision aid during the inpatient stay to facilitate informed
      choices about post-discharge drinking options and resources for help to change drinking, if
      desired, followed by telephone calls with the patient to continue to motivate and support
      decisions. In addition to determining the effectiveness of DO-MoST, this project includes a
      process evaluation - that is, will gather information from providers and patients on
      DO-MoST's implementation at the two project sites - to inform VA's potential widespread
      implementation of DO-MoST with medical-surgical patients with AUDs.

      Using an effectiveness/implementation Hybrid Type 1 design, incorporating a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) and process evaluation to facilitate future implementation, this
      project has three Specific Aims.

      Aim 1: Adapt a decision aid being implemented with AUD patients in non-VA primary care
      settings to be appropriate for Veterans with AUDs in medical-surgical inpatient settings.
      With this prototype, the investigators will conduct alpha testing with patients and
      providers, and adapt and pilot the decision aid to finalize it for use in the RCT.

      Aim 2: Conduct DO-MoST at two VA facilities (Ann Arbor and Palo Alto) and evaluate its
      effectiveness.

      The primary hypotheses are: Patients in DO-MoST, compared to patients in usual care (UC),
      will be more likely to (1) utilize AUD help (initiate, engage), (2) have better AUD (fewer
      heavy drinking days) and medical (physical status) outcomes, and (3) have fewer and more
      delayed acute care episodes (Emergency Department visits, rehospitalizations). Patients will
      be assessed at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-discharge, for outcomes and non-VA
      health care; VA health care will be assessed with VA databases. GLMM analyses will be
      conducted to compare the UC and DO-MoST groups on course of outcomes.

      Aim 3: Conduct a qualitative process evaluation to inform the wider implementation of
      DO-MoST, using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance)
      framework. The purpose is to provide guidance for VA facilities' broader adoption of DO-MoST
      in the future, including its possible adaptation for diverse subpopulations of Veterans, such
      as patients with mental health diagnoses (e.g., PTSD).

      In summary, this project will develop a decision aid and comprehensively examine DO-MoST as a
      novel and groundbreaking approach to providing a bridge between inpatient medical-surgical
      treatment and AUD treatment. Decision Aids have been used successfully in a number of
      contexts, but never with medical-AUD inpatients. The investigator's operations partners from
      VHA Mental Health Services and Medical Service are committed to directly addressing the
      dangerous, costly pattern of Veterans obtaining inpatient medical-surgical services but not
      receiving the AUD treatment they need. The project is focused on priorities in the VA
      Blueprint for Excellence, of HSR&amp;D Service, and of the PIs' HSR&amp;D Centers of Innovation.

If the patient agrees to treatment, specialty addiction services are notified.</description>
