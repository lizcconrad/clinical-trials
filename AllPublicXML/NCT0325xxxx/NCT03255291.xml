  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiology seeks to improve public health by identifying risk factors for cancer and other
      diseases and conveying that information to relevant audiences (e.g., physicians, the public).
      The audience is presumed to understand and use that information to make appropriate decisions
      about lifestyle behaviors and medical treatments. Yet, even though a single risk factor can
      affect the risk of multiple health outcomes, this information is seldom communicated to
      people in a way that optimizes their understanding of the importance of engaging in a single
      healthy behavior. Providing individuals with the ability to understand how a single behavior
      (obtaining sufficient physical activity) could affect their risk of developing multiple
      diseases could foster a more coherent and meaningful picture of the behavior's importance in
      reducing health risks, increase motivation and intentions to engage in the behavior, and over
      time improve public health.

      The proposed study translates epidemiological data about five diseases that cause significant
      morbidity and mortality (i.e., colon cancer, breast cancer (women), heart disease, diabetes,
      and stroke) into a visual display that conveys individualized risk estimates in a
      comprehensible, meaningful, and useful way to diverse lay audiences.

    <description>Risk communication strategy = risk ladder, table, or alphanumeric text
Self-reported comprehension of risk information is measured by the sum of (3) 5-point multiple choice questions and (4) 3-point multiple choice questions (Likert scale).
All questions have an additional &quot;don't know&quot; option, which will be counted as incorrect. Comprehension will not be assessed for people who report a history of diabetes because they are not given risk information.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete all baseline activities in person with a research assistant. Participants will complete the Risk Display App and Initial Audio Recording. The Risk Display App walks the participant through background and health questions. They are then randomized on how they will receive personalized risk results for their current activity level and how it would change if they began exercising regularly.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants are randomized to two types of Mental Imagery Audio Recording and goal setting activity (exercise or sleep).
The recording walks the participant through a set of mental imagery instructions. They will be asked to practice the mental imagery twice a day over 3 weeks. The participant also writes down a exercise goal. After the mental imagery ends, the participant will take a second survey.
Text messages will then be sent to participant as a reminder to practice the imagery twice daily for 5 minutes each time (3 text messages per week for 3 weeks). Participants will receive a survey via text message at the end of each week for four weeks.
90 days after 1st session, the participants will receive another survey in mail to complete
1 year later, 20 participants may be contacted by phone for an additional survey</description>
