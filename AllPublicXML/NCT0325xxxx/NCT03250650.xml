      To evaluate the efficacy of combined transvaginal electrical stimulation (ES) and
      transcutaneous tibial nerve electrical stimulation (TTNS) in the treatment of female
      overactive bladder syndrome (OAB).

    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial, blind and randomized study with 86 women with OAB or Mixed Urinary
      Incontinence with prevalence in the OAB symptoms, who were randomly and allocated into 2
      equal groups. Group 1 underwent transcutaneous tibial nerve electrical stimulation (TTNS),for
      30 minutes using 10Hz for frequency and 200µs for pulse. Group 2 received a combined of
      Vaginal electrical stimulation (ES) using a transvaginal probe applied ,for 20 minutes using
      10Hz for frequency and 1ms for pulse and tibial nerve electrical stimulation, 30 minutes at
      the same parameters used in Group1. Both groups were treated once a week for 12 sessions. All
      patients were evaluated before and after treatment by a voiding diary, King´s Health
      questionnaire, avaliation of pelvic floor muscle function, overactive bladder questionnaire
      (OABV-8).The analyzed variables included day and night time frequency, urgency and urge
      incontinence.

      The sample calculation was based on the difference waited between 2 groups regarding the
      frequency improvment.

    <description>Intervention for Group 1: transcutaneous tibial nerve electric stimulation (TTNS), using a Device Dualpex 961(Quark medical), with 2 silicone electrode in the tibial nerve path, being one on the lower border of the medial malleolus and another one, 10cm above. Once a week for 12 weeks. The parameters used on device were, 200 microseconds for pulse time and 10Hz for Frequency, during 30 minutes.</description>

    <description>Intervention for Group 2: transvaginal electric stimulation plus transcutaneous tibial nerve electric stimulation (ES + TTNS), using a Device Dualpex 961(Quark medical), with transvaginal electrode, located inside the vagina. Once a week for 12 weeks. The parameters used on device were 1milisecond for pulse time and 10Hz for Frequency, during 20 minutes. After transvaginal stimulation, the tibial stimulation will be applied like described on Group 1.</description>
