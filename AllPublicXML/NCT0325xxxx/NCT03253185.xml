  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 1 study in participants with colorectal cancer (CRC)
      or gastric cancer to study the safety and tolerability of SC-007 and consists of Part A (dose
      regimen finding) in participants with CRC followed by Part A in participants with gastric
      cancer. Part B (dose expansion) will enroll participants into separate disease specific
      cohorts of CRC or gastric cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced metastatic or unresectable advanced
             colorectal cancer (CRC) or gastric cancer that is relapsed, refractory, or progressive
             after:

          -  CRC: at least 2 prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting, and as appropriate
             in patients whose tumors are microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), pembrolizumab as
             well.

          -  Gastric cancer (including gastric and EGJ cancers): at least 2 prior systemic regimens
             in adjuvant, advanced, or metastatic setting and, as appropriate, a human epidermal
             growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) targeted agent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any significant medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor,
             may place the participant at undue risk from the study.

          -  Has electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities that make QT interval corrected (QTc)
             evaluation difficult.

          -  Prior exposure to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine or indolinobenzodiazepine based drug.
