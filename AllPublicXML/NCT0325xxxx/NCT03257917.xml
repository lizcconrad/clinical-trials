  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to gain knowledge about out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses
      and lost opportunity costs among metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. To achieve this
      objective, MBC patients will be asked to participate in a short, 37-question survey asking
      questions about the financial burden, OOP expenses, and opportunity costs related to their
      cancer care
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treating physician, PI or study coordinator will inform eligible MBC patients about the
      study via a letter (Appendix B) during or prior to their regular clinic visits in a waiting
      area. Prior to the survey administration, study coordinator will obtain all necessary
      signatures on the ICF from interested study participants in the private clinic room or
      infusion area. The survey (Appendix A) will consist of 37 survey questions, which should take
      patients less than 30 minutes to complete during their regularly scheduled clinic visit.
      Study participants will have the option of taking incomplete surveys home, completing, and
      mailing it back to us using stamped, self-addressed envelopes provided during their clinic
      visit. All consented participants will also be given the option to complete the survey over
      the phone with a study coordinator. Participants will be requested to provide their
      preferable times and days for a phone call with a coordinator. The study coordinator will
      call the patient and administer the same survey that would be given during a clinic visit. If
      participants prefer completing the survey in the clinic a research coordinator will remain in
      the room and will verbally facilitate the completion of the survey. Participants will be
      compensated in the form of merchandise at the time they agree to participate (the photo of
      sample merchandise is attached). Surveys will be collected by the study coordinator and
      stored in secure, locked rooms at the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, where the study
      coordinators will double-key enter de-identified survey responses into an encrypted, password
      protected, electronic database.
