  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetesis is a cardiac diagnostics company which presents a novel magnetocardiogram (MCG)
      analysis system called CardioFlux. This investigation presents a new, noninvasive diagnostic
      option to use MCG for rapid diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Data from the Cardioflux
      system will be compared with stress testing methods as well as the results of cardiac
      catheterization to identify patients with myocardial ischemia.

      This is a prospective observational single-blinded convenience pilot study of 100 patients
      placed in the Clinical Decision Unit (CDU) for evaluation of chest pain at St. John Hospital
      and Medical Center (Detroit, MI).

      Patients enrolled in the study will also have a 30 and 180 day follow up for analysis of
      adverse cardiac events.

        Investigators are conducting a prospective observational double-blinded convenience pilot
        study of 100 patients over the age of 18 years that are to be placed in the CDU for
        evaluation of chest pain. Patients selected for this study will be screened using the
        stated eligibility criteria. Estimated time frame of patient enrollment is 3 - 6 months.

        Patients who are to be placed in the CDU for evaluation of chest pain of possible cardiac
        origin will be eligible for the MCG-CF scan based on above criteria.
