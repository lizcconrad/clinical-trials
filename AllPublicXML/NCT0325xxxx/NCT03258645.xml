    <textblock>
      This is an observational study in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF)
      presenting to the hospital with a first acute ischemic stroke based on existing data recorded
      in the SITS International Registry (located in Sweden) by physicians in several European
      countries, such as Italy, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Spain,
      Finland, Portugal, Slovakia, Denmark, Estonia, Norway Belgium, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia,
      Austria, Lithuania, France, Greece, Netherlands, Ireland, Ukraine and Iceland.

      The aim of this study is to explore the current real world use of dabigatran for stroke
      prevention in NVAF patients in the post-stroke setting. Secondary data from eligible European
      patients registered in the SITS registry will be considered; countries of origin are not
      known a priori.
