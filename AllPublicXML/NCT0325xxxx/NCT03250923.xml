  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CelAgace™ OraRinse (silver citrate complex and acemannan) Solution is being evaluated for
      safety and effectiveness as a potential treatment for candidiasis, a yeast infection,
      commonly known as thrush, which is associated with mouth sores. CelAgace™ contains two active
      ingredients, a silver citrate complex salt that has demonstrated laboratory effectiveness
      against yeast organisms and acemannan, a purified extract isolated from the inner leaf gel of
      the Aloe vera plant that has been used as a key ingredient in other oral care products.
      Patients will swish and spit the product 4 times daily (after meals and at bedtime) for 14
      days. Following an initial office visit, patients will be evaluated on days 7 and 14 to
      determine response to the product.
