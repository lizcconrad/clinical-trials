  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine is one of the most active agents in the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors.
      However, variability in toxicity and response remains a major problem for patients receiving
      capecitabine. It is general that there are many factors for individual differences of drugs
      in clinical application, of which genetic factors accounted for more than 20%. Toxicities of
      capecitabine, such as diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome or anemia, were evaluated for possible
      relationship with pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in several pharmacogenomics studies. Due to
      the levels of evidence of those studies are low and lack of sufficient research data of
      Chinese, it has the important significance in studying individual differences of capecitabine
      in toxicities, through the pharmacogenomics research.

      The aim of this study is to evaluating the association genetic polymorphisms with
      capecitabine-based chemotherapy toxicities in chinese solid tumor patients. By detecting the
      gene polymorphism, investigators intend to study the pharmacokinetic/pharmacogenomics (PK-PG)
      correlation of capecitabine and provide scientific basis for precise medication guide for
      people to use capecitabine.
