  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to understand more about what kinds of health problems are caused by
      Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD), what happens as a result of different treatments for ECD, and
      how ECD affects people's lives, their feelings and their attitudes. The investigators also
      want to learn how these things change over time for people with ECD. To try to figure this
      out, doctors would like to collect information about people who have ECD and how they are
      treated for this disease.

          -  Diagnosis of Erdheim-Chester Disease by either 1) documented histopathologic
             establishing ECD or 2) documented histopathologic findings compatible with
             Erdheim-Chester disease in the context of corroborating clinical and/or radiologic
             findings or 3) documented radiologic findings, in the absence of a biopsy having been
             performed or yielding evaluable tissue, that are felt by the Principal Investigator to
             unequivocally represent an ECD diagnosis given the clinical context or 4) self
             reported with supporting documentation upon medical record collection.

          -  Proficiency in English, in the determination of the Investigator or by self report.
