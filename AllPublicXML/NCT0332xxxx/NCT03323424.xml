      The proposed theory is based on combination of radiation therapy with usual targeted
      therapies capable of ADCC (Antibody-Dependant Cell Cytotoxicity). This association could
      enhance in a additive/synergistic way the benefic impact of immune system activation on tumor
      control. Stereotactic Body Radio-Therapy (SBRT) will be combined with the first line
      chemotherapy for metastatic breast, colorectal or VADS (upper aerodigestive tract) cancers.
      The IRAM study objective is to highlight a possible abscopal effect of this combination for
      metastatic cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, metastatic cancer treatment is evolving with systemic treatments (target therapies
      and immunotherapies). Combinations and new therapeutic schemes have recently boosted the
      interest for an effect called &quot;abscopal&quot;. This effect is based on the immune-stimulating
      effect of high doses ionizing radiations, but also on synergistic association with systemic
      treatment with immunologic mechanisms. This effect could enhance the tumor local control, but
      also its distant control.

      Numerous preclinical evidences as well as some clinical case reports described the abscopal
      effect.

      Ongoing clinical studies are investigating with radiotherapy abscopal effect alone, or
      associated with immunotherapies (anti-CTLA-4, PD-1 or PDL-1). The present study proposes a
      new association, based on an original biological rational. The proposed theory is based on
      combination of radiation therapy with usual targeted therapies capable of ADCC
      (Antibody-Dependant Cell Cytotoxicity). This association could enhance in an
      additive/synergistic way the benefic impact of immune system activation on tumor control.

      In the present study, Stereotactic Body Radio-Therapy (SBRT) will be combined to the standard
      systemic treatment for first line treatment of metastatic breast, colorectal and VADS (upper
      aerodigestive tract) cancers. Indeed, these treatments have in common the use of target
      therapies capable of ADCC.

      The IRAM study objective is to highlight a possible abscopal effect of this combination for
      metastatic cancer patients.
