  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is an emotional disorder. It's a painful concern caused by uncertainty. It is a
      complex phenomenon misunderstood in spite of medical progress. Relaxation is a technical for
      reduce anxiety and is effective and safe. Previous study demonstrated the impact of session
      relaxation on the autonomous nervous system by the heart rate variability.

      Primary objective of this new study is to demonstrate a link between heart rate variability
      and reduced anxiety during relaxation session.

      It is monocentric, prospective and interventional study. This study will be proposed at the
      patients who will have an orthopedic surgery in full hospitalization. These patients are
      anxious because of surgery too. The day before surgery anesthetist save heart rate
      variability and value of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide during relaxation session.
