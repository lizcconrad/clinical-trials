  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of its availability, non-invasiveness, and high diagnostic performance, myocardial
      perfusion tomoscintigraphy has become a standard tool for the detection, characterization and
      monitoring of coronary artery disease. Standard analysis, based on the reversibility of
      regional myocardial hypoperfusion between stress (physiological or pharmacological) and rest,
      has good sensitivity and negative predictive value in the search for myocardial ischemia.
      However, two major obstacles persist. First, because of the relative nature of the
      normalization of cardiac activity, this approach may underestimate the extent of the damage,
      especially when the territory with the most activity is itself pathological. Thus myocardial
      perfusion scintigraphy can only detect 40 to 50% of tri-truncal patients. To overcome these
      disadvantages, several indexes have been proposed to improve the diagnostic performance of
      perfusion scintigraphy in multi-truncal patients based in particular on kinetic analysis.
      Secondly, the review does not provide any guarantee as to the quality and reproducibility of
      use of the coronal reserve during stress, in particular during submaximal stress tests and
      pharmacological stress, the latter being easily antagonized by xanthine derivatives contained
      in tea and coffee in particular (abstinence of at least 12 to 24 hours being recommended). In
      recent years and thanks to the advent of CZT semiconductor cameras dedicated to cardiology -
      to perform a dynamic tomographic acquisition - a study of the coronal reserve is feasible by
      perfusion tomoscintigraphy in current practice. This study of the coronary reserve mainly
      consists of a computer post-processing of the myocardial perfusion scintigraphy data and does
      not therefore require any additional irradiation (the only difference with respect to the old
      protocols is the start of the images at the time of publication. injection of the
      radiotracer). However, the diagnostic benefit gained from the coronary reserve study compared
      to conventional stress / rest perfusion scintigraphy has not been clearly studied,
      particularly in the multi-truncal patients.
