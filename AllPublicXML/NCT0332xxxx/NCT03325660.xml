      Background: Urinary incontinence is common in men following prostate cancer surgery.
      Conservative treatment incorporates pelvic floor muscle exercises, biofeedback, electrical
      stimulation, lifestyle changes, or a blend of strategies. Little is thought about the
      physiologic impacts of entire body vibration practice on people body. The aim of the current
      study is to determine the effect of the whole body vibration and pelvic floor exercises on
      urinary incontinence following prostate cancer surgery. Methods: 61 patients were divided
      randomly into two groups. Group (1) included 30 patients participated in synchronous
      whole-body vibrations, 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks; the frequency and peak-to-peak
      displacement of vibration were 2 mm/20 Hz for the first week for 5 minutes, 3mm/25 Hz, 10
      minutes for the second week and 4 mm/30 Hz, 15 minutes for the last two weeks. Group (2)
      included 31 patients received only pelvic floor exercises. The intervention in both groups
      was for three times per week for four weeks. The outcome measures were urodynamic
      measurements for pressure at maximum flow rate and maximum flow rate. Also, patients were
      instructed to complete 2 questionnaires; incontinence visual analogue scale (I- VAS) and the
      international consultation of incontinence-short form. Results: When comparing between pre-
      treatment and post treatment for group 1 the results revealed that there were significant
      differences including all test parameters, while the results of group 2 showed non-
      significant differences including all test parameters except for the pressure at maximum flow
      rate which showed a significant difference from the baseline data (P&gt; 0.05. It was revealed
      that there were significant differences when comparing the results of all test parameters
      after the treatment protocol in favor of group 2 (P&gt; 0.05). Conclusion: It can be concluded
      that the whole body vibration is a simple training and has a good effect in treating the
      patients with urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

      The initial sample was adult patients suffering from urinary incontinence at least 6 months
      after radical prostatectomy. The exclusion criteria included patients with an artificial
      pacemaker, body mass index more than 35 kg/ m2, urinary infection, bleeding from the urinary
      bladder or the digestive tract, polyuria, diabetes mellitus, detrusor instability,
      neuromuscular disorders and any other medical condition that affects participation in the
      training program. After the approval of the Research Ethical Committee, of the Faculty of
      Physical Therapy, Cairo University according to Declaration of Helsinki principles, subjects
      were selected from Cairo University Hospitals. An informed consent form was signed by each
      subject before starting the study.

      70 patients were randomly divided between study and control groups and were assessed pre and
      post intervention. Two patients were excluded from the study because of urinary infection and
      one because he had already undergone surgical intervention for his urinary incontinence. 6
      patients were excluded due to an irregular attendance, inner ear problem and intolerance to
      whole body vibration. The study group included 30 patients participated in synchronous
      whole-body vibrations, 3 times weekly for 4 consecutive weeks; the frequency and peak-to-peak
      displacement of vibration were 2 mm/20 Hz for the first week for 5 minutes, 3mm/25 Hz, 10
      minutes for the second week and 4 mm/30 Hz, 15 minutes for the last two weeks. Every patient
      was made a request to remain on the stage, stacking their feet consistently, with the knee
      and hip joints bent at 35Â° and the upper limbs stretched horizontally forwards, clutching a
      railing. The hip and knee flexion range of motion was measured by a goniometer to guarantee
      that each subject kept up the required position. The previously mentioned position is very
      sheltered as knee flexion decreases the measure of vibration which reaches the head [32]. The
      control group included 31 patients received only pelvic floor exercises. Pelvic floor
      exercises: The patients were instructed to empty their bladders before the treatment sessions
      in an effort to feel comfortable and relaxed during the treatment session. Each patient was
      prepared and taught a program of pelvic floor exercises to be performed in daily sessions in
      lying, sitting, and standing positions consisting of 10 seconds of contractions followed by
      10 seconds of relaxation and repeating the exercises 15 times each session. The contraction
      and relaxation times were continuously expanded by 1 second every week as a training for the
      slow twitch muscle fibers. While, fast twitch muscle fibers can be trained through asking the
      patient to contract as if he controls his urine by quick contraction and relaxation of the
      levator ani muscles 20 times, rest for ten seconds, and then repeat again for a total of 2 to
      4 sets of contractions.
