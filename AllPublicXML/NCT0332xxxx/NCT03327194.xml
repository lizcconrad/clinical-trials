  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A hearing loss affects the quality of life and the natural development of children.

      The new generation of hearing devices provides a huge number of options to them. These new
      hearing aids are often aesthetically acceptable, less invasive and user-friendly.

      The ADHEAR Non-Implantable Bone Conduction Hearing System is connected directly to the skin
      with a special adhesive adapter. The device transmits the sound to the mastoid by vibrating
      on the skull and stimulates the inner ear without any previous surgery.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate of the audiological benefit and subjective
      satisfaction of ADHEAR Audio Processor with Adhesive attachment in a group of children
      suffering from conductive hearing loss and/or single sided deafness.

    <description>ADHEAR Audio Processoris a non-invasive bone conduction hearing device which is retained on the patient's head with an adhesive adapter that is placed behind the auricle.
The ADHEAR Audio Processor transmits sounds to the mastoid by vibrating on the skull and stimulates the inner ear without any previous surgery.
ADHEAR Audio Processor is classified as a Class lla medical device and ADHEAR Adhesive Adapter is classified as a Class I medical device.
The ADHEAR Audio Processor has the CE mark.</description>
