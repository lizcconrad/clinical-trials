      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an hypnosis session, performed on the
      eve of a laparoscopic gynecological surgery, on the level of immediate preoperative anxiety
      measured by State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI-Y) self-administered questionnaire compared to
      premedication by alprazolam®.
