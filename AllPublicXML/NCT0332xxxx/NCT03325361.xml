  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomotic leakage (AL) is considered the commonest major complication after surgery for
      rectal cancer. Transanal tube drainage role in the prevention of AL is still debatable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who underwent low or ultralow anterior resection for rectal cancer were enrolled
      between 01/2015 and 06/2017. A de-Pezzer catheter was placed transanally after the creation
      of the anastomosis, secured to the buttocks, and connected to a urine bag to allow monitoring
      the amount and the color of the drainage. The catheter was removed on the 3rd day
      postoperative if the volume collected was insignificant.

      Patients were followed-up on the ward and then in the outpatient's department at two weeks,
      and one month postoperative. Patients who were suspected to have AL underwent CT with rectal
      contrast to assess the integrity of the anastomosis. The primary outcome was the incidence of
      AL. We adopted the definition published by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer.
