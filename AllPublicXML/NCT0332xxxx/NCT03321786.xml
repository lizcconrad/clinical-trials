  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether survivors of Legionnaires' disease suffer
      smell loss. A quantitative olfactory test will be performed by the participants. Such testing
      will require approximately 20-30 minutes of the participant's time. The participants will
      take the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), a scratch-and-sniff
      test to assess their ability to identify odors in a forced- choice format. Volunteers will
      also complete a questionnaire asking personal history, demographic questions, and medical
      history.

    <description>The number of correct odor identification responses out of 40 from the standardized University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test.
The total number of correct responses will then be compared to standard norms of correct responses based on demographic information such as age and sex. Comparing the scores to the standard norms collected will indicate whether a volunteer is normosmic, hyposmic, or anosmic.</description>

    <intervention_name>The University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT)</intervention_name>
    <description>This standardized test, the most widely used olfactory test in the world, is derived from basic psychological test measurement theory and focuses on the comparative ability of subjects to identify odorants at the suprathreshold level. The UPSIT consists of four envelope-sized booklets, each containing ten &quot;scratch and sniff&quot; odorants embedded in 10- 50-Âµm polymer microcapsules positioned on brown strips at the bottom of the pages of the booklets.</description>

        group of who have survived Legionnaires' disease. The second group will be healthy men and
        women over the age of 18 years.
