  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients in the emergency department commonly require arterial line placement
      for continuous direct blood pressure monitoring, frequent arterial blood gas sampling, and
      frequent blood sampling. Trans-radial catheterization has been shown to reduce access site
      complications and increase patient comfort compared to trans-femoral access. Radial artery
      access on the first attempt is optimal; attempts at reentry delay care and increase the risk
      of vascular spasm, hematoma, infection, neurovascular injury, and pain. The traditional pulse
      palpation method of radial artery cannulation can be challenging, especially in patients with
      weak pulses (i.e. morbidly obese or hypotensive individuals).

      A review of literature suggests that ultrasound guided trans-radial catheterization compared
      to standard pulse palpation reduces access time and increases rate of first-entry success
      when performed by physicians trained in ultrasound. Thus, complications ascribed to reentry
      are prevented and timely care is provided.

      To the investigator's knowledge, only one other prospective study has been conducted to
      assess the utility of ultrasound guided radial artery cannulation in the emergency
      department. Due to the paucity of literature to support the use of ultrasound guided
      trans-radial catheterization in critically ill patients, the study will aim to provide
      further data on the topic. Both techniques are considered standard of care.

      Patients presenting to the Emergency Department 18 years old or greater, who do not belong to
      a vulnerable group, requiring arterial line placement will be included in this trial. The
      investigators will randomize each patient into LM vs US. Data collected will include number
      of attempts, success rate, and time for procedure to be completed. PGY-1 residents will
      perform the arterial line placement.
