  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching objective of the Stroke Minimization through Additive Anti-atherosclerotic
      Agents in Routine Treatment (SMAART) trial is to assess whether a polypill containing fixed
      doses of (2/3) antihypertensives, a statin and antiplatelet therapy taken once daily orally
      would result in carotid intimal thickness regression-a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis,
      improved adherence, and tolerability compared with 'usual care' group on separate individual
      secondary preventive medications among Ghanaian first time stroke survivors. Our ultimate
      objective is to design of a future multi center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, randomized trial comparing the clinical efficacy of the polypill strategy vs
      'usual care' in the African context to derive locally relevant, high-quality evidence for
      routine deployment of polypill for CVD risk moderation among stroke survivors in LMICs. In
      this current study, we plan to recruit 120 recent ischemic stroke survivors randomized 1:1 to
      the polypill or usual care arms.

    <intervention_model_description>SMAART incorporates (i) a pilot randomized controlled trial and (ii) a human capital/institutional capacity building component. We propose a randomized, open label, blinded endpoint clinical trial with the intervention arm assigned to a polypill containing 2/3 antihypertensives, a moderate/high-intensity statin and Aspirin to be taken orally, once daily in the form of a hard capsule compared with the 'usual care' arm who will continue to take separate, individual secondary preventive medications as prescribed their physicians to assess CIMT changes as a robust intermediary outcome measure for CVD events, as well as adherence, tolerability, and risk factor control rates. Furthermore, a cadre of emerging investigators from Ghana will benefit from the rich learning environment to be created through the implementation of the RCT and the interactions (2 years) with experts from the Medical University of South Carolina.</intervention_model_description>
