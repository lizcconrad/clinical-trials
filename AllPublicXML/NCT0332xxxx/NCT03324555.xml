    <textblock>
      ORIC-GR-17001 is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, single ascending dose study in
      healthy male subjects and healthy female subjects of non-child bearing potential. In this
      study, ORIC-101 will be administered as single-ascending oral doses. The primary objective is
      to characterize the safety and tolerability of oral ORIC-101.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, non-randomized, single ascending dose study in healthy
      male subjects and healthy female subjects of non-child bearing potential.

      Subjects will receive a single administration of ORIC-101 oral suspension on a single
      occasion and will be followed in the clinic for at least 96 hours post-dose. Total subject
      participation will be approximately 5 weeks from screening until discharge from the study.

      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and tolerability of oral
      ORIC-101 administered as a single dose in adult healthy subjects. The secondary objective of
      the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ORIC-101 and its metabolites M1 and M2. The
      exploratory objective of the study is to assess the pharmacodynamics of ORIC-101 by
      measurement of serum and urine levels of cortisol and other biological markers in healthy
      subjects

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy males or healthy females of non-child bearing potential

          3. Weighs more than 50 kilograms (kg), and less than 120 kg, with a body mass index of
             18.0 to 32.0 kg/meters squared

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have received any investigational medicinal product (IMP) in a clinical
             research study within 5 half-lives or within 45 days prior to first dose. However, in
             no event, shall the time between last receipt of IMP and first dose be less than 30
             days

             test). A woman is considered of childbearing potential unless she is permanently
             sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, tubal ligation or bilateral
             oophorectomy) or is postmenopausal (had no menses for 12 months without an alternative
             medical cause and a serum follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] concentration â‰¥40
             international units per litre (IU/L))

          5. Women with a history of unexplained vaginal bleeding or endometrial hyperplasia with
             atypia or endometrial carcinoma
