    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is intended to assess the clinical lot-to-lot consistency in manufacturing
      by evaluating and comparing the immunogenicity of three consecutively manufactured lots of
      the Quadrivalent Virus-Like Particles (VLP) Influenza Vaccine, during the 2016-2017 influenza
      season, in healthy adults 18-49 years of age. A single dose of one of three consecutive lots
      of Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine (30 µg/strain) will be administered to 1,200 subjects.

    <textblock>
      This randomized, observer-blind, multicenter, Phase 3 lot consistency study will be conducted
      at multiple sites in Canada. The composition of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine used
      in this study includes two influenza A virus strains and two influenza B virus strains based
      on the 2016-2017 recommended strains for vaccination in the Northern hemisphere.

      1,200 healthy male and female subjects aged 18 to 49 years will be randomized in a 1:1:1
      ratio to one of three lots of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza Vaccine (30 μg/strain). Subjects
      will participate in this study for approximately 21 days, during which a first visit will be
      scheduled on Day 0 for screening, eligibility assessment, and vaccine administration; and on
      Day 21 for blood sample collection for immunogenicity assessment.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation
        in this study; no protocol waivers are allowed:

          1. Subjects must be able to read, understand, and sign the informed consent form (ICF);
             complete study-related procedures; and communicate with the study staff at visits and
             by phone;

          2. Subjects must be considered by the Investigator to be reliable and likely to cooperate
             with the assessment procedures and be available for the duration of the study;

          3. Male and female subjects must be 18 to 49 years of age, inclusive, at the
             Screening/Vaccination visit (Visit 1);

          4. Subjects have a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 40.0 kg/m2 on Day 0 pre-vaccination;

          5. Subjects must be in good general health prior to study participation with no
             clinically relevant abnormalities that could jeopardize subject safety or interfere
             with study assessments as assessed by the Principal Investigator or sub-Investigator
             (thereafter referred as Investigator) and determined by medical history, physical
             examination, and vital signs; Note: Subjects with a pre-existing chronic disease will
             be allowed to participate if the disease is stable and, according to the
             Investigator's judgment, the condition is unlikely to confound the results of the
             study or pose additional risk to the subject by participating in the study. Stable
             disease is generally defined as no new onset or exacerbation of pre-existing chronic
             disease six months prior to vaccination. Based on the Investigator's judgment, a
             subject with a more recent stabilization of a disease could also be eligible.

          6. Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test result at the
             Screening/Vaccination visit (Visit 1);

          7. Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an effective method of
             contraception for one month prior to vaccination and agree to continue employing
             adequate birth control measures for the duration of the study. Abstinent subjects
             should be asked what method(s) they would use, should their circumstances change, and
             subjects without a well-defined plan should be excluded. The following relationship or
             methods of contraception are considered to be effective:

               -  Hormonal contraceptives (e.g. oral, injectable, topical [patch], or estrogenic
                  vaginal ring);

               -  Intra-uterine device with or without hormonal release;

               -  Male partner using a condom plus spermicide or a sterilized partner (at least one
                  year prior to vaccination);

               -  Credible self-reported history of heterosexual vaginal intercourse abstinence
                  until at least the Day 21 visit;

               -  Female partner.

          8. Non-childbearing females are defined as:

               -  Surgically-sterile (defined as bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or
                  bilateral oophorectomy performed more than one month prior to vaccination); or

               -  Post-menopausal (absence of menses for 24 consecutive months and age consistent
                  with natural cessation of ovulation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in this
        study; no protocol waivers are allowed:

          1. According to the Investigator's opinion, history of significant acute or chronic,
             uncontrolled medical or neuropsychiatric illness. 'Uncontrolled' is defined as:

               -  Requiring a new medical or surgical treatment during the six months prior to
                  study vaccine administration unless the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion
                  no. 5 can be met (i.e. the Investigator can justify inclusion based upon the
                  innocuous nature of medical/surgical events and/or treatments);

               -  Requiring any significant change in a chronic medication (i.e. drug, dose,
                  frequency) during the three months prior to study vaccine administration due to
                  uncontrolled symptoms or drug toxicity, unless the innocuous nature of the
                  medication change meets the criteria outlined in inclusion criterion no. 5 and is
                  appropriately justified by the Investigator.

          2. Any medical or neuropsychiatric condition or any history of excessive alcohol use or
             drug abuse which, in the Investigator's opinion, would render the subject unable to
             provide informed consent or unable to provide valid safety observations and reporting;

          3. Any autoimmune disease other than hypothyroidism with stable replacement therapy; or
             any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition or immunodeficiency including
             known or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or C infection, or
             the presence of lymphoproliferative disease;

          4. Administration or planned administration of any non-influenza vaccine within 30 days
             prior to randomization and up to blood sampling on Day 21. Immunization on an

          5. Administration of any adjuvanted or investigational influenza vaccine within 24 months
             prior to randomization or planned administration prior to the completion of Day 21;

          6. Administration of any &quot;standard&quot;, non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (e.g. live
             attenuated trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine intranasal or split
             trivalent/quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine by either intradermal or
             intramuscular (IM) route) within 24 months prior to randomization and up to completion
             of the Day 21 visit;

          7. Use of any investigational or non-registered product within 30 days prior to
             randomization or planned use during the study period. Subjects may not participate in
             any other investigational or marketed drug study while participating in this study
             until the Day 21 visit. Participation in observational studies is permitted;

          8. Treatment with systemic glucocorticoids at a dose exceeding 10 mg of prednisone (or
             the equivalent) per day for more than seven consecutive days or for ten or more days
             in total, within one month of study vaccine administration; or any other cytotoxic or
             immunosuppressant drug, or any immunoglobulin preparation within three months of
             vaccination and until the completion of the Day 21 visit. Low doses of nasal or
             inhaled glucocorticoids and topical steroids are permitted;

          9. Any significant disorder of coagulation including, but not limited to, treatment with
             warfarin derivatives or heparin. Persons receiving prophylactic anti-platelet
             medications (e.g. low-dose aspirin [no more than 325 mg/day]) and without a clinically
             apparent bleeding tendency are eligible. Subjects treated with new generation drugs
             that do not increase the risk of IM bleeding (e.g. clopidogrel) are also eligible.

         10. History of allergy to any of the constituents of the Quadrivalent VLP Influenza
             Vaccine or a tobacco allergy;

         11. History of anaphylactic allergic reactions to plants or plants components;

         12. Any history of serious asthma (e.g. status asthmaticus, hospitalization for asthma
             control) in the last three years;

         13. Use of antihistamines 48 hours prior to study vaccination;

         14. The use of prophylactic medications (e.g. acetaminophen/paracetamol, aspirin,
             naproxen, or ibuprofen) within 24 hours of randomization to prevent or pre-empt
             symptoms due to vaccination. Subjects discovered to have taken a prophylactic
             medication to prevent or pre empt symptoms due to vaccination within the 24 hours
             prior to planned randomization must be delayed until at least the 24-hour period is
             met;

         15. Subjects who have a dermatological condition at the injection site that may interfere
             with injection site reaction rating;

         16. Subjects who have received a blood transfusion within 90 days prior to study
             vaccination;
