    <textblock>
      The trial evaluates the clinical efficacy and safety of decalcification bone scaffold for
      cartilage lesions of the knee. Half of participants will receive decalcification bone
      scaffold combined with microfracture, while the other will only receive microfracture as a
      control group.

    <textblock>
      Decalcification bone scaffold is a tissue engineering scaffold with the closest biomechanics
      and structure of normal cartilage. The objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy of arthroscopic decalcification bone scaffold combined with microfracture in the
      repairment of articular cartilage defects by randomized controlled trial. Sixty patients with
      clinically diagnosed knee cartilage injury according to 1: 1 were divided into experimental
      group and control group. The experimental group will be treated with decalcification bone
      scaffold combined with microfracture .The control group will be treated with microfracture .
      The patients will be treated by the same surgeon in this study group. MRI evaluation, Lysholm
      score, IKDC score, Tegner score, VAS score are selected as the measures of outcome, while the
      blood routine, blood biochemistry, urine, CRP, ECG and other laboratory tests will be
      recorded inclduing the incidence of adverse events.

    <description>The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. From 0 to 10, no pain 0, worst pain imaginable 10. The higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
