  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cefixime is an orally active third generation cephalosporin indicated for the treatment of
      acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute otitis media, uncomplicated acute cystitis
      and uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Cefixime acts by inhibiting the action of proteins involved
      in the synthesis of bacterial cell walls, which leads to bacterial cell lysis and cell death.
      Due to lack of bioequivalence between tablet/capsule and suspension formulation of cefixime,
      consideration needs to be given if the oral suspension is to be substituted for the
      tablet/capsule. This study is designed to assess whether test SKF101804 cefixime 400
      milligrams (mg) capsule is bioequivalent to reference cefixime 400 mg capsule under fasting
      conditions in healthy adults. Subjects will be randomized in crossover manner to receive
      single oral doses of treatment A (SKF101804 cefixime test capsules) and treatment B
      (reference cefixime capsules), followed by a washout period of 7-14 days. Approximately 26
      subjects will be included in the study and total duration in the study for each subject will
      be approximately 5 to 7 weeks.
