    <measure>Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Visit 6 (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>PSQ is a 7-item questionnaire typically used to assess sleep quality with pharmacologic treatment. The questionnaire collects data on average time to sleep, sleep latency, frequency of interrupted sleep, duration of interrupted sleep, total sleep time and sleep quality over the last week.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Visit 6 (Week 4)</time_frame>
    <description>CSHQ is a tool designed to screen for the most common sleep problems in children and consists of 33 items for scoring and several extra items intended to provide administrators with other potentially useful information about respondents. The instrument evaluates the child's sleep based on behavior within 8 different subscales: bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, night wakings, parasomnias, sleep disordered breathing, and daytime sleepiness.</description>
