  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent improvements in cystic fibrosis management have enabled an important subset of
      patients to maintain normal spirometry. Nevertheless, even in these patients with normal
      spirometry, chest computed tomography (CT) might identify structural lung abnormalities such
      as bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, bronchiolitis and air trapping.

      Lung clearance index (LCI) has been shown to correlate well with structural pulmonary
      alterations seen on CT even in CF patients with well-preserved spirometry. In cystic
      fibrosis, a high LCI is associated with a worse feeling of illness assessed by the Cystic
      Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). School-aged CF patients with normal spirometry also
      have normal aerobic function as assessed by peak oxygen uptake (V̇O2) measured during
      symptom-limited incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test. However, the ability of LCI to
      predict ventilatory abnormalities appearing at exercise in CF patients has not been
      investigated. The investigators therefore aimed to compare physiological parameters at
      exercise between CF patients with elevated LCI (i.e., LCI above the upper limit of normal
      [ULN]) and patients with normal LCI, all with preserved spirometry.
