  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical plethysmography index (SPI) is a device that can noninvasively monitor the balance
      between the nociception and ant-nociception using pulse photoplethysmographic amplitude
      (PPGA) and heart rate obtained through an oxygen saturation measuring device. SPI has
      recently been studied as a useful tool to monitor the stress response of patients due to
      surgery or anesthesia and to guide the appropriate use of analgesics/anesthetics. However,
      these SPI devices have been developed for adults and have not been studied in pediatric
      patients with relatively high heart rates, and no direct effects on post-operative arousal
      excitability have been reported.

    <measure>Relationship between the SPI during emergence time and the peak emergence delirium score</measure>
    <time_frame>Observation from approximately 1 hour after the end of operation</time_frame>
    <description>The SPI is attained from waveform finger plethysmography. It is expressed as a numerical index between 0 (total absence of discomfort) and 100 (high stress level) with an increase after noxious stimulation. We will investigate the relationship between the SPI during emergence period and the pediatric assessment of emergence delirium (PAED) score.</description>

    <measure>The sensitivity and specificity of the SPI in detecting the emergence delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>Observation from approximately 1 hour after the end of operation</time_frame>
    <description>Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and the associated areas under the curves (AUC) were computed to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of the SPI in detecting a pediatric emergence at different PAED scores.</description>

    <description>After anesthesia induction, all participants received standard anesthesia monitoring, SPI monitor (GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland) and bispectral index (BIS). BIS was kept between 40-60, whereas no specific target was determined for SPI. At the end of surgery, anesthesia was terminated and the patients were stimulated to wake up. After the participants were able to breathe spontaneously and obey verbal commands, extubation was carefully performed, and the monitoring of SPI was stopped.</description>
