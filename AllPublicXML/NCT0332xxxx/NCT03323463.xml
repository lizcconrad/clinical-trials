  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that participants with HPV positive and hypoxia
      negative T1-@N / 1-2b oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma receiving a major de-escalated
      radiation therapy with 2 cycles of standard chemotherapy is not inferior to comparable
      subjects treated with the current standard chemoradiation.

    <description>Cycle 1 (week 1): At the start of week 1 of IMRT, subjects will receive cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously. They may be given for 2 consecutive days (50 mg/m2 each day for a total dose 100 mg/m2), typically on days 1 and 2, or as a single dose, typically on day 1.</description>

    <description>If cisplatin cannot be given at 100 mg/m2 for either cycle 1 or cycle 2, the investigator may use a regimen with carboplatin and 5-Fluorouracil in its place. Carboplatin will be given at a dose of AUC 1.25 intravenously daily x 4 days starting on day 1 of the cycle (total dose of AUC 5). Cycle 2 (Week 4): After the three weeks of radiation at week 4 when the subject no longer is receiving radiation therapy, subjects will receive cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously. The may be given for 2 consecutive days (50 mg/m2 each day for a total dose 100 mg/m2), typically on days 22 and 23, or as a single dose, typically on day 22.</description>
