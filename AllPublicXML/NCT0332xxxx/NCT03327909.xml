  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with kidney failure requiring hemodialysis treatment, sometimes the blood
      pressure will drop too low during dialysis. In an effort to prevent that from occurring,
      patients are frequently told to skip doses of their blood pressure medications. However,
      whether this actually prevents blood pressure drops during dialysis, and whether it may cause
      more uncontrolled high blood pressure is unknown. TAKE-HOLD will study the effect of taking
      or holding blood pressure medication on blood pressure for patients on hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and
      upwards of 90% of patients with end- stage renal disease (ESRD) have high BP. Appropriate BP
      management, therefore, is a fundamental part of patient care in ESRD, yet the question of
      when best to take antihypertensive medications relative to the hemodialysis treatment session
      remains unanswered. Many patients on hemodialysis suffer from an abrupt fall in BP during the
      dialysis session (i.e., intradialytic hypotension [IDH]), a phenomenon that is associated
      with numerous adverse outcomes. In an attempt to minimize IDH, patients are often told to
      withhold antihypertensive medications prior to hemodialysis, and current guidelines suggest
      taking antihypertensive medications at night to minimize IDH. However, there are no data
      regarding the safety of these antihypertensive medication timing strategies, or whether these
      strategies are effective in reducing IDH.
