  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single arm, first-in human feasibility study using the Symphony - MRI guided focused
      ultrasound system for the treatment of leiomyomas. The study is expected to accrue over 12
      months. This study will help determine the feasibility to ablate leiomyomas, as measured by
      MR thermometry and contrast enhanced imaging. In addition, the study will look at the
      efficacy and safety of the treatment, as measured by the reduction in fibroid size and
      reduction in symptom severity score and adverse events. This study will help develop future
      pivotal trials using the same device.
