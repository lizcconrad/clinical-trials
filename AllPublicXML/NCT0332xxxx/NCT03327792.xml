  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this alcohol-interaction pilot study is to provide information on the effect
      of mavoglurant on the pharmacokinetics of alcohol and on alcohol responses, including
      stimulation, sedation, intoxication, body sway and physiological responses. The investigators
      propose to test the effects of 200 mg mavoglurant versus placebo on alcohol related
      responses. This is a between subjects double blind randomized design in which the
      investigators plan to run 14 subjects to obtain 10 completers.

      The purpose of this alcohol-interaction pilot study is to provide information on the effect
      of mavoglurant on the pharmacokinetics of alcohol and on alcohol responses, including
      stimulation, sedation, intoxication, body sway and physiological responses. The investigators
      propose to test the effects of 200 mg mavoglurant versus placebo on alcohol related
      responses. This is a between subjects double blind randomized design in which the
      investigators plan to run 14 subjects to obtain 10 completers.

      Subjects will participate in two lab sessions, one prior to taking medication and one
      following 8-11 days of mavoglurant/placebo. During each session, participants will receive
      successive doses of alcohol over a 90 min period designed to raise their blood alcohol levels
      to 80 mg/dl; this dose was chosen because this is close to the legal limit of intoxication
      and to the peak BAC the investigators have observed in prior research studies. Subjects will
      be monitored throughout the lab session and will receive a phone call two days following the
      2nd lab session and a follow-up appointment one week after the 2nd lab session to assess any
      remaining side effects from the medication.
