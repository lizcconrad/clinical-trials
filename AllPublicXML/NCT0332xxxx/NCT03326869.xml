    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the Raindrop® Near Vision Inlay for the
      improvement of near vision in presbyopes implanted in corneal pockets with a delayed or a
      non-delayed approach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must be presbyopic with a reading add from +1.5 to +2.5 D, and both emmetropes (MRSE
      from -0.5 to +0.5 D) as well as ametropes (requiring concurrent LASIK) are included in the
      investigation. In the non-delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and inlay implanted
      on the same surgical day. In the delayed approach, the corneal pocket is created and
      dissected but the corneal inlay is not implanted. After one to three months, the corneal
      inlay is implanted on a second surgical day.

    <description>The Raindrop Near Vision Inlay was approved by the US FDA in June of 2016 for the improvement of near vision in presbyopic emmetropes. Raindrop is a clear device made of a hydrogel material and resembles a microscopic contact lens; it is the first implantable device that changes the shape of the cornea to correct the refractive errors that cause near vision problems.</description>
