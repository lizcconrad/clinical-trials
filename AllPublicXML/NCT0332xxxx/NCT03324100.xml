  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasal mucus and nasal epithelium are the first defense barriers against allergens. Various
      proteins are found in nasal mucus that play a role in allergic rhinitis and reflect immune
      response to allergen exposure. The difference in the proteomic profile of allergic rhinitis
      patients and healthy controls can give insight about how the response works and which
      proteins could lead to either enhanced immune reaction or to defense response like
      augmentation of epithelial integrity. It is also known that the airway epithelium plays a
      crucial role in the regulation of airway immune responses and inflammation. Gene expression
      profiling is widely used to analyses complex disease. For the airway epithelium gene
      expression profile in diseased and healthy state as well as in baseline and provoked state
      can clarify the mechanism of defense reactions and the course of inflammatory processes.
      Nasal mucus proteins as consequence of different gene expression can be seen as part of the
      end products of this complex mechanisms and interactions between allergens and the
      epithelium.

      Nasal mucus proteins have different origins and production sites and gene expression does not
      necessarily result in functional metabolites. The aim of this proposed project is to try and
      analyze in a holistic proteomic approach the response to allergen on a genetic/genomic level
      from the nasal epithelium to protein/proteomic level in nasal mucus. This analysis gives us
      insight of how the different gene expression profiles result in a protein expression and
      further clarifies which proteins are directly originate from the epithelium and which are
      result of plasma exudation or underlie different regulatory processes.

      From allergic rhinitis patients and healthy controls nasal mucus, nasal mucosa, and serum
      will be obtained. Nasal mucus will be collected with a special suction device equipped with a
      mucus trap from the middle meatus under endoscopic control without touching the mucosa. Nasal
      mucosa will be obtained through nasal brushes under local anesthesia and put into primary
      culture. Serum prepared from blood samples. Patients with grass or tree pollen allergy will
      be included and allergic state will be determined by skin prick tests and RAST
      (Radio-Allergo-Sorbent-test). The aimed for sample size will be 15 patients per group.
      Samples will be obtained in and out of pollen season. Allergic patients will fill out a
      symptom score and samples will be taken when symptoms are strong (in pollen season) and
      disappeared (out of pollen season). For healthy controls the time point of sample taking will
      be correlated to the allergic rhinitis patients to have a similar pollen exposure. Nasal
      mucus will be sent for Liquid Chromatography Tandem mass spectrometry for proteomic analysis
      and from nasal epithelial cells RNA will be isolated and send for Microarray analysis. By an
      integrative omics approach gene and protein expression will be correlated and cross talk
      between nasal mucus and epithelium will be analysed. The identification of key genes or gene
      clusters leads to further identification of key proteins or protein groups as biomarkers that
      could serve for novel therapeutic or diagnostic strategies in allergic rhinitis. The
      integrative omic approach downsizes the potential candidates since the focus lies on
      epithelial gene expression and their protein products and excludes proteins that are highly
      abundant without direct correlation to allergen exposure e.g. through plasma exudation.
      Moreover, the genomic and proteomic analysis could explain in more detail how the barrier of
      mucus and epithelium are affected by allergen exposure. The comparison to healthy controls
      and the longitudinal changes throughout the season further sheds light on how these
      individuals react upon allergen exposure and how this could lead to prevention of
      sensitization.
