  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is triggered by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque that
      results in a platelet aggregation reaction in the coronary artery. The administration of
      antiplatelet agents starting from the acute phase of the disease has helped reduce the risk
      of ischemic relapse both during initial and long-term hospitalization.

      Management of clopidogrel following an ischemic event has been the subject of several
      treatment regimens ranging from a single continuous dose to a sequential double dose of
      between 7 and 30 days. The CURRENT-OASIS 7 therapeutic trial showed a benefit of clopidogrel
      double dose in reducing the risk of myocardial intervention (MI) and the composite outcome:
      cardiovascular mortality, MI, or stroke (CVA/TIA) at 30 days. However, the study protocol was
      interested in all ACSs, regardless of the Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) status in selected
      patients. Also, doubling of clopidogrel dose was maintained over 7 days after angioplasty.
      The literature describes an increased cardiovascular risk in type II diabetics in secondary
      prevention. No previous study has evaluated the effect of clopidogrel double dose given for 1
      month on the reduction of this risk in the long-term in diabetic patients.

      Thus, the objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel
      double dose, given for 1 month in ACS in the diabetic patient.
