  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm study to evaluate progression free survival rate at
      18 months as well as evaluating the safety and efficacy of niraparib in combination with
      bevacizumab as maintenance therapy in patients with advanced ovarian cancer patients who have
      received prior front-line therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with
      bevacizumab and who have had at least one prior attempt at debulking surgery. Niraparib is an
      orally active poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose (PARP) inhibitor. Niraparib will be
      administered by mouth once daily continuously during a 21-day cycle. Bevacizumab will be
      administered intravenously D1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 15 mos, including the duration
      of the front-line therapy. Health-related quality of life will be measured by Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG). Safety and tolerability will be
      assessed by clinical review of adverse events (AEs), physical examinations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), RECIST tumor assessments and safety laboratory values.

    <time_frame>18 months after last patient enrolled (approximately 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib in combination with bevacizumab in patients with Stage IIIB to IV ovarian cancer who have Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or no evidence of disease (NED) following front-line, platinum-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab. The primary efficacy endpoint is the progression free survival (PFS) rate at 18 months (PFS18), which is defined as the proportion of patients who have not progressed or died within 18 months after niraparib combined with bevacizumab treatment initiation. Progression will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria per Investigator assessment.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Benefit - Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) - Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian Symptom Index (FOSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FOSI is a validated 8-item measure of symptom response to treatment for ovarian cancer.16 Patients respond to their symptom experience over the past 7 days using a 5-point Likert scale scored from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much&quot; (4). The average score is calculated as an average of the 8 items. The total symptom index is calculated as the total of the 8 symptoms.
PROs will be collected every 6 weeks (± 7 days) for 6 months, then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter while the patient is receiving study treatment. Once a patient discontinues treatment, PRO evaluations will be performed 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after treatment discontinuation, regardless of subsequent treatment.</description>
