    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bexarotene in preventing breast
      cancer in patients at high risk for breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      bexarotene, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of topical bexarotene 1% (weight by weight
      [w/w]) gel for evaluation in healthy women. (Dose Escalation Group) II. Conduct an
      intervention of topical 1% bexarotene gel to an unaffected breast of healthy women at high
      risk for breast cancer for 4 weeks at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as determined during
      the dose escalation group phase to assess bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue.
      (Dose Expansion Group)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To detect bexarotene concentration in the serum at baseline and at 4 weeks of treatment.

      II. To detect bexarotene concentration in the breast tissue at 4 weeks of treatment in the
      dose escalation group.

      III. To investigate the effects of topical bexarotene on serum biomarkers. IV. To investigate
      the biologic effects of topical bexarotene 1% gel in the breast tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bexarotene topically every other day (QOD) for 1 week for 4 weeks, or QOD
      for 1 week and then daily for 3 weeks after confirmation that toxicity is at an acceptable
      range.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
