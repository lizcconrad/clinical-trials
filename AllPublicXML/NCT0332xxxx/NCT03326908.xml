  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvement of retinal medical imaging opens new perspectives for exploring the retinal
      structures. Optical coherence spectral domain (SD-OCT), which has been widely used in the
      last ten years, is certainly the most advanced device. In the analysis of patients without
      retinal disease using SD-OCT, granulations in the interdigitation area were observed. These
      granulations have never been described with this device. They could correspond either to the
      degradation products of the external segments of the photoreceptors or to melanosomes. A
      descriptive study of these granulations at different examination times and in different
      lighting situations would allow us to obtain essential information for a better understanding
      of this area. Based on the results, larger studies could explore this area more finely in
      retinal pathologies involving dysfunctions of photoreceptors or of the pigmentary epithelium.

after 5 min of retinal glare, obtained by means of a projection of light of 1000 lux on the fundus of eye
