      VISTA technique with PRF compared to MCAF technique with PRF to treat gingival recession
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparison between two techniques for root coverage divided in two groups the first (test
      group) VISTA technique in conjunction with PRF-membrane and the second (control group)MCAF
      technique in conjunction with PRF-membrane for treating Miller's class I and II gingival
      recession defects.

      Clinical Periodontal Records will be taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months respectively.

      Visual analogue scale for pain during one week after operation. Patient satisfaction record
      using questionnaire after 6 months.

    <description>Using a questionnaire which are designed in a dichotomous fashion (yes or no ) and calculated by percentage of answering yes.
it not a scale, the following questions will be asked to the patients;
did you feel pain in spite of the medication prescribed?
did you perceive the course of healing unexpected restriction?
did you experience any remaining symptoms of parasethesia?
would you described the under taken effort as reasonable?
have your expectations been fulfilled?</description>
