  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, multicenter, single-arm study to assess the safety and feasibility of
      combining crenolanib with fludarabine and cytarabine chemotherapy in pediatric patients with
      relapsed/refractory FLT3-mutated AML. Patients will receive up to two courses of salvage
      chemotherapy with fludarabine, cytarabine, and crenolanib. Response will be assessed between
      day 29-43 of each course.
