      First aim: PARIS study

      The main aim of the current study is to determine the association between abdominal aortic
      aneurysm (AAA) progression and the evolution of proteases and cytokines levels.To achieve
      this aim, we will prospectively collect blood, aortic tissue, patient data, and imaging data.
      Aortic tissue will only be obtained when patients undergo conventional open repair. The other
      biomaterials will be collected during regular patient follow-up visits, with a maximum
      frequency of once per year.

      Second aim: Pearl AAA biobank

      For future research purposes, a new biobanking infrastructure will be created to collect and
      store additional blood and urine samples in a biobank. This biobank will be embedded within
      the infrastructure of the 'Parelsnoer Institute' (PSI) and will be called Pearl AAA. The
      Pearl AAA will be established in the extension of the PARIS study
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PARIS study aims to determine the correlation between AAA progression (growth or rupture)
      and the evolution of serum levels of proteases and cytokines over time. A repeated measures
      analysis will be done to use all longitudinal data available.

      The Pearl AAA biobank will be established to enable the PARIS study, but also aims to
      facilitate future research. Such future research should fall under the scientific aims of the
      Pearl AAA, which are:

        -  To gain insight in the pathogenesis of AAA

        -  To gain more knowledge in the rupture risk of AAA

        -  To evaluate and potentially improve treatment of AAA

      The 'Parelsnoer Institute' will facilitate the biobank Pearl AAA with certain aspects such
      as, but not limited to the following:

        -  Standardized operating procedures for the collection and storage of the biosamples
           across all participating hospitals

        -  Information architect to establish a data dictionary in which all variables are defined

        -  Standardized procedures for coding of patient data before storage

        -  Standardized digital infrastructure to enhance storage of patient data and imaging data
