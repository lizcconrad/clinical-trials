  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to prospectively examine outcomes in 12 patients using
      ziconotide Intrathecal Drug Therapy(IDT) as first-line monotherapy with the use of an
      algorithm of slow titration for dosing. The use of Prialt has demonstrated fewer and less
      serious associated adverse effects as compared to IDT morphine, especially when titrated
      slowly. We will use an average Numerical Rating Scale as our primary outcome and the Oswestry
      Disability Index(ODI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),
      Clinical Global Impression of Change Scale including binary satisfaction measures(CGIC),
      Lawton-Brody Instrumental Activities of Daily Living(IADL) and Short Form-36 as secondary
      outcome measures.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 week and 4, 5 and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This scale allows the subject to quantify their pain numerically, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable. This scale describe subject reported pain at its worst and best in the week prior to reporting, as well as total pain on average, and at the time of documentation. The mean of these scores will be used as the primary outcome. This scale also includes a question of subject experienced global improvement in which the patient is asked to quantify their overall change in pain with 0 being no change and 10 being completely changed. Using the NRS we will calculate a responder rate, assessing percentage of patients with a 50% response in NRS</description>

    <description>Quantitative sensory testing will be done using different types of sensory stimulation to objectively quantify sensation and pain tolerance. VonFrey fibers of various widths are used to detect sensation, a Neuropen pin prick iutilized to detect pain, along with a tuning fork to measure vibrationand a pressure guage to measure pressure felt on the skin. Cold/hot sensation is tested with Medoc Pathway system to quantitatively measure the temperature felt by patients to be done at baseline and 6 months,</description>
