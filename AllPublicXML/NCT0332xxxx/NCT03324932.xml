  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, comparative study will evaluate the efficacy of denosumab to
      prevent the adjuvant therapy of aromatase inhibitors-induced loss of bone mineral density
      (BMD) in breast cancer patients with normal BMD. Investigators will compare the inhibitory
      effects of denosumab on bone loss between participants with normal BMD to whom Letrozole or
      Arimidex will be administered as postoperative endocrine therapy for stage I-IIIA
      postmenopausal hormone-sensitive breast cancer and controls.

      Normal BMD means T score is ≥-1.0 for the lumbar vertebrae (L1-L4) and/or the femoral neck.
