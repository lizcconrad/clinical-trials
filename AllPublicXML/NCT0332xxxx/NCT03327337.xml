      The investigators use existing resources to carry out this new technology, in accord with the
      standard of the patients, were randomized to traditional fracture balloon tibia fixation or
      arthroscopic reduction under angioplasty, the original data and data acquisition in a certain
      period of time corresponding to the patient, through statistical and epidemiological analysis
      and comparison of the method of professional data analysis discussion and experience
      according to the analysis results, the balloon angioplasty tibial arthroscopy and traditional
      open reduction and internal fixation for the clinical differences between postoperative
      recovery of tibial plateau articular surface reduction and joint function, and feedback the

      The Balloon Tibioplasty arthroscopic assisted forming technique based on the existing data,
      the subject of the design, 1. patients met the inclusion criteria, were randomized to
      traditional fracture tibial fixation or balloon assisted arthroscopic reduction under
      angioplasty, through follow-up, statistical evaluation after operation were compared between
      the two techniques for clinical curative effect the difference of tibial plateau articular
      surface reduction and recovery of joint function. 2., through the clinical practice,
      operation and experience summary, found that the new technology in the operation of the
      existing deficiencies, in order to improve the technology. 3 guide clinical diagnosis and
      treatment through results feedback and analysis.The investigators use existing resources to
