  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, adaptive, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, Sham-controlled
      pilot study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Vibrant Capsule in relieving
      constipation in subjects with functional constipation.

      Three arms will be assessed:

        -  Vibrant Capsule with vibrating mode 1 administered 5 times per week

        -  Vibrant Capsule with vibrating mode 2 administered 5 times per week

        -  Sham Capsule administered 5 times per week

      Subjects will be followed continuously for at least a 2 weeks run-in period and then be
      randomized to either Vibrant or Sham capsules for a treatment period of 8 weeks. The first 2
      weeks of treatment will be considered as a subjects' training period.

      Data reporting will be done on an electronic Case Report Form and an eDiary. Subjects will be
      asked to refrain from taking any medication or supplement to relieve their constipation,
      during the entire study period.

      After the run-in period, the subjects will return and eligibility will be re-assessed.
      Subjects will be trained on how to use the base unit and will swallow the first capsule on
      site the day of baseline visit. They will activate and ingest the rest of the capsules at
      home by themselves, using the base unit.

      Subjects will be instructed to complete a simple subject eDiary each day throughout the
      duration of the study. A final visit will take place at the end of the 8 week treatment
      period.

      Subjects will receive phone calls at least once a week and subject compliance will be
      monitored during the 8 weeks of the study.
