  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of atezolizumab, gemcitabine, oxaliplatin,
      and rituximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with transformed diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and
      spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and rituximab, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving atezolizumab, gemcitabine,
      oxaliplatin, and rituximab may work better in treating patients with transformed diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and toxicity of atezolizumab in combination with immunogenic
      chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin) with rituximab (R-GEMOX-ATEZO) in patients with
      relapsed or refractory (rel/ref) transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including
      determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of
      R-GEMOX-ATEZO.

      II. Evaluate on-treatment changes in density of and proximity between immune cell subsets in
      the tumor microenvironment after immunogenic chemotherapy alone and R-GEMOX-ATEZO by
      multispectral immunofluorescence, including density of CD8+ cells and cytotoxic lymphocyte
      (CTL):regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. Evaluate genomic (e.g. gene expression
      profiles, whole exome sequencing) characteristics of patients with rel/ref transformed DLBCL
      treated with R-GEMOX-ATEZO.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV), gemcitabine IV, and
      oxaliplatin IV every 2 weeks. Starting course 2, patients also receive atezolizumab IV over
      30-60 minutes every 2 weeks. Treatment repeats every 14 days of course 1 and every 28 days
      for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Patients receive rituximab IV and atezolizumab over 30-60 minutes IV on
      day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression
      or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
