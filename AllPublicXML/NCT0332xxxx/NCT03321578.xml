    <textblock>
      This service evaulation aims to investigate how common diarrhoea is in hospital patients on
      medical, surgical and elderly care wards, what it is due to and how it is managed.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latest National Health Service (NHS) England guidelines for the assessment of Clostridium
      difficile infection (CDI) cases recommend that acute hospitals collect data on the prevalence
      of hospital-onset diarrhoea in their organisations, and how it is managed, including if
      patients are appropriately tested for CDI.

      The aims of this multi-centre service evaluation are therefore to:

        -  Determine the prevalence of hospital-onset diarrhoea on adult medical, surgical and care
           of the elderly wards in the NHS

        -  Investigate how hospital-onset diarrhoea is managed, including whether patients are
           tested for CDI according to Department of Health (DoH) England standards

        -  Investigate the aetiology of hospital-onset diarrhoea on adult medical, surgical and
           care of the elderly wards in the NHS, based on previously described causes

      Data will be collected at participating centres on two days, one between 11-15/Jan/2016 and
      one between 6-10/Jun/2016. Hospitals will be able to choose locally which two days. On those
      days investigators from the local Microbiology and/or Infection Prevention teams will screen
      all patients on pre-identified wards, who have been admitted for ≥72 hours, for
      hospital-onset diarrhoea. For all patients that meet the definition of hospital-onset
      diarrhoea their medical notes and charts will be reviewed, to ascertain potential causes and
      how they have been managed.

      This service evaluation should help participating hospitals to investigate hospital-onset
      diarrhoea in their own institutions, as well as generating a dataset that is representative
      of the problem across the NHS, and therefore of use to other centres.
