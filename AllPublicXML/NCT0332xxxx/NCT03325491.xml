  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As people grow older skeletal muscle gradually becomes smaller and weaker, causing reduced
      mobility and quality of life. To understand and reverse this negative process investigators
      need to find new ways of improving the ability of muscle to perform physical activity. There
      is some evidence that supplements may improve how the mitochondria work, and investigators
      want to explore this idea in more detail. This is possible by measuring how the muscles work
      and respond to exercise before and after taking the supplement alongside an aerobic (i.e.
      cycling) and resistance (i.e. weight lifting) exercise programme. This will give us the basic
      information investigators would need to see if this is a useful idea.

    <description>The active supplement will contain the prescription drug Acipimox (250 mgs) , a nicotinic acid precursor traditionally used to lower blood lipid levels. The supplement will be administered 3 times per day, for 6 weeks.</description>

    <description>The placebo supplement will contain only cellulose microcrystalline. This is an inert substance widely used in many pill and tablet formulations. It is an insoluble fibre and is not absorbed into the blood stream therefore is unlikely to cause toxicity when taken orally.</description>
