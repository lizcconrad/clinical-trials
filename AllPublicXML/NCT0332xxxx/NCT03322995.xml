      This is an open-label, phase II study in patients with resectable and borderline resectable
      pancreas cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with baseline CA19-9 &gt; 35 at diagnosis (CA19-9 producers) will initially be assigned
      to study 1, which includes:

        1. molecular profile-directed therapy;

        2. standard chemotherapy or

        3. chemoradiation.

      Restaging assessments will be performed at two-month intervals during the receipt of
      chemotherapy and approximately four to six weeks following the completion of chemoradiation.
      Treatment response will be assessed by imaging (CT scan), biomarker (serum CA19-9) and
      performance status assessment (SPPB and CES-D evaluations) at the first restaging assessment.

      Treatment response will be categorized as:

        1. response;

        2. stable disease;

        3. local disease progression;

        4. metastatic disease progression.

      After the first restaging evaluation, patients who demonstrate:

        1. a response will be maintained on the same chemotherapy;

        2. stable disease will be changed to a defined alternative chemotherapy;

        3. local progression will receive chemoradiation;

        4. metastatic disease will be removed from the trial.

      Patients who complete four months of chemotherapy, will be treated with chemoradiation
      (50.4Gy in 28 fractions). In the absence of local disease progression deemed inoperable, or
      metastatic disease progression, patients will be offered surgical resection. Patients who did
      not receive four months of systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant setting will be offered four
      months of adjuvant therapy at the discretion of their treating physicians.

      Among patients who are CA19-9 producers, but have insufficient material for molecular
      profiling to be performed, patients will receive induction FOLFIRINOX, as standard therapy.
      Patients who demonstrate a response or stable disease at the first treatment assessment will
      be maintained on the same chemotherapy for an additional two months. Patients who demonstrate
      local disease progression deemed amenable to surgical resection will be switched to
      chemoradiation, undergo restaging assessment and be offered surgery in the absence of further
      disease progression. Patients who demonstrate metastatic disease progression will removed
      from the trial. Among the patients who complete four months of chemotherapy, restaging
      assessment will be performed, using imaging (CT scan), biomarker (serum CA19-9) and
      performance status. In the absence of local disease progression deemed inoperable, or
      metastatic disease progression, patients will be treated with chemoradiation (50.4Gy in 28
      fractions). A third restaging assessment will be performed, and in the absence of inoperable
      local progression or metastatic disease progression, patients will be offered surgical
      resection. Patients who did not receive four months of systemic therapy in the neoadjuvant
      setting will be offered four months of adjuvant therapy at the discretion of their treating
      physicians.

      Patients who have a CA19-9 level &lt; 35 at diagnosis (CA 19-9 nonproducer) will initially be
      assigned to study 2, which includes:

        1. molecular profile-directed therapy;

        2. standard chemotherapy or

        3. chemoradiation.

      Restaging assessment will be performed at two-month intervals during the receipt of
      chemotherapy and approximately four to six weeks following the completion of chemoradiation.
      At the time of restaging, patients will be categorized as having

        1. no local or metastatic disease progression;

        2. local progression, which is deemed amenable to surgical resection or

        3. metastatic disease progression.

      Patients with no local or metastatic disease progression will receive an additional two
      months of chemotherapy, followed by chemoradiation. Patients who have local disease
      progression will be switched to chemoradiation, undergo restaging assessment and be offered
      surgery in the absence of further disease progression. Patients with metastatic disease
      progression will be removed from the trial. Restaging imaging will be repeated four to six
      weeks after the completion of chemoradiation. In the absence of inoperable local disease
      progression or metastatic disease progression, patients will be offered surgical resection.
      Patients who received less than four months of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will receive four
      months of adjuvant chemotherapy.
