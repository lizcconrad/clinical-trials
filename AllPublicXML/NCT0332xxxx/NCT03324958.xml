  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynaecological cancers among women in the
      developed countries. After a curative surgical treatment, many relapses occur in the vaginal
      cuff. The PORTEC-2 trial has demonstrated a similar reduction in local relapses of
      intermediate- to high-risk endometrial cancer with vaginal cuff brachytherapy (VCB) than with
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). However, VCB induced less late toxicities. VCB is
      therefore indicated after surgery for intermediate- to high-risk endometrial cancer. VCB is
      also recommended after radiation therapy, for patients with stage II or III type 1
      endometrial cancers according to the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics
      classification (FIGO), and for all patients with histological type 2 endometrial cancers.

      If the late tolerance of VCB is correct, the acute tolerance remains limited, and is mainly
      characterized by local pain and anxiety) Virtual reality appears to be a promising tool to
      enhance treatment cancer tolerance, offering a safe and entertaining environment. By the way,
      the use of virtual reality could limit physical and psychical discomfort induced by VCB.

      This randomized phase III multicenter trial aims to assess the impact of virtual reality
      helmets (visual and audio) during VCB in patients treated for endometrial cancer, in terms of
      pain (primary endpoint), and in terms of anxiety (secondary endpoint). Randomization will
      define which patient will wear a virtual reality helmet. Stratification will be performed
      according to the following criteria: vaginal molded applicator versus cylinder, two
      applications versus four; &lt;70 years versus&gt; 70 years.

    <description>The virtual reality helmet will be installed by a radiotherapist or a radiotherapy manipulator, just before the intra vaginal applicator. The virtual reality headset will be connected to a dedicated computer. The virtual reality program will run for 10 minutes which will cover the entire procedure for setting up the brachytherapy device. In order to optimize the distractive potential of virtual reality, four different virtual reality programs will be offered to patients during each brachytherapy fraction. These programs will be contemplative so as not to compromise the immobility of the patients during the installation of the brachytherapy applicator.</description>
