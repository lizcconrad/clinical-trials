  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG) is recommended for both treatment-na√Øve and treatment-experienced, HIV
      infected adults and paediatric subjects aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg.
      One case of suspected DTG hypersensitivity (HSR) reaction from among over 1500 subjects
      exposed to the drug at the time of submission in 4Q2012, has been identified; this subject
      experienced a diffuse maculopapular rash with fever and elevated liver enzymes. Isolated rash
      was uncommon in the DTG programme with less than 1% of clinical trial subjects experiencing
      treatment related rash. The pharmacovigilance strategy for DTG and DTG-containing products is
      to implement a post-marketing risk management program to further quantify the risk of HSR and
      compare it to that of other integrase inhibitors, and to possibly determine associated risk
      factors. In addition, the post-authorization safety study will monitor and compare
      hepatotoxicity and severe skin rash following initiation of DTG or other integrase inhibitor
      (raltegravir (RAL) or elvitegravir (EGV) based antiretroviral regimens (ARV). Further to be
      able to distinguish the above symptoms and reactions caused by DTG or the other integrase
      inhibitor regimen from that of abacavir (ABC), known to cause hypersensitivity reaction, the
      integrase inhibitor groups will be compared in combinations with and without ABC. This five
      year-long safety study will be conducted through collaboration with EuroSIDA, a well
      established prospective observational cohort study of more than 18,200 subjects followed in
      107 hospitals in 31 European countries, plus Israel and Argentina. This is a five year-long
      non-interventional prospective cohort study nested within the EuroSIDA study. The study
      population will include HIV positive subjects over the age of 16 years from EuroSIDA clinical
      sites, who are new users of DTG or other integrase inhibitors with and without ABC. Following
      initiation of DTG with ABC based antiretroviral regimen or DTG without ABC or regimens
      containing other integrase inhibitors (RAL, EGV) with or without ABC or any other DTG based
      ARV regimen as monotherapy or two-drug regimens, the study will aim to a) Monitor and compare
      hypersensitivity reaction, b) Monitor and compare hepatotoxicity, and c) Monitor and compare
      severe skin rash among all subjects discontinuing DTG or other integrase inhibitor regimens
      for any reason.
