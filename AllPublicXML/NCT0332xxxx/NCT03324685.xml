  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of a uridine
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGT)-inducing oral contraceptive (OC) regimen (ethinyl
      estradiol and levonorgestrel) on the PK of BIIB074 at steady state; evaluate the effect of
      multiple doses of BIIB074 on the pharmacokinetics(PK) of an OC regimen (ethinyl estradiol and
      levonorgestrel) at steady state.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB074
      when administered alone and when coadministered with a UGT-inducing OC regimen containing
      ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel and to evaluate the effect of a UGT-inducing OC regimen
      (ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel) on the PK of the M13, M14, and M16 metabolites of
      BIIB074.
