      Reverse hybrid therapy achieves a higher eradication rate than bismuth (triple therapy plus
      bismuth) remains unanswered

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rising prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, the failure rate of the 7-day
      standard triple therapy has declined to unacceptable level (&lt;80%) worldwide. Several regimens
      were suggested to replace standard triple therapy in the area with high clarithromycin
      resistance, including sequential therapy, concomitant therapy, hybrid therapy and bismuth
      containing quadruple therapy. A 14-day hybrid therapy invented by our study group appears
      very promising in H. pylori eradication, achieving eradication rates of 95%. A clinical trial
      by Hsu et al from our hospital showed 12-day reverse hybrid therapy also achieved high
      eradication rate, and improved the compliance of patients. Even prolong the treatment
      duration of standard triple therapy from 7 days to 12 days, the efficacy of eradication was
      still &lt; 90% (85-88%). The limitation of triple therapy in against resistant-stains was still
      existed. The addition of bismuth (triple therapy plus bismuth) can improve cure rates despite
      a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. The major bismuth effect is to add an
      additional 30%-40% to the success with resistant infections. However the direct compare the
      efficacy between 14-day reverse hybrid therapy and 14-day triple therapy plus bismuth is
      still insufficiency in Taiwan and worldwide. Choosing a navel therapy or a modifying triple
      therapy can get better efficacy, it is remained to be determined. Besides genotyping
      polymorphism of CYP2C19 influenced the metabolism of proton pump inhibit, and could cause
      decreasing of eradication rate of standard triple therapy. But the influence in 14-day
      reverse hybrid therapy and 14-day triple therapy plus bismuth is unclear.
