    <textblock>
      The aim of this multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Dorithricin® lozenge - a triple combination of 0.5 mg
      tyrothricin, 1.0 mg benzalkonium chloride, and 1.5 mg benzocaine - in repeat dosing for 3
      days to matched placebo lozenges in the treatment of acute pharyngitis in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, adult patients with
      non-streptococcal sore throat and signs of moderate-to-severe associated pain (pain intensity
      on the 11-point Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale NRS ≥7 and ≥50 mm on the subjective 0-100 mm
      visual analogue) are assigned to Dorithricin® or matching placebo lozenge treatment. Efficacy
      was assessed at the investigating center for 2 hrs after first dosing, and 3 days later
      (visit 2). The primary efficacy end-point is the percentage of total responders assessed at
      visit 2, i.e. complete resolution of throat pain and difficulty in swallowing at approx. 72
      hrs after first application of treatment, Safety and local tolerability are also assessed.

    <description>Dorithricin throat lozenges is a fixed combination of three active substances: Benzalkonium Chloride-Benzocaine Topical plus tyrothricin. Lozenge has to be sucked slowly until it fully dissolves in the mouth and dosed up to 8 lozenges per day. Test product without mint oil.
Intervention: The initial dose is administered at the study site. Patients administer at home 1 lozenge at intervals of 2 hours (±15 minutes) up to a maximum of 8 lozenges per day.</description>

    <description>Placebo Oral Tablet is taken orally. Placebo consists of a lozenge with matched appearance and the same excipients as those of the Dorithricin lozenge. The initial dose (2 lozenges simultaneously) is administered at the study site.
Intervention: Patients are instructed to administer at home 1 lozenge at intervals of 2 hours (±15 minutes) up to a maximum of 8 lozenges per day.</description>
