  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (SZ) is a highly debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder of young adulthood
      onset and a leading cause of disability worldwide. While treatments delivered at early stages
      of the disorder may be effective at reducing psychosis or altering the course of the disease,
      there are currently no biomarkers capable of identifying subjects in early stages of SZ who
      are likely to respond to treatment and would be good candidates for available proactive,
      symptomatic or future disease-modifying treatments; or those who would not respond and can be
      spared unnecessary medication exposure. The lack of these vitally important biomarkers
      provides a compelling rationale for the present multidisciplinary research project, which
      aims to develop and validate highly promising noninvasive and objective proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS)-based biomarkers for monitoring treatment response in early
      stages of SZ. In support of the viability of this overall objective is a large body of data,
      reported by the applicants and others, that show (a) that levels of glutamate (Glu) and -
      aminobutyric acid (GABA) - respectively, the major excitatory and inhibitory amino acid
      neurotransmitter systems - are abnormally elevated in medication-na√Øve and unmedicated first
      episode and chronic SZ patients; (b) that the effect of treatment with antipsychotic
      medications in these populations may be to lower or normalize brain levels of both Glu and
      GABA. To investigate the potential of these in vivo brain Glu and GABA abnormalities to serve
      as biomarkers of treatment response in early-stage SZ, the applicants propose to use 1H MRS
      to measure Glu and GABA levels in the largest cohort of medication-free SZ subjects to date,
      at baseline and following 4 weeks of antipsychotic treatment.

Participants are rated on a scale of
(Absent)
(Minimal)
(Mild)
(Moderate)
(Moderate severe)
(Severe)

to describe Positive, Negative and General symptomatology. Items from each subscale (Positive, Negative, and General) are summed for their respective scales, with lower numbers indicating less severe or absent symptomatology, and higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. A total sum of all subscales is also computed to reflect overall symptom severity.
