    <textblock>
      An 8 week 'real-life' inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose reduction study in patients with
      severe asthma without evidence of bronchial hyperactivity.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to describe the proportion of patients with severe asthma, but without objective
      evidence of active disease, who can successfully be reduced in ICS dose for a period of 8
      weeks. This is also intended as an exploration of the methodology and feasibility of
      step-down studies with this patient group, to act as a pilot for future projects.

      This study enrolled patients from the SATS severe asthma study, in which they had undergone
      systematic investigation for comorbidities, triggers and barriers to good asthma control.

      After baseline investigations, the patient's ICS dose is halved (or as close as possible to,
      but not below, 50%). Patients continued on the same inhaled steroid drug and device. Patients
      taking a combined ICS/LABA inhaler halve the dose of this, as per usual clinical practice.
      Other asthma medicaitons are continued unchanged.
