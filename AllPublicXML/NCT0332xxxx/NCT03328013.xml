    <textblock>
      In France, the vaccination coverage observed for HPV vaccination is low for a full-scale
      regimen, and has been falling since 2010. A high rate of HPV vaccination coverage has a
      significant epidemiological impact with a reduction in cervical cancer mortality.

      There is less data on vaccinated catch-up patients. In 2017, these patients are 25 years of
      age or older and carry out screening smears.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether HPV catch-up vaccination results in a
      decrease in the abnormal smear rate compared to the rate in unvaccinated patients.

      If so, these data will help mobilize doctors to vaccinate patients against HPV, even in
      catching-up.

    <textblock>
      In France, the observed vaccination coverage is very low for a complete regimen and has been
      declining since 2010. This low coverage makes it impossible to benefit from the efficiency
      observed in the other countries.

      Indeed, a high HPV vaccination coverage rate would allow an epidemiologically significant
      impact with a reduction in cervical cancer mortality. In France, it is estimated that the
      vaccination of 80% of girls between the ages of 11 and 14 would reduce the incidence of 72%
      of CIN2 and 54% of CIN3.

      Nevertheless, there is less data on patients who have been vaccinated in catch-up. These
      patients are 25 years of age or older in 2017, and make smears.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate whether HPV catch-up vaccination results in a
      decrease in the abnormal smear rate compared to the rate in unvaccinated patients.

      If our study shows the benefits of catch-up vaccination, these data will help to mobilize
      doctors to vaccinate girls 15-19 years of age against HPV if they have not been able to
      benefit between 11 and 14 years as recommended.
