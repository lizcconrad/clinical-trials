    <textblock>
      Patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) that has relapsed (come back) or refractory
      (progressed on treatment) will receive ixazomib and ibrutinib.

      Ibrutinib has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment for
      patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least one prior therapy.

      Ixazomib is in a class of medications called proteasome inhibitors. Cancer cells depend on
      proteasome to provide this protein metabolism (turnover) function to regulate their growth
      and survival. Ixazomib disrupts a cancer cells' ability to survive by blocking the proteasome
      and disrupting protein metabolism. This may help to slow down the growth of cancer or may
      cause cancer cells to die.

      The purpose of this study is to see whether the addition of ixazomib to ibrutinib
      chemotherapy is effective in treating people who have relapsed or refractory MCL and to
      examine the side effects associated with ixazomib in combination with ibrutinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MCL is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is considered incurable with conventional
      therapy. For relapsed patients, Ibrutinib, lenalidomide, and bortezomib are all approved by
      the FDA but are not curative. Novel approaches are required to improve outcomes for patients
      with relapsed/refractory MCL.

      This is an open-label study that will be done in 2 phases. Phase I will test different doses
      of ixazomib and ibrutinib to determine the maximum safe and tolerated dose. In Phase I,
      patients who have already received ibrutinib, may participate if they meet certain criteria
      (i.e., have not received ibrutinib for at least 3 months).

      Phase II will find out the effects, good and/or bad, of ixazomib in combination with
      ibrutinib. In Phase II, patients will be separated into 2 groups, patients who have never
      received ibrutinib and patients who have received ibrutinib. This study is designed to
      examine the effectiveness of this drug in treating patients with MCL.

      Patients will be treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor assessments will be performed approximately every 3 months for the first year of
      treatment, then every 6 months until progression.

      Mandatory bone marrow and tumor tissue samples (i.e., obtained during a previous procedure or
      biopsy) are required at baseline. Mandatory research blood samples will also be collected.

             or C are not eligible.

          -  Patients with any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the
             investigator's opinion, potentially interfere with the completion of the treatment
             according to the protocol are not eligible.

          -  Patients with a known allergy to any of the study medications, their analogues, or
             excipients in the various formulations of any agent are not eligible.

          -  Patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, or Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy with
             pain on clinical examination during the screening period are not eligible.

          -  Patients may not participate in any other therapeutic clinical trials, including those
             with other investigational agents not included in this trial throughout the duration
             of this study.

          -  As ibrutinib will not be provided by the study, the patient must be able to obtain
             ibrutinib through other means (i.e., commercially or through patient assistance
             programs). This must be confirmed prior to registration.
