  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare providers are routinely being assessed for metrics designed to assess the quality
      of the care they deliver. There is growing consensus that these measurements, which typically
      assess the percentage of patients meeting a specific standard of care, should be adjusted for
      the clinical complexity of the providers. This study will assess whether adjusting for the
      social complexity of the patient panel adds significantly to adjustment for clinical
      complexity in explaining apparent differences in quality of care provided by Primary care
      providers and clinics.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The analysis will be conducted in 2 stages. In the first stage, indicators of social
      complexity (as assessed by characteristics of the patients' geocoded addresses) will be
      tested for significant association with patient level outcomes (meeting or not meeting a
      specific standard of care). These indicators will be assessed in 4 cohorts: 2 cohorts of
      patients identified in electronic health records of Clinical Research Networks of community
      health centers, and 2 cohorts of patients insured by Medicaid in 2015 (Oregon and Florida
      Medicaid cohorts). Due to limitations in the available data, some quality indicators can only
      be evaluated in a subset of the cohorts. The consistency of specific social complexity
      indicators, referred to as Community Vital Signs (CVS), will be evaluated across the cohorts
      and quality metrics.

      In the second stage, CVS indicators that contributed consistently to models at the patient
      level will be evaluated for their effect on provider ranking on quality metrics if the
      metrics are adjusted for the social complexity of the providers' patient panel in addition to
      the panels' clinical complexity.
