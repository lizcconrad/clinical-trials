  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been the 'gold standard' for the
      treatment of insomnia. There is a need to increase access to treatment, particularly for
      patients in more rural locations where providers may be scarce. One solution is to utilize
      telemedicine which is &quot;the use of electronic communications to provide and support health
      care when distance separates the provider from the patient.&quot; So the purpose of the study is
      to determine if receiving CBT-I by video teleconferencing works just as well as in-person
      treatment.
