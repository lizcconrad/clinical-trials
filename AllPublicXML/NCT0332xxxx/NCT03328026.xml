    <textblock>
      This is an open-label rollover study of Study WRI-GEV-007, which evaluates SV-BR-1-GM in
      metastatic or locally recurrent breast cancer patients. Patients who demonstrate progressive
      disease on Study WRI-GEV-007 will be eligible to enroll in this study, which will evaluate
      SV-BR-1-GM in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda) if their tumors express PD-L1 or
      PD-L2, or in combination with ipilimumab (Yervoy) if their tumors do not express PD-L1 or
      PD-L2. Treatment cycles will be every 3 weeks with evaluations for tumor progression or
      response every 8-12 weeks.

      This is an open-label, single arm roll-over study of Study WRI-GEV-007, &quot;A Phase I/IIa Study
      of SV-BR-1-GM in Metastatic or Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer Patients&quot;. Those patients who
      have exhibited disease progression according to iRECIST criteria will be eligible to roll
      over into this study, at the Investigator's discretion. Following discussion with the
      Sponsor, the Investigator can have the patient treated with one of the following regimens:

        1. Combination therapy with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®, anti-PD-1) - for patients with PD-L1
           or PD-L2 positive tumors (defined as at least 1% of tumor cells on biopsy or archival
           material, or 1% of circulating tumor cells, staining positive for PD-L1 or PD-L2).

        2. Combination therapy with ipilimumab (YERVOY®, anti-CTLA-4) - for patients with PD-L1 and
           PD-L2 negative tumors (defined as at less than 1% of tumor cells on biopsy or archival
           material, or 1% of circulating tumor cells, staining positive for PD-L1 or PD-L2).

      The SV-BR-1-GM regimen will be tailored to accommodate the dosing regimen of the
      immunotherapy, but cannot be more frequent than every 2 weeks, except when approved by the
      Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor. After the first year of therapy, consideration
      should be given to decreasing the frequency of therapy (monthly, every 6 weeks, etc.) by the
      PI in consultation with the Sponsor. Note that hormonal therapy (e.g., aromatase inhibitors)
      is permitted if ongoing, but may be added while the patient is on this study only with the
      Sponsor's approval.

      Patients rolling over from Study WRI-GEV-007 will be screened to assure they fulfill the
      enrollment criteria. Screening must be performed within 30 days of initiating therapy, and
      imaging studies must be performed within 2 weeks of initiating therapy. Patients will be
      evaluated every 3 weeks during the study, including all safety assessments. Imaging studies
      will be performed every 2-3 months (8 - 12 weeks) during study participation. Pharmacodynamic
      assessments, including evaluation of the immune response to SV-BR-1-GM will also be performed
      every 3 months. Patients who develop progressive disease may remain on the study if the
      Investigator feels they are deriving clinical benefit. For patients who come off the study, a
      final assessment will be carried out 2-4 weeks following the final treatment, including all
      safety assessments. Subjects will continue to be followed for survival analysis by phone call
      every 6 months.

             prednisone or equivalent or any immunosuppressive drugs. Beta-blocker therapy, while
             not exclusionary, is discouraged and alternatives should be sought if possible. The
             beta-blocker might compromise use of epinephrine for the rare possibility of
             anaphylaxis.

         16. Patients who are on treatment for an autoimmune disease, unless specifically approved
             by the Investigator and the Sponsor.
