  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in Republic of Korea is 27% and 16% in men and
      women aged 40-69 years. Up to 93% of women and 82% of men with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      remain undiagnosed. Polysomnography, the gold standard, is time consuming and costly.
      Patients with undiagnosed OSA may experience obstructive episodes during procedures with
      conscious sedation.

      STOP-Bang questionnaire is the validated questionnaire to screen patients for undiagnosed OSA
      in the preoperative setting. It has high sensitivity (92.9%) for predicting patients with
      moderate to severe OSA.

      Previous studies reported that STOP-Bang questionnaire predicted cardiopulmonary events
      during advanced endoscopic procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound. However, there have been no studies regarding the risk for
      sedation-related cardiopulmonary events in patients with undiagnosed OSA undergoing
      bronchoscopy. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of high-risk patients for OSA by a
      screening questionnaire, and to determine whether the questionnaire could predict patients
      who are at risk for cardiopulmonary events during bronchoscopy with conscious sedation.
