  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood copeptin will be measured during the routine treatment of neonates, children and
      adolescents on the Intensive Care Unit of the University Children`s Hospital Zurich at
      different time points (admission, 12, 24, 48, 96, 168 hours after admission). These values
      will be primarily analysed for their variability and their association with arterial
      hypotension. Blood samples will be drawn together with otherwise medically indicated blood
      withdrawals to avoid extra harm. Further, copeptin values will be compared to clinical and
      vital parameters, all of them open-label available during clinical routine. Copeptin`s
      predictive value for patients` outcome will be analysed as secondary outcome.

        This is a study designed to explore Copeptin values in all kinds of critically ill
        paediatric patients. Patients with normal blood pressures will allow calculating Copeptin
        reference values for the ones requiring cardiovascular support. Therefore, all patients,
        irrespective of their medical condition (e.g. medical or surgical, mildly or severely
        affected) and their age (neonates to adolescents) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of
        the University`s Children Hospital Zurich will be eligible, as long as they fulfil the
        mentioned inclusion criteria.
