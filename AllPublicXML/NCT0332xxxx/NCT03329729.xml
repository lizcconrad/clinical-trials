  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemias are a major risk factor for the onset of cardiovascular disease, while early
      diagnosis and appropriate treatment approaches significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity
      and mortality.

      The aim is to provide revised Greek guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of
      dyslipidaemias.

      The lipids of the human body are cholesterol (it is used to synthesize cell membranes,
      adrenal hormones and gonads and is a component of bile) and triglycerides (used as a fuel and
      as a storage of energy in adipose tissue). Dyslipidemias are disorders (quantitative or
      qualitative) of the metabolism of lipoprotein particles [low density lipoproteins (LDL),
      chylomic, high density lipoproteins (HDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL)] that carry
      lipids into the body.

      Primary prevention in subjects aged 40-65 years with no known clinical atherosclerotic
      disease and without diabetes or chronic renal disease should evaluate the likelihood of a
      fatal cardiovascular event over the next 10 years. For this purpose, it is recommended to use
      the Greek version of the SCORE of the Hellenic Heart SCORE.

      Rosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric coenzyme
      A (HMG-CoA), an enzyme regulating the rate of cholesterol synthesis. Its main area of action
      is the liver.

        -  In cases of primary hypercholesterolaemia (type IIa, including familial
           hypercholesterolemia heterozygote) or mixed dyslipidaemia (type IIb) as a supplement to
           diet when dietary and other non-medication responses are inadequate.

        -  In cases of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), as a supplement to the diet
           and other lipid-lowering treatments.

        -  In cases of slowing the progression of atherosclerosis. It is indicated as a
           supplemental treatment of the diet in lowering the total cholesterol (Total C) and LDL-C
           values.

        -  In patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (excess triglycerides in the blood). Dosage and
           route of administration

        -  In hyperlipidemia, mixed dyslipidaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia, and slowing the
           progression of atherosclerosis, the recommended starting dose is 10 mg once a day.

        -  In homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the recommended starting dose is 20 mg once
           a day.

        -  In Asian patients, the recommended starting dose is 5mg once a day.

        -  In patients receiving ciclosporin, the dose of rosuvastatin should be set at 5 mg, while
           those taking the combination of Lopinavir

    <description>Assessing Quality of Life in patients with hypercholesterolemia and other risk factors by EQ-5D questionnaire. The EQ- 5D is a descriptive, generic instrument that has also been validated for the Greek population and consists of two parts.25 The first part is a descriptive system of five dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The second part consists of a visual analogue scale (VAS), the EQ-VAS, that asks respondents to self-rate themselves on a thermometer-like grading system in order to capture variations in health states. EQ-5D health state valuations may be converted into a single summary index by applying an algorithm that attaches values to each of the levels in each dimension. Value sets have been derived for the EQ-5D scores in several countries using either the VAS or the time trade-off (TTO) valuation technique.</description>
