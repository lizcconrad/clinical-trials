  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) to explore the possible beneficial effect of a
      novel combination therapy consisting of molecular hydrogen H2 plus minocycline (&quot;H2M&quot;), on
      neurological recovery after acute ischemic stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a pilot trial exploring the ability of a novel combination (&quot;H2M&quot;) of molecular
      hydrogen (an antioxidant) and minocycline (a widely used antibiotic known to inhibit the
      activation of matrix metallo-proteinase-9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase), to protect brain
      tissue from ischemia/reperfusion injury that occurs during and after an ischemic stroke. Both
      hydrogen and minocycline have excellent safety profiles, have been previously demonstrated
      individually to reduce infarction in animal models of stroke, and have potentially
      synergistic mechanisms of action against ischemic brain damage. The mechanisms of action of
      both agents would be specifically relevant to patients receiving tissue plasminogen activator
      (tPA) or thrombectomy, and achieving some degree of therapeutic reperfusion.

      This will be a double blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible and willing subjects will
      be randomly assigned to be treated with either H2M or placebo, in addition to standard
      treatments. The treatment with H2M or placebo will start as soon as possible after diagnosis
      of stroke, and continue for three days (hydrogen) and five days (minocycline) respectively.
      Measures of stroke severity and disability will be recorded at baseline, and through a
      follow-up phone call (45 days) and clinic visit (90 days).
