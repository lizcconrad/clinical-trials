  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) is a frequently used questionnaire to assess
      somatic symptom burden. The Somatic Symptom Scale China (SSS-Ch) was recently developed as a
      comprehensive self-report instrument in assessing somatic symptom burden, but its assessment
      value has not yet been widely tested in a nationwide. The study aims to investigate the
      reliability of the SSS-Ch, to validate discriminate validity and factorial validity, and to
      investigate its utility in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) based on
      multi-centers inpatients.

      Somatic symptoms are prevalent in kinds of medical conditions and mental disorders. Since
      they are associated with decreased quality of life, increased psychological distress, and
      increased use of health care services, the assessment of somatic symptom burden is essential
      in evidence based patient care and research. The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) is
      a frequently used questionnaire to assess somatic symptom burden, but in which there are not
      any mental symptoms listed. Recently, we developed the Somatic Symptom Scale China (SSS-Ch)
      which includes common mental symptoms and more comprehensive somatic symptoms to assess
      somatic symptom burden, but its assessment value has not yet been widely tested.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the reliability and validity of the SSS-Ch compared
      with the PHQ-15. We also try to use the SSS-Ch to investigate the prevalence of somatic
      symptoms in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) based on multi-centers
      inpatients.

The Somatic Symptom Scale China (SSS-Ch) is developed to assess somatic symptom burden, which includes 20 items. Each item represents an organ discomfort and is rated as 1 (&quot;not at all&quot;), 2 （&quot;mild&quot;）, 3（&quot;moderate&quot;）， or 4 (&quot;severe&quot;). In determining the SSS-Ch score, the total score is summarized from the 20 items, rendering ranges from 20 to 80 (higher scores represent the more severe somatic symptom burden).</description>
