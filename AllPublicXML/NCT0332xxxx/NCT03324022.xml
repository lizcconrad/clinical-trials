  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) affects about 50% of patients with Graves' disease (GD), and some
      cannot be cured by current treatments. Orbital fibroblasts involves in the pathogenesis of GO
      by producing glycosaminoglycans and inflammatory cytokines. Since fibroblast growth factors
      (FGFs) binding to FGF receptors (FGFRs) can induce proliferation and differentiation of
      fibroblasts, investigators would like to measure the expression of FGFs and FGFRs in GO
      patients to see if inhibition of FGF-FGFR pathway has potential in treatment.
