    <textblock>
      Nephrotic syndrome (NS) represents one of the most common diagnoses in pediatric and adult
      nephrology, with a prevalence of 16 per 100,000 children and 3 per 100,000 adults in Western
      countries.

      In most cases, the pathogenesis of NS remains elusive, and the clinical phenotype of patients
      does not allow discrimination among different causes. Thus, children with NS are usually
      treated with corticosteroids before a biopsy is taken, and approximately 80% of them respond
      to such a treatment. According to this observation, pediatric NS has been separated into two
      broad categories; Steroid-Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome (SSNS) and Steroid-Resistant Nephrotic
      Syndrome (SRNS). In both these categories the biopsy result is usually Minimal Change Disease
      (MCD) while a few may show Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Although children
      affected by SSNS have good long-term prognosis, most patients with SRNS progress to End Stage
      Renal Disease (ESRD) within 2-10 years of diagnosis .

      In adults a biopsy diagnosis of FSGS is more common than in children and more patients will
      not respond to corticosteroids alone and will need additional immunosuppressant medication.
      About 40% will progress to ESRD within 10 years .

      Currently, at least 19 genes have been clearly identified with association to SRNS harboring
      ~300 independent mutations, conferring a considerable genetic heterogeneity to the disorder.

      Genetic testing is emerging as a useful diagnostic tool in SRNS as it has implications for
      clinical course, treatment response, risk for posttransplant proteinuria and prenatal
      diagnosis. An approach for genetic testing based on the current evidence seems cost-effective
      and may help in the best possible management of SRNS .

      The NPHS2 gene, is located on chromosome 1 and is also known as the Podocin gene. It encodes
      the podocin protein. Podocin is a 383-amino acid lipid-raft-associated protein localized at
      the slit diaphragm, where it is required for the structural organization and regulation of
      the glomerular filtration barrier. Its interaction with other slit diaphragm proteins eg.
      nephrin, NEPH1, CD2AP and TRPC6 is important in mechanosensation signaling, podocyte
      survival, cell polarity, and cytoskeletal organization .

      It has been reported that variants in the NPHS2 gene are associated with NS .

      The commonly studied rs61747728 NPHS2 gene polymorphism also known as p.R229Q has been
      reported to be associated with NS and SRNS .

      However others have failed to report an association , which might be due to population
      differences.

      The rs61747728 is a non-synonymous variant found on exon 5 which is suggested to be involved
      in in altering the functional properties of podocin in vitro and possibly in vivo .

      The investigators will therefore investigate the frequency of the p.R229Q variant in Middle
      East patients with NS.

      Genetic analysis will have important implications in several aspects:-

        1. Understanding the biology of the disease in this part of the world.

        2. Counselling patients about their clinical course and what medication they will respond
           to.

        3. Counselling patients about the possibility of a kidney transplant sooner in their
           disease course

      Aim of the work:

      The aim of this study is:

        1. To identify any relationship between NPHS2 gene mutations and NS in children and adults
           in Middle East.

        2. To study the relationship of mutations in this gene with the clinical presentation,
           clinical coarse and response to treatment in these patients and compare it with patients
           without mutations in this gene.

        3. To compare our results with similar data from other World populations/ethnic groups.

        4. To share our results with the treating clinicians so that counselling of the patients
           can be done in terms of treatment, prognosis and family screening.

      Anticipated outcome and benefit :

      With the increasing number of patients with NS in Middle East and the higher number of
      consanguineous marriages as compared to other societies, the investigators are sure that many
      gene mutations will be uncovered that may be the same as the previously reported genes or new
      novel genes.

      In either case the investigators would have studied the genetic predisposition in our patient
      population and helped the nephrologists in taking appropriate treatment decisions.

      The investigators expect a total of 150 patients with NS in both children and adults. About
      20% will be from the pediatric population with MCD, while about 80% will be adults with
      predominantly FSGS.

      Patient Recruitment:

      This study will include patients referred to the nephrology departments in the major
      hospitals in Kuwait- Mubarak,Amiri,Farwaniya, Adan and Jahra Hospitals. Both children and
      adults of all ages.

      This study will also include patients referred to the nephrology departments in Assuit
      university hospitals and all Upper Egypt hospitals Both children and adults of all ages,

      Procedures:

      Saliva and blood sampling and DNA extraction

      After obtaining informed consent from parents of children and adults, 3 ml of blood will be
      collected from children and in the event that the patients or their parents refuse then
      buccal swabs will be collected from children, and 5 ml of blood will be collected from
      adults.All patients will be fully informed about the methods of blood sampling or buccal
      swabs and A written consent will be obtained from adult patients and parents of childrens.
      The buccal swabs will be processed to extract DNA and stored at -20 till time of genetic
      analysis. Peripheral blood samples will be collected in EDTA anticoagulated tubes and DNA
      will be extracted according to standard methods using QIAGEN DNA blood mini kit (QIAGEN) and
      stored at 20 till time of analysis.

      Genotyping :

      Genotyping of the NPHS2 variant rs61747728 will be performed by Real-time TaqMan Allelic
      Discrimination Assay (Life technologies, CA, USA) according to standard manufacturer
      protocols. Allelic discrimination analysis will be performed and analyzed using ABI 7500 Fast
      Real-time PCR system SDS software (Life technologies, CA, USA).

      Statistical analysis

      Basic statistical analysis will performed using SPSS software (version 22; SPSS Inc, Chicago,
      IL, USA). The genetic analysis will be performed using the SNPassoc package from R software.
