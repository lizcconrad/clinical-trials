  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b/2 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of metronomic combination
      therapy in subjects with pancreatic cancer who have progressed on or after previous SoC
      chemotherapy. Phase 2 will be based on Simon's two-stage optimal design.

      Treatment will be administered in two phases, an induction and a maintenance phase, as
      described below. Subjects will continue induction treatment for up to 1 year. Treatment in
      the study will be discontinued if the subject experiences progressive disease (PD) or
      unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment.
      Those who have a complete response (CR) in the induction phase will enter the maintenance
      phase of the study. Subjects may remain on the maintenance phase of the study for up to 1
      year. Treatment will continue in the maintenance phase until the subject experiences PD or
      unacceptable toxicity (not corrected with dose reduction), withdraws consent, or if the
      Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's best interest to continue treatment. The
      maximum time on study treatment, including both the induction and maintenance phases, is 2
      years.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years old.

          2. Able to understand and provide a signed informed consent that fulfills the relevant
             IRB or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) guidelines.

          3. Histologically-confirmed pancreatic cancer with progression on or after SoC therapy.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.

          5. Have at least 1 measurable lesion of ≥ 1.5 cm.

          6. Must have a recent formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsy specimen
             following the conclusion of the most recent anticancer treatment and be willing to
             release the specimen. If an historic specimen is not available, the subject must be
             willing to undergo a biopsy during the screening period, if considered safe by the
             Investigator. If safety concerns preclude collection of a biopsy during the screening
             period, a tumor biopsy specimen collected prior to the conclusion of the most recent
             anticancer treatment may be used.

          7. Must be willing to provide blood samples prior to the start of treatment on this
             study.

          8. Must be willing to provide a tumor biopsy specimen 8 weeks after the start of
             treatment, if considered safe by the Investigator.

          9. Ability to attend required study visits and return for adequate follow-up, as required
             by this protocol.

         10. Agreement to practice effective contraception for female subjects of child-bearing
             potential and non-sterile males. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must agree
             to use effective contraception for up to 1 year after completion of therapy, and
             non-sterile male subjects must agree to use a condom for up to 4 months after
             treatment. Effective contraception includes surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy,
             tubal ligation), two forms of barrier methods (eg, condom, diaphragm) used with
             spermicide, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and abstinence.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of persistent grade 2 or higher (CTCAE Version 4.03) hematological toxicity
             resulting from previous therapy.

          2. Within 5 years prior to first dose of study treatment, any evidence of other active
             malignancies or brain metastasis except controlled basal cell carcinoma; prior history
             of in situ cancer (eg, breast, melanoma, cervical); prior history of prostate cancer
             that is not under active systemic treatment (except hormonal therapy) and with
             undetectable prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (&lt; 0.2 ng/mL); bulky (≥ 1.5 cm) disease
             with metastasis in the central hilar area of the chest and involving the pulmonary
             vasculature.

          3. Serious uncontrolled concomitant disease that would contraindicate the use of the
             investigational drug used in this study or that would put the subject at high risk for
             treatment-related complications.

          4. Systemic autoimmune disease (eg, lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Addison's
             disease, autoimmune disease associated with lymphoma).

          5. History of organ transplant requiring immunosuppression.

          6. History of or active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease, ulcerative
             colitis).

          7. Requires whole blood transfusion to meet eligibility criteria.

          8. Inadequate organ function, evidenced by the following laboratory results:

               1. White blood cell (WBC) count &lt; 3,500 cells/mm3

                  has documented Gilbert's syndrome).

               6. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST [SGOT]) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT [SGPT])
                  &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases).

               7. Alkaline phosphatase levels &gt; 2.5 × ULN (&gt; 5 × ULN in subjects with liver
                  metastases, or &gt;10 × ULN in subjects with bone metastases).

               8. Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL or 177 μmol/L.

          9. Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic &gt; 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic &gt; 100 mm Hg) or
