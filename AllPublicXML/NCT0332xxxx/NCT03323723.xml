      This study is an interventional, single arm, multi-center study. It will be conducted at
      sites in the northeastern United States. The protocol will be approved by Chesapeake IRB or
      applicable local IRBs. The sample size will consist of approximately 50 participants.
      Participants will undergo an initial control period in which preweighed pads will be worn for
      7 consecutive days for 12 hours. This will be followed by device usage for 14 consecutive
      days where participants will wear both device and preweighed pads simultaneously. for 12
      hours.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an over-the-counter (OTC)
      disposable stress urinary incontinence (SUI) pessary device. Specifically, this study will
      evaluate the effectiveness of the pessary device by assessing reduction in urine leakage in
      approximately 50 women with Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI). Efficacy will be assessed by
      mean pad weight gain per hour, reduction of stress urinary incontinence events per day, and a
      quality of life questionnaire. The safety of the OTC SUI pessary device will be evaluated by
      assessing all adverse events, including the results of urinalysis, vaginal swab, and vaginal
      examination.

    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Mean pad weight gain reduction is &gt;50% during the last 7 days of the treatment phase as compared to the baseline phase. The objective is to show that reduction in the mean pad weight gain per hour is &gt;50% in the treatment period. Thus, the null hypothesis is that the mean weight gain reduction per hour is &lt;=50%, and the alternative is that it is &gt;50%, from the control period (no device) to the treatment period (women wearing the device).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in Mean SUI episodes during treatment phase as compared to baseline phase</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Reduction in mean number of SUI episodes per day from the 7-day baseline period to the last 7 days of the 14-day device treatment period. Participants will record SUI episodes in the Study Diary during the baseline (7 days) and treatment (14 days) periods. Negative values are indicative of efficacious outcome. Each subject will have a change in the number of episodes per day from the control period to the treatment period. Specifically, the number of episodes will be recorded each day in the diary. For the control phase, there will be (at most) 7 days of data. The mean number of SUI episodes per day will be computed for each subject. The same measures will occur in the treatment period for the analysis period, the last 7 days.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life - Measured improvement during treatment phase</measure>
    <time_frame>21 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Quality of Life as measured by the ICIQ-LUTSqol - The Quality of Life Questionnaire to be performed at baseline, before, and after treatment phase of the study is based on 20 questions referring to areas which may have been influenced or changed by accidental urine loss and/or prolapse. These questions are assigned a value of, 1 = 'Not at all,' 2= 'Slightly,' 3 = 'Moderately,' or 4 'A lot.' Each area is then assessed on a scale of 1-10 to see how much it bothers them. The Questionnaire is scored by taking the average score of items and then multiplying that value by 25 to put scores on a scale from 0 to 100. A lower score is considered less impact to quality of life and a higher score reflects more impact to quality of life. In the same manner, a reduction in scores from baseline reflects improved quality of life. A reduction in score of &gt; 3.7 is considered the Minimum Clinically Important Difference (MCID).</description>
