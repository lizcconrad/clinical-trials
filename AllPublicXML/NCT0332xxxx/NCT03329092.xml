    <masking_description>An independent adjudication committee (central blinded assessor) will be convened at regular intervals during the study. The adjudication committee will be blinded to study treatment and will review the clinical response assessments at each visit. In case of a discrepancy with the Investigator's assignment of clinical response, the adjudication committee's assessment will prevail.
In addition, for cIAI subjects classified as a clinical failure, and all cIAI subjects classified as a cure who undergo another procedure (eg, another surgical procedure) subsequent to randomization, the expert panel will review the adequacy of the surgical source control.</masking_description>
