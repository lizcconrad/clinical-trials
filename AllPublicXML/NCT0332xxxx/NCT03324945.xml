  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI), also known as &quot;chemobrain,&quot; is a spectrum
      of neurocognitive deficits experienced during and after the administration of chemotherapy
      for cancer. The incidence of CICI is significant, affecting anywhere from 25 to 75% of
      survivors, and the biologic basis is unknown. This novel study is designed to address the
      questions of incidence and biological cause for CICI, while gaining a better understanding of
      the structural and functional effects of chemotherapy on the brain.

      Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI), also known as &quot;chemobrain,&quot; is a spectrum
      of neurocognitive deficits experienced during and after the administration of chemotherapy
      for cancer. The incidence of CICI is significant, affecting anywhere from 25 to 75% of
      survivors, and the biologic basis is unknown. This novel study is designed to address the
      questions of incidence and biological cause for CICI, while gaining a better understanding of
      the structural and functional effects of chemotherapy on the brain. In order to address these
      important objectives, a diverse team of experienced investigators has been assembled to
      design and implement the proposed protocol. The research team for this project seeks to
      accomplish the proposed objectives through following mechanisms: 1) assessment of the
      neurocognitive domains affected in CICI using a tailored battery of cognitive tests to define
      CICI; 2) measurement of serum markers of oxidative stress and correlation of these markers
      with neurocognitive test results; and 3) exploration of structural and functional changes in
      the brain during cognitive tasks and correlation of results with markers of oxidative stress
      and neurocognitive test results.

    <description>To address the primary aim, RCI (which is essentially a z-score) for each patient will be calculated from the pre-, post-chemotherapy Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test results. Then a Wilcoxon signed rank test will be applied to the RCI values with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <description>Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline log serum levels, will be utilized to assess for differences in log levels over timepoints including the 4 and 6 hour samples. Spearman correlations will be utilized to describe associations with cognitive tests scores and biochemical measured in addition to Spearman Correlation coefficients between baseline biochemical measures.</description>

    <description>For neurological outcomes, a longitudinal comparison before and after Chemotherapy in fMRI (percent signal change and extend of activation voxels), DTI (FA % change), and ERP (uV) will be performed. There will be changes in patterns of fMRI responses, FA, and ERP signals from baseline to after treatment. We expect that fMRI activation will be change in prefrontal regions change of effort needed to do the memory task. Changes in white matter FA in after the treatment may be observable in the white matter regions such as the frontal and temporal cortices as well as in gray matter regions suspected to be affected by the Chemo. Cognitive ERP patterns will be changed in the same individuals. fMRI and ERP analysis can be analyzed and compared at individual level.
To explore correlations between fMRI outcomes and cognitive measures, ANCOVA is an appropriate choice since we want to study measures after treatment, relative to initial values.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any stage epithelial ovarian cancer, including cancers arising from the
             fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer, or patients with other gynecologic
             malignancy (any stage), who are chemotherapy-naïve, and scheduled to undergo at least
             6 cycles of intravenous platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy.

          2. Patients who are receiving other investigational agents will be permitted on study, at
             the discretion of the principal investigator.

          3. Patients must have adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic, and sensory neurologic
             function to be eligible to receive platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy.

          4. Patients must have a World Health Organization Performance Status of ≤ 2.

          5. Age ≥18 years.

          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign an approved written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy are ineligible. Patients may
             have received prior adjuvant hormonal therapy for localized breast cancer, provided
             that it was completed prior to registration, and that the patient remains free of
             recurrent or metastatic disease.

          2. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic outcomes and other
             adverse events.

          3. Patients with underlying dementia (or on medications to treat Alzheimer's disease such
             as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, tacrine, or memantine), encephalopathy, or
             other neurological disorder known to adversely affect cognition (such as epilepsy or
             prior stroke) are excluded. (Patients with depression or anxiety are not excluded).

          4. Patients will be excluded from fMRI testing if they are left-handed, claustrophobic,
             have a pacemaker, or have metal implants. Patients not undergoing fMRI testing may
             still enroll in clinical trial, including the ERP testing, if all other eligibility
             criteria are met.

          5. Patients who are pregnant or nursing are excluded. Pregnant women are excluded from
             this study because cytotoxic chemotherapy has the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cytotoxic
             chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          6. Patients who are non-English speaking are excluded because of the inability to
             adequately administer neurocognitive testing in non-English languages.
