  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the effects of the Neuro RX Gamma on the cognitive and behavioral
      functioning of subjects with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's Disease. The Neuro RX Gamma uses
      non-invasive near-infrared energy delivered to the brain in daily treatment sessions at home.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Neuro RX Gamma system is a headset which emits near-infrared energy through diodes placed
      on the scalp and inside a nostril.

      A potential participant will undergo screening procedures to confirm eligibility to
      participate in the study, followed by randomization procedure to one of the study groups -
      treatment or sham (placebo). A dedicated caregiver will apply the device to the subject for
      20 minute daily sessions at home, 6 days a week for a total of 12 weeks. The subject and
      caregiver will be required to return to the clinic for follow-up assessments after 3, 6 and
      12 weeks of treatment.

      40 patients will be enrolled in 2 clinical sites in Ontario, Canada.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The ADL SAD assesses the performance of activities of daily living by patients with Alzheimer's disease. The assessment includes 19 questions. The score for each question ranges as follows: questions 1 - 5, 0 - 15; questions 6 - 8, 0 - 13; questions 9 - 12, 0 - 12; questions 13 - 15, 0 - 10 and questions 16 - 19, 0 - 4. Subscales will be summed to compute the total score. The total score ranges from 0 - 54 with higher scores indicating less functional impairment and greater competence.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 3</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS CGIC gives the Clinician's assessment of the patient's response to the treatment. It is intended to be used as a measure of clinically meaningful change. The ADCS-CGIC focuses on clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral performance since the beginning of a trial. It relies on both direct examination of the patient and interview of the caregiver. Scored as marked/moderate/minimal improvement or worsening or no change.</description>
