      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation
      therapy in treating patients with ovarian or uterine cancer that has come back. Stereotactic
      body radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the
      tumor using smaller doses over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) for abdominopelvic recurrences in patients with ovarian and uterine serous carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the rates of one-year local control, progression-free survival, overall
      survival, chemotherapy-free interval, and to assess quality of life.

      II. Determine the functional imaging correlates for local control and acute and late
      toxicities.

      III. Determine the chronology and profile of the SBRT-associated immune response.

      OUTLINE: This is dose escalation study.

      Patients undergo SBRT every other day for 3 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks and then every 3
      months for 1 year.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 or 1

          -  Diagnosis of primary ovarian cancer of any histology (patients with diagnoses of
             fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer are also eligible), or primary uterine
             cancer of papillary serous histology

          -  Pathologic confirmation of eligible histology

          -  Eligible disease states will include: 1) initial oligorecurrence defined as first
             recurrence after initial standard of care surgery and chemotherapy with 3 or less
             sites of disease, 2) subsequent oligorecurrence limited to 3 or less sites of disease,
             and 3) oligoprogressive disease defined as 3 or less sites of active disease in the
             setting of otherwise controlled additional systemic disease

          -  Sites of disease must be confined to the abdomen or pelvis (with the exception of
             parenchymal liver metastases) and must be =&lt; 5 cm in greatest dimension as determined
             by pre-screening cross-sectional imaging

          -  Systemic therapy is allowed but SBRT cannot begin until &gt;= 7 days after the last cycle
             of systemic therapy, and systemic therapy cannot be initiated or re-initiated until &gt;=
             7 days after SBRT; there will be no limit on prior lines of systemic therapy

          -  Patients with contraindications to intravenous (IV) contrast administration are still

             the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist) but will not participate in the
             functional imaging studies

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women; if patients are not status post bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy then
             pregnancy testing is required

          -  Patients with active collagen vascular disease (CVD), specifically systemic lupus
             erythematosus or scleroderma; patients with a history of CVD without evidence of
             active disease are eligible for enrollment at the discretion of the study principal
             investigator (PI)

          -  Patients with inflammatory bowel disease and/or gastrointestinal (GI) ulcers and/or GI
             fistulas are eligible but only at the discretion of the study PI after personalized
             review of their medical history and proximity of SBRT targets to gastrointestinal
             mucosa

          -  Patients with a separate non-cutaneous cancer diagnosis for which the patient has not
             been without evidence of disease for at least 5 years
