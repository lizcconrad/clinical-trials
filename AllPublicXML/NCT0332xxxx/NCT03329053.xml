  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this trial are:

      (A) to determine and compare the indices of exercise recommendations compliance after
      exercise prescription according to digital training and decision support system as compared
      to exercise prescription following the standard informative procedure among patients with
      cardiovascular disease.

      (B) to determine whether health literacy moderates effect of exercise prescription according
      to digital training and decision support system on the indices of exercise recommendations
      compliance among patients with cardiovascular disease.

    <textblock>
      The trial will compare the utilization of physical activity recommendation between the
      standard lifestyle informative procedure and the digital training and decision system
      informative procedure.

      We hypothesize that a higher rate of compliance between seven-day exercise report and
      physical activity recommendations will be observed in the experimental group compared with
      three-months waiting group.

      The goal is to recruit patients with a stable diagnosis, clinically defined as sufficiently
      healthy to participate in an optimized (safe and monitored) exercise programme. Based on the
      experience with similar projects completed on Cardiovascular Health Centres (CHC) expected
      attrition rate is 25%. Such a value and 400 participants as a target recruitment number still
      allows to keep 150 participants in both groups and a power of 80% to detect the differences
      between groups and across the time at an α level of 0,05 (two-tailed).

      The trial will be supervised by a Data Safety and Monitoring Board consisting of one
      independent, internationally recognized clinical researcher, one representative
      (cardiologist) from each cooperating Cardiovascular Healthcare Centre as an advisor and
      experts in health psychology, exercise psychology, trial management and exercise physiology.
      The Board will be the policy and decision-making authority of the trial.

    <time_frame>Before the intervention and 1-5 days after three months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical data will included a list of actual patient's cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk factors, other chronic non-cardiovascular co-morbidities, patient´s medication (type of medication), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), blood total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (mmol/l), fasting glycaemia (mmol/l), resting, and known patient´s adverse events registered during exercise testing.</description>

    <measure>Change in health literacy at three months</measure>
    <time_frame>Before the intervention and 1-5 days after three months follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Health literacy level will be assessed using The Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). This questionnaire comprises nine domains to provide a detailed profile of health literacy of populations, groups or patients of interest. The HLQ is divided into two parts which differ in response categories. Part 1 (domains 1-5) has 4 response categories rating the extent of agreement from 1 to 4. Part 2 (domains 6-9) has 5 response categories rating the level of difficulty from cannot do or always difficult (1), to always easy (5). Each domain was scored as the average of the item scores. The score ranges from 1 to 4 or 1 to 5 respectively, a higher score indicating higher level of health literacy.</description>
