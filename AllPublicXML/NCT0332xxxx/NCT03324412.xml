  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that results in a chronic inflammatory
      disorder that may affect many synovial joints, and may cause serious disability. It has been
      confirmed that Tripterygium Wilfordii has effects of anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and
      cartilage protection. This is a multicenter ,double Blind, randomized study to evaluated the
      efficacy and safety of Tripterygium Wilfordii in treating of patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) and establish a prediction model for Tripterygium Wilfordii response of
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      Two arms were included in this study. Active Comparator: treatment of MTX Patients were
      treated with methotrexate (MTX)and Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F（TwHF）placebo.Experimental:
      treatment of TwHF Patients were treated with methotrexate (MTX) and Tripterygium wilfordii
