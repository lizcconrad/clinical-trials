    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, unblinded/open-label study of the effect size of HRCT
      endpoints in response to glucocorticoid induction therapy in subjects with a diagnosis of
      pulmonary sarcoidosis who have not received glucocorticoid as initial sarcoidosis therapy (≥
      20 mg/day prednisone or prednisolone) or other sarcoidosis therapy for at least 3 months
      prior to enrollment. This study will enroll a total of approximately 24 subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal development of novel treatments for sarcoidosis requires clinical study endpoints
      that efficiently reflect changes in disease activity over short treatment durations. Such
      endpoints enable preliminary assessment of candidate drug efficacy in small studies - prior
      to exposing large cohorts to experimental compounds in pursuit of registrational data.

      This study will accordingly investigate the ways that certain HRCT-based functional
      respiratory imaging (FRI) measures can serve as more quantitative and sensitive endpoints
      compared to pulmonary function tests to measure drug effect in a short duration small sample
      size study in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. The study is designed to minimize impact
      on sarcoid care that the patient would have otherwise received. Glucocorticoid (≥ 30 mg/day
      prednisone or prednisolone) as per local clinical practice of sarcoidosis initial induction
      therapy will be taken orally in this study. The glucocorticoid dose may be modified depending
      on ongoing assessment as a part of standard local clinical practice.

             examination at screening.

             a. Stable and mild syndromes associated with normal ageing, that are not expected to
             affect safe participation or data interpretation are allowed. Examples include, but
             are not limited to, systemic hypertension, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, etc.

          7. Contraception Requirements:

             the study and for at least 28 days after the last study visit.

             At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a FCBP's
             contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes, the Investigator will
             educate the subject regarding contraception options and the correct and consistent use
             of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.

             spermicide.

             Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in
             which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (latex or non-latex
             condoms NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane]) while

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment. If the
        result(s) do not satisfy eligibility criteria, subjects will be ineligible to enroll in the
        study and will be considered a screen failure. Subjects may be re-screened with the
        approval of the medical monitor:

          1. Subject has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, neurological
             disease or psychiatric illness that would prevent the subject from safely completing

             screening (eg, an arrhythmia, heart block, etc.) that suggest either significant
             cardiac sarcoidosis or significant risk of cardiac adverse event over the duration of
             this study.

         20. Subject has a history of malignancy within 5 years (except basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin that is surgically cured, remote history of cancer now considered cured or

               -  Candidate subjects having these conditions may be re-evaluated upon resolution
                  and entered into the study if all other criteria are met.
