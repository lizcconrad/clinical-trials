      In this study, participants with histologically diagnosed locally advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy
      followed by surgery harbouring high risk of tumor recurrence will receive adjuvant
      cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy followed by pembrolizumab. The primary study hypothesis is
      that adjuvant pembrolizumab will improve the 1-year recurrence-free survival rate compared to
      historical control.

      It is a single-arm phase II trial. The target population is patients with histologically
      diagnosed locally advanced ESCC patients (clinically staged at least T3 and/or any N and M0
      by endoscopic ultrasonography [EUS] and fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography
      [FDG-PET]) who have received preoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by
      surgery, and exhibit high risk (closed or involved resection margin or extranodal invasion of
      involved lymph nodes) of tumor recurrence. Eligible patients will receive adjuvant
      cisplatin-based CRT followed by pembrolizumab for 18 cycles.The study will enroll 46 patients
      in Taiwan. The estimated enrollment period is 2 years.

             reactive or HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected).

         18. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.
