    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a HIV risk assessment tool to
      promote HIV testing and to reduce high risk sexual behaviors among men who have sex with men
      (MSM). It hypothesizes that the social media-based HIV risk assessment tool can increase 20%
      HIV testing proportion during the six months follow-up period.
