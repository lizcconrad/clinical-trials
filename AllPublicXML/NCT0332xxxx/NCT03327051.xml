    <textblock>
      Probiotics are over-the-counter dietary products with microorganisms that are generally
      consumed for health benefit. However, the durability of these microorganisms is unclear,
      particularly when it passes through the highly acidic environment of the stomach. We will
      test the colonization of these microorganisms among individuals who consume probiotics with
      and without acid suppression therapy.

      Probiotics are over-the-counter dietary products with microorganisms that are generally
      consumed for health benefit. However, the durability of these microorganisms is unclear,
      particularly when it passes through the highly acidic environment of the stomach. We will
      test the colonization of these microorganisms among individuals who consume probiotics with
      and without acid suppression therapy.

      All activities will be related to research. Participants will be randomized to receive either
      over-the-counter acid suppression medication or placebo from weeks -2 through week 4. All
      participants will receive VSL #3 (over-the-counter probiotic) from weeks 0 through 4. Survey
      data, serum, and stool samples will be collected at weeks -2, 0, and 4.

      The intervention medication and probiotics have a very low side effect profile and are
      available over the counter. All data collection methods are non-invasive.

      Elucidation of the effects of acid suppression on probiotic colonization will allow us to
      better understand the utility of probiotics use by individuals on acid suppression
      medications.
