  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with breast cancer who report insomnia that started or worsened during breast cancer
      diagnosis and treatment will be enrolled in a group behavioral trial to one of two arms
      testing cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia against a mindfulness-based therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are recruiting breast cancer survivors with stage I-III or Eastern
      Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1 breast cancer to enroll in a group-delivered behavioral trial
      for insomnia. The investigators are comparing mindfulness-based therapies delivered in an
      alternative medicine context to cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. The intervention
      is 9 weeks, for two hours weekly.
