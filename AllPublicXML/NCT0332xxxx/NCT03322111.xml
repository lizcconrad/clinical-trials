  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study the investigator wants measure the individual cyclofusion competence from
      healthy subjects and patients suffering from Strabismus with a only binocularly visible
      threedimensional Landolt-C stimulus. For this the participant has to look at a 3-D monitor
      with shutter glasses. The participant is sitting in 2 meter distance in front of the monitor.
      On the monitor appears the Landolt-C stimulus as a dynamic Random-Dot Stimulus. As long as
      the participant can fuse the stimulus he will be able to see the Landolt C-ring
      threedimensional. The participant is then ask to tell in which direction the notch of the
      Landolt-C ring points out. Once a critical degree of cyclotorsion is reached the participant
      will no longer be able to see the Landolt C ring and the individual cyclofusion competence is
      reached.
