    <textblock>
      For patients undergoing postoperative therapy for locally advanced gastric cancer after
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we assessed the utility of graded histologic regression of &lt;50% as
      the criterion of treatment change. Sixty patients will be enrolled to randomize into two
      groups：receiving modified chemotherapy and receiving the original chemotherapy.
