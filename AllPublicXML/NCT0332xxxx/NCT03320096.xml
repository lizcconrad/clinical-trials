    <measure>Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) score reduction at day 30 post second treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>60 days from Baseline (= 30 days post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>HDSS score reduction from a 3 or 4 at baseline to a 1 or 2 at 30 days post second treatment.
The HDSS is a validated 4-point scale providing qualitative measures of the severity of patient condition based on how it affects their lives ranging from 1(my underarm sweating is never noticeable and never interferes with my daily activities ) to 4 (my underarm sweating is intolerable and always interferes with my daily activities).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in spontaneous axillary sweat production assessed by gravimetric method at all time points following completion of study treatment(s), as measured by a 50% reduction or more compared to baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 60 (=30 days post 2nd treatment) and day 120 (=90 days post 2nd treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Gravimetric method is performed by drying the surface of the skin, then applying a pre-weighed filter paper to the axilla for a period of time measured by a stopwatch. The paper is then weighed and the rate of sweat production is calculated in mg/min.</description>

    <measure>Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) score reduction 90 days post treatment #2.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to day 120 (=90 days post second treatment)</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Starch iodine test to assess area of efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days from Baseline (= 90 days post second treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Starch Iodine test is performed by applying an iodine solution to the sweaty area. After it dries, starch is sprinkled on the area. The starch-iodine combination turns a dark blue color wherever excess sweat is present. Digital images of the starch iodine test will be obtained.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, age 18-75 years.

          -  Diagnosis of bilateral axillary hyperhidrosis refractory to previous topical
             therapies.

          -  At least 50 mg of spontaneous resting axillary sweat production in each axilla
             measured gravimetrically at room temperature/humidity (20 - 25.6°C/20-80%) over a
             period of 5 minutes. (Patients should be at rest for at least 30 minutes after
             physical exercise including walking.)

          -  HDSS score of 3 or 4. An attempt will be made to approximate an equal number of scores
             3 and 4.

          -  Willingness to refrain from use of aspirin, Ibuprofen, Naproxen or any other NSAID,
             and Vitamin E in the 2 weeks prior to each study treatment .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Dermal disorder including infection at anticipated treatment sites in either axilla.

          -  Previous botulinum toxin treatment of the axilla in the past year.

          -  Expected use of botulinum toxin for the treatment of any other disease during the
             study period.

          -  Known allergy to starch powder, iodine, lidocaine, or epinephrine.

          -  Secondary hyperhidrosis, for example, hyperhidrosis that is secondary to other
             underlying diseases including hyperthyroidism, lymphoma and malaria.

          -  Previous surgical treatment of hyperhidrosis including sympathectomy, surgical
             debulking of the sweat glands, subcutaneous tissue curettage and ultrasonic surgery.
