  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventionally fractionated radiation therapy given over 6-7 weeks alone, sequentially, or
      concurrent with chemotherapy have produced poor outcomes in Stage II NSCLC in most series.
      Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has been shown to be very effective and is now
      standard of care for Stage 1 disease. There has been initially reluctance to utilize SABR for
      central lung tumors because of published reports that showed an excess of toxicity when SABR
      was utilized; however, newer data with less intense treatment regimens suggest safety in
      treatment of central lung disease. The safety and efficacy of SABR in treating hilar nodes or
      N1 disease currently is not known fully and will be evaluated in this study.

      1. Primary Objectives Safety run-in - To determine the safety of SABR for the treatment of
           primary lung disease and N1 (hilar) node in stage T1-2a N1 NSCLC Phase II - To determine
           2-year local control of SABR for T1-2a N1 NSCLC with sequential chemotherapy

        2. Secondary Objectives Phase II - To determine overall and progression-free survival
           times, pattern of failures, and rates of ≥ grade 3 adverse events after SABR for T1-2a
           N1 NSCLC combined with sequential chemotherapy
