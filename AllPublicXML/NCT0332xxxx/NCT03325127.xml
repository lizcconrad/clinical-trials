  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no real-world data that describes how Radium-223 (Ra-223) is being used in
      combination with abiraterone/enzalutamide (abi/enza) or evidence describing outcomes of this
      combination usage for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC). To address these data gaps a cohort of mCRPC patients will be chosen who received
      Ra-223 concomitant with abi/enza in first line therapy to assess the treatment patterns
      following first line and clinical outcomes from initiation of first line treatment. For the
      purpose of this study concomitant use will be defined as Ra-223 initiated after at least 6
      months from the start of first line abi/enza. The specific objectives of the study are to
      describe the outcomes, treatment patterns, patient and provider characteristics of mCRPC
      patients treated with Ra-223 concomittantly with abi/enza in first line treatment.
