  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and paroxetine IR tablets have
      been approved for the treatment of three anxiety indications in China. This bioequivalence
      study will evaluate Paroxetine IR tablets manufactured in GSKT (A) and Mississauga (B) sites
      in healthy Chinese subjects under fasting and fed conditions to support the quality
      consistency evaluation. This is a single dose, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover
      study and will include a screening period (up to 7 days), two open-label treatment periods
      (up to 16 days) and a follow-up phase (up to 14 days after last-dose). The whole study will
      be divided into two groups, one for fasting condition enrolling approximately 36 subjects and
      another for fed condition for which approximately 44 subjects will be enrolled. In both
      groups, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive single dose of Paroxetine IR tablets
      A or B in a cross-over manner.
