    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate safety and tolerability of BI 705564 in
      healthy male subjects, following oral administration of multiple rising doses.

      Secondary objectives are the exploration of the pharmacokinetics, including dose
      proportionality and investigation of linearity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history, a physical examination, vital signs (Blood Pressure (BP),
             Pulse Rate (PR)), 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Age of 18 to 50 years (incl.)

          -  Body Max Index (BMI) of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

             accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure (BP), Pulse Rate (PR)
             or Electrocardiogram (ECG)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 50 to 90 bpm

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/ or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere
             with the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple
             hernia repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizure or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

             finding at screening

             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

          -  Subject is assessed as unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has a

        In addition, the following trial-specific exclusion criteria apply:

          -  Male subject with women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) partner who is unwilling to

             trial medication until 30 days after last administration of trial medication

          -  Subjects who, in the investigator's judgement, are perceived as having an increased
             risk of bleeding, e.g. history of haemorrhagic disorders, clinical relevant petechial
             bleeding, occult blood in faeces, haematuria in repeated urine tests, trauma or
             surgery within the last month planned surgery during trial participation, history of
             arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm, history of gastroduodenal ulcer disease or
             gastrointestinal haemorrhage, history of intracranial, intraocular, spinal,
             retroperitoneal, or atraumatic intraarticular bleeding, use of drugs that may
             interfere with haemostasis during trial conduct (e.g. acetylic salicylic acid or other
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)

          -  Repeated platelet counts below 100 cells/nL at screening

          -  Bleeding times (to monitor platelet function) above reference range at screening

          -  Repeated absolute B cell (CD19+) counts below 40/μL at screening

          -  Serum potassium below normal range at screening

          -  A history or current clinical signs of acute pancreatitis
