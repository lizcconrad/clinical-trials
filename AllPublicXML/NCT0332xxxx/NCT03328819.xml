  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: The effect of acupuncture as treatment for chronic pain and depression
      comorbidity is questionable because only a limited number of controlled clinical trials with
      sound methodologies have been conducted. The investigators will perform a well-designed
      crossover study including assessments of scales and blood sample analysis to investigate the
      efficacy of acupuncture as treatment for comorbidity of chronic pain and major depression
      disorder (MDD) and figure out the indicative biomarkers to predict or assess the comorbidity.

      Methods: Patients with a recent major depression and chronic pain were randomized to receive
      acupuncture for depression group or acupuncture for chronic pain. They will receive 2~3
      sessions per week over 6 consecutive weeks. Then patients accept another 6weeks sessions
      after two-week washout. During washout period, original western treatment will be maintained
      and acupuncture will be interrupted.

      The primary outcome measure was change in 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD),
      pain with Brief Pain Inventory- Long form (BPI). Secondary outcome measures included changes
      in Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Neurotoxicity Rating Scale (NTRS), WHO Quality of
      Life (WHOQoL), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), biomarkers such as neurotransmitter, kinase,
      protein, cytokine, DNA, mRNA related to comorbidity of chronic pain and major depression.

    <description>Acupuncture is a form of alternative medicine in which thin needles are inserted into the body. It is a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). TCM theory and practice are not based upon scientific knowledge, and acupuncture is a pseudoscience. There are a diverse range of acupuncture theories based on different philosophies, and techniques vary depending on the country. The method used in TCM is likely the most widespread in the US. It is most often used for pain relief, though it is also used for a wide range of other conditions.</description>
