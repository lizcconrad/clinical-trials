  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-Deficit/Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) in adults is associated with global impairments
      and deficits in quality of life. The ADHD functional impairments during adulthood usually
      persist even after adequate medication treatment. The Skill Training Group of the Dialectical
      Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is one of the group therapies that had been adapted for the specific
      treatment of ADHD patients. Our primary aim is to explore the feasibility of the approach in
      different culture and to evaluate the efficacy of the Skill Training Group as an add-on
      treatment for adults using ADHD medication. This is a Randomized Clinical Trial comparing the
      Skill Training Group added to stimulants to treatment as usual. 52 adults previously
      diagnosed with ADHD and treated with stimulants in our ADHD outpatient program will be
      enrolled. Only patients with residual symptoms will be included (ADHD-Self Report Scale -
      ASRS ≥ 20). The intervention comprises the standard 12 sessions therapy program. The groups
      will have between 8 and 12 patients each, and will be conducted by a trained DBT therapist
      with supervision from a senior DBT therapist. The primary outcome will be the ASRS scores.
      Secondary outcomes include scores in ADHD Quality of Life, Beck's Depression Inventory,
      Beck's Anxiety Inventory, and performance in a neuropsychological test (difference between
      pre and post-intervention) (Stop Signal Task). Adherence to the protocol will also be
      checked. The recruitment was initially scheduled for beginning in November.
