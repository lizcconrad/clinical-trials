    <textblock>
      A prospective dose escalation, nine period cross-over trial assessing the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, bioavailability and pharmacodynamics of escalating doses of Remimazolam
      when administered intranasally as powder and solution in healthy subjects and compared to an
      intravenous control
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design will be a randomized, double-blind, comparative, placebo- and active-controlled
      nine-period crossover study in healthy male volunteers. Subjects will be randomized and will
      receive each of the 9 treatments which will be separated by a minimum of 48 hours.The first
      treatment arm will always be the intravenous remimazolam. Eligible subjects will then be
      randomized to treatment sequence prior to study drug administration in treatment period 2.
      Each subject will participate in the study for up to 51 days, from Screening until Follow-up.

    <description>Adverse events assessment will include: change in clinical laboratory assessments from baseline, change in vital signs from baseline, change in 12-lead electrocardiograms from baseline, drop in oxygen saturation measured using continuous pulse oximetry, nasal effect using the Nasal Effect Questionnaire (NEQ) and nose and throat examination. Adverse events with a respiratory or cardiovascular focus and adverse events related to effects seen with medications known to be associated with abuse will be analysed separately. The intensity, causality, outcome, seriousness and expectedness of adverse events will be assessed</description>
