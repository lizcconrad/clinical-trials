  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess the effectiveness of a stepped-care model (i.e. digital Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (dCBT-I) followed by face-to-face CBT-I) in improving
      severity of insomnia and sleep outcomes in an insomnia cohort, including those at higher risk
      of depression. This project will also investigate the effectiveness of this stepped-care
      model in prevention of depression and any potential mediation by rumination as a modifiable
      behavior.

  <detailed_description>

      This project will assess the acute and long-term effectiveness of dCBT-I on Research Domain
      Criteria (RDoC) sleep parameters: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), sleep onset latency, and
      wake after sleep onset in an insomnia cohort including those at elevated risk for depression
      (e.g. high sleep reactivity, low SES, minority). This will be tested by administering
      internet-based dCBT-I to people with insomnia and adding face-to-face CBT-I in non-remitters
      (ISI &gt; 10), as well aS comparing the RDoC sleep outcomes to an attention control group
      post-treatment and at 1 year follow-up. This study will also determine the acute and
      long-term effectiveness of face-to-face CBT-I for insomnia in non-responders to dCBT-I on
      RDoC sleep outcomes relative to a comparison group post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up.

      This study will also determine the effects of dCBT-I and CBT-I using a stepped-care model for
      prevention of incident depression and depression relapse. The 1-year rate of depression of
      both dCBT-I and CBT-I will be compared to a control group.

      This study will also evaluate changes in nocturnal rumination as a modifiable behavior
      (post-treatment) that mediates the effect of insomnia treatment on subsequent depression
      risk. This will also determine the moderating effects of important depression risk factors
      (e.g. race, SES) on the change in sleep and depression outcomes.
