  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given today's high prevalence of common mental disorders and related sick leave among
      teachers an urgent need exists for a more sustainable working life for this professional
      group. One way of doing this is by improving schools' social and organizational risk
      management. Recent reports have shown that many schools in Sweden however lack a structured
      approach to the management of social and organizational risks. In 2015, we launched the first
      Swedish occupational health guideline to support a structured prevention of social and
      organizational risks at the workplace with the aim of preventing common mental disorders. The
      long-term goal of this study is to support the implementation of this guideline within
      schools in order to improve social and organizational risk management and in doing so reduce
      risk factors for mental ill-health and related sick days. The objective of the study is to
      fill the current research-to-practice gap by conducting a cluster-randomized controlled trial
      that compares the effectiveness of two implementation strategies for implementing the
      guideline in schools. The strategies that will be compared are training (ARM 1) versus
      training in combination with implementation teams and workshops (ARM 2). Our hypothesis for
      the study is that schools that receive support in implementing the guideline through combined
      strategies are more responsive to working in a structured and systematic manner with the
      management of social and organizational risks than schools that only receive training. The
      trial will be conducted in 30 primary schools in three municipalities in Sweden. All schools
      have agreed to participate. The primary outcomes are adherence to the guideline
      (implementation effectiveness) and self-reported exhaustion among schools personnel
      (intervention effectiveness); the secondary outcomes are risk factors for mental ill-health
      and absenteeism. Data will be collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months by mixed methods
      (i.e. survey, focus-group interviews, observation, and register-data).
