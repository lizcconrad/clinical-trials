    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

        -  To evaluate tolerability and safety of SAR408701 when administered as a single agent
           according to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) related dose limiting
           toxicities (DLTs) to determine the recommended dose (RD) of SAR408701 in Japanese
           patients with advanced malignant solid tumors (dose-escalation part).

        -  To evaluate tolerability and safety of SAR408701 in combination with other anti-tumor
           drug according to the IMP related DLTs to determine RD of SAR408701 in Japanese patients
           with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) (combination part).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To characterize the overall safety profile of SAR408701 monotherapy and in combination
           with other anti-tumor drug.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of SAR408701 and its metabolites, and
           TAS-102 components (trifluridine and tipiracil).

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PDy) effect of SAR408701 on levels of circulating
           carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5).

        -  To assess preliminary efficacy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor
           (RECIST) 1.1 criteria and other indicators of antitumor activity.

        -  To assess the potential immunogenicity of SAR408701.

      The study duration per participant will include a period to assess eligibility (screening
      period) of up to approximately 4 weeks (28 days), a treatment period and an End-of-Treatment
      (EOT) visit around 30 days after the last administration of IMP, and at least one follow-up
      (FU) visit after the EOT visit.

             partners of childbearing potential who do not agree to use accepted and effective
             method of contraception during the study treatment period and for 6 months following
             discontinuation of IMP.

          -  Significant concomitant illnesses, including all severe medical conditions which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, would impair the patient's participation
             in the study or interpretation of the results.

          -  Prior therapy targeting CEACAM5.

          -  Prior maytansinoid treatments (maytansinoid derivative 1 [DM1] or maytansinoid
             derivative 4 [DM4] antibody drug conjugates).

          -  Previous history and or unresolved corneal disorders.

          -  Medical conditions requiring concomitant administration of medications with narrow
             therapeutic window, metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) and for which a dose
             reduction cannot be considered.

          -  Medical conditions requiring concomitant administration of strong CYP3A inhibitor,
             unless it can be discontinued at least 2 weeks before first administration of
             SAR408701.

          -  For participants to the Combination part only: Prior TAS-102 treatment.
