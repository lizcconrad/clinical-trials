    <description>neurological disease are dementia (Alzheimers disease or other dementia), Parkinson's syndrome and stroke. Diagnosis of dementia was carried out in several ways: after examination by a neurologist or geriatrician, when the Mini Mental State was less than or equal to 17 or in the presence of a demonstrated and clinically evident dementia.</description>
