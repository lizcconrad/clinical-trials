  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to compare the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT)
      versus neuromuscular training (TR) in reducing pain in women with patellofemoral pain (PFP).
      Women with PFP will be randomly divided into two therapeutic groups: ESWT and TR. The ESWT
      group will undergo extracorporeal shock wave therapy to the iliotibial band and tensor fascia
      latae. The TR group will be treated with neuromuscular training. The women's gait will be
      analysed and the strength of hip abductors and internal rotators will be measured.
      Additionally, the women's pain and health status will be assessed with the visual analogue
      scale and the Lysholm Scale. Outcomes will be registered at baseline, and then at five weeks
      and at three months post-therapy

    <description>The women walk on the treadmill barefoot for three minutes in order to become accustomed to the speed belt. After that time, the angles of the joints are measured for 30 seconds. Internal rotation is demarcated at the highest peak in midstance when the contralateral limb is in the terminal stance (toe-off phase). Hip adduction is determined at the highest peak in midstance</description>

    <description>Each session lasted 30 minutes and consisted of three sets of exercises with 20-30 repetitions. Emphasis is placed on proper knee alignment during exercise. Most of the women exhibit excessive medial rotation and adduction of the femur, resulting in knee valgus. The women will be instructed how to correct their abnormalities using mirrors as visual feedback. All exercises will be completed without pain. If the exercises are too easy, the level of difficulty will be increased individually in accordance with the rehabilitation protocol</description>
