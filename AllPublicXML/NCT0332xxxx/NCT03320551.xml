    <textblock>
      An ongoing Nutrition and Education Immersion program is currently ongoing that is supported
      by Whole Foods, Inc. for their employees. Eighty employees have previously agreed to attend a
      one week nutrition education and immersion program October 14-21, 2017. This program will
      involve nutrition education seminars, exercise and support classes that they are scheduled to
      attend. All meals are provided. They will all be 100% plant based with low oil. All employees
      will complete a dietary survey at the beginning of the study. Clinical parameters will be
      tested at start and end of the program. The majority of the lectures are CME certified by
      Rush University.

      All participants will be approached for participation on day one to allow for the collection
      of the data being obtained as part of the existing project. In addition to the data from the
      program, this project will include a lab draw for nutritional markers at baseline and at the
      end of the immersion program, a dietary survey, SF-36, and DASI at baseline. Participants
      will be contacted by phone at months 3 and 6 and will be asked to complete the dietary
      survey, SF-36, and DASI. In addition, self-reported weight will be collected, and occurrence
      of health events (hospitalizations, new diagnoses). This will end their participation.
