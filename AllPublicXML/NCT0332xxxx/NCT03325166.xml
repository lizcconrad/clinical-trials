      This pilot phase II trial study evaluates the usefulness of the ferumoxytol steady state
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique for response assessment after pembrolizumab and
      radiation therapy in non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain (brain
      metastases). The interactions of monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab, and the body's
      immune system may result in an anti-tumor effect. However, it may also increase inflammation
      around the tumor which cannot be differentiated from true tumor growth on standard MRI. This
      study evaluates ferumoxytol as an MRI contrast agent to differentiate this treatment related
      inflammation from true tumor growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV)
      measured by steady state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ferumoxytol in predicting true
      vs pseudoprogression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab
      in subjects with brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab when given with SRS in subjects with
      brain metastasis.

      II. Evaluate progression free survival, overall survival, best response in brain disease,
      best response in systemic disease, and duration of best responses of brain and systematic
      diseases.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the immune response as determined by the volume, pattern and intensity of delayed
      (24 hour [hr]) ferumoxytol uptake between subjects who develop true vs pseudoprogression.

      II. Investigate the serum immunological parameters and correlate clinical as well as
      radiological response with systemic immune response to pembrolizumab as measured by
      immunological panel.

      III. Compare the changes percentage expression in PDL-1 in the biopsy tissue before and after
      therapy at the time of progression.

      IV. In subjects with measurable systemic lesions, investigate the feasibility of measuring
      vascular volume fraction (VVF), vessel size index (VSI) and vessel density index (VDI) as
      surrogate for response (true versus [vs.] pseudoprogression, as measured with Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (or up to 32 courses) in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ferumoxytol IV and undergo MRI at baseline,
      12 weeks after radiation, at suspected radiographic progression, and 6 weeks after suspected
      radiographic progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for
      up to 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.
