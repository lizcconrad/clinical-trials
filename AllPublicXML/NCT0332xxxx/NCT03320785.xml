  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Circulating markers to diagnose complications (sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis) in preterm
      infants are often inaccurate, partly due to the lack of comprehensive studies with temporal
      evaluation from birth until a disease onset. The investigators plan to collect weekly blood
      samples of preterm infants from birth until 4 weeks of age to comprehensively characterize
      differential protein and epigenetic markers in infants with and without complications
      (sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, chorioamnionitis).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm infants (10% incidence worldwide), especially those who do not receive sufficient
      mother's own milk, are susceptible to infectious diseases including sepsis and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Infants with history of prenatal inflammation including chorioamnionitis may
      be at higher risks of acquiring these infectious diseases. Limited knowledge is available
      regarding a comprehensive temporal profile of circulating markers in preterm infants from
      birth to disease onset. This current study aims to provide a comprehensive temporal profile
      of circulating markers, via -omic techniques (proteomics and/or epigenetics), during the
      first 4 weeks of life in preterm infants with various systemic complications. Thus, this will
      elucidate a profile of early markers consistently associated with pathological conditions in
      the whole study period. Depending on the outcome, a subsequent study for validation may be
      performed.

      Primary objective: To characterize circulating markers associated with the early life
      complications including chorioamnionitis, LOS and NEC in preterm infants during the first
      four weeks of life.

      Secondary objective: To characterize how different feeding regimes and diets may affect these
      markers during the first four weeks of life in preterm infants

        The study recruits very preterm infants (&lt; 32 weeks of gestation) at the Department of
        Neonatology, Bao'An maternal and Child Health Hospital right after birth after screening
        inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information about maternal conditions (premature rupture
        of membranes or chorioamnionitis) and birth are collected but are not determining factor to
        recruit.
