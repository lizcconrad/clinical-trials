    <textblock>
      This repository is a multi-center, outcomes study designed to retrospectively collect data on
      the demographics, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, cost of associated care, quality of
      life, and outcomes of subjects utilizing Caris Molecular Intelligence® (CMI) Services for the
      treatment of cancer. Prior to enrolling a subject, the subject's physician will have made the
      independent decision whether or not to utilize the drug associations provided by CMI and made
      clinical treatment choices as appropriate. Thus, data captured and reported provides a &quot;real
      world&quot; perspective on diagnosis, treatment, cost, and outcomes.

      world&quot; perspective on diagnosis, treatment, cost, and outcomes.

      Patients who have had CMI testing prior to the initial IRB submission date of November 11,
      2016 for the respective site would be eligible to have their treatment and treatment response
      data entered into the study Database. All entered data would be de-identified. The patient's
      CMI biomarker results and treatment response data will be coupled together in order to allow
      the investigation of research questions concerning biomarker status and treatment response.
