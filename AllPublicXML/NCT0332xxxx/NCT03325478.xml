  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: For 40 years, brief contact interventions (BCIs) have been presented as promising
      approaches in suicide prevention but patient's experiences of BCIs are less investigated.

      Aim: Understand mechanisms of BCIs after suicide attempt, through patient's experience of a
      French BCI &quot;Stay in contact&quot; and assess its impact on seeking care during suicidal crisis.

      Method:This is a single-center, non-interventional, prospective qualitative study using phone
      call interview on a BCI, 6 months after suicide attempt behavior.

      Statistical analysis

      Data were analyzed using statistical software (Version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North
      Carolina, USA). Chi-squared test was used to assess qualitative variables and t-test to
      evaluate quantitative variables, with p&lt;.05 considered significant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The baseline interviews were conducted on the phone, on weekdays, during a mean time of 10 to
      15minutes by a trained resident in psychiatry as the only interviewer. The interviewer didn't
      participate in patient's medical care nor in the follow-up interventions. The interviewer
      didn't look in patients file before conducted over the phone interviews and had only
      administrative information on the study subjects: first and last name, age, sex, phone
      number. The phone call interview wasn't considered as an intervention. Whenever the
      interviewer judged necessary that a patient needed more intensive treatment, the relevant
      referral to help was done.

    <description>This study used phone call interviews on a BCI &quot;Stay in Contact&quot;, 6 months after suicide attempt behavior.The questionnaire used for the interview of included suicide attempters was pilot tested to assess acceptability and feasibility of the study. It included 24 questions, which were based on literature's data.They covered seeking care and help items and assess the subjective quality appreciation of medical care in the PED and on the BCI.Closed-ended and multiple-choice questions were mixed. Included patients were informed that the questionnaire was anonymous and that seeking their views and feedbacks would help adjusting the implementation of follow-up interventions closer to their needs.The baseline interviews were conducted on the phone, on weekdays, during a mean time of 10 to 15minutes by a trained resident in psychiatry as the only interviewer.</description>
