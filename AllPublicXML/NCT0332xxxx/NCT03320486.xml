  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that dapaconazole cream 2% (experimental
      drug) is non-inferior to ketoconazole cream 2% (Nizoral® - active comparator) for the
      treatment of dermatological lesions of Tinea pedis, when applied to the skin (topically) once
      daily during 28 days. Additionally, the safety and tolerability aspects will be evaluated in
      a descriptive way, through the observation of the incidence of adverse events.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (allocation of
      treatment), balanced, controlled (active comparator) trial, with two parallel groups in a 1:1
      proportion.

      Randomization will depend on inclusion/exclusion criteria, taking into account the
      confirmation of diagnosis by the direct mycological test performed during the screening
      phase. However, cases whose diagnosis is not additionally confirmed by positive fungal
      culture (sampled during the screening phase) will be excluded from the efficacy analysis.

      Participants will show up to the clinic, for treatment, during 42 consecutive days, when one
      of the investigational products (according to the randomization) will be applied by a blind
      member of the study staff. A non-blind member of the study staff will weigh the corresponding
      investigational product and pass on to the blind member only a spatula with the weighed
      product, in order to maintain the blinded aspect of the trial.

      For exploratory purposes, clinical and mycological evaluations will also be performed after 7
      and after 14 days of treatment.

      Safety analysis will be performed considering all the randomized patients to which at least
      one dose of the investigational products has been applied, regardless of the result of the
      fungal culture.

      Conclusion of non-inferiority will be based on the per protocol set. It will be deemed as per
      protocol those participants who do not miss more than 20% of the applications and, also, no
      more than four consecutive application days.

    <description>Proportion of participants, in each treatment group, who achieved therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical cure and mycological cure, on the assessment performed after 28 days of treatment.
Clinical cure is defined as a score ≤ 2 for the sum of scores attributed to each sign or symptom (erythema, maceration/peeling, fissuring/cracking, itching and burning) as evaluated by a four-point categorical scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).
Mycological cure is defined as negative result for the direct mycological examination (potassium hydroxide [KOH] test) and a negative fungal culture.</description>
