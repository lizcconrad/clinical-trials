  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CTC-STOP is a multicentre prospective randomised controlled phase III trial for metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.

      This study will determine if serial CTC counts can be used as early markers of progression to
      direct early discontinuation of docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC without
      adversely impacting overall survival, when compared with standard approaches to guide
      treatment switch decisions.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer will be randomised 1:1 to
      either control group (standard of care) or intervention group (CTC-guided treatment). All
      patients will commence first line chemotherapy with docetaxel three-weekly and will receive a
      minimum of 3 cycles of treatment before any recommendation to discontinue first-line
      docetaxel.

        -  Control Group (standard of care): patients will receive first line docetaxel until
           disease progression according to treating clinician or completion of 10 cycles. Patients
           and treating clinicians will not be disclosed to the results of CTC determinations.

        -  Intervention Group (CTC guided treatment): patients will receive first line docetaxel
           until progression by CTC, and/or disease progression according to treating clinician or
           completion of 10 cycles. CTC results will be available to the treating clinician to
           guide decision-making. A progressing CTC count on Day 1 will require confirmation with a
           second CTC count performed on Day 15 (-/+ 5 days) of that cycle. If a patient is found
           to have two successive CTC determinations showing progression by CTCs, the clinician
           will receive a recommendation to discontinue docetaxel on the following cycle.

      The reasons of the treating clinician to discontinue docetaxel will be reported in both
      groups. Patients who discontinue first line docetaxel according to the criteria for each
      group will be switched to second line chemotherapy with cabazitaxel. After progression on
      cabazitaxel or completion of 10 cycles, patients will be followed up for survival every three
      months until end of study.

         10. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1 (see Appendix
             A2).

         11. At least 3 weeks should have elapsed since stopping any investigational agent at the
             time of randomisation. More than 4 weeks since completion of radiotherapy, other than

         14. Participants must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception
             during the period of the therapy and for 12 months after the last dose of study
             treatment. Effective contraception is defined as double barrier contraception (e.g.
             condom plus spermicide in combination with a female condom, diaphragm, cervical cap or
             intrauterine device).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Received any prior cytotoxic chemotherapy as treatment for castration-resistant
             prostate cancer. Patients that have received chemotherapy for hormone-sensitive
             metastatic prostate cancer will be allowed onto the trial, if the patient merits
             retreatment with docetaxel and at least 12 months has elapsed since the patient has
             completed that previous docetaxel therapy.

          2. Measurable soft tissue or lymph node metastases or any metastatic disease outside the
             bone that is RECIST measurable will be an exclusion (unless it is pelvic nodal disease
             &lt;1.5cm in short axis). Bone metastases with associated soft tissue components will
             also not be an exclusion.

          3. Received any cycling, intermittent or continuous hormonal treatment 28 days prior to
             randomisation with the exception of the continuous LHRH analogues.

             or untreated. Brain imaging for asymptomatic patients is not required.

             patient is successfully treated the patient will be considered eligible for the
             study).

          6. Active second malignancy (except non-melanoma skin or superficial bladder cancer)
             defined as requiring anticancer therapy or within the previous two years.

          7. Serious medical conditions such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, pulmonary
             thromboembolism within 12 months; stroke or treatment of a major active infection
             within 3 months of randomisation, as well as any significant medical illness that in
             the opinion of the Investigator would preclude protocol therapy.

          8. Planned concomitant participation in another clinical trial of an experimental agent,
             vaccine, or device. Concomitant participation in observational studies is acceptable.

          9. Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to any of its excipients (including
