  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure is a progressive disorder that begins after an insult to the heart muscle
      resulting in the loss of functional cardiomyocytes, or even compromising the ability of the
      myocardium to contract and/or relax normally. A common finding in heart failure is exercise
      intolerance that generates a vicious cycle, in which the individual starts to limit his
      activities even further due to progressive fatigue. Studies demonstrate that regular physical
      exercise can increase the aerobic capacity of these individuals, delay the anaerobic
      threshold, and reestablish the sympathovagal balance. Paradoxically, many of these patients
      assume an even more sedentary lifestyle, which leads to a greater physical limitation and the
      progression of symptoms. Patients with HF present a 30% reduction in their ability to perform
      their daily life activities when compared to healthy individuals, and this has also been
      attributed to reduced muscle mass, as well as lower aerobic capacity. In this sense, strength
      training increases the torque and muscular endurance, capacity and functional independence,
      as well as the quality of life, reducing the morbidity of individuals with and without
      cardiovascular disease, with a lower overload to the cardiorespiratory system. It is known,
      however, that daily life activities require a combination of resistance and muscle strength.
      Aerobic training does not improve muscle strength, just as traditional strength training does
      not ideally represent the movements performed during daily life activities, since it does not
      include exercises on unstable surfaces and exercises on different axes. Functional training
      emerges as a simple and low cost alternative for the treatment of patients with heart
      failure. This method consists of integrated movements of the body, in several axes, involving
      joint acceleration and deceleration, stabilization, strength and neuromuscular efficiency. It
      aims to improve the functional capacity of the individual using exercises that relate to
      their specific physical activity, transferring their gains effectively to their daily lives.
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of functional training on
      cardiopulmonary capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure, comparing it to
      strength training.

      Individuals with cardiac heart failure, in functional class II and III (according to the New
      York Heart Association), residents of the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, of both
      genders and aged ≥ 18 years, will be recruited from the Outpatient Clinical of Heart Failure
      of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto Alegre, RS/ Brazil. At the end of the initial
      evaluations of each participant, they will be randomly allocated in one of two groups:
      functional training group (FTG) and strength training group (STG). After the consent of the
      participants, the author of the research will start collecting the data, by completing an
      anamnesis form. The following evaluations will be performed before the start of the study and
      immediately after the end of the research, by prior appointment: cardiopulmonary capacity,
      quality of life, functionality, palmar grip strength, maximum inspiratory pressure,
      endothelial function and lean body mass. Both groups will perform the exercise training three
      times per week, during 13 weeks, totaling 39 sections.

    <description>Quality of life assessed by the Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire. It is composed of 21 questions about limitations that are often associated with how heart failure interferes with patients' quality of life. The patient should consider the last month to answer the questions. The scale of responses for each question varies from 0 (zero) to 5, where 0 represents without limitations and 5, maximum limitation. These questions involve a physical dimension (from 1 to 7, 12 and 13 questions) that are highly interrelated with dyspnea and fatigue, an emotional dimension (17 to 21 questions) and other issues (8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15 and 16 questions) which, added to the previous dimensions, form the total score. The scale totals 105 points. Higher values indicate maximum limitation and poorer quality of life.</description>
