  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of maternal death worldwide. Tranexamic acid has been
      shown to reduce rates of hemorrhage when given prophylactically prior to cesarean delivery.
      It has also been shown to be an effective treatment in response to hemorrhage after a vaginal
      delivery. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of TXA on hemorrhage rates when given
      prophylactically prior to all deliveries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhage remains the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. In a 2014 systematic
      analysis of the causes of maternal death, the World Health Organization (WHO) noted that even
      in the face of interventions developed to actively manage the third stage of labor, 27.1% of
      maternal deaths were directly attributable to excessive blood loss.

      Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) have been identified, but the majority of cases
      occur in low risk women. As such, the routine use of oxytocin in the third stage of labor is
      recommended in all women and has been well documented to reduce the risk of excessive blood
      loss. Uterotonics such as methylergonovine, 15-methyl PGF2Î± and misoprostol have shown to be
      particularly useful adjuncts as decreased uterine tone is the most common etiology of blood
      loss. More recently, tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to be efficacious in the prevention
      of postpartum hemorrhage in certain cohorts.

      Tranexamic acid exerts its effect through the binding of plasmin and subsequent inhibition of
      fibrin degradation. It is regarded as pregnancy category B by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).
