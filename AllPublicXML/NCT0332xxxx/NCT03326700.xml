  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, there are several studies that compare Laparoscopic totally
      extraperitoneal hernia repair (TEP) with Lichtenstein hernia (LH) repair. There are no
      studies that compare sexual functions on men's health and quality of life. Our aim was to
      study the sexual functions of men, who underwent TEP or LH repair according to Health Survey
      Scoring Demonstration (SF36) and The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).

      176 men with unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized into two groups. Group T (n=88)
      underwent TEP and Group L(n:88) underwent LH repair. Patients demografigs, perioperative
      findings were recorded. For all patients preoperative, postoperative 7th,30th and 90th day SF
      36 and IIEF were filled up.

    <description>Inguinal hernia repair is surgery to repair a hernia in the groin. A hernia is tissue that bulges out of a weak spot in the abdominal wall. The intestine may bulge out through this weakened area. During surgery to repair the hernia, the bulging tissue is pushed back in. The abdominal wall is strengthened and supported with sutures (stitches), and sometimes mesh. This repair can be done with open or laparoscopic surgery.</description>
