  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be designed as a prospective surveillance of the immune response to seasonal
      influenza vaccination in 240 healthy children and adults ages 9 and over. Study duration will
      be 5 years, with a participant duration of 6 months. Subjects will receive Fluarix (GSK)
      quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, at a dose of not less than 15 ug of hemagglutinin
      (HA), by intramuscular injection in open label fashion on day 0. Blood draws will occur at
      baseline, day 7, 28 and 90. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the
      relationship between first influenza A virus exposure (inferred by age), vaccine history, and
      baseline serum antibody and Memory B cell (MBC) specificity, and the magnitude and breadth of
      the subsequent B cell response to seasonal influenza vaccine in healthy adults and children.

      The study will be designed as a prospective surveillance of the immune response to seasonal
      influenza vaccination in 240 healthy children and adults ages 9 and over. Study duration will
      be 5 years, with a participant duration of 6 months. Subjects will receive Fluarix (GSK)
      quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, at a dose of not less than 15 ug of hemagglutinin
      (HA), by intramuscular injection in open label fashion on day 0. Blood draws will occur at
      baseline, day 7, 28 and 90. The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that there
      will be differences in the specificity and magnitude of the HA-specific B cell response
      depending on the age, previous vaccine history and baseline B cell reactivity. The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between first influenza A virus
      exposure (inferred by age), vaccine history, and baseline serum antibody and Memory B cell
      (MBC) specificity, and the magnitude and breadth of the subsequent B cell response to
      seasonal influenza vaccine in healthy adults and children. The secondary objective is to
      determine the durability of the antibody response and relationship between acute and durable
      antibody.
