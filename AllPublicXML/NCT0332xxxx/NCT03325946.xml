  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VTCRI Neuromotor Research Clinic was established and opened in May of 2013 to provide
      intensive therapeutic services to individuals with motor impairment secondary to neuromotor
      disorders. It is direct by Dr. Stephanie DeLuca and based on the principles surrounding
      ACQUIREc Therapy.

      ACQUIREc Therapy is an evidenced-based approach to pediatric constraint-induced movement
      therapy, which refers to a multi-component form of therapy that is focused on helping
      children who have asymmetric motor abilities between the two sides of the body. Historically,
      ACQUIREc Therapy has the unimpaired or less impaired upper extremity constrained (by a cast
      or a splint) while also receiving active therapy from a specially trained therapist who
      shapes new skills and functional activities with the child's more impaired upper extremity
      but who is also a licensed Occupational or Physical Therapist (OT/PT). Therapy dosages are
      high much higher than tradition OT or PT - often lasting many hours per day, up to 6 hours a
      day, 5 days a week, for 2-4 weeks.

      Investigators have developed further treatments based on the same principles of intensive
      services combined with behavior shaping for other areas of the body that are also affected by
      weakness (e.g., the leg and trunk) also, but which usually do not involve constraint. These
      have been more generally labeled ACQUIRE Therapy.

      All forms involve intensive, play-based therapy for children with asymmetric motor
      impairments of the arms and hands. The primary focus of treatment is to facilitate the
      acquisition of new motor skills in the child's weaker body parts through high levels of
      intensive therapy using scientifically-based behavioral guidelines. Therapy is also delivered
      in naturalistic environments.

      ACQUIREc Therapy as a treatment method has been tested in two randomized controlled trials,
      and a specific manual for its implementation has been developed. Dr. (s) Ramey and DeLuca
      previously founded a similar clinic, The Pediatric Neuromotor Research Clinic, at the
      University of Alabama at Birmingham where Dr. DeLuca directed the research clinic for 13
      years and oversaw the implementation of the ACQUIREc Therapy treatment protocol in more than
      400 cases.

      This research will involve analyzing and interpreting the clinical data of children going
      through clinical procedures at the VTCRI Neuromotor Research Clinic. All participation is
      voluntary and no children will denied services if families choose not to participate.
