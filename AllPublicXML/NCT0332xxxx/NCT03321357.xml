  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The five-repetition sit-to-stand test has been validated and is used primarily in pulmonary
      medicine and cardiology, and has recently been shown to be a useful tool for the objective
      assessment of functional impairment in patients with degenerative diseases of the lumbar
      spine.

      The goal of this study is to assess the possibility of supervised and unsupervised
      at-home-assessment. Validation of at-home-assessment would allow the 5R-STS to be easily used
      as a follow-up tool in clinical trials, for example.

      Patients will perform three 5R-STS measurements:

        1. During outpatient clinics, time measured by the physician

        2. At home, time measured by partner/family

        3. At home, and assessed by producing a video recording of the 5R-STS performance that is
           subsequently sent and analyzed (time measured digitally)

    <description>An armless chair with a hard seat was stabilised by placing it against a wall. Seated participants were asked to come forward on the chair seat until the feet were flat on the floor and to fold their upper limbs across the chest. Participants were then instructed to stand up all the way and sit down once without using the upper limbs. For those unable to complete the initial manoeuvre or who required assistance, the test was terminated. If successful on the initial sit to stand, participants were then asked to stand up all the way and sit down landing firmly, as fast as possible, five times without using the arms. Timing with a stopwatch was started on the command 'go' and stopped at the end of the completed fifth stand; the time taken was recorded as the participant's score.
