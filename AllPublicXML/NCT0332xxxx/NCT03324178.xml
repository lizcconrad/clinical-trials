  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficulty to sustain attention over a prolonged period of time is one of the core
      difficulties experienced by people who have undergone traumatic brain injury. Rehabilitation
      of attention is often based on compensatory strategies, because of the limited impact of
      cognitive training on improving attentional capacity after brain injury. New therapeutic
      approaches to explore the plastic recovery of the brain after injury, and consequent
      performance improvement, are warranted.

      Neurofeedback (NFB) allows the self-regulation of brain activity using visual feedback. Very
      recently, it has been demonstrated that NFB training targeted at reducing alpha power (alpha
      desynchronization NFB), can induce initial plastic changes in brain networks associated with
      attention. It has been proposed that NFB can improve cognitive performance by tuning
      oscillatory activity of the brain towards a more healthy balance between neural network
      flexibility and stability. It is speculated that the use of alpha desynchronization NFB
      training, with people who present with brain injury, can enhance sustained attention in as
      much as the training promotes neural variability during resting state (i.e. more flexible
      network configuration) and neural stability during a sustained attention task (i.e. more
      stable network configuration).

      However, before assessing the effectiveness of the intervention, it is necessary to evaluate
      the feasibility and acceptability thereof. This study will recruit 14 participants and
      randomly assign them to two groups: a NFB group and a video games control group. Long-term
      changes will be evaluated at two time points for both groups: baseline and post-intervention.
      The NFB group will have a follow-up session one week after the intervention, to evaluate
      whether there are long lasting changes after NFB training. In addition, short-term changes of
      NFB will be evaluated for the experimental group, contrasting EEG activity immediately before
      and after the last NFB session.

      Participants taking part in the neurofeedback group will undertake sixteen 30-minute sessions
      of neurofeedback training, from Tuesday to Friday, distributed over the course of four weeks.
      Sessions will be performed at the same time each day. Each 30-min NFB session will consist of
      7 x 3-minute blocks of training flanked by a 3-minute resting state block with eyes-open.
      During the training blocks participants will seat in front of a laptop screen displaying an
      image that will change according the brain activity produced by the participant. One
      electrode will be located at the centro parietal region of the scalp (Pz) and another one in
      the earlobe as a reference. Participants taking part in the control group will play video
      games for 30 minutes during the same number of sessions, also distributed across four weeks.
      The same experimental set-up will be used, but EEG activity will not be recorded.
      Participants will follow the same structure as the NFB group, playing video games during 7 x
      3-minute blocks flanked by a 3-minute seated relaxation.

      Each participant will be involved in the study for a maximum of 5 weeks. The NFB training and
      control sessions for all participants are expected to be completed over the course of five
      months.

    <description>Change in score on Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)
Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), (Brown et al. 2003). It is a 15-item questionnaire that assesses day-to-day experiences of mind wandering.
Each of the 15 questions is rated with a number between 1 to 6, with 1 being &quot;almost always&quot; and 6 being &quot;almost never&quot;. The total score is calculated by averaging the answers across the 15 items. The minimum score is 1 and the maximum score is 6. The questionnaire does not have subscales.
Higher scores reflect higher levels of mindfulness, this is considered to be a better outcome. Instead, lower scores reflect higher levels of mind wandering, this is considered to be a worst outcome.
No subscales are combined.</description>

    <description>Change in score on Continuous Temporal Expectancy Task (CTET)
Continuous Temporal Expectancy Task (CTET), (O'Connell 2009). It is a computerized task to evaluate sustained attention.
Participants monitor a stream of stimuli to detect a low frequent target. They will be presented with 200 target trials in average, which corresponds approximately to the 10% of the total stimuli presented. 100% of target detection is the highest possible score.
Higher percentage of target detection reflects better sustained attention capacity and it is considered to be a better outcome.
No subscales are combined.</description>

    <description>Change in score on Test of Everyday Attention (TEA)
1. Test of Every Day Attention (TEA), (Robertson et al. 1996). It is a clinical assessment of attention. In this study, only three subtests will be used that evaluate sustained attention: (1) elevator counting, (2) telephone search while counting and (3) lottery 2a. Scale range for the subtest Elevator Counting: 0 - 7. 2b. Scale Range for the subtest Telephone Search while counting: -1.0 - 17.0 (raw score).
2c. Scale Range for the subtest Lottery: 0 - 10 (raw score) 3a. Elevator Counting: A score of 7 (maximum) is considered normal. 5 or less is considered definitely abnormal.
3b. Telephone Search while counting: lower raw scores are considered better output 3c. Lottery: higher raw scores are considered better output. 4. The subscales will not be combined</description>
