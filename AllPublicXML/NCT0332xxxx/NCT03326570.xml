    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is learn about side effects and the success of
      bronchoscopies when performed in cancer patients with and without symptoms.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 110 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, researchers will collect information from
      participant's medical records.

      Length of Study:

      Researchers will continue to collect participant's medical information for up to 2 years.

      Additional Information:

      Participant's data will be kept in a database on a password-protected computer in a secure
      office. This information will only be available to the study doctors and staff.
