  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are rare inflammatory systemic conditions. Reduced muscle
      function is a cardinal symptom and lung involvement is very common. Knowledge of heart
      involvement in these patients is very limited, as is knowledge of exercise effects in recent
      onset, active disease.

      The aim of this project is to investigate effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
      compared to standard low-intensity home exercise as to tolerance, physical capacity, quality
      of life, depression, disease activity, inflammation, muscle mass/fat mass, muscle metabolism
      and heart function in patients with recent onset, active polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

      This is a randomized controlled trial. Muscle biopsies are taken at time of diagnosis and
      after 12 weeks of exercise. Muscle biopsies will be analyzed as to baseline kynurenine
      pathway, calcium release, gene expression and inflammatory infiltrates and as to changes in
      these parameters following exercise. Muscle function (primary outcome), maximal oxygen
      uptake, muscle mass/fat mass, disease activity, systolic and diastolic heart function, as
      well as quality of life and depression is measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of
      exercise. After all assessments, patients are randomized to HIIT or standard low-intensity
      home exercise.

      The HIIT group will perform 6 sets of 30-60 second biking bouts reaching 85-100% of maximal
      heart rate, in combination with strength training, three days a week for 12 weeks. The
      control group will perform a standardized home exercise program five days a week for 12
      weeks. After 12 weeks, all assessments are preformed again. If the HIIT is well tolerated,
      patients in the control group will be invited to HIIT exercise according to the same
      protocol. Clinical assessments will be performed at 3, 6 and 9 months follow-up in an open
      extension.

      This study will improve our understanding of heart function, muscle metabolism as well as
      tolerance and effects of intensive exercise as well as heart function early in the disease
      course and could also improve treatment and prognosis in patients with polymyositis and
      dermatomyositis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the HIIT protocol will train three days a week for 12 weeks. Before
      exercise start participants will rate self-reported pain and fatigue on a visual analogue
      scale and describe in own words information about possible changes in medication dose, any
      side effects from medication as well as possible negative and positive effects from previous
      exercise sessions, as well as physical activities performed since the previous exercise
      session. Each exercise session starts with a 5-minut warm-up on about 50% of maximal heart
      rate. Each HIIT set is between 30-60 seconds where loads are increased and the participant
      bikes as fast as possible with the goal of reaching &gt;85% of maximal heart rate. During the
      2-minuts rest in-between HIIT sets the participant will rate self-reported exertion using the
      Borg CR-10, 0-10 scale and the Borg RPE scale, 6-20.

      When initiating the exercise period, participants start on three HIIT sets on a lower
      intensity, gradually increasing to goal intensity during the first two weeks. Then the number
      of sets are gradually increased to six sets.

      After completing six HIIT sets the participants perform one set of 10 voluntary repetitions
      maximum (VRM) resistance training of the deltoids using free weights and of the quadriceps
      using free weights or a quadriceps curl machine, depending on degree of muscle weakness.
      Every other week a new 10 VRM is tested and training loads are adapted. After completing each
      set, the participant rates perceived muscle exertion on the Borg CR-10 scale. The program is
      ended with stretching of trained muscle groups and rating of overall exertion during the
      exercise session on the Borg RPE-scale.

      Participants randomized to the control group will perform a standardized home exercise
      program on an easy-to moderate intensity adapted to initial muscle weakness, five days a week
      for 12 weeks. The program includes tasks for muscle groups targeted by myositis and takes
      about 15 minutes to perform. In combination with the home exercise program the participants
      walks 15 minutes on 60% of maximal heart rate. Participants fill out an exercise diary
      commenting on loads and number of repetitions for each task.

      Participants in both groups ware a Polar 330A heart rate monitor during each training
      session. By synchronizing to a computer program all exercise data are stored in a cloud data
      base and can be monitored regularly by the project investigator.

    <description>A myositis-specific protocol in Biodex systems is used. After completing measures of MVIC, the subjects perform six sets of 12, 4-second contractions with a 6-second rest in-between. Set 1: 12 contractions on 20% of MVIC. For each set, intensity is increased by 10%. In the last, 6th set contractions are performed on 70% of MVIC. After each set, a new MVIC is tested. The MDAAT is a valid core set of measures to assess disease activity including physician's and patient's global assessment, measures of muscle strength, activity limitation and extra-muscular organ activity. Physician's global assessment is performed in a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), 0-100.</description>
