    <textblock>
      For Non-dialysis subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, demonstrate
      non-inferiority of MT-6548 compared to darbepoetin alfa using Hb value and evaluate long-term
      safety of MT-6548.

      For subjects not currently receiving ESAs, evaluate Hb correction and maintenance effect of
      MT-6548 and for subjects currently receiving ESAs, evaluate Hb conversion and maintenance
      effect of MT-6548
