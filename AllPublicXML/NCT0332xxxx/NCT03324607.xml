  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the new inhaler, Bevespi improves lung
      function. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using inhaled hyperpolarized 129Xe gas, that can
      provide useful images of the functioning of the lung will be used as a new measure to
      determine change in function. The investigator anticipate these images will provide more
      specific information about lung disease than standard lung function tests in response to
      treatment.

    <description>There will be MRI imaging before the treatment with Bevespi and another one 2 weeks after use Bevespi. Images obtained using 129Xe MRI will be compared with standard lung function tests that are used routinely in the clinic, 6 minute walk test that assesses walking ability and several questionnaires that assess shortness of breath and life quality.</description>
