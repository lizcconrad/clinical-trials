    <textblock>
      This research study in infant males with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) will learn more about
      the effect of testosterone on early health and development. The study is a total of three
      visits over 6 months with assessments of motor skills, body composition (muscle and fat), and
      hormone levels. This is a randomized, placebo-controlled study but all infants will receive
      testosterone treatment during the study period. The investigators will learn how testosterone
      treatment in infancy effects short term outcome measures on health and development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      XXY (also known as Klinefelter syndrome) is the most common chromosomal abnormality in males,
      affecting 1/600 boys. The extra X chromosome leads to insufficient development of the
      testicles and subsequent testosterone deficiency. Males with XXY also have a high risk for
      developmental delays, learning disabilities, and cardiovascular disease. An essential
      question is how much of this risk is because of testosterone deficiency and could therefore
      be reduced by testosterone supplementation, particularly during critical periods of
      development.

      In typical male development, there is a surge of testosterone in the first few months of
      life, commonly known as the &quot;mini-puberty period of infancy.&quot; This testosterone surge may be
      critical for neurodevelopmental and cardiometabolic programming throughout life. Recently
      there has been increased off-label use of testosterone in infants with XXY, however neither
      the short or long term safety or efficacy have been evaluated. This study aims to quantify
      the short term effects of testosterone treatment in infants with XXY on neurodevelopment,
      growth, body composition, testicular function, and safety parameters. This is a double blind
      randomized placebo controlled trial of testosterone injections 25 mg every 4 weeks for 3
      doses in boys with XXY enrolled between 1 and 3 months of age. Outcomes including body fat
      percentage, scaled motor developmental scores, growth velocity, testicular hormone
      concentrations, specific metabolites, and safety parameters will be assessed 12 weeks into
      the study. The groups will then cross-over (all subjects will receive testosterone during the
      study period) and the outcomes will be reassessed 24 weeks into the study. The secondary
      questions the investigators will answer with this cross-over is 1) whether benefits in the
      treatment group at 12 weeks are sustained at 24 weeks, and 2) whether the same benefits are
      seen if treated after the mini-puberty period.

    <measure>Change in Gross Motor Scores on the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gross motor development will be assessed using the standardized Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2. The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 measures gross motor development using the subscale of the Gross Motor Quotient, which measures the ability to utilize the large muscle systems. High scores on this composite are made by children with well-developed gross motor abilities.</description>

    <measure>Change in Gross Motor Scores on the Alberta Infant Motor Scales</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gross motor development will be assessed using the standardized Alberta Infant Motor Scales (AIMS). The Alberta Infant Motor Scales is a performance-based and norm-referenced measure of infant gross motor maturation from birth to 18 months. The AIMS total score is calculated by summing the scores for the 58 items, with the score ranging between 0 and 58. Higher scores indicate more mature motor development. The infant's score can then be converted to a percentile and compared with age-equivalent peers from the normative sample.</description>

    <description>Fine motor development will be assessed using the standardized Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2. The Peabody Developmental Motor Scales 2 measures fine motor development using subscale of the Fine Motor Quotient, which measures a child's ability to use his or her hands and arms to grasp objects, stack blocks, draw figures, and manipulate objects. High scores on this composite are made by children with well-developed fine motor abilities.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition and language will be assessed by a trained administrator of developmental tests using the standardized Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III: cognitive and language domains. In each subscale, age-standardized scores are calculated using test norms. Developmental delay is determined by calculating how many standard deviations a child scores from the mean in that subscale. Typically, the more standard deviations below the mean, the more severe the delay.</description>
