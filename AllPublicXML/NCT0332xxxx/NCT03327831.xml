  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy is an effective treatment for actinic keratoses. In the United States
      topical aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is approved as a photosensitizing agent for this treatment,
      and it has traditionally been activated with the use of an in-office artificial light source.
      This clinical trial seeks to measure the safety and efficacy of using natural sunlight to
      activate the ALA.

    <description>This study has a single, open label treatment arm. Patients will have topical aminolevulinic acid applied to the actinic keratoses in the treatment area (face/scalp) and will spend 2 hours outdoors in the shade to activate the medication. The patient then follow up in clinic 3 months and 6 months after their treatment to have the number of actinic keratoses counted.</description>
