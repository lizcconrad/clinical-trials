    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore the feasibility of using loss-of-resistance technique for
      Quadratus Lumborum block (QLB). And to compare between the Ultrasound guided QLB type II and
      the loss-of-resistance technique for QLB as regards the degree and duration of analgesia and
      side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is an abdominal plane block with increasing popularity. QLB is
      achieved by local anesthetic infiltration at the anterolateral aspect of quadratus lumborum
      muscle (QLB-I), or at the posterior aspect of the muscle (QLB-II), or transmuscular (QL-TM
      block). Ultrasound-guided technique is the usual route used for QLB performance. QLB had been
      considered a modification of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block[4]. A cadaveric study
      had showed similar local anesthetic spread in both QL and TAP blocks.

      TAP block could be performed by using either the ultrasound or loss-of-resistance technique;
      whilst, QLB is only performed using the ultrasound and the feasibility of loss-of-resistance
      technique had not been investigated for this block.

      This study aims to explore the feasibility of using loss-of-resistance technique for QLB. And
      to compare between the Ultrasound guided QLB type II and the loss-of-resistance technique for
      QLB as regards the degree and duration of analgesia and side effects.

    <description>ŸêA blunted 22-G, 11 mm, short-bevel facet needle will be introduced in the paravertebral line at the level of L3 or L4, in 30-45 degree to the skin directing it laterally. Once the skin barrier is breached, the needle will be withdrawn back so that the tip lies just under the skin. The needle will be advanced through the posterior thoracolumbar fascia and a first fast &quot;pop&quot; sensation will be felt when the needle pierced it. With further advancement of the needle, a second deep pop will be felt after it pierces the middle thoracolumbar fascia. At this point, the needle will be in the plane of the quadratus lumborum block type II. After careful aspiration, the 30 mLs of local anaesthetic will be injected. The needle will be visualized by the ultrasound by another physician to ensure safety.</description>

    <intervention_name>Ultrasound-guided Quadratus lumborum block</intervention_name>
    <description>A broadband (5-8 MHz) convex transducer will be placed transversely in the abdominal flank above the iliac crest to identify the external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis muscles and aponeurosis. Then the external oblique muscle will be followed posteriorly until its posterior border is visualized (hook sign), and the posterior aspect of the Quadratus lumborum muscle is confirmed. A 22-G, 11-mm, short-bevel facet needle will be advanced under direct ultrasound visualization in-plane from anterolateral to postero-medial. Then the 30 ml of local anesthetic (bupivacaine 0.25 %) will be injected into the lumbar inter-facial triangle (LIFT) behind the quadratus lumborum muscle using hydro-dissection.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 2 mg of midazolam and 8 mg of dexamethasone IV; then, they will be transferred to the operating room to receive a standard general anesthetic. Perioperative monitoring will include ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide. Anesthesia will be induced by propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg, atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, and fentanyl 2 mcg/kg to facilitate the insertion of an endotracheal tube. Anesthesia will be maintained by isoflurane 1-2% end-tidal concentration to maintain systolic arterial blood pressure and heart rate within + 20% of the baseline values. Ventilation will be adjusted to maintain normocapnia.</description>
