  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish clinical evidence for introducing disulfiram and cooper
      as an active therapy for metastatic breast cancer upon failure of conventional systemic
      and/or locoregional therapies.

      Analyses of the following objectives will be performed in the population of patients with
      metastatic breast cancer:

      Primary efficacy objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of the treatment by assessment of:

        -  clinical response rate (RR)

        -  clinical benefit rate (CBR)

      Secondary efficacy objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of the treatment by assessment of:

        -  time to progression (TTP)

        -  overall survival (OS)

      Pharmacokinetic objectives:

      • to determine pharmacokinetic parameters for disulfiram and its active metabolites
      administered in combination with copper supplements in cancer patient population

      Safety objectives:

      • to describe safety profile of disulfiram administered in combination with copper
      supplements

      Exploratory objectives:

      Parallel analysis to assess (identify) potential candidate surrogate biomarkers of disulfiram
      efficacy, as well as identification (using proteomic, biochemical and molecular genetic
      studies) of potential predictive biomarkers of disulfiram sensitivity or resistance will be
      performed. Surrogate biomarker analysis will focus on in vivo ubiquitin-proteosomal system
      inhibition, cell cycle and DNA damage.
