  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the investigators' study is to evaluate the mucosa-elevating capacity and clinical
      safety of Sodium Alginate (SA) mixed with Calcium Lactate in assisting Endoscopic Submucosal
      Dissection/Endoscopic Mucosal Resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the mucosa-elevating capacity and clinical safety of Gut Guarding Gel
      (the Sodium Alginate (SA) mixed with Calcium Lactate) in assisting Endoscopic Submucosal
      Dissection/Endoscopic Mucosal Resection to treat early gastroenterological tumor and polyps.

      All participants in the study received Endoscopic submucosal dissection with Sodium Alginate
      mixed with Calcium Lactate prior to endoscopic resection.

      The product is used in Endoscopic submucosal dissection which is accomplished by steps listed
      as follows: lesion marking, submucosal injection, mucosal incision, submucosal dissection,
      then en-bloc resection. It's a new submucosal injection regimen, sodium alginate mixed with
      calcium lactate, which turned to calcium-alginate gel, we called it as &quot;Gut Guarding Gel&quot;.

      Determine the rates of the delayed bleeding/perforation, postpolypectomy electrocoagulation
      syndrome, and the late tissue injury.
