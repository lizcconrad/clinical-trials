      A. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate outcomes of aphakic eyes implanted with
      the IC-8 IOL following cataract removal in prior inlay patients after KAMRA inlay removal.

      B. The secondary purpose of the study is to determine whether there are any changes in
      biometry measurements before and after the inlay removal and how the changes affect the
      calculated IOL power.

      This will be a prospective study in which no more than 20 subjects will be implanted with
      IC-8 IOL following the removal of the KAMRA inlay. The refractive target of the IC-8 eye will
      be -0.75 D MRSE.

      Subjects will be screened for eligibility and consented before enrolled. Following
      enrollment, the inlay will be removed, and the eye will be monitored for corneal and
      refractive stability before the implantation of the IC-8 IOL. Corneal stability is defined as
      keratometry readings in each meridian within ± 0.50 D, and/or the stability of the corneal
      topography as determined by the principal investigator, over two consecutive visits at least
      two weeks apart. Refractive stability is defined as manifest refractive sphere and cylinder
      measurements that are each within ± 0.50 D over two consecutive visits at least two weeks
      apart, or based on investigator judgment. When corneal and refractive stability are achieved,
      the IC-8 IOL will be implanted following cataract extraction by phacoemulsification.

    <description>The AcuFocus IC-8 intraocular lens (IC-8 IOL) is a one-piece hydrophobic acrylic posterior chamber IOL into which a circular mask with a small 1.36 mm central aperture has been embedded. The IOL mask works by extending the depth of focus and its design is based on the KAMRA corneal inlay, which operates under the principle of small aperture optics.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        i. Subjects must sign and be given a copy of the informed consent form. ii. Subjects with
        BCDVA of 20/40 or worse, or significant visual symptoms/complaints as a result of cataract
        in the study eye.

        iii. Subjects must be &gt; 45 years of age at the time of screening. iv. Subjects must be
        willing and able to return for scheduled follow up examinations for 12 months after
        surgery.

        v. Subjects who underwent uneventful KAMRA inlay implantation and who currently still have
        the inlay in the eye.

        vi. Potential visual acuity following cataract removal and IOL implantation projected to be
        0.8 or better (Snellen 20/25) as determined by diagnostic testing or investigator's medical
        judgment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        i. Patients who had any type of intraocular surgery or refractive surgery (with the
        exception of KAMRA inlay implantation).

        ii. Requiring an intraocular lens outside the available power range of +15.5 to +27.5
        diopters.

        iii. Pharmacologically dilated pupil size less than 6 mm or the presence of any pupil
        abnormalities (aniridia, non-reactive, fixed, or abnormally shaped pupils) or marked
        microphthalmos.

        iv. Preoperative corneal astigmatism &gt; 1.5 diopters (as determined by corneal topography or
        keratometry in either eye) or irregular corneal astigmatism.

        v. Corneal abnormalities such as stromal, epithelial or endothelial dystrophies, or
        diagnosed degenerative visual disorders (e.g., macular degeneration or other retinal
        disorders) that are predicted to cause visual acuity losses to a level of 0.8 or worse
        during the study.

        vi. Active or recurrent anterior segment pathology (chronic uveitis, iritis, iridocyclitis,
        rubeosis iridis, etc.).

        vii. Glaucoma suspect, uncontrolled ocular hypertension, or history of glaucomatous changes
        in the retina or visual field.

        viii. Subjects with uncontrolled systemic disease. ix. Subjects with previous retinal
        pathology in either eye.
