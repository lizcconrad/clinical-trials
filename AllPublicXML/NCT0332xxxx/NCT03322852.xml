    <textblock>
      In a prospective observational study at a university teaching hospital, blood flow indices
      and serum hormone levels were compared between spontaneous and stimulated cycles in the same
      group of 50 patients with unexplained delayed conception.

      In a prospective observational study at a university teaching hospital, the mid-luteal
      (peri-implantation) endometrial thickness and volume, uterine artery pulsatility index (PI)
      and resistance index (RI), endometrial and subendometrial vascularization index, flow index,
      and vascularization flow index, and serum estradiol and progesterone levels were compared
      between spontaneous and clomiphene citrate stimulated cycles in the same group of 50 patients
      with unexplained infertility.
