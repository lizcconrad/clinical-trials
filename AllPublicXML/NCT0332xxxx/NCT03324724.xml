  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, Integrative Cognitive-Affective Therapy (ICAT), a novel intervention for bulimia
      nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) that targets emotion regulation deficits, has
      shown promise in reducing eating disorder symptoms as well as improving emotion regulation
      capacities in adults. However, this treatment has not been investigated in an adolescent
      sample. Given the contributing role of emotion regulation in adolescent eating disorder
      symptoms and limited treatment options for adolescents with BN and BED, the aim of this study
      is to adapt the existing adult ICAT treatment for adolescents with clinically significant
      binge eating (ICAT-A) and to evaluate the extent to which ICAT-A is helpful in reducing binge
      eating and associated eating disorder symptoms in a younger sample.

    <description>The EDE is a semi-structured interview conducted by a trained clinician to assess the psychopathology associated with the diagnosis of an eating disorder. The EDE is rated through the use of four subscales and a global score. The four subscales are: 1) Restraint, 2) Eating concern, 3) Shape concern, 4) Weight concern. The questions concern the frequency in which the patient engages in behaviors indicative of an eating disorder over a 28-day period, but some questions extend out to cover the previous 3 months. To obtain a particular subscale score, the ratings for the relevant items are added together and the sum divided by the total number of items forming the subscale. To obtain an overall score, the four subscales scores are summed and the resulting total divided by the number of subscales (4). The total score can range from 0 (normal) to 6 (high eating disorder).</description>
