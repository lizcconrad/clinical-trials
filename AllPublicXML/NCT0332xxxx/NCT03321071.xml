      Summer vacation represents a &quot;window of vulnerability&quot; where dramatic declines in both health
      and academics occur for elementary age children. Currently, there are no summer programs that
      incorporate curriculum addressing both unhealthy weight gains and academic achievement
      simultaneously. This work represents an important step towards addressing important public
      health goals - obesity and learning - through a comprehensive program delivered during a
      timeframe - summer vacation - where substantial and long-lasting negative effects occur.

    <textblock>
      Summer vacation represents an important time away from the school setting for a majority of
      children attending public school in the US. This break is characterized by large amounts of
      free time and involvement in a wide variety of formal and informal activities, time spent
      with friends and family, and travel. Yet for many children, particularly those from
      low-income households, summer vacation represents a &quot;window of vulnerability&quot; in which
      dramatic declines in both health and academics occur. During the summer months (typically 3
      months) children gain a larger amount of body weight compared to the amount of weight gained
      over the school year, and weight gain during summer reverses weight losses achieved during
      school. For academics, it is well established that children from low-income households
      experience greater declines in reading and math during the summer than their middle-to-upper
      income peers. Numerous programs that address these issues currently exist (e.g., summer
      school, summer weight loss or fitness programs). However, these programs are designed and
      delivered at the expense of the promotion or prevention of the other - academic focus without
      health or health focus without academics. Our long-term goal is to develop summer programming
      for widespread dissemination that addresses both lifestyle behaviors (i.e., physical activity
      and nutrition) and academic performance. The objective of the proposed study is to establish
      the efficacy of an innovative &quot;Healthy Summer Learners&quot; (HSL) program for low-income,
      minority children. The rationale for the proposed research is that no summer programs
      incorporate curriculum that addresses both unhealthy weight gains and academic achievement
      simultaneously. This study seeks to fill this void by testing a prototype learning and
      health-oriented summer program focused on promoting physical activity and nutrition, along
      with content that provides quality learning experiences to develop reading and math skills.
      To accomplish this objective, this study will evaluate over 2 summers the effectiveness of a
      10-week Healthy Summer Learners program delivered within a Boys &amp; Girls Club summer camp
      using a randomized design in a sample of rising 4th graders. The aims of the study are Aim 1:
      Evaluate the impact of Healthy Summer Learners on children's weight gain and academic
      performance from beginning (end of Spring school year) to the end of summer (beginning of
      Fall school year), and Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Healthy Summer
      Learners to children, parents, and program staff.

    <description>Similar to typical summer day camp procedures, students attending Healthy Summer Learners will be dropped-off and picked-up at camp. The physical activity component of the program was designed with the expertise and input from B&amp;G Club youth program staff. The academic component was informed by school district personnel. The program was also designed to be analogous to typical summer day camp program in terms of operating weeks (10 weeks) length of program day (i.e., 8am-5pm), and program component time blocks (~45min-1hr time blocks).</description>

    <description>Physical Activity Component. The physical activity component of Healthy Summer Learners is designed to engage children in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for at least 50% of the time. With 3 hours each day dedicated to physical activity, this translates into children accumulating 90 minutes of MVPA daily. This is 30 minutes above the 60 minutes of MVPA each day recommended by the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.
Nutrition Component. The nutrition component of Healthy Summer Learners is designed to provide healthy snacks and meals and nutrition education via standardized pre-existing curricula.
Food/Beverage Guidelines. Meals will follow the USDA Nutrition Standards for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.
Academic Component. The academic component will consist of existing, effective academic programs focused on Math and Reading.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MAP scores are norm referenced based on typical grade level scores and are
             dichotomized into 5 categories: Low (percentile &lt; 21), LoAvg (percentile between 21
             and 40), Avg (percentile between 41 and 60), HiAvg (percentile between 61 and 80), and
             High (percentile &gt; 80). Students that have scored Low or LoAvg on their MAP test in
             the Spring of the 3rd grade will be considered struggling academically and will be
             eligible to participate in the study.
