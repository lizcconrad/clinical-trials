    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NBI-98854 titrated to the subject's
      optimal dose administered once daily (qd) for a total of 12 weeks of treatment in pediatric
      subjects with TS.

    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic tic symptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference. The scale also includes an impairment assessment. The YGTSS total tic score (TTS) will be the primary measure for this study and represents the sum of the 5 subcategories (number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference) for both motor and phonic tics, each scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing a worsening assessment.</description>
