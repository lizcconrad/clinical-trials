  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding an investigational medication called
      recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH[1-84]) to standard hypoparathyroidism therapy
      (oral calcium and active vitamin D tablets) may result in superior improvements in symptoms
      of hypoparathyroidism assessed by hypoparathyroidism symptom diary (HPT-SD) symptom scale
      compared with standard therapy.

             the following symptoms related to hypoparathyroidism occurring within the 2 weeks
             before Week -3 visit: muscle cramps, muscle spasms or twitching, tingling, numbness,
             heaviness in arms or legs, physical fatigue, or slowed or confused thinking (brain
             fog).

          -  Based on the results of the Hypoparathyroidism Symptom Diary (HPT-SD) administered
             during the first week of the screening period (from Week -3 to Week -2 visits), the
             participant reports at least 2 of the following symptoms that average at least
             moderate in intensity: muscle cramps, muscle spasms or twitching, tingling, numbness,
             heaviness in arms or legs, physical fatigue, or slowed or confused thinking (brain
             fog). Additionally, the sum score of the HPT-SD symptom subscale (items 1-7) measured
             during the first week of the screening period must be greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 6.
             At least 4 responses must be entered for each symptom.

                  alfacalcidol or &lt;1000 mg/day of calcium supplement, the participant must have a
                  history of inability to be successfully managed on higher doses of at least one

             have been stable for at least 4 weeks before screening, and serum TSH level must be
             within the central laboratory reference range. A serum TSH level below the lower limit
             of the normal range but not undetectable in participants treated with thyroid hormone
