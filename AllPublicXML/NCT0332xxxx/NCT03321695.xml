    <textblock>
      This is a study of the safety and effectiveness of atezolizumab in participants with
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have disease progression during or
      following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Participants also will have progressed on an
      appropriate approved targeted therapy if their tumor has epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene abnormalities treated in common clinical
      practice settings in Argentina.

        The study population will include participants with locally advanced or metastatic (Stage
        IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received the
        indication for treatment with atezolizumab, as per local label (disease progression during
        or following treatment with a prior platinum-containing regimen for locally advanced,
        unresectable/inoperable or metastatic NSCLC or disease recurrence after treatment with a
        platinum-based adjuvant/neoadjuvant regimen, and have progressed on an appropriate approved
        targeted therapy if their tumor has EGFR or ALK gene abnormalities) and who have no
        contraindication to atezolizumab therapy.
