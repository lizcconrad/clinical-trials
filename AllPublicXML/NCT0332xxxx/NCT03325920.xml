      This study aims to validate a new diagnostic method for quantification and monitoring of
      sleep bruxism.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep bruxism has characteristically been defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine
      as 'an oral activity characterized by grinding or clenching of the teeth during sleep,
      usually associated with sleep arousals'. For sleep bruxism diagnosis, to date the
      polysomnographic recordings represent the highest standard for sleep bruxism diagnosis, but
      they are concomitantly associated with disadvantages which include technical complexity,
      limited availability, and the fact that they are time-consuming and cost-intensive. Recently,
      a prototype of a diagnostic plate has been developed which allows a fully-automatic,
      computer-based quantification of abrasion thereupon for the assessment of sleep bruxism
      activity. The results of the pilot study were promising, and therefore, the aim of the
      present study is to refine and validate this new diagnostic method for quantification and
      monitoring of sleep bruxism.
