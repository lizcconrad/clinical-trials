  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD) ranges from 0.4/100,000 to 29.0/100,000
      children &lt;15 years of age. There is significant variability in incidence within racial groups
      and is frequently higher in lower socioeconomic classes. The typical age at presentation
      ranges from 4 to 8 years (average 6.5 years).The optimal treatment goal in Legg-Calvé-Perthes
      disease (LCPD) is to obtain a spherical femoral head with good congruency to prevent or delay
      the onset of osteoarthritis after skeletal maturity. There is agreement that patients younger
      than 5years with a good remodeling capacity have a particularly excellent prognosis,
      irrespective of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older children more than 8 years usually have a poor prognosis, especially without treatment.
      Apart from the age at diagnosis and surgery, the severity of femoral head flattening and the
      signs of &quot;head at risk&quot; are also associated with the final clinical outcome. The current
      surgical treatment options, including proximal femoral varus osteotomy, innominate osteotomy,
      lateral shelf acetabuloplasty,triple pelvic osteotomy, and Chiari pelvic osteotomy have
      proved to be effective in covering the femoral head within the acetabulum. To promote the
      coverage of the femoral head, shelf acetabuloplasty directly increases the size of the
      acetabulum by implanting graft bone to the lateral rim. When used as salvage surgery, it may
      provide relief from pain and benefit the involved hip via femoral head flattening, especially
      in older children. It also improves the spherical remodeling of the femoral head and
      acetabulum by stimulating lateral acetabular growth. Lateral shelf acetabuloplasty is able to
      increase the coverage of the femoral head, which is an important tissue for remodeling and
      preventing further femoral head deformation.

    <description>Harris hip score is one of the most commonly used hip score for assessment of hip function.It assess the following items:Pain,support,distance walked, limp, activities-shoes and socks,stairs, public transportation, sitting,flexion deformity, abduction, adduction and external rotation range.The score of these items are summed together to get the total score. Grading according to this score as follows:
&lt;70= Poor ,70 - 79= Fair, 80-89=Good, 90 -100=Excellent.</description>
