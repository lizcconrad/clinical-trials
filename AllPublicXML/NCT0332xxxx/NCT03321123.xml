  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in childhood.
      Despite major advances in ALL therapy, 20% of children and 40-50% of adults fail state-of-the
      art first-line treatment. But there is a strong need for alternative treatments to cure
      chemotherapy-refractory and relapsed B cell malignancies in pediatric patients. Relapsed and
      refractory B cell malignancies remain a therapeutic challenge, as these diseases are
      characterized by adverse survival. These cancers share a cell origin from the B-cell lineage
      and consequent surface expression of B-lineage markers such as CD19 and CD22. Chimeric
      antigen receptor (CAR) engineered T cell therapy has recently emerged as a new modality to
      target B cell malignancies. CARs couple a single-chain Fv (scFv) domain directed against a
      B-lineage-specific antigen to T-cell activating intracellular signaling domains. CAR
      gene-modified T cell interaction with target cells occurs in a HLA-independent fashion, so
      that a single vector can be used to treat all patients with cancers that express the target
      antigen. Miltenyi Biotec has established a semi-automated manufacturing process that can be
      made available to academic settings for systematic exploration of CAR strategies in advanced
      clinical studies. Closed-system operation, improved robustness, simplified work flows, and
      reduced labor intensity, while maintaining strict adherence to regulatory guidelines, allows
      for decentralized manufacturing. In the proposed phase II study, the investigator will
      explore autologous 2nd generation CD19 CAR T cell products in patients with relapsed and
      refractory disease incurable with standard therapies.

      This is an open-label, non-randomized phase II paediatric study. In this study, eligible
      patients will receive autologous T cells transduced with the lentiviral vector pLTG1563
      (MB-CART19.1) at a doesage of 2x10e6 ~2x10e7 CAR-transduced T cells/kg.

      Upon enrollment, leukapheresis will be performed for MB-CART19.1 generation. Patients with
      high disease burden at screening (e.g. ALL with M3 marrow and 10.000/L blasts in peripheral
      blood) may receive bridging chemotherapy after leukapheresis, to avoid critical tumor lysis
      syndrome and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) by subsequent lymphodepleting chemotherapy and
      CAR transfer.

      All patients will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d
      intravenously (iv) on days -5,-4,-3 and -2 cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2/d iv on day -3,-2
      before CAR T cell transfer to enhance the in vivo expansion of CAR T cells.

      Patients will receive freshly prepared MB-CART19.1 on day 0, corresponding to day 12 (48
      hours) of manufacturing, at a dose of 2x10e6 ~2x10e7/kg MB-CART19.1 T cells as defined in the
      study design section. The appropriate volume for the target cell dose will be drawn up and
      given as an IV injection over 30 minutes through a large vein peripherally or centrally.

      The primary objectives are:

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of MB-CART19.1.

        -  To evaluate the biological activity of adoptive transfer of autologous MB-CART19.1 in
           patients with R/R CD19-positive B cell lymphoblastic leukemia.

      The primary endpoint is Overall response rate (ORR):ORR in ALL patients is defined as the
      rate of complete remission (CR, CRh) on day 28.
