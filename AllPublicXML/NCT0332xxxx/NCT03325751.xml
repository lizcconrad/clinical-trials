  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perimetry is a well-established method that is used to measure the visual field functions of
      humans. Commercially available products, such as the OCTOPUS 900 (Haag-Streit AG, Koeniz,
      Switzerland), are commonly used for assessing the visual field. Such devices are of critical
      value for patients suffering of glaucoma and neuro-ophthalmic conditions. The operating
      principle is to sequentially present light stimuli of different intensity at different
      locations within the visual field in an automatic way. Algorithms that select what locations
      and intensities to present over time are called strategies. These have the goal to provide
      both a fast and accurate estimation of the visual field function.

      Recently, new strategies were developed that are faster and equally accurate as the
      strategies used today. The technological advancement of these new methods lies primarily in
      the ability to estimate location sensitivities without observing them directly but by
      leveraging previously queried locations. For this the investigators plan to implement the
      next generation of perimetry strategies into an OCTOPUS 900 and to test it in healthy
      subjects and glaucoma patients.

    <measure>Non-inferiority estimation quality of mean defect between SORS and dynamic strategy visual field locations</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the non-inferiority estimation quality of mean defect when using SORS visual field locations as compared to the dynamic strategy visual field locations in healthy subjects and glaucoma patients with early or moderate visual field loss. The non-inferiority margin is defined as a mean defect difference of no more than 0.5 decibel to the dynamic strategy measurement.</description>

    <description>Standard Automated Perimetry using a perimeter is one of the most commonly used techniques for measuring perceived visual ability of a subject. For a given eye, it provides quantitative measurements of visual function represented as a 2D spatial visual field map. It is of great clinical importance for diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma and detecting neurological conditions.</description>
