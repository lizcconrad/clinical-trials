  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated 10 year long open cohort observational study, aiming to
      increase the understanding of the humoral and cellular immunological mechanisms of
      vaccination against influenza, including effects of repeated vaccination, the duration of
      protection, immunity against circulating viruses, as well as factors affecting the
      immunological responses and immunity against other vaccine preventable infectious diseases
      among health care personnel. Influenza vaccination is given according to the normal routine
      of Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) occupational health care. Blood samples
      will be collected before vaccination, 5 weeks after vaccination and 6 months after
      vaccination. The analysis will be mainly descriptive.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Members of health care or laboratory personnel in HUS having decided to take the
             seasonal influenza vaccination by the routine occupational health care service

          -  General good health as established by or volunteer's own statement

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Administration (longer than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other immune- modifying
             drugs within 6 months before the vaccination; oral corticosteroids in dosages of 20
             mg/day or more prednisolone or equivalent are excluded; inhaled or topical steroids
             are allowed.
