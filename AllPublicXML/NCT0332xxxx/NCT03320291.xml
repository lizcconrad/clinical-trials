  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a society based on the use of everyday tools and objects, the loss of function of one or
      both thumbs due to Rhizarthrosis can drastically reduce the quality of life. Many patients
      are refractory to preservative treatments.Therefore, multiple arthroplasty techniques were
      developed.

      Trapeziectomy, with or without tendon interposition, gives very good results in terms of
      pain, function or force. However, it can result in a reduction of the size of the column of
      the thumb, therefore leading to a loss of force.

      Replacement of the trapezo-metacarpal joint with prosthetic material is also proposed and has
      the advantage to avoid the reduction of the thumb column. Several models are available, mono
      or bipolar, with a conical or hemispherical cup. Another option is the placement of implants.
      They were first used when a partial trapeziectomy was possible to counter the collapse of the
      column and are made of different materials such as metal, silicone, ceramic, pyrocarbon , and
      gelfoam.

      The bioabsorbable poly-LD-lactide implant (PLDLA) is a relatively new possibility for the
      reconstruction of small joints. Studies have previously revealed that the PLDLA implant is
      biocompatible and represents a good alternative to arthroplasty by tendon interposition in
      the reconstruction of the trapezo-metacarpal articulation with osteoarthritis.

      In this study, the investigators will investigate the long term effects (1 year after
      placement) of the Regjoint, a poly-LD-lactide implant (PLDLA).
