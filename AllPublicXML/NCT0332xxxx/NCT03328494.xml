  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of BOS172722 when
      administered as monotherapy and in combination with paclitaxel in participants with advanced
      nonhaematologic malignancies and also to establish the maximum tolerated dose and recommended
      Phase 2 dose of BOS172722 in combination with paclitaxel in those participants.

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>a minimum of approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product (IP), whether or not related to the IP. AEs include pre-existing conditions that worsen.</description>

Responses are assessed by the Investigators using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) guideline version 1.1.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response (DOR)</measure>
    <time_frame>a minimum of approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression. Responses are assessed by the Investigators using RECIST guideline version 1.1.</description>

    <time_frame>a minimum of approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the first objective tumor response observed for participants who achieved a CR or PR. Responses are assessed by the Investigators using RECIST guideline version 1.1.</description>

    <measure>Time to progression on study</measure>
    <time_frame>a minimum of approximately 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to progression is defined as the time from treatment until objective tumor progression. This does not include deaths. Responses are assessed by the Investigators using RECIST guideline version 1.1.</description>
