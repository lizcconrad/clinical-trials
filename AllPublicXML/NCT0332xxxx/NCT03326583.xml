    <textblock>
      The Effects of Patiromer on Serum Potassium Level and Gut Microbiome of ESRD Patients With
      Hyperkalemia (potassium greater than 5 milliequivalents per liter) is a non-randomized,
      crossover study. This is an open-label, pilot clinical trial with 3 sequential phases of (a)
      2 weeks of no intervention, (b) 12 weeks of Patiromer treatment, and (c) 6 weeks of no
      intervention. Treatment with Patiromer will be initiated at a dose of 8.4 grams, once daily
      and observed for a week, then uptitrated to 16.8 grams once daily. Eligible study subjects
      will collect stool samples and provide blood and urine samples.
