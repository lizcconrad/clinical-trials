  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of daratumumab following a
      single subcutaneous (SC) administration in healthy participants and to determine whether
      premedication with corticosteroids is required to improve the tolerability of SC
      administration of daratumumab in healthy participants.
