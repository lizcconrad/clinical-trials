    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of
      capecitabine versus the approved dose of capecitabine alone in patients with HER2 negative,
      HR positive MBC previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.

      Approximately 600 eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either Arm A
      (tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine) or Arm B (approved dose of capecitabine
      alone).

      This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel group Phase 3 study.
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of
      capecitabine versus the approved dose of capecitabine alone based on PFS, as assessed by an
      Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRC), in patients with HER2 negative, HR positive
      MBC previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.

      Patients randomly assigned to Arm A (tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine) will be
      administered:

        -  Tesetaxel (27 mg/m2) orally once every 21 days on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; and

        -  Capecitabine (825 mg/m2) orally twice daily (in the morning and evening after a meal,
           for a total daily dose of 1,650 mg/m2) beginning with the evening dose on Day 1 through
           the morning dose on Day 15 of each 21-day cycle

      Patients randomly assigned to Arm B (approved dose of capecitabine alone) will be
      administered:

      • Capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2) orally twice daily (in the morning and evening after a meal, for
      a total daily dose of 2,500 mg/m2), beginning with the evening dose on Day 1 through the
      morning dose on Day 15 of each 21-day cycle Dose modifications for tesetaxel and/or
      capecitabine are described in the Study protocol.

      Patients will be treated until documentation of progressive disease (PD), evidence of
      unacceptable toxicity, or other decision to discontinue treatment.

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             Study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this Study.

          9. Presence of neuropathy &gt; Grade 1 per NCI CTCAE version 4.03

             pathways (patients should discontinue taking any regularly-taken medication that is a
             potent inhibitor or inducer of the CYP3A or CYP2C9 pathways)

         14. History of hypersensitivity to capecitabine, other fluoropyrimidine agents, or any of
