    <textblock>
      This is a single arm seamless phase I/II prospective cohort study. Patients with early stage
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (T1-T2N0M0) or those with a single pulmonary metastasis of a known
      malignancy (either following radical treatment or systemic therapy) will be offered
      participation in this study. Participants will have three tumor locator beacons placed with a
      flexible bronchoscope in the small bronchial airways in proximity (&lt;3cm) from their lung
      tumors. These tumor locator beacons will provide real-time positional data and will allow for
      smaller treatment volumes of Stereotactic Ablative Radiosurgery (SABR) and also allow for a
      specialized form of treatment delivery known as respiratory gated SABR. This is expected to
      result in higher precision radiotheapy delivery with less radiotherapy dose to healthy
      tissues which are in close proximity to the lung tumours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a seamless phase I/II prospective, single arm, cohort study.

      Phase I of the trial will consist of two patients and will serve to conduct quality assurance
      assessments and to familiarize thoracic surgeons, radiation oncologists, and medical
      physicists at CancerCare Manitoba and Health Sciences Center in the use and work flow of the
      Health Canada approved endobronchial implanted real-time tumor tracking transponder beacons.
      Patients in phase I will undergo standard stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) of a lung
      tumor with prior endobronchial transponder beacon placement. For phase I, the transponder
      beacons will be used for comparative localization analyses and SABR treatment setup
      procedures will be carried out independent of transponder beacon data, however, transponder
      data will be collected in order to conduct, post-treatment, in vivo quality assurance
      assessments of beacon performance characteristics. Otherwise, the SABR treatment for phase I
      will consist of the currently accepted standard internal target volume based and standard
      image guided SABR.

      Phase II of this trial will consist of 26 patients who will undergo a specialized form of
      SABR radiotherapy specifically designed to take full advantage of the real-time tumor
      tracking ability of the transponder beacons. Specifically, SABR in phase II will consist of
      smaller radiotherapy treatment volumes employing respiratory gating and smaller planning
      target volume expansion margins given the superior tumor location telemetry afforded by the
      beacons. Comparative dosimetric analyses contrasting the traditional ITV/PTV style treatments
      to those with reduced ITV/PTV margins achieved via Calypso guided SABR will be performed.
      Patient self-reported quality of life and toxicity assessments will be collected with the
      goal of facilitating power and sample size calculations for the design of a larger phase III
      randomized controlled trial of Calypso guided SABR treatment in the future

    <description>The anchored lung tracking beacons are passive electromagnetic transponder beacons which are placed immediately adjacent to a lung tumor using a bronchoscope. Three beacons will be placed in the small airways of the lung adjacent to the target tumor (within 3 cm of the tumor). Each beacon measures 2 mm in diameter and 8 mm in length and consists of a miniature electrical circuit that is encapsulated in a biocompatible glass capsule. Each beacon has an affixed five-legged anchoring system which expands to 5mm diameter once deployed. The Calypso transponder beacon is placed endobronchially using the working channel of a bronchoscope. Navigational bronchoscopy can be used to pre-plan the optimal location for each beacon to be placed within the airways by using a pre-bronchoscopy CT scan.</description>
