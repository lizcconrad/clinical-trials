  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the performance and clinical outcomes of the
      A.L.P.S® Proximal Humerus Plating System.

      The optional, interventional arm of this study will assess bone quality in the proximal
      humerus of a fracture patient population.

      Specific Aims:

        -  Conduct physical assessments measuring shoulder strength and range of motion, physician
           assessment of radiographs

        -  Obtain patient-reported outcomes regarding pain level, function capabilities, and
           work/leisure restrictions

        -  Document revisions, complications, and adverse events

      The optional, interventional arm of this study will assess bone quality in the proximal
      humerus of a fracture patient population. DXA is not particularly effective at identifying
      individuals who are at risk of suffering a fracture. Yet, there is a growing population of
      diabetics and elderly individuals prone to fragility fractures. In effect, the age-related
      and diabetes-related increase in fracture risk is independent of a person's aBMD. These
      findings stress the urgency in developing diagnostic tools that can improve fracture risk
      prediction so that patients can be treated with the appropriate anti-fracture therapies.

      Shifting from the current paradigm of using X-ray based modalities to assess fracture risk,
      the reference point indentation (RPI) method acquires direct measurements of 'materal
      quality' of the bone tissue. Specifically, the OsteoProbe-RPI engages the patient's bone, and
      upon applying an impact force, it measures the ability of the tissue to resist
      micro-indentation. Despite the encouraging results from aformentioned studies applying RPI to
      bone, there is no evidence that a local measurement of bone material quality are predictive
      of fracture resistance at sites that are prone to fragility fractures (e.g. the proximal
      humerus).

      By affirming the ability of RPI to discriminate a fragility fracture from a high-energy
      (trauma) fracture of otherwise normal bone, the data from this optional study arm may provide
      justification for large prospective studies that evaluate whether intra-operative RPI is
      useful for surgical guidance.
