  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, more and more women embark on pregnancy with previous Caesarean scar. One in five
      pregnancies requires induction of labour. The use of non-pharmacological methods (methods
      without using medication) has been gaining popularity for women who are not good candidates,
      such as women with previous Caesarean scar, for an induction with medications such as
      prostaglandin. Labour induction with prostaglandin carries higher risk of uterine rupture and
      thus it is not routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery in Sibu Hospital.
      Non-pharmacological methods of induction of labour appear to be safe in women with previous
      Caesarean delivery. However, various methods are available and the efficacy among them remain
      in doubt.

      In Sibu Hospital, membrane sweeping, which is a type of non-pharmacological method, is
      routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean delivery who require induction of labour.
      However, membrane sweeping may not exert its labour induction effect immediately and the
      delivery may be delayed by up to 8 days. This may render a proportion of women to resort to
      repeated Caesarean section for failed induction.

      Transcervical Foley catheter insertion is another non-pharmacological methods for labour
      induction. Foley catheter, which is made from latex rubber, is inserted into the womb. The
      balloon will be inflated and this put pressure on the cervix and encourages dilatation. This
      method may successfully stimulates labour and the catheter falls out once the cervix dilates
      to 3 centimeters.

      The benefits of the Foley catheter:

        -  A favourable and safe option for mothers who are hoping for a vaginal birth after
           Caesarean. It is estimated that 4-7 in 10 women with previous Caesarean undergoing
           labour induction with Foley catheter will have successful vaginal births.

        -  Cause the cervix to mechanically open without involving medication.

        -  Reduced risk of uterine rupture compared to induction with prostaglandin.

        -  Less risk of fetal distress compared to induction with prostaglandin.

      The risks of Foley catheter:

        -  Vaginal bleeding (1.8%)

        -  Pain requiring removal of catheter (1.7%)

        -  Baby moving from head down to breech (1.3%)

        -  Fever (1%) which is lower than induction with prostaglandin.

        -  The risk of uterine rupture is similar to women undergoing spontaneous vaginal birth
           after Caesarean.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two types of non-pharmacological
      methods, ie. membrane sweeping and transcervical Foley catheter for induction of labour in
      women with previous Caesarean delivery.

    <textblock>
      Induction of labour (IOL) is an obstetric intervention to artificially initiate labour before
      its spontaneous onset. It is undertaken when maternal or fetal risks of continuing pregnancy
      outweigh the risks of IOL. The methods of IOL include pharmacological method (prostaglandin),
      mechanical methods (transcervical Foley catheter and laminaria tents) and surgical method
      (amniotomy). Pharmacological method and mechanical methods are preferred choice for IOL in
      women with unfavourable cervix. Whereas surgical method is reserved for women with favourable
      cervix in which membranes are accessible.

      With the global rise in Caesarean section, more and more women embark on pregnancy with
      previous Caesarean scar. It is estimated that one in every four term pregnancies requires
      IOL. With IOL in previous Caesarean section, the risk of uterine scar rupture with subsequent
      catastrophic maternal and neonatal outcomes is the greatest concern. Previous influential
      study highlighted that IOL with prostaglandin conferred the greatest risk of uterine rupture
      (2.45%) in women with one previous Caesarean delivery. On the other hand, the risks of
      uterine rupture were lower and comparable among women whose labour induced without the use
      prostaglandin (0.77%) and women with spontaneous labour (0.52%). Among the various IOL
      methods, prostaglandin is more likely associated with shorter interval to achieve vaginal
      delivery and avoidance of oxytocin augmentation. Nevertheless, mechanical methods have lower
      risk of uterine hyperstimulation but have more risk of infection. As a result, obstetricians
      are facing dilemma on deciding the safe and effective method of IOL in women with previous
      Caesarean delivery.

      In Sibu Hospital, membrane sweeping is routinely offered to women with previous Caesarean
      delivery who require IOL. This technique involves the examining finger passing through the
      cervix to rotate against the wall of the uterus, to separate the chorionic membrane from the
      decidua, or to massage around the cervix if the os is closed. However, membrane sweeping may
      not exert its cervical ripening effect immediately and the delivery may be delayed by up to 8
      days. This may render a proportion of women to resort to repeated Caesarean section for
      failed induction. The vaginal birth rates following membrane sweeping in women with unscarred
      uterus are ranging between 78%-90%. Among women with previous Caesarean delivery undergoing
      IOL with membrane sweeping, the reported vaginal birth rates were conflicting. A randomised
      controlled trial by Hamdan et al. showed vaginal birth rate of 56.1%. Another comparative
      study by Ramya et al. reported much lower vaginal birth rate of 17.3% which could be
      explained by high rate of Caesarean Section for maternal request in this study. The average
      intervals from sweeping to labour onset and to delivery were about 2 days and 4 days,
      respectively. Membrane sweeping did not increase the risk of maternal or neonatal infection,
      Caesarean section, postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal poor APGAR score, though discomfort
      during vaginal examination, minor vaginal bleeding and irregular contraction were frequently
      reported by women undergoing membrane sweeping. No cases of uterine rupture was reported
      among women with scarred uterus undergoing membrane sweeping.

      Pharmacological IOL method involving prostaglandin is avoided in Sibu Hospital in view of
      higher risk of scar rupture and presence of limited number of consultants to cope with this
      debilitating event. Non-pharmacological methods of IOL such as Foley catheter, double-balloon
      catheter, hygroscopic cervical dilator (laminaria tent) etc are known to have lesser risk of
      scar rupture. Double-balloon catheters are limited in numbers in this hospital and they are
      costly. Laminaria tent is not available in this hospital. Foley cathter is a consumable item
      in this hospital and thus is readily available all the time. Compared to double-balloon
      catheter, Foley catheter has equivalent cervical ripening efficacy and safety profile. In
      addition, Foley catheter is also cheaper and has shorter induction to delivery interval. All
      these advantages make Foley catheter an ideal method of IOL for women with previous Caesarean
      delivery.

      Among women with previous Caesarean delivery underlying IOL with transcervical Foley
      catheter, the reported vaginal birth rates are ranging between 43.5%-71.4%. The retrospective
      cohort analysis by Bujold et al. compared the risk of uterine rupture among women with
      previous Caesarean delivery undergoing spontaneous labour, induction by amniotomy with or
      without oxytocin, or preinduction cervical ripening with transcervical Foley catheter. The
      rates of uterine rupture were similar among the groups ((1.1% vs 1.2% vs 1.6%, p = 0.81).
      However, transcervical Foley catheter appeared to be safer than low dose oxytocin infusion
      for cervical ripening before amniotomy as the latter tended to be associated with risk of
      uterine scar dehiscence. Another retrospective cohort study done by Gonsalves et al. showed
      no case of uterine rupture among 68 women with previous Caesarean section undergoing IOL with
      transcervical Foley catheter insertion.

      The transcervical insertion of balloon catheter as a 'foreign material' may theoretically
      increase the risk of uterine infection. But, the current data available are conflicting.
      Meta-analysis by Heinemann et al. demonstrated that the Foley catheter was associated with a
      significantly higher rate of maternal infections, defined as fever, endometritis or
      chorioamnionitis, compared to the use of prostaglandins or oxytocin for induction of labour
      (7.6% vs 5%, pooled OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.07-2.09). On the other hand, Cochrane Review concluded
      that there is no evidence of an increased risk of infectious morbidity with balloon
      catheters. In the PROBAAT-trial, comparing the Foley catheter with the use of vaginal
      prostaglandin E2 gel, the rate of intrapartum infection was significantly lower in women with
      the Foley catheter (1% vs 3%, p = 0.035). Two other trials evaluating labour induction with
      balloon catheters after rupture of the membranes did not show an increased risk for maternal
      infection.

      Maslovitz et al. reported the rate of vaginal bleeding of 1.8% following transcervical Foley
      catheter insertion. However, the bleeding was minor with unaltered haemoglobin levels and
      coagulation profile. There was also no case of cervical tear which might result in postpartum
      haemorrhage. Besides, risk of change of fetal vertex presentation to breech was reported to
      be 1.3%. This was probably related to concomitant presence of unengaged free-floating fetus
      and contraction following Foley catheter insertion which resulted in flipping movement of the
      fetus. Risk of poor APGAR and NICU admission was not significantly higher compared to other
      IOL methods eg. prostaglandin and oxytocin.

      Till date, there is paucity of evidence on the superiority of membrane sweeping and
      transcervical Foley catheter in IOL in previous Caesarean delivery. Both methods have the
      same mechanism action by increasing local production of endogenous prostaglandin. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of membrane sweeping and transcervical Foley
      catheter insertion for IOL in women with previous Caesarean delivery. The investigators had
      searched electronic databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Ovid, JSTOR and
      Google Scholar. The investigators found that there was no study comparing these two IOL
      methods, thus no prior information is available for sample size calculation. Based on Julious
      SA, this study will recruit 24 subjects (a sample size of 12 per group) first, then do an
      interim analysis and calculate the actual sample size required for a full RCT. The
      justifications for this interim sample size are based on rationale about feasibility,
      precision about the mean and variance, and regulatory considerations.

    <intervention_model_description>Pregnant women with one previous Caesarean section who are indicated for induction of labour (IOL) and eligible will be recruited in the study.
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups below.
Group 1: IOL with membrane sweeping
Group 2: IOL with transcervical Foley catheter Blocked randomisation, in a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 1:1, will be performed using a computer-generated randomisation sequence by Research Randomizer (available online at https://www.randomizer.org/). The allocation assignment indicating &quot;membrane sweeping&quot; or &quot;transcervical Foley catheter&quot; will be sealed in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes by principal investigator. Envelopes will be kept in a locked box in Labour Ward. When study consent is signed, the next sequential envelope will be taken out from the box and opened to determine allocation.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>None (Open Label)</masking>
    <masking_description>This is a non-blinded study in which subjects, medical staffs, and investigators are not blinded to group assignment. This is because both IOL methods are distinctly different procedure. However, both intervention arms are considered receiving equal treatment. In term of safety, both membrane sweeping and transcervical Foley catheter are non-pharmacological in nature and thus the risk of scar rupture does not differ in both methods. In term of efficacy, there is no previous study to compare effectiveness between these two methods. Individual studies revealed that membrane sweeping is likely to reduce the need for formal IOL in post-date pregnancy and transcervical Foley catheter could improve cervical favourability.</masking_description>

    <description>Subjects undergoing induction of labour (IOL) will be randomly assigned to two interventional arms (Group 1: membrane sweeping or Group 2: transcervical Foley catheter insertion). Before IOL, modified Bishop score will be assessed for cervical favourability. After 24 hours of IOL, improvement of modified Bishop score will be reassessed. If the cervix is favourable, amniotomy will be performed followed by augmentation with intravenous oxytocin. If the cervix is still unfavourable and amniotomy is impossible, membrane sweeping will be continued for one more day in Group 1 whereas conservative management will be undertaken for one day in Group 2. Suitability for amniotomy will be reassessed on the next day. After amniotomy, subsequent intrapartum management will be based on the hospital protocol. If amniotomy is still impossible after 2 days of IOL, the ward Obstetrician will discuss with women regarding option of Caesarean section.</description>
