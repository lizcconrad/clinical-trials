      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  The safety of LY3298176 and any side effects that might be associated with it.

        -  How much LY3298176 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to remove
           it.

        -  How LY3298176 affects the levels of blood sugar.

      This study includes eight weekly doses of LY3298176 or placebo given as subcutaneous (SC)
      injections just under the skin. The study will last about 16 weeks (total), including
      screening and follow-up. This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to
      treat any medical conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have T2DM controlled with diet and exercise alone or are stable on a single oral
             antidiabetic medication (metformin or dipeptidyl peptidase [DPP]-IV inhibitors)

          -  Have a body mass index of 20.0 to 35.0 kilograms per square meter, inclusive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have known allergies to LY3298176, glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogs, or related
             compounds

          -  Have had more than 1 episode of severe hypoglycemia, as defined by the American
             Diabetes Association criteria, within 6 months before entry into the study or has a
             history of hypoglycemia unawareness or poor recognition of hypoglycemic symptoms

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead electrocardiogram at screening that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, increases the risks associated with participating in the study

          -  Have a history or presence of pancreatitis or gastrointestinal (GI) disorder or any GI
             disease which impacts gastric emptying or could be aggravated by GLP-1 analogs or
