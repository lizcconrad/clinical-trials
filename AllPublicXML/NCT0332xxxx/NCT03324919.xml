    <textblock>
      This study is based on a survey about the patient centered care situation and health-related
      quality of life of patients with diagnoses Psoriasis, Urtikaria or Lupus erythematodes.
      Detection of relevant parameters of quality of life by these patients serves for the
      detection of psychosocial burden of the mentioned skin diseases, thus gaining an increasing
      importance for prospective economic issues. This survey is a behaviorally based questionnaire
      for patients with the above diseases and addresses activities such as sleep and rest,
      mobility, recreation, home management, emotional behavior, social interaction, and the like.

      The care of patients with the above indications is based on a wide variety of available
      therapies. This study is based on a survey about the patient centered care situation and
      health-related quality of life of patients with diagnoses Psoriasis, Urtikaria or Lupus
      erythematodes. Therefore a cross-sectional survey will be done of patients with the above
      diseases from non-urban practices vs. urban practices (University Hospital). An adequate
      diagnosis and treatment of Psorisasis, Urticaria or Lupus erythematodes is often problematic
      due to the diverse and complex organ manifestations. However adequate diagnosis and
      appropriate treatments of these diseases is often conducted by various medical specialists in
      both outpatient and in-patient care. Lack of access and ability of the rural population to
      get an appropriate therapy may lead by these patients to false diagnosis or a therapeutic
      oversupply of an only symptom-oriented therapy. Furthermore the partly chronic character in
      the above mentioned diseases with recurrent symptoms, connected with prolonged itching
      periods and long-lasting treatments by these patients can lead to both emotional, mental
      stress and physical isolation. This situation does not only affect the health but also the
      overall quality of life of these patients. Therefore this study addresses several factors
      concerning the patient's perceived health status and to detect changes or differences in
      health status occurring between groups (patients from non-urban practices vs urban practices)
