  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiogenic shock, the most severe form of acute heart failure, is a critical situation where
      the body cells lack of oxygen because of cardiac dysfunction. The failure of pharmacological
      therapy to maintain adequate perfusion has led to attempts to improve the circulation by the
      use of mechanical circulatory support devices. Peripheral veno-arterial support (PVA-ECMO) is
      the most frequently used device. It consists of extracorporeal circulatory support. Venous
      blood is aspirated via the right atrium and reinjected into the descending aorta via the
      femoral artery. As a consequence of this by-pass, pulmonary artery flow and residual left
      ventricle ejection can fall drastically until zero in the most severe patients. A minimal
      transpulmonary blood flow is crucial to avoid left heart cavities and pulmonary artery and
      left heart cavities thrombosis. The gold standard technique to monitor transpulmonary blood
      flow is right-heart cavities catheterism (Swan-Ganz catheter) but it represents major limits:
      invasive technique, limited duration of utilization because of septic risk, physical limit of
      flow measurement (under 1 liter/minute). End-tidal pressure carbon dioxide (Pet CO2)
      monitoring (or capnography) is a routine and non-invasive measure in ventilated patients.
      Previous studies have shown that changes in PetCO2 can measure changes in cardiac output in
      anesthetized patients and that PetCO2 is a useful index of pulmonary artery blood flow during
      separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that PetCO2
      is correlated to transpulmonary blood flow in patients under PVA-ECMO and that exhaled CO2
      can provide an on-line, continuous, and noninvasive monitor of residual outflow from the
      heart during PVA-ECMO.

      Settings

      This prospective study is conducted since January 2016 in our tertiary ICU and has been
      approved by our hospital's institutional review board. Informed consent will be obtained from
      all patients or their surrogates.

      Hemodynamic is monitored via a radial arterial catheter for continuous blood pressure
      monitoring, a pulmonary artery catheter (Swan-Ganz CCOmboÂ® CCO/SvO2, Edwards Lifesciences)
      inserted through the superior vena cava (jugular intern or subclavian vein) and
      transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) at PVA-ECMO implantation or at operator discretion.

      ECMO circuit settings and patients management under ECMO

      PVA-ECMO consist of polyvinyl chloride tubing with a membrane oxygenator (PH.I.S.I.O and EOS;
      Sorin Group, Clamart, France), a centrifugal pump (Stockert; Sorin Group), and percutaneous
      or surgically inserted arterial and venous femoral cannulae (Fem-Flex and Fem-Track, Edwards
      Life- sciences, Guyancourt, France) with or without an additional 7 F cannula inserted
      distally into the femoral artery to prevent lower limb ischemia. An oxygen-air blender
      (Sechrist Industries, Anaheim, CA) ventilate the membrane oxygenator. Unfractionated heparin
      is administrated to maintain an activated partial thromboplastin time between 1.5 and 2 times
      the normal value. The lower speed flow necessary for adequate tissue perfusion is wanted.
