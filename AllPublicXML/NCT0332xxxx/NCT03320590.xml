    <textblock>
      To date, none study shows the impact of human spermatozoa nuclear alteration on embryonic
      development kinetic with morpho-kinetics tools. In this study, Investigator analyze the
      possible influence of sperm nuclear quality on embryonic development kinetics. Moreover,
      Investigator will evaluate possible new sperm biomarkers and try to better understand the
      pathophysiology of male infertility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, there has clearly been a significant decline in male fertility in
      industrialized countries, particularly sperm quality. Furthermore, it is known that the
      quality of sperm DNA affects embryonic development and pregnancy outcomes. However, few
      elements are known about the effects of spermatozoa nuclear alterations on the embryonic
      development kinetics.

      Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the possible influence of sperm nuclear quality on
      the embryonic development kinetics. In order to answer this question, Investigator will study
      the spermatozoa quality of patients whose torque is supported by ICSI.

      On these spermatozoa, Investigator will analyze DNA fragmentation, oxidation by measuring the
      8-OHdG residues, chromatin compaction and nuclear methylation degree. This will allow to
      determine the spermatic nuclear parameters in relation to an ICSI fertilization rate (normal&gt;
      60%) and a good blastocyst rate (≥ B3 in the Gardner classification).

      And finally, by this study, Investigator will probably find new biological markers spermatic.
      Moreover, the data will help to better understand the physiopathology of male infertility.
