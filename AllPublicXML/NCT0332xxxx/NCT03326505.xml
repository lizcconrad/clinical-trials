  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at expanding Umbilical Cord derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to a
      clinical scale according to Good Laboratory Practice and study its efficacy when compared to
      a Supervised Physical Therapy Program alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord derived MSCs bank will be generated and all patients given the same cells from
      the same biological sample.

      Thorough clinical, cognitive and motor analysis will be performed at baseline and compared to
      outcomes at 3 different time points of all enrolled patients.

      The study will consist of three arms: 1- Stem cells treatment 2- Stem cells and supervised
      physical therapy 3- Supervised physical therapy
