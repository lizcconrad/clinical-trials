  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single arm phase II study, to determine the overall response rate for
      the combination of lenvatinib and pemrolizumab in patients with metastatic gastroesophageal
      cancer who have progressed on first or subsequent line therapies. Given the significant cross
      talk between angiogenesis and the immune response, combined therapy with lenvatinib and
      pemrolizumab in advanced gastroesophageal cancer patient will provide improved outcomes
      compared to standard treatment with currently approved agents.

      The objective of this study is to determine the progression free survival (PFS), overall
      survival (OS) and toxicity rates in advanced gastroesophageal patients treated with
      lenvatinib and pemrolizumab.
