    <textblock>
      This is a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility of a cluster
      randomized trial to evaluate the individual and health system impact of implementing a new
      physiotherapist-led primary care model for back pain in Canada.

      This study aims to determine the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomized trial in
      primary care settings in Ontario to evaluate the individual health outcomes and health system
      impact of implementing a new physiotherapist-led primary care model for people with back
      pain. The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility including
      recruitment and retention of primary care teams (sites) and patient participants, carrying
      out the assessment procedures, and implementing the physiotherapist-led primary care
      intervention including training the physiotherapist to adopt this role.

    <description>The PT-led primary care model for back pain will involve incorporating a PT within the primary care team at the first point of contact for people with back pain at no cost to the patient. Patients in this model will be given the choice of seeing the PT or family doctor. They will be encouraged to book with the PT except when the primary reason for visit is for medication renewals or when the patient has additional health concerns that need attention from their physician in the same visit. There will be 4 key components of the PT led primary care intervention: 1) Initial assessment and screening; 2) Brief individualized intervention at the first visit; 3) Health services navigation; 4) Providing additional PT care for people with an unmet need.</description>

    <description>The physician led primary care intervention will be unstandardized to best reflect standard clinical practice in Canada. This usually includes a visit to a primary care physician, who would perform a history and physical examination, provide LBP education, and prescribe medications and/or refer based on their assessment findings and patient preferences.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Physiotherapist-led primary care model for back pain</intervention_name>
    <description>Assessment and screening: taking a history; screening for red flags, comorbidities, and risk factors of ongoing pain and disability; physical examination
Brief individualized intervention at the first visit: effective communication, cognitive reassurance, a few exercises, and advice/strategies to stay active.
Health services navigation: PT assistance with navigating healthcare services based on the assessment findings. First, red-flags requiring emergency or urgent referrals. Next, comorbid conditions that would benefit from care from other healthcare providers. Finally, referral to PT (if appropriate).
Providing additional physiotherapy care to people with an unmet need: Additional physiotherapy care will be provided to patients who have an identified need for physiotherapy but no physiotherapy coverage through private or government health insurance plans.</description>
