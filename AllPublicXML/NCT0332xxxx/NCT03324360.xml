  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upwards of 40% of cancer patients will develop brain metastases during their illness, most of
      which become symptomatic. The burden of brain metastases impacts the quality and length of
      survival. Thus the management of brain metastases is a significant health care problem.
      Standard treatment options include stereotactic radiosurgery and/or whole brain radiation.
      There is a great interest in studying the association between the functional characteristics
      of tumors - such as tumour hypoxia and lactate accumulation - and clinical outcomes in order
      to guide management. These characteristics may predict future tumor behavior and stratify
      risk of therapy failure. Hyperpolarized 13C MR imaging is a novel functional imaging
      technique that uses 13C-labeled molecules, such as pyruvate, and MRS to image in vivo tissue
      metabolism.

      There is significant clinical heterogeneity in patients with brain metastasis due to
      differences in underlying tumour biology. Biochemical differences in tumour metabolism have
      been shown to correlate with response to therapy. While the significance of tissue hypoxia
      for radiosensitivity has been established for years, the impact of lactate accumulation on
      radiosensitivity has only recently been recognized. Studies have shown that tissue lactate
      levels correlate with radioresistance in several human tumours. Hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate
      MRS has been shown in numerous pre-clinical studies and a recent clinical study to have great
      potential as a metabolic imaging tool. Our study seeks to establish the role of
      hyperpolarized 13C MRS in characterizing the metabolic features of intracranial metastasis.
      The results of this study will provide insight into intracranial metastatic disease
      signatures with MR spectroscopy and determine if there is added benefit for incorporation of
      this new technique into future clinical MRI protocols. If the technique can accurately
      differentiate between aggressive and indolent tumours based on MR spectroscopic patterns,
      hyperpolarized 13C MRS may have wide-ranging utility in the future. In the era of
      personalized medicine, the ability of imaging tests to predict response to therapy would open
      the door for individualized treatment options specific to each patient's disease biology.

      This is a pilot prospective, single-institution study in both healthy participants and
      particpants with evidence of intracranial metastases who will be planned for brain radiation
      therapy. Healthy particpant accural will be done through advertisments. Intracranical
      metastatic participant screening and accrual will be completed by a member of the
      participant's Cirlce of Care. Clinical procedures will be completed at Sunnybrook Health
      Sciences Centre (SHSC) by the study's Qualified Investigator or medical designate. Eligible
      healthy particpants must meet the study's inclusion and exclusion crtieria and MRI
      eligibility. Intracranial metastatic particpants must meet the study's inclusion and
      exclusion crtieria, MRI eligibility will be undergoing radiation therapy (stereotactic
      radiotherapy).

      The study will be divided into three parts:

      Part I

        -  Population: up to 6 healthy study particants, &gt;18 years of age

        -  Each participant will undergo a single MRI sequences (hyperpolarized 13C pyruvate MRS),
           of approximately 60 minutes in length.

      Part II

        -  Population: up to 5 study particpants from the Odette Cancer Centre, &gt;18 years of age
           with demonstrated intracranial metastasis on imaging (CT or MRI), who have been referred
           to clinic for radiotherapy consideration.

        -  Procedure: Each participant will undergo additional MRI sequences (hyperpolarized 13C
           pyruvate MRS) with an additional length of approximately 30-60 minutes that will be
           performed on the day of or in advance of the particpant's routine radiation planning
           scan prior to radiation treatment. No extra visits to the hospital, beyond routine
           clinical care, are anticipated.

      Part III

        -  Population: up to 30 study particpants from the Odette Cancer Centre, &gt;18 years of age
           with demonstrated intracranial metastasis on imaging (CT or MRI), who have been referred
           to clinic for radiotherapy consideration.

        -  Procedure: Each participant will undergo additional MRI sequences (hyperpolarized 13C
           pyruvate MRS) with an additional length of approximately 30-60 minutes that will be
           performed on the day of or in advance of the particpant's routine radiation planning
           scan prior to radiation treatment In addition, each particpant will undergo one
           non-rountine MRI scan with a length of approximately 60-90 minutes at a time point of
           1-5 days following radiation treatment.
