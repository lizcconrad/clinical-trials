  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Pain is the predominant and most feared symptom of pancreas cancer, and is often
      incompletely relieved. Scrambler Therapy is a new way of treating pain by providing
      &quot;non-pain&quot; information to confuse the nervous system and reset the damaged nerve pathways. It
      has been useful in treating many types of pain, but has not been adequately tested in the
      pain associated with pancreas cancer.

      OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of Scrambler Therapy on typical
      abdominal pain associated with pancreas cancer.

      HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that pain scores from day 0 (pre) to day 28 (post) will be reduced
      by at least 33%, e.g. from 6/10 to 4/10.

      METHODS: 20 patients, with expected data from 18 due to drop out of 2, will be treated with
      Scrambler Therapy using the standard methods of 45 minute sessions for 10 treatments.

      OUTCOMES: We will record data using the Brief Pain Inventory, and EORTC Quality of Life
      Questionnaire-Pancreas 26 to see if we obtain at least a 33% reduction in pain. This will
      inform future randomized trials of Scrambler Therapy versus traditional methods such a celiac
      plexus blocks.

      Specific aims include the following:

        1. To determine the change in pain from day 0 to day 28 with scrambler therapy in patients
           with pancreas cancer pain. (Question #3 of the Modified Brief Pain Inventory). This
           endpoint serves to get preliminary information on the effect size for planning future
           larger, phase III studies comparing to splanchnic or celiac nerve blocks. The primary
           measurement tool for pain will be the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

        2. To determine changes in the complete Brief Pain Inventory; changes in pain drug use; and
           changes in quality of life (QOL) using the EORTC QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE-PANCREAS
           26, our current Hopkins standard. With 18 patients and a one-sided type 1 error rate of
           10%, we have 87% power to detect a 33% reduction in pain, the primary endpoint, and can
           complete this in one year. To ensure completion, we will enroll 20.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria will be men and women, 18 years of age or older with cancer; English
        speakers; documented pancreas cancer by cytology, or histology; pain in the abdomen with an
        average daily pain rating of &gt; 46 out of 10, using the following question from the BPI:
        &quot;Please rate your pain by circling the one number that best describes your (abdominal)
        pain/discomfort on average over the past week. (Scale 0-10; 0= No pain, 10= Pain as bad as
        you can imagine)&quot;. They must have a life expectancy &gt; 5 days, so that some treatments can
        be given), and ECOG Performance Status 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4

                  compromise the objectives of the study.

        Patients currently receiving anti-convulsants (such as gabapentinoids, e.g. gabapentin
        (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica) will be tapered off these medications over 7 days
        because of new data that suggests patients do not do as well when on gabapentin or
        pregabalin (Moon 2014). The study team will provide instructions on how to do this.
