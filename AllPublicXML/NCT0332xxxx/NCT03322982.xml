  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled pilot trial of a dietary intervention vs. wait-list control in
      patients with MS and fatigue for management of their fatigue. The hypothesis of this study is
      that participants following the low-fat study diet will demonstrate a significant reduction
      in fatigue after four months compared to wait list controls.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS). The MFIS is a 21-item questionnaire that assesses overall self-reported fatigue. Subjects rate agreement with a series of statements on a scale of 0 (rarely) to 4 (almost always), in context of their fatigue over the preceding four weeks. Total possible score of 84. Individuals with an MFIS score of &gt; 38 are considered to experience moderate to severe &quot;fatigue</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The FSS is a 9-item questionnaire, with subjects giving a response from 1-7 to indicate their degree of agreement with each statement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 4</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by EDSS. The EDSS is an eight functional system scale including motor, sensory, cerebellar, brain stem, visual, mental, sphincteric, and other systems. Each functional system is graded from 0 (no disability) to 5 or 6 (maximal disability)20. An integrated score between 0 (normal examination) and 10 (death from MS) is formed based on the score in each functional system.</description>
