  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer in Europe and the third worldwide. Approximately
      1 in 20 men and 1 in 35 women will develop colorectal cancer at some moment in their life. In
      Flanders, in 2014, there was an increase in the detection of colorectal cancer with 21%
      compared to 2013. Early detection improves the prognosis for the patient. In this early
      stage, colorectal surgery is one of the most important treatments, but it is also complex and
      has a high complication rate. However, over the last decade, surgical care for patients with
      colorectal cancer has become more standardized. The use of structured care methods, such as
      care pathways and protocols, has helped in standardizing care processes. Specifically for
      patients with colorectal cancer, perioperative care has shifted with the implementation of
      Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) programs. The goal of ERAS- protocols is to optimize
      the interventions during the perioperative hospitalization period and reduce postoperative
      complications. Despite the increasing evidence in favor of the use of these standardized
      protocols, adherence and implementation in daily practice remains challenging.

      The primary goal of this quality improvement project is to enhance the standardization of key
      interventions in the ERAS care process for patients undergoing colorectal surgery.

      Therefore, adherence to the ERAS-guidelines will be investigated and hospitals will receive
      feedback to set up improvement initiatives. Moreover, interactive group sessions and on-site
      training activities will stimulate knowledge sharing and define best practices.
