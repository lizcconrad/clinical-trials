      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label study to assess the feasibility of a
      low-protein diet intervention in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC) who are receiving treatment with sipuleucel-T. Subjects will be randomized (1:1 ratio)
      to either Arm 1 or Arm 2 (Fig. 1).

      Arm 1: Subjects randomized to Arm 1 will be treated with sipuleucel-T infusion on Day 1,
      every two weeks for a total of three infusions. Subjects on this arm will receive a control
      diet containing 20% protein.

      Arm 2: Subjects randomized to Arm 2 will be treated with sipuleucel-T infusion on Day 1,
      every two weeks for a total of three infusions. Subjects on this arm will receive a
      low-protein diet containing 10% protein.

      Patients with metastatic, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic CRPC that has progressed
      despite androgen deprivation therapy will be eligible for the study. After informed consent
      eligible patients will be scheduled to receive sipuleucel-T (three infusions two weeks apart)
      with normal-protein diet vs. low-protein diet. Each cycle will be every 14 days. Diet
      intervention will commence 1 week prior to the first apheresis (Day -7) and will continue
      until 10 days after the last infusion of sipuleucel-T (Day +42) (Fig. 2).

      Primary Objective To assess the feasibility of low-protein diet intervention in patients with
      metastatic CRPC receiving immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T. Change in blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN) and urine urea nitrogen (UUN) from baseline to 6 weeks will be measured to assess
      adherence of following the diet intervention. The expected changes (mean, standard deviation)
      in BUN are 5.5 ± 2.6 mg/dL with 10% protein diet arm and 2.5 ± 2.6 mg/dL with 20% protein
      diet arm (please see section 12.5.7).

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To assess whether low-protein diet intervention augments the immune response to
           sipuleucel-T in men with metastatic CRPC.

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of sipuleucel-T and low-protein
           diet intervention.

        3. To obtain preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy of the combination of sipuleucel-T
           and low-protein diet compared to sipuleucel-T and control-diet, including objective
           response rate (partial + complete response), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
           survival (OS), and changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

        ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Men at least 18 years of age with asymptomatic or minimally
        symptomatic, metastatic, androgen independent prostate cancer will be recruited for this
        study. Before the initiation of screening procedures, the patient will undergo the Informed
        Consent Process which includes signing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved consent
        form. The subject will subsequently undergo screening assessments to determine if he meets
        the eligibility criteria for the study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologically documented adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Metastatic disease as evidenced by soft tissue and/or bony metastases on baseline bone
             scan and/or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

          -  Androgen independent prostatic adenocarcinoma. Subjects must have current or
             historical evidence of disease progression concomitant with surgical or medical
             castration, as demonstrated by PSA progression OR progression of measurable disease OR
             progression of non-measurable disease as defined below:

               -  PSA: Two consecutive PSA values, at least 14 days apart, each ≥ 5.0 ng/mL and ≥
                  50% above the minimum PSA observed during castration therapy or above the
                  pre-treatment value if there was no response.

               -  Measurable disease: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target
                  lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the
                  baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative
                  increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5
                  mm. The change will be measured against the best response to castration therapy
                  or against the pre-castration measurements if there was no response.

               -  Non-measurable disease: Soft tissue disease: The appearance of 1 or more new
                  lesions, and/or unequivocal worsening of non-measurable disease when compared to
                  imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against the pre-castration
                  studies if there was no response.

               -  Bone disease: Appearance of 2 or more new areas of abnormal uptake on bone scan
                  when compared to imaging studies acquired during castration therapy or against
                  the pre-castration studies if there was no response. Increased uptake of
                  pre-existing lesions on bone scan does not constitute progression.

               -  Serum PSA ≥ 5.0 ng/mL

               -  Castration levels of testosterone (&lt; 50 ng/dL) achieved via medical or surgical
                  castration. Surgical castration must have occurred at least 3 months prior to
                  registration. Subjects who are not surgically castrate must be receiving medical
                  castration therapy, have initiated such therapy at least 3 months prior to
                  registration, and continue such therapy until the time of confirmed objective
                  disease progression.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          -  Men ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function as evidenced by the following:

               -  White blood cell (WBC) ≥ 2,500 cells/μL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000 cells/μL

               -  Platelet Count ≥ 100,000 cells/μL

               -  Hemoglobin (HgB) ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  Aspartate aminotransaminase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Alanine aminotransaminase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  The presence of lung, liver, or known brain metastases, malignant pleural effusions,
             or malignant ascites.

          -  Moderate or severe symptomatic metastatic disease. Subjects who meet either of the
             following criteria must be excluded:

          -  Use of non-steroidal antiandrogens (e.g., flutamide, nilutamide, or bicalutamide)

          -  Treatment with chemotherapy within 28 days of registration including subjects who
             received more than 2 chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting at any time prior
             to registration.

          -  Treatment with any of the following medications or interventions within 28 days of
             registration:

               -  Systemic corticosteroids; however, use of inhaled, intranasal, and topical
                  steroids is acceptable.

               -  Ketoconazole

             cancer must have been adequately treated and been disease-free for ≥ 3 years at the
             time of registration.

          -  A requirement for systemic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason
