  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relationship of tissue oxygenation of different organs and tissue beds
      (e.g., a tissue bed on the arm vs. leg vs. flank tissue bed(s) and renal tissue bed, and thus
      can be used as a surrogate of renal tissue oxygenation monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will monitor tissue oxygenation of four different tissue beds including
      cerebral tissue (SctO2) on the forehead, and 3 somatic tissue beds monitored on the forearm
      (SarmO2), upper leg (SlegO2), and the renal region (SrrO2). The primary end point is AKI and
      the secondary end points are postoperative major non-renal complications (e.g. stroke,
      delirium, myocardial infraction, heart failure, new or worsening arrhythmia, mechanical
      ventilation &gt; 24 hours, deep wound infection, etc.) and mortality. The associations between
      tissue oxygenation of different tissue beds, i.e. SctO2, SarmO2, SlegO2, and SrrO2, and AKI
      and non-renal outcomes will be compared to explore the tissue bed(s) whose oxygen saturation
      has a stronger association with the outcomes of interest. The strength of this study is to
      use the patient as self-control.
