  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to evaluate safety and efficacy outcomes in renal transplant
      recipients in whom post-transplant care is managed using AlloSure®. AlloSure® is a
      non-invasive test to measure donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA). The AlloSure test is
      intended to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney transplant recipients
      with clinical suspicion of rejection and to inform clinical decision-making regarding the
      necessity of renal biopsy in such patients at least 2 weeks post-transplant in conjunction
      with standard clinical assessment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AlloSure test has been approved for Medicare coverage for clinical use when a physician
      determines there is a need to assess the probability of allograft rejection in kidney
      transplant recipients. Accurate and timely detection of allograft rejection and effective
      treatment are essential for long-term survival of renal transplants. The DART study validated
      the ability of the non-invasive AlloSure test to measure donor-derived cell-free DNA
      (dd-cfDNA) to discriminate active rejection in a renal transplant recipient. Use of the test
      will inform and may reduce invasive percutaneous renal biopsy procedures among patients with
      risk of rejection.
