  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of imatinib (as
      mesilate) in healthy subjects exposed inhaled lipopolysaccharide. During the study, eight
      oral doses of imatinib, or placebo, will each be taken 12 hours apart, before subjects are
      exposed to nebulized lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Four hours after LPS exposure, a
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) will be undertaken, and BAL fluid (BALF collected. Once study
      assessments are completed, a follow-up visit will be conducted approximately 7 days after the
      last dose of imatinib.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effect of imatinib on LPS-induced
      pulmonary vascular dysfunction. The primary endpoints of this study are:

        1. Change in the number of neutrophils in BALF 6 hours after the LPS challenge in subjects
           exposed to imatinib compared with placebo.

        2. Change in concentration of total protein in BALF 6 hours after the LPS challenge in
           subjects exposed to imatinib compared with placebo
