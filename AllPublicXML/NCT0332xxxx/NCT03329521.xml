  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compared to dialysis, kidney transplantation is associated with improved survival, better
      quality of life and substantial cost savings to healthcare systems.Despite these advantages,
      many individuals with kidney failure never receive a kidney transplant. A multicomponent
      quality improvement initiative was developed to enhance access to kidney transplantation and
      living kidney donation in Ontario's chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs. These CKD programs
      provide care to individuals with reduced kidney function. The initiative includes four main
      components: Data (e.g., data collection and reports to CKD programs about their transplant
      related performance); 2. Education (e.g., education toolkits for CKD program staff, kidney
      patients and families, including living kidney donor candidates); 3. Transplant Ambassadors
      (e.g., kidney transplant recipients and living kidney donors who discuss transplantation and
      living donation to patients and their families) and 4. Administration (e.g., provincial
      administrative support and resources provided to CKD programs to support local work). This
      trial will provide high-quality evidence about the effectiveness of a multicomponent quality
      improvement initiative aimed to enhance access to kidney transplantation and living kidney
      donation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        This is a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial with eligibility criteria detailed
        below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All 26 chronic kidney disease (CKD) programs in Ontario. These programs provide care
             for all chronic dialysis patients in the province. Each CKD program also provides a
             multi-care kidney clinic for patients with advanced CKD who are progressing to
             end-stage renal disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  None. Including all Ontario CKD programs.
