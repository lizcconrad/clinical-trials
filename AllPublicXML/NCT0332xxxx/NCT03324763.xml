  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic tests used to detect Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection are either
      direct and invasive, as in culture, histology and the rapid urease test (RUT) or noninvasive,
      such as serology, the 13C-Urea breathe test or the stool antigen test. However, there is no
      single reference method to detect the H. pylori infection reliably and accurately. The
      specificity of gastric biopsy cultures is 100%, but the sensitivity is lower. Histology and
      RUT provide excellent diagnostic accuracy, but the detection of H. pylori is decreased in
      cases of bleeding peptic ulcers or gastric atrophy. Therefore, it is recommended that at
      least two tests should agree when defining the H. pylori infection in children. Quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based methods have been shown to be the most
      reliable for H. pylori detection in adults and in children. In children, the reference method
      for H. pylori infection detection is invasive, namely upper digestive endoscopy with gastric
      biopsy for histology, culture, RUT and qPCR. A noninvasive alternative to detect H. pylori
      antigen in stools could use a quick one-step immuno-chromatographic technique.

      The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a new quick, noninvasive, one-step
      immuno-chromatographic, stool antigen test (ALERE Inc, Jouy-en-Josas, France) for the
      detection of H. pylori infection in children.
