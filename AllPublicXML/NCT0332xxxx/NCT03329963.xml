  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese older adults will be randomized to participate in either healthy lifestyle intervention
      or behavioral diet and exercise intervention for one year. This study aims to determine the
      effects of Lifestyle intervention on bone microarchitecture, bone strength, bone material
      properties, and the mechanism behind it.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies had suggested that lifestyle therapy (diet plus exercise) resulting in
      weight loss in elderly population improves physical function, cardio metabolic risk factors,
      and cognition/quality of life, but a major complication is loss of BMD. The addition of
      exercise to diet-induced weight loss attenuated but did not eliminate weight-loss-induced
      reduction of BMD. Moreover, while long-term maintenance of weight loss and physical function
      was feasible, sustained lifestyle change led to continued loss of hip BMD, which might
      predict hip fractures. Although similar BMD loss with weight loss has been observed in
      younger populations, BMD loss in older adults might be of particular concern because of
      aggravation of age-related bone loss. Moreover, the belief that obesity protects against
      fractures has now been challenged by studies demonstrating that obesity is associated with
      poor bone quality and ankle and leg fractures.Because of previous lack of options to assess
      bone quality in vivo, there has been little or no scientific study of the possibility that
      lifestyle therapy in obese older adults improves bone quality. This study represents an
      unprecedented opportunity to prove the hypothesis that lifestyle therapy intervention
      improves bone quality and thus, may confer a protective rather than adverse effect on bone
      health. This will be the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) to comprehensively assess
      bone quality using novel techniques in response to lifestyle therapy in obese older adults,
      with major ramifications with regards to defining optimal treatment strategies for this
      increasingly high-risk older population.

    <description>Participants in the this group will receive group educational sessions that focus on diet, exercise, and social support once a month throughout the study.

    <description>The lifestyle modification will be achieved by group behavior therapy sessions designed to have older adults acquire positive weight-control skills/attitudes, and practice weight-maintenance skills.Participants will attend weekly group sessions (10-15 persons), which will last ~75-90 minutes. Visit frequency will be decreased to every 2 wks. from 6 to 12 mos. to prevent &quot;treatment fatigue&quot;. A balanced diet will be prescribed to provide a deficit of 500-750 kcal/day from daily energy requirement.
The exercise sessions are of ~90 min duration (~15 min warm-up of flexibility exercise, followed by ~30 min of aerobic exercise, and after a brief rest period, ~30 min of resistance training, and finally ~15 min balance exercise) conducted three times weekly supervised at our exercise facility for one year. Aerobic exercises consist of treadmill, stationary cycling, and stair climbing.</description>
