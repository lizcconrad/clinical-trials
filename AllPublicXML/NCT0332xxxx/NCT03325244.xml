  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Residency training requires hospital presence twenty-four hours a day. At times this
      necessitates working extended shifts, including night shifts, resulting in altered sleep
      patterns and sleep deprivation. Since 2003, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
      Education (ACGME) has enforced duty hour regulations limiting shift length, the amount of
      weekly hours worked, and other variables governing shift work. Numerous studies have sought
      to determine the impact of duty hour regulations on the quality of patient care and resident
      education.

      In addition to affecting patient care, medical resident sleep deprivation also has the
      potential to affect residents' well-being and their ability to perform basic tasks. A study
      in surgical residents showed reduced efficiency and safety in performing simulated
      laparoscopy following a period of sleep deprivation that was worse with novices compared to
      experienced residents. Recently, UVA found that resident physicians have greater difficulty
      controlling speed and driving performance with increased reaction times and minor and major
      lapses in attention in the driving simulator following six consecutive night shifts.

      To comply with duty hour restrictions, residency programs have adopted various strategies
      including the creation of night float systems where residents are required to work multiple
      nights in a row. Reduced shift length has been associated with decreased medical errors,
      motor vehicle collisions, and percutaneous injuries.Surgical residents who transitioned to a
      night float system from 24-hour call every 3rd day reported reduced fatigue, more time for
      sleep and independent reading and increased family time, while nurses and patients reported
      improved communication and quality of patient care. In a pilot study of urology residents
      assigned to a 12-hour day shift (Monday-Friday), 12-hour night float (Sunday-Friday) or
      24-hour home call, actigraphy was used to measure total sleep time, sleep latency and depth
      of sleep. Night float did not impact total sleep time or quality of sleep. However, these
      studies did not establish the optimal shift duration
