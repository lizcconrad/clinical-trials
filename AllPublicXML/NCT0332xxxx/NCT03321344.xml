      Single arm pilot study to evaluate the safety and initial feasibility of the Neurolyser XR, a
      new portable high intensity focused ultrasound device, for noninvasive thermal ablation of
      medial nerve branches of painful lumbar facet joint/s

    <textblock>
      Study design: Prospective, single arm

      Timeline: six month enrollment period and 12 months follow-up period.

      Sites: The study will be conducted at McGill University.

      Study population: Ten adult patients diagnosed with facet related low back pain.

      Primary study objective: Safety and efficacy of the Neurolyser XR for the treatment of facet
      related low back pain.

      Safety would be evaluated by the incidence and severity of treatment related adverse events
      Efficacy would be evaluated by the changes in average pain score and Rolland Morris
      Disability Questionnaire between baseline and 6 months.
