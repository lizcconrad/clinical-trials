        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical unequivocal diagnosis of Alopecia Areata (patchy, univeralis and totalis), on
             both scalp and eyebrows as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Maximal disease duration of current episode of Alopecia Areata on the eyebrows of 3
             years at screening.

          -  Maximal Alopecia Areata disease duration - defined as years of active disease - in
             other locations than eyebrows of 10 years at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of diffuse type alopecia areata as assessed by the investigator.

          -  Any topical, intralesional therapy or procedure applied within 2 cm of the treatment
             area, within 4 weeks of randomisation, which in the opinion of the investigator, could
             interfere with the trial assessments. This includes, but is not limited to:
             corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, calcipotriol, minoxidil, antimicrobials,
             prostaglandin analogs (e.g. bimatoprost), herbal extracts, topical immunotherapy with
             allergens or irritants and any laser or phototherapy, and eyebrow tattoo.

          -  Any systemic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. methotrexate, cyclosporine,
             azathioprine), chloroquin derivatives, corticosteroids (including intralesional
             treatment outside the trial treatment area), or any other systemic therapy that in the
             opinion of the investigator could affect hair regrowth, within 4 weeks prior to
             randomisation.

          -  Any biologic medicinal product targeting the immune system within 5 half-lives and
             minimum 4 weeks prior to randomisation (e.g. anti-TNFα, anti-IL17, anti IL12/23, anti
             IL-4Rα targeting drugs).

          -  Systemic JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Jakafi®/Jakavi®), Tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) at any
             time prior to randomisation.
