      Inclusion criteria:

      Goup &quot;A&quot;: Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome at reproductive age (20-35) diagnosed
      according to Rotterdam criteria and underwent laparoscopic ovarian drilling from more than
      two years.

      Goup &quot;B&quot;: Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome at reproductive age (20-35) diagnosed
      according to Rotterdam criteria and didn't undergo laparoscopic ovarian drilling

      Anti-mullerian hormone (as an indicator for ovarian reserve) will be measured for the two
      groups and data collected will be compared
