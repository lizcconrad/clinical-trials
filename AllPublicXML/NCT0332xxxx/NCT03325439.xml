    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of brivaracetam (BRV) in
      neonates who have seizures that are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital (PB)
      treatment and to identify the optimal BRV dose (Exploratory Cohort) for the treatment of
      subjects enrolled into the Confirmatory Cohorts of this study

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmation on video-electroencephalography (VEEG) of &gt;= 2 minutes of cumulative
             electroencephalographic neonatal seizures (ENS), or &gt;=3 identifiable ENS within the 2
             hours prior to entering the Evaluation Period, despite receiving phenobarbital (PB)

             the 2-hour period must be confirmed either by the local or central VEEG reader prior
             to drug administration. Preferably, the central VEEG reader should confirm the
             required ENS. If a qualified VEEG reader is available, a local VEEG reader may be
             used.

          -  Subject is male or female with an age at birth of 34 weeks to less than 42 weeks of
             gestational age (GA) and up to 28 days of postnatal age at the time of enrollment

          -  Subject weighs at least 2.3 kg at the time of enrollment

          -  Subjects with or without concomitant hypothermia treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

             doses of phenobarbital (PB) [total therapeutic administered dose of 20 to 40mg/kg] for
             the treatment of repeated seizures) prior to entering the Evaluation Period.

          -  Subject with seizures responding to PB (total therapeutic administered dose of 20 to
             40mg/kg), pyridoxine treatment, or correction of metabolic disturbances (hypoglycemia,
             hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia)

          -  Subject has a poor prognosis for survival, as judged by the Investigator

          -  Subject has 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) of any of the following: aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
             with the following exception: For subjects with perinatal asphyxia, elevation of ALT,
             AST or ALP up to 5 x ULN is acceptable, if initial and peak elevation of liver
             function tests (LFTs) occurs within 5 days after birth, and if the time course of LFT
             elevation is compatible with hepatic injury due to perinatal asphyxia. The
             determinations of ULN will be based on the subject's gestational age (GA) and the
             site's normal range values for the respective GA

          -  Subject requires extra corporeal membrane oxygenation

          -  Subject has seizures related to prenatal maternal drug use or drug withdrawal

          -  Subject has known severe disturbance of hemostasis, as assessed by the Investigator
