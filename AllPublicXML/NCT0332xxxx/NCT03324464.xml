  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the current project is to assess the efficacy of Central Executive Training (CET)
      for youth with ADHD. CET is a new, computerized training intervention that targets specific
      components of the working memory system. Two versions of CET were developed as part of our
      R34, each targeting a different combinations of executive functions. The final CET protocol
      reflects the contributions and feedback of a diverse group of caregivers, children with ADHD,
      and recognized experts in human cognition, ADHD treatment research, randomized control trial
      (RCT) intervention design methods, serious game theory and task design, cognitive training,
      and the role of executive dysfunction in ADHD.
