  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients using multiple drugs including generics have found different solutions to manage
      their medication. During a Polymedication-Check (medication review type 2a service in
      community pharmacies) additional information about the organisation of patients' medication
      in daily life will be compiled in Swiss community pharmacies. Data will allow to better
      address patients' needs in their medication organisation and comprehension of generics.

    <measure>Insight in patients' organisation of polymedication</measure>
    <time_frame>retrospective 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients organise their multiple medications differently in daily life. The study will investigate the different organisation strategies to get a better understanding of patients' behaviour. The behaviour is assessed with a questionnaire containing 14 questions on the management of medication including single choice, multiple choice and free text questions. As example the number of patients already using a medication organisation system will be assessed, the number of patients using a weekly or daily pillbox will be assessed, and who is filling the medication organisation system.</description>

    <measure>Insight in patients' comprehension of generics</measure>
    <time_frame>retrospective 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients have a different comprehension of generics including their advantages and disadvantages. The study will investigate patients' comprehension of generics to get a better understanding of patients' behaviour. The comprehension is assessed with a questionnaire containing 4 questions on the believes about generics including single choice, multiple choice and free text questions. As example the number of patients knowing that they use generics is assessed and the patient's personal opinion on advantages and disadvantages of generics is investigated.</description>

    <time_frame>retrospective 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prevalence of present and/or past swallowing difficulties and coping strategies will be assessed. A specific question (from SWAMECO) on the experienced swallowing difficulties is asked and will be answered on a visual analog scale (0 to 100%). If swallowing-difficulties are present, 2 more questions are asked: Which medication is difficult to swallow and how medication is altered in order to be able to swallow them.</description>

        The study population comprises adults (18 years and older) with at least 4 prescribed
        medicines which they are taking for at least 3 months. One of those medicines must be a
        generic drug, one must be prescribed for a cardiovascular condition (ATC C01-10). Patients
        cannot have their medication provided in a Multicompartment Compliance Aid or a similar
        device by a specific service like home care, pharmacy or home for elderly.
