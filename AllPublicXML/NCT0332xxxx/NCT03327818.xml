      AIM OF THE WORK The aim of the study is to compare the maternal morbidity and mortality
      between obstetric hysterectomy and conservative surgery for pregnant ladies &gt; 28 weeks with
      placenta accreta during caesarean section at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital in the
      last five years and prospective study in the next six months.

      Hypothesis In women with placenta accrete undergoing hysterectomy may be similar to
      conservative surgery as regard maternal morbidity and mortality.

      The study included all cases of placenta accreta that were diagnosed preoperative or
      intra-operative and treated by conservative surgery or by hysterectomy during caesarean
      section between January 2011 to December 2015 at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital and
      from July 2016 to January 2017.

      The collected data will be categorized according to the way of management and will be
      analyzed regarding:

      Mortality rates.

      Intraoperative morbidities:

      Blood loss and it's amount and need for transfusion. Amount of blood and blood products
      transferred. Injury to adjacent organs eg: bladder or bowel injury.

      Early postoperative morbidities:

      Blood and blood product transfusion Length of maternal Hospital admission post operative
      Acquiring intensive care unit admission and identifying the cause and duration Wound sepsis
      Septic shock Peritonitis DVT Acute pulmonary embolism Hysterectomy after conservative
      management and its indication Wound dehiscence Burst abdomen

      Late postoperative morbidities:

      Anemia Recurrence of placenta accretes in next pregnancy. Hysterectomy after conservative
      management and its indication Uterine necrosis Fistula eg. urinary fistula
