  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One common anesthetic that is performed for total knee replacement surgery is spinal
      anesthesia with an adductor canal regional block, which involves injecting numbing medication
      in the thigh region for pain control after surgery. The aim of this study is to determine
      whether the addition of another regional block called obturator nerve block, which involves
      injecting numbing medication in the upper thigh region, will improve pain control after
      surgery while not sacrificing mobility after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no consensus on the optimal strategy that provides the most effective
      postoperative analgesia while preserving ambulation and limiting side effects such as nausea
      and vomiting. The clinical team's hypothesis is that the obturator nerve block in addition to
      adductor canal block can target both the anterior and posterior distribution of nerves to the
      knee to provide superior analgesia while not limiting ambulation. To test this hypothesis,
      the clinical team will compare the rate of IV opioid consumption in patients who receive a
      combination of adductor canal block and obturator nerve block at the surgical site versus
      patients who receive adductor canal block alone.
