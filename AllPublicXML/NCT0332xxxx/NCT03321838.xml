  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed specifically to determine the short-term effect of OBVAT on
      intermittent exotropia in terms of 4 key areas (Standardizing reported outcomes of surgery
      for intermittent exotropia): control score, alignment, near stereoacuity and quality of life
      score. Result of this pilot study will be used to determine whether a full-scale RCT should
      be conducted to evaluate the short and long term effectiveness of OBVAT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 8 to 18 years old

          2. deviation meeting all of the following criteria: A. intermittent or constant exotropia
             at distance (mean of 3 baseline assessments of distance control&gt; or = Grade 2) B.
             intermittent exotropia at near (at least 1 of 3 assessments of near control at the
             baseline visit Grade 2-4) C. distance and near exodeviation both between 15 to 35
             prism diopters (PD) measured by prism and alternate cover test (PACT); D. near
             deviation not exceeding the distance deviation by &gt;10PD by PACT (i.e., convergence
             insufficiency type IXT excluded)

          3. cycloplegic objective refraction spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error between
             -6.00 diopters (D)and +1.00 D inclusive in either eye

          4. Patients must be wearing the updated refractive correction (spectacles or contact
             lenses) for at least 1 week if refractive error (based on cycloplegic refraction
             performed within 6 months) meets any of the following:

             A. Myopia &gt;-0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye B. Anisometropia &gt;1.00 D
             spherical equivalent C. Astigmatism in either eye &gt;1.50 D

          5. Refractive correction must meet the following guidelines:

             A. Anisometropia spherical equivalent must be within 0.25 D of the full anisometropic
             difference B. Astigmatism cylinder must be within 0.25 D of full correction and axis
             must be within 5 degree C. For hyperopia and myopia, the spherical component can be
             reduced by investigator discretion provided reduction is symmetrical and results in
             residual (i.e., uncorrected) spherical equivalent refractive error that does not
             exceed +1.50 D spherical equivalent hyperopia or -0.50 D spherical equivalent myopia

          6. Gestational age &gt;34 weeks

             spectacles more than 0.50 D)

          9. No vision therapy or orthoptics for any reason within the last year

         10. No prior strabismus surgery or botulinum injection, intraocular surgery, or refractive

             of resolution units of interocular difference and &gt; or = 0.3 logarithm of the minimum
             angle of resolution units in one eye ( Variability of stereoacuity in intermittent
             exotropia)

          3. Regular use of any ocular or systemic medications known to affect accommodation or
             vergence system, such as atropine, pirenzepine, and anti-epileptic medications in

          5. Relocation anticipated for 2 years；

          6. Significant ocular or neurologic disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy) other than strabismus
