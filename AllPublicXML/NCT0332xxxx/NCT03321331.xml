      WaznApp study is a 12-week randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the feasibility and
      preliminary efficacy of a self-directed behavioral weight-loss intervention targeting
      employees of an academic institution, using two popular consumer mobile applications for
      weight loss. The hypothesis is that individuals assigned to the app that provides interactive
      feedback and proactively motivates engagement in healthy behaviors (eating healthily and
      being more active) will be significantly better than those who receive the comparison
      condition (a simple calorie tracking app).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Recent reviews show that popular mobile apps for weight loss and weight
      management embed elements that are commonly associated with behavior change, such as setting
      goals, self-reporting and monitoring behavior, and prompting feedback on performance. These
      technologies show good potential for developing interventions for the prevention of
      noncommunicable diseases. Despite their potential, little is known about how these changes
      can occur and the way end-users perceive and use these apps. Few studies tested if commercial
      apps for weight management can be used in interventions for behavior change.

      PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a self-directed weight-loss
      intervention targeting employees of an academic institution, using consumer mobile
      applications for weight loss (Lark and MyFitnessPal).

      SETTING: American University of Beirut campus and Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.

      PARTICIPANTS: Employees (adults aged 18+), with criteria of being able to read, write, and
      understand English, being owners of a mobile phone with either Android (v4.4 or above) or
      iPhone operative system (v8 or later); in better controlling their weight, and provide
      written informed consent to participate in the trial.

      RESEARCH DESIGN: The study is a single-center, parallel randomized controlled trial with two
      study arms (intervention and control). The intervention arm will use Lark, a mobile coach
      app, which provides a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) by providing motivational
      feedback, goal setting, and emotional social support, among other change techniques. The
      control group will use MyFitnessPal, a calorie-counting app, which does not include JITAI
      components, but allows users to keep track of their caloric intake and energy expenditure.

      EXPECTED IMPACT: This project will provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of weight
      management apps, promoting behavior change among employees of an academic workplace. The
      results will inform larger scale studies targeting this population in Lebanon, and will be
      used as benchmark for further investigations in other settings and with other target groups.

    <masking_description>Assessments regarding body weight and waist circumference will be conducted by nurses at the University Health Services clinics, who are blind to treatment allocation. The assessor will go through an assessment training program and will be informed about the study, but not about the allocation or treatments. Due to the nature of the intervention neither participants nor staff can be blinded to allocation, but are strongly inculcated not to disclose the allocation status of the participant at the follow up assessments.</masking_description>

    <description>Measured through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, short form (IPAQ-SF). IPAQ-SF requires respondents to estimate how much time they spent while doing activities in the previous week, in four domains: vigorous or moderate physical activity, walking and sitting. A total physical activity score is calculated by summing the time spent in each domain. Total physical activity score and sub-domain scores can be expressed in hours/week, or converted to metabolic-equivalents (METs), following the IPAQ scoring protocol.</description>

    <description>Automated Self-Administered 24-hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool, version 2016, developed by the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD. The multiple pass approach in 24-hour recall consists of 8 modules: a meal based quick list, meal gap review, detail pass, final review, forgotten foods, last chance, usual intake question and supplements module. It provides a detailed assessment of dietary intake over the past 24 hours including food, drinks and supplements, as well as timing, form, portion size, the way food has been prepared, consumption of additions such as sugar, cream, dressing, etc., in addition to the source/brand of food. The 2016 version of the system includes also pictures of portions which are deemed to reduce overestimation or underestimation of food intake.</description>

    <description>App quality will be assessed through the user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale - uMARS. The uMARS scale provides a measure of app quality based on the average of four sub-domains: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information. Each of the sub-domains is based on the average value of multiple items, assessed through 5-point Likert scales (engagement: 5 items; functionality and information: 4 items; aesthetics: 3 items). The uMARS includes also 4 items that are aimed to address a subjective quality domain, which are: Would you recommend this app to people who might benefit from it? How many times do you think you would use this app in the future if it was relevant to you? Would you pay for this app? What is your overall star rating of the app?</description>

    <description>Participants in the intervention arm will use for 12 weeks the pro version of a mHealth app called &quot;Lark&quot;, developed by Lark Technologies Ltd. Lark is a coach app, which uses several variables to generate smart and empathic conversations. Variables include activity, sleep, meals, weight, and height data, weight goal set by the user/Lark coach, activity goal set by user/Lark coach, starchy food goal set by user/Lark coach. Lark uses all these variables to create a dynamic coaching system, constantly changing and adapting to the user in the moment and over time. For these features, Lark provides a just in time adaptive intervention (JITAI).</description>

    <description>Participants in the control arm will be assigned to use MyFitnessPal. Similar to the intervention arm, they will be instructed to use the app for 12 weeks. MyFitnessPal does not include JITAI components, but allows users to keep track of their caloric intake and energy expenditure. MyFitnessPal has features that can be associated with effective behavior change techniques, including: self-monitoring of behavior and outcomes, goal setting and feedback (similar to Lark). In MyFitnessPal, social support is limited to comments and 'likes' from friends of its restricted user community, therefore tackling the techniques of &quot;social comparisons&quot; and &quot;social reward&quot;.</description>

    <description>MyFitnessPal (MFP) is a calorie counting app, which relies on user input for food tracking, but automatically tracks activity through the phone or through integrations with wearable devices. This app provides allows to set weight and caloric goals, review them and to receive feedback, but it has limited social support, a feature that is generally lacking in calorie-counting apps.</description>
