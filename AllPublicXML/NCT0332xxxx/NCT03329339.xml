  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background 2L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (PEGA) is known to be as effective as
      standard 4L polyethylene glycol for bowel preparation. However, the volume of this regimen is
      still large. Therefore, the present investigators evaluated the potential of 1L PEGA with
      prepackaged low-residue diet (PLD) for an alternative to 2L PEGA.

      Aim: To evaluate efficacy of 1L PEG with ascorbic acid combined with prepackaged low-residue
      diet as bowel preparation for colonoscopy.

      Methods: The subjects were randomly assigned to either groups. PEGA group received 2L PEGA
      split regimen. PLD group received PLD on the day preceding colonoscopy and 1L PEGA on the
      morning of colonoscopy. One blinded physician performed colonoscopy and evaluated the degree
      of bowel preparation using Boston bowel preparation score (BBPS). A questionnaire regarding
      tolerability and safety were also gathered.

    <description>Definition: Achievement of preparation adequacy was defined by as having BBPS scores of 2 or 3 for all colon segments.
BBPS was measured by Physician who performing colonoscopy. To maintain precise evaluation, the physician participated in an online training program from www.cori.org/bbps. For each colon segment, BBPS preparation score ranged 0 to 3. Definition of BBPS are presented at www.cori.org/bbps</description>

    <measure>Tolerability and adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>assessed at the colonoscopy day</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability and adverse events were measured by comprehensive questionnaire. Participants were asked about the presence of distressing symptoms, such as abdominal pain/discomfort or nausea/vomiting, and if they had problems taking the entire dose. The subjects also reported the percentage of the preparation they completed (100%, 90~99%, &lt;90%), regardless of solution or meals. Adverse events are categorized by CTCAE v4.03.</description>

    <description>Participants who were allocated to the 2 L PEG with ascorbic acid (PEGA) group took 250 ml of PEG with ascorbic acid at 15-min intervals, completing 1 L of the PEG with ascorbic acid protocol at 8:00 PM on the day prior to the procedure. The remaining 1 L of the PEG with ascorbic acid solution was administered in the same manner at 6:00 AM on the day of the procedure. Participants assigned to the 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid with PLD (PLD) group consumed a prepackaged, low residue diet (ZeroCol, Korea Medical Food Inc., Seoul, Korea) which consisted of a breakfast, lunch and dinner, the day prior to colonoscopy. The Participants took 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid solution at 6:00 AM on the day of the colonoscopy in the same way as described above. All of the subjects ingested 500 mL of water for every 1 L of 1 L PEG with ascorbic acid solution consumed. The Participants completed all of the administrations at least 2 hours before the colonoscopy.</description>
