  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present project is to compare High-Flow Nasal Oxygen therapy with Standard
      Oxygen therapy, initiated in the prehospital setting in patients with acute hypoxemia
      respiratory failure, in terms of oxygenation at arrival to the hospital and need of
      mechanical ventilation during the subsequent 28 days
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with respiratory distress and an SpO2 below 90% in the prehospital setting will be
      randomized to receive either high-flow nasal oxygen therapy through a dedicated device or
      standard oxygen therapy through standard devices such as nasal cannula or face mask. Need of
      mechanical ventilation either invasive or noninvasive from enrollment to day 28 and time
      course of oxygenation between first SpO2 measured on scene and arrival to the hospital will
      be the main outcome measures.
