      This research study is being done to assess the safety and tolerability of study drugs,
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate (Lutathera) and nivolumab in subjects with small cell lung cancer
      or advanced or inoperable neuroendocrine tumor of the lung that has overexpressed
      somatostatin receptors (SSRT). Lutathera is an investigational radioactive agent that targets
      tumor cells that express SSRT. Nivolumab is an investigational agent that targets and
      inhibits a pathway that prevents your immune system from effectively fighting your cancer.
      The combination of these 2 study drugs is investigational. The term &quot;Investigational&quot; in this
      context means that the drugs have not been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA).

      Giving Lutathera and nivolumab together may increase the effectiveness of this therapy. We
      first need to find out the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given safely together with
      nivolumab. This study will be the first study to test giving Lutathera together with
      nivolumab. Once we have found the highest dose of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab,
      we will treat more patients with this combination to determine how effective it is.

      The purposes of this study are:

      To find the highest doses of Lutathera that can be given with nivolumab without causing
      severe side effects.

      To find out the side effects seen by giving Lutathera at different dose levels with
      nivolumab.

      To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called PD-L1 makes you more likely to
      have a response to the combination of Lutathera and nivolumab.

      The purpose of this project to see if the combination of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and
      nivolumab is safe and tolerable, and provides PFS benefit compared to observation alone in
      the maintenance setting in patients with ES-SCLC and no disease progression after first-line
      platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. A standard dose-escalation phase I
      design will be used. Three subjects will be enrolled at each dose level in the absence of
      DLT.

      Selection of the starting dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and nivolumab is based on the
      results from previous clinical studies with each compound used as single agent and the fact
      that the combination has not been tested in clinical trials. The first dose of
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be given two weeks after the first administration of
      nivolumab. Studies have shown that intravenous administration of amino acids has a renal
      protective effect [46]. An infusion of amino acids (lysine 2.5% and arginine 2.5% in 1 L 0.9%
      NaCl; 250 mL/h) will be started 30 minutes before the administration of
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and last 4 hours.

      Nivolumab will be administered as a fixed dose of 240 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30
      minutes every 2 weeks. Nivolumab will be given until progressive disease, patient withdrawal
      or toxicities.

      The phase II portion will consist of patients with ES-SCLC who completed platinum based
      standard first-line chemotherapy (e.g. 4-6 cycles of platinum plus etoposide or irinotecan)
      without disease progression (responders plus stable disease) at the time of initiation of the
      combination therapy with 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and nivolumab. Eligible patients will
      then be randomly allocated in two arms: one will be treated with the combination of
      177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate and nivolumab, and the other arm will continue be followed
      (observation) after completion the standard chemotherapy treatment.

      Randomization:

      Patients who do not receive radiotherapy after chemotherapy

        -  The randomization must occur within 6 weeks of the last chemotherapy cycle.

        -  The study treatment must start within 2 weeks from randomization. Patients who receive
           radiotherapy (including prophylactic cranial radiation and/or thoracic radiation) after
           chemotherapy

        -  The randomization must occur within 9 weeks of the last chemotherapy cycle but at least
           2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.

        -  The first dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate cannot be given within 8 weeks of
           radiotherapy.

      Randomization process:

        -  Randomization will be stratified according to NETSPOTÂ® PET tumor uptake score (Grade 2,
           3 and 4).

        -  OnCore will be used as statistical center and the randomization algorithm will be
           developed by the study biostatistician.

        -  The project management department will be the first point of contact for assessment
           through email.

      Courses are defined as 56 days of dosing. Nivolumab will be given until progressive disease,
      patient withdrawal, or toxicities. For patients randomized to the observation group,
      cross-over at the time of disease progression will be allowed, since the primary endpoint is
      PFS and not OS.

    <description>177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be administered every 8 weeks. The first dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate will be given two weeks after the first administration of nivolumab. Each dose is infused over 30 minutes. On the day of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate infusion, an intravenous bolus of anti-emetics will be given (suggested options: ondansetron (8 mg), granisetron (3 mg), or tropisetron (5 mg)). Administration of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate may be given one day earlier or delayed up to 1 week due to holidays, inclement weather, conflicts, or similar reasons.
Concurrent amino acids are given with each dose of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate since co-infusion of amino acids leads to a significant reduction (47%) in the mean radiation dose to the kidneys. The amino acid solution and 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate are administered in parallel by peripheral vein infusion</description>
