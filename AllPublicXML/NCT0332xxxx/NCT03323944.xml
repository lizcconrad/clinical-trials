      This study will evaluate an immunotherapy approach to pancreatic cancer, where patients' own
      immune cells are engineered to treat their cancer. Specifically, the study will determine the
      safety and feasibility of intravenous administration of transduced huCART-meso cells in
      patients with histologically confirmed unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
      with and without cyclophosphamide as lymphodepleting chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study evaluating the safety and feasibility of lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells in 3 cohorts with and without cyclophosphamide in a 3+3 dose escalation
      design.

      The trial will begin in Cohort 1 and progress to Cohorts 2 and 3 chronologically, depending
      upon dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment. Subjects will be enrolled serially, but
      infusions will be staggered to allow assessment of DLTs for determination of cohort
      progression, expansion, or dose de-escalation.

      Cohort 1 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^7 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Cohort 2 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0 without any conditioning chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Cohort 3 subjects (N=3-6) will receive a single dose of 1-3x10^8 /m^2 lentiviral transduced
      huCART-meso cells on day 0, following a flat dose of 1 gram/m^2 of cyclophosphamide
      administered 2-4 days prior to the huCART-meso cells (day -4 to day -2).

      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level at which 0 or 1 subject among 6
      subjects in one cohort experiences a DLT within the dose range specified.

             or anticipated treatment with another investigational product while on study. This
             refers to non-commercially approved investigational drugs different than those used in
             this protocol.

          2. Active invasive cancer other than pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Patients with active
             non-invasive cancers (such as non-melanoma skin cancer, superficial cervical and
             bladder cancer, or prostate cancer with PSA level &lt; 1.0) are not excluded.

             anti-emetic prophylaxis on the day of cyclophosphamide administration is allowed per
             institutional guidance.

          8. Patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy.

          9. Prior therapy with lentiviral gene modified cells.

             according to the New York Heard Association Classification (see Appendix 2) or other
             cardiovascular condition that would preclude assessment of mesothelin induced
             pericarditis or that may worsen as a result of toxicities expected for this study.
