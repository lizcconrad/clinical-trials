    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of CT-guided needle guidance
      using stereotaxic unit, navigation versus conventional biopsy technique for the patients
      scheduled to undergo percutaneous pulmonary nodule biopsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with localized lesions such as pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray, CT or PET CT

          -  Histopathologic examination is necessary if lung lesion is unknown

          -  Histologic findings affect the disease stage or treatment plan

          -  If the investigator decides to perform a percutaneous lung biopsy because the biopsy
             or diagnosis through the bronchoscopy is not possible or has low risk-benefit

          -  Patient who have consented to contraception during the period of clinical trial
             participation (one month after the procedure)

          -  Patient who voluntarily agree to participate in this clinical trial and are willing to
             comply with the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with pulmonary function insufficiency

          -  Patient who has difficulty in self-breathing (e.g, breathing through oxygen breathing
             apparatus)

          -  Patient with Uncontrolled coagulation disorders (INR &gt; 1.3 or Blood platelet count &lt;
             50,000/µl)

          -  Patient with allergy to CT contrast agent

          -  Patient under 19 years old or over 80 years old

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Patient with uncontrollable systemic disease (e.g, uncontrolled hypertension,
             uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, etc.)

          -  Patient who currently participating or has participated in other clinical trials
             within 30 days of the screening date

          -  If it is judged inappropriate to participate in this clinical trial under the judgment
             of the investigator
