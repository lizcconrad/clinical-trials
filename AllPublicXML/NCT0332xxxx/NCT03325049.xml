  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: We investigated the outcomes of a nurse-led family intervention, Health Promoting
      Conversations, which focused on family functioning and wellbeing in families with a
      critically ill member.

      Study design: This randomized controlled pilot study used a pre-test, post-test design with
      intervention and control groups to investigate the outcomes of the nurse-led intervention in
      17 families.

      Outcome measures: The Health Promoting Conversations intervention was evaluated using
      validated instruments that measure family functioning and family wellbeing: the General
      Functioning sub-scale from the McMaster Family Assessment Device; the Family Sense of
      Coherence, the Herth Hope Index, and the Medical Outcome Short-Form Health Survey.
      Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used to analyse the data.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized control trial (RCT) used a pre-test, post-test design with intervention and
      control groups.

      In the intervention group, there were 3 health-promoting conversations with each family after
      the discharge. The health-promoting conversations were held within an approximately 4- to
      8-week period with an interval of 2 weeks between conversations. A closing letter was sent 2
      to 3 weeks after the final conversation that summarized all of the conversations and that
      provided further opportunities for reflection.

      Baseline data were collected to assess family functioning and wellbeing in the intervention
      group and the control group 1-2 months after the critical illness and before the start of the
      intervention. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3 and 12 months after the intervention for
      both groups. Additionally, background data, including health history, were collected using a
      self-administered questionnaire that asked about age; sex; education level; habits like
      smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity; psychosocial support; co-morbidity; and
      risk of mortality. The latter was calculated using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Charlson
      et al., 1987).

      The main outcome variables in this study were family functioning and family wellbeing. The
      following instruments were used in this study: 1) General Functioning (GF) sub-scale from the
      McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD); 2) Family Sense of Coherence (F-SOC/F-KASAM); 3)
      Herth Hope Index (HHI); and 4) Medical Outcome Short-Form health survey (SF-36).

    <description>e GF is a 12-item scale designed to measure self-reported perceived overall 15 family functioning (Wright and Leahey, 2009, 2013). Each item is rated on a four-point 16 Likert scale: 'strongly agree' = 1, 'agree' = 2, 'disagree' = 3 and 'strongly disagree' = 4. The 17 scale scores ranges from 12 to 48, with lower scores indicating better family functioning. The 18 GF was translated into Swedish and has been pilot tested in Swedish samples, and the scale 19 has shown satisfactory reliability and acceptable validity of 0.90 (Bylund et al., 2015). The 20 reliability coefficient alpha was 0.45 in this study.</description>
