      Introduction: The osteoarthrosis is incurable, one of the most incapacitating disease around
      the world and your prevalence is increasing every year. The main consequences of this disease
      is pain and loss of functionality as a result of biomechanical limitations coming from
      articular inflammation. Among the variability of therapeutic resources, we propose MatPilates
      like a no drug intervention, that probably will contribute for a decrease in the symptoms of
      this disease.

      Objective: It is hypothesized that MatPilates is a method capable of decrease pain and
      increase functionality in elderly woman with osteoarthrosis.

      Methods: This study is a randomized double blind clinical trial, in which the volunteer need
      be in between 60 and 69 years old. Will be formed of two groups: MatPilates Group (MG) and
      Control Group (CG), and the ideal &quot;n&quot; will be calculated in a pilot study.

    <description>In the beginning was nominated Contrology, but today is known as Pilates. Created by Joseph Humbertus Pilates. This technique is based on respiration, balance, flexibility, proprioception and muscular strength. One of the main work is on the power house (core), biomechanical axis of the body, composed of muscles: rectus abdominis, paravertebral, multifidus, diaphragm, and those of the perineal center.</description>

    <description>The MatPilates program was specialized developed for this trial, in which all exercises belong to contemporaneous Pilates style. Each session has 60 minutes of duration, divided in three blocs (stretching, exercise and relaxation), with mean of 10, 40 and 10 minutes respectively (VIEIRA et al., 2016). Each exercise will be performed in one series of 10 to 15 repetitions and will be modified accordingly the patient need.</description>
