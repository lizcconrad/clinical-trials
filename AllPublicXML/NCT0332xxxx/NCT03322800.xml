    <textblock>
      This study will characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AK0529, the effect of food and
      evaluate the safety of AK0529 in healthy Chinese adult subjects. 50 subjects will be
      randomized to receive a dose level of AK0529 or placebo in five groups. The total study
      duration will be approximately 18-27 days for each subject.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, Phase I study in
      healthy Chinese subjects. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of AK0529,
      characterize the PK of AK0529 and to evaluate the effect of food in healthy Chinese subjects.
      50 healthy Chinese subjects will be randomized to orally receive one of four dose levels of
      AK0529 (single dose:100 mg and 300 mg, Multiple dose: 600 mg, Cross-over Food Effect: 300 mg)
      or placebo. The total duration of the study will be approximately 18 to 27 days for each
      subject.
