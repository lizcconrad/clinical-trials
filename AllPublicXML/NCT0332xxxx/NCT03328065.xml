  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflexion on the therapeutic strategies to implement in patients at the end of life is
      advancing rapidly in France. However, beyond the choices presented to patients, sometimes
      even the decision to carry on, to limit or to stop treatments is also questioned. This
      decision is subjective; it is influenced by the patient's representation system (emotions,
      beliefs, values, practices, etc). In addition, even though he or she is the focus of the
      decision, the patient is not alone; other actors, accompanying the patient, play an important
      role in the final decision making. These actors, namely the doctors and close relatives, are
      also influenced in their decision making. This coexistence of representation systems may
      interfere with objective indicators that help in decision making (functional, clinical and
      biological) or with the knowledge acquired by doctors in their training and may complicate
      the decision-making process.
