  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate whether the spacing of the interrupted deep (subdermal)
      sutures affects surgical wound cosmesis on the trunk and extremities. In other words, the
      investigator would like to determine which of the following yields a more cosmetically
      appealing scar: many closely approximated subdermal sutures or fewer, more widely spaced
      subdermal sutures. The investigator wishes to compare the effects of one versus two
      centimeter spacing between sutures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sutures are the standard of care in repairing cutaneous wounds. The majority of surgical
      reconstructions following a Mohs micrographic surgery and standard surgical excisions require
      two layers of sutures: a deep layer and a top layer. The deep layer dissolves naturally
      whereas the top layer must be removed.

      This study aims to investigate whether the spacing of the interrupted deep (subdermal)
      sutures affects surgical wound cosmesis on the trunk and extremities. In other words, the
      investigator would like to determine which of the following yields a more cosmetically
      appealing scar: many closely approximated subdermal sutures or fewer, more widely spaced
      subdermal sutures. The investigator wishes to compare the effects of one versus two
      centimeter spacing between sutures. It is possible that fewer, more widely spaced sutures may
      leave more open space in the wound, leaving more tension to pull on those few sutures,
      possibly encouraging the wound to dehisce and make it harder to approximate the wound edges
      yielding a less cosmetically appealing scar compared to placing many closely approximated
      sutures which would decrease the tension and likely better approximate the wound edges
      yielding a more cosmetically appealing scar. On the other hand, we may find that suture
      spacing has no effect on wound cosmesis and that placing fewer, more widely spaced sutures is
      much more time efficient. The investigator may also find that the effect of suture spacing on
      wound cosmesis is dependent on wound tension. For example, perhaps the suture pacing would
      have no effect on the cosmesis of a wound under no tension, however, for a wound under high
      tension, it is possible that many closely approximated sutures would yield better cosmetic
      results for the reasons listed above.
