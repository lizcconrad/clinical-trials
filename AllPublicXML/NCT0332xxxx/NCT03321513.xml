  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both aflibercept and bevacizumab have been shown to improve vision in eyes with DME. In eyes
      with DME and at least moderate vision loss, both aflibercept and bevacizumab were also shown
      to be successful in many eyes. However, aflibercept was shown to be more effective at
      improving vision, on average, at 1 year and at 2 years. Due to the large cost difference
      between the two drugs, many clinicians and patients are choosing to initiate treatment with
      bevacizumab and then switch to aflibercept depending on the eye's response to bevacizumab
      treatment. However, there is no scientific evidence that this treatment strategy is as
      effective at improving vision as initiating treatment with aflibercept. Patients and
      clinicians do not know if this approach ultimately has deleterious effects on visual acuity.
      If starting with aflibercept is not better than starting with bevacizumab and switching to
      aflibercept if needed, the potential cost savings to future patients and the health care
      system would be substantial. However, if starting with aflibercept is better, then patients,
      clinicians, and health care providers can make informed decisions for how to best treat
      patients with DME and at least moderate vision loss.

      Study Objectives To compare the efficacy of intravitreous aflibercept with intravitreous
      bevacizumab + deferred aflibercept if needed in eyes with CI DME and moderate vision loss

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Participant-level Criteria Inclusion

        To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met:

          1. Age ≥ 18 years • Individuals &lt;18 years old are not being included because DME is so
             rare in this age group that the diagnosis of DME may be questionable.

          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

               -  Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that
                  diabetes is present:

             Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes Current regular use of
             oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes Documented diabetes by
             American Diabetes Association and/or World Health Organization criteria

          3. At least one eye meets the study eye criteria listed.

          4. Able and willing to provide informed consent.

             Exclusion

             An individual is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present:

          5. Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          6. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

               -  Individuals in poor glycemic control who, within the last four months, initiated
                  intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do
                  so in the next four months should not be enrolled.

          7. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that
             involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the
             indication being studied at the time of study entry.

             • Note: study participants cannot receive another investigational drug while
             participating in the study.

          8. Known allergy to any component of the study drug or any drug used in the injection
             prep (including povidone iodine prep).

          9. Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110).

             • If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment,
             individual can become eligible.

         10. Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within four months prior to randomization or
             anticipated use during the study.

             • These drugs cannot be used during the study.

         11. For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 24 months.

             • Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential
             for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is
             needed.

         12. Individual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not
             covered by another clinical center during the next two years.

        Study Eye Criteria The study participant must have at least one eye meeting all of the
        inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed below.

        Study participants can have two study eyes only if both eyes are eligible at the time of
        randomization. For study participants with two eligible eyes, the logistical complexities
        of the protocol must be considered for each individual prior to randomizing both eyes.

        The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:

        Inclusion

          1. Best corrected Electronic-Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity
             letter score &lt; 69 (i.e., 20/50 or worse) and ≥ 24 (i.e., 20/320 or better) within
             eight days of randomization.

          2. On clinical exam, definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema involving
             the center of the macula.

          3. Diabetic macular edema present on optical coherence tomography (OCT) within eight days
             of randomization

               -  Zeiss Cirrus central subfield: ≥ 290µm in women or ≥ 305µm in men

               -  Heidelberg Spectralis central subfield: ≥ 305µm in women or ≥ 320µm in men

               -  Investigator must verify accuracy of OCT scan by ensuring it is centered and of
                  adequate quality

          4. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and individual cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs.

             Exclusions

             The following exclusions apply to the study eye only (i.e., they may be present for
             the nonstudy eye):

          5. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

             • An eye should not be considered eligible if: (1) the macular edema is considered to
             be related to ocular surgery such as cataract extraction or (2) clinical exam and/or
             OCT suggest that vitreoretinal interface abnormalities (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid
             or epiretinal membrane) are the primary cause of the macular edema.

          6. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity loss would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigment abnormalities, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).

          7. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             neovascular glaucoma, etc.).

          8. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to be
             decreasing visual acuity by three lines or more (i.e., cataract would be reducing
             acuity to 20/40 or worse if eye was otherwise normal).

          9. History of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment for
             diabetic macular edema (DME) in the past 12 months or history of any other treatment
             for DME at any time in the past four months (such as focal/grid macular
             photocoagulation, intravitreous or peribulbar corticosteroids).

             • Enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 25% of the planned sample size with any
             history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME. Once this number of eyes has been enrolled,
             any history of anti-VEGF treatment for DME will be an exclusion criterion.

         10. History of pan-retinal photocoagulation within four months prior to randomization or
             anticipated need for pan-retinal photocoagulation in the six months following
             randomization.

         11. History of anti-VEGF treatment for a disease other than DME in the past 12 months.

         12. History of major ocular surgery (including vitrectomy, cataract extraction, scleral
             buckle, any intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior four months or anticipated within
             the next six months following randomization.

         13. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within two months prior to randomization.

         14. Aphakia.

         15. Exam evidence of external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or
             significant blepharitis.

         16. Evidence of uncontrolled glaucoma. • Intraocular pressure must be &lt;30, with no more
             than one topical glaucoma medication, and no documented glaucomatous field loss for
             the eye to be eligible

        Note, combination therapies are considered more than one medication
