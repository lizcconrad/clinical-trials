  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of pain, a conscious response, in the anesthetized patient remains one of the
      main challenges in anaesthesia.

      Opioids remain the cornerstone for perioperative analgesia, albeit frequently associated with
      side effects. Most of these side-effects are dose-dependent.

      Thus intra-operative monitors are necessary to measure the balance between Nociception and
      Anti-Nociception (NAN balance) by an adequate opioid administration.

      Recently the NOL monitor was released.The NoL index ranges from 0 to 100 and is based on a
      nonlinear combination of nociception-related physiologic variables, specifically heart rate
      (HR), heart rate variability at the 0.15- to 0.4-Hz band power, photoplethysmograph wave
      amplitude (PPGA), skin conductance level, number of skin conductance fluctuations, and their
      time derivatives. The NoL index estimates the nociceptive/antinociceptive state from these
      component measures using random forest regression.

      NOL index has been studied in many types of surgery apart from cardiac surgery. Cardiac
      surgery has one of the frailest patient populations, in whom hemodynamic stability is of
      utter importance.

      In our institution, a combination of TCI propofol (Schnider model) and remifentanil (Minto
      model) is used to for most of the anaesthetic procedures, including cardiac anaesthesia.
      Remifentanil is titrated to prevent an increase in blood pressure and hearth rhythm at
      noxious stimuli, such as surgical incision, sternotomy and adapted following hemodynamic
      trend during surgery.

      The hypothesis of this study is to develop a calibration test using the NOL index variation
      to define the individual most appropriate NAN balance using remifentanil TCI before the start
      of surgery and before a very strong noxious surgical stimulus such as surgical incision in
      thyroid surgery and sternotomy during cardiac surgery.

      Before the start of surgery, the investigators want to titrate in each patient the
      remifentanil Ce required to abolish the NOL index response to a calibrated noxious tetanic
      stimulus (Tetanus 60 mamp, 100 Hz, 30 seconds). Thus this individual remifentanil Ce will be
      the remifentanil level programmed before surgical incision and sternotomy. NOL and
      hemodynamic responses will be recorded during the entire duration of thyroid surgery and
      until the cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery.

      The individual relation between the remifentanil calibration level and the patient's response
      will be studied.

      The evaluation of pain, a conscious response, in the anesthetized patient remains one of the
      main challenges in anaesthesia.

      Opioids remain the cornerstone for perioperative analgesia, albeit frequently associated with
      side effects. Most of these side-effects are dose-dependent. The misadministration of opioids
      contributes to side-effects such as: post-operative nausea and vomiting, respiratory
      depression and opioid-induced hyperalgesia.

      Thus intra-operative monitors are necessary to measure the balance between Nociception and
      Anti-Nociception (NAN balance) by an adequate opioid administration.

      In the past few years, different monitors have been developed such as the Analgesia
      Nociception index (ANI) based on the heart rate variability and the Surgical Plethysmographic
      index (SPI) based on the amplitude of the Plethysmogram and the heart rate variation. Pupil
      dilation has also been proposed (Algiscan, Idmed company, Marseille, France). Each one of
      these monitors is measuring only one parameter.

      Recently the NOL monitor was released.The NoL index ranges from 0 to 100 and is based on a
      nonlinear combination of nociception-related physiologic variables, specifically heart rate
      (HR), heart rate variability at the 0.15- to 0.4-Hz band power, photoplethysmograph wave

    <description>A calibration Tetanus test of 60 mAmp during 30 sec at remifentanil level (Ce) of 4 ng/ml will be done when starting NOL is below 10. According to the NOL response: there will be an increment of 1 ng/ml of RemiCe if NOL gradient ≥ 10 or a decrement of 1 ng/ml of remifentanil Ce NOL gradient &lt; 10. The optimal individual remifentanil level is defined as the level at which the variation of NOL index will be less than 10 units starting at a NOL value below 10. So surgical incision and sternotomy will be done at 'optimal individual remifentanil level' and MAP (mean artrial pressure), HR (heart rhythm), NIBP (non-invasive blood pressure) will be measured (every 3 minutes during thyroid and continuous measurement for cardiac surgery).</description>

    <description>After tracheal intubation and before surgical incision, a calibration Tetanus test of 100Hz, 60 mAmp during 30 sec at remifentanil level (Ce) of 4 ng/ml will be done (starting NOL below 10).
According to the NOL response, there will be an increment of 1 ng/ml of RemiCe if NOL gradient ≥ 10 or decrement of 1 ng/ml if NOL gradient &lt; 10. Ideal remifentanil Ce is the remifentanil Ce at which the variation of NOL index will be less than 10 units at a NOL starting value below 10. Thus this individual remifentanil Ce will be the remifentanil level programmed before surgical incision and sternotomy. NOL and hemodynamic responses will be recorded during the entire duration of thyroid surgery and until the cardiopulmonary bypass during cardiac surgery.</description>

    <description>After tracheal intubation, a Tetanus test (60 mAmp,100 Hz) is done during 30 sec at remifentanil level Ce of 4 ng/ml (with starting NOL value &lt;10). According to the NOL response: increment of 1 ng/ml of RemiCe if NOL gradient ≥ 10 / decrement of 1 ng/ml of remifentanil Ce NOL gradient &lt; 10. During the testing period propofol Ce is fixed at the concentration associated with BIS levels between 45-60 during the first calibration.
Upon the incision and 10 minutes after skin incision and sternotomy, Propofol TCI (Schnider model) is adjusted to BIS between 45-60 and remifentanil Ce at which the variation of NOL index variation is less than10 units at a NOL starting value &lt;10. MAP (mean arterial pressure), HR (heart rhythm) and NIBP (non-invasive blood pressure) will be measured.</description>
