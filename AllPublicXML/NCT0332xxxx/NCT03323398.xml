  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will assess the safety and tolerability of escalating intratumoral doses
      of mRNA 2416 in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study designed to
      determine the safety and tolerability of repeated intratumoral injections of mRNA 2416 in
      patients with advanced relapsed/refractory solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma. The study
      will include 2 dosing periods: a Dose Escalation Period followed by an Expansion Period at
      the MTD/RDE as determined by the Dose Escalation Period.
