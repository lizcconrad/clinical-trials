  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for CDX-1140 and to further
      evaluate its tolerability and efficacy in expansion cohorts once the MTD is determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CDX-1140 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to a cell receptor called CD40 found
      on certain cells to activate the immune system which may promote anti-tumor effects.

      This study will determine the MTD of CDX-1140 while also evaluating the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of CDX-1140.

      Eligible patients that enroll to the dose-escalation portion of the study will be assigned to
      one of several levels of CDX-1140. The first part of the study will test the safety profile
      of CDX-1140 and determine which dose(s) of CDX-1140 will be studied in the expansion portion
      of the study.

      Up to 105 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study will be closely
      monitored to determine if there is a response to the treatment as well as for any side
      effects that may occur.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of one of the following cancers: melanoma
             (including mucosal and/or ocular), bladder/urothelial, non-small cell lung cancer,
             pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast, colorectal, gastric, esophageal, renal cell,
             hepatic, ovarian, head and neck, and cholangiocarcinoma

          2. Receipt of all standard therapies for the tumor type:

               1. Must have had all standard approved and unapproved therapies as deemed
                  appropriate by the treating physician.

               2. Patients are not required to have all approved therapies in a drug class (e.g.,
                  patients with kidney cancer do not need all tyrosine kinase inhibitors, patients
                  with melanoma do not need all approved checkpoint blockade inhibitors)

               3. Patients who refuse standard therapy are excluded from the study

          3. Measurable disease.

          4. Life expectancy â‰¥ 12 weeks.

          5. If of childbearing potential (male or female), agrees to practice an effective form of
             contraception during study treatment and for at least 6 months following last
