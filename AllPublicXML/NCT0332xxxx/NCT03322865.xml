  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) Rituximab in combination with conventional chemotherapy are
      widely used for those patients who fail local therapy or do not qualify for such. Depending
      on the MZL subtype Rituximab/chemotherapy is able to induce in part long remissions, but do
      not prevent relapse later on. In addition, chemotherapy associated toxicity is often
      problematic in MZL patients, who are mostly of advanced age. Thus, chemotherapy - free
      approaches are highly attractive for this patient group. Rituximab single agent is a widely
      used chemotherapy - free approach in MZL, but was significantly inferior compared to
      Rituximab/chlorambucil in a large randomized prospective clinical trial in treatment naïve
      MZL with a CR rate of 56 % vs. 80%, respectively (P&lt;0.001).Thus, it is the major aim to
      develop chemotherapy - free approaches for MZL, which approach efficacy of
      rituximab/chemotherapy combinations, but avoid chemotherapy associated toxicities. This in
      particular important in MZL as many physicians are reluctant to treat these often elderly
      patients with more intense treatments and prefer single agent therapies in these very often
      well and long responding lymphoma subtype. The type II anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab
      (OBINUTUZUMAB) has demonstrated remarkable activity in follicular lymphoma and superiority to
      Rituximab in combination with chemotherapy in treatment naïve (Gallium trial) and rituximab
      refractory follicular lymphoma (Gadolin trial) as well as in CLL in combination with
      chlorambucil. Based on these observations it is the aim of this study to test the toxicity
      and efficacy of the anti-CD20 antibody Obinutuzumab (OBINUTUZUMAB) in patients with newly
      diagnosed MZL in need of treatment, who are not eligible or failed local therapy, following
      the assumption that this novel anti-CD20 antibody is significantly more effective than
      Rituximab single agent therapy, and avoids chemotherapy - related toxicity.

          -  Patients in need of treatment:

        For patients with symptomatic splenic, nodal, or non-gastric extranodal MZL disease that is
        de novo or has relapsed following local therapy (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) and
        requires therapy, as assessed by the investigator.

        For patients with symptomatic gastric extranodal MZL: Helicobacter pylori-negative disease
        that is de novo or has relapsed following local therapy (i.e., surgery or radiotherapy) and

          -  Positive test results for chronic HBV infection (defined as positive HBsAg serology):
             patients with occult or prior HBV infection (defined as negative HBsAg and positive
             total HBcAb) may be included if HBV DNA is undetectable, provided that they are
             willing to undergo monthly DNA testing. Patients who have protective titers of HBSAb
             after vaccination or prior but cured hepatitis B are eligible.

             rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs, sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner.

          -  Men must agree not to father a child for the duration of therapy and 6 months after

             of the neoplastic nature of the disease and has been informed of the procedures to be
             followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits,
             possible side effects, potential risks and discomforts, and other pertinent aspects of
