  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and PK of two dose levels of SPI-1005
      administered for 28 days compared to placebo in patients with Meniere's disease.

      Study participants will be randomized to SPI-1005 or placebo in this double-blind study to
      evaluate both safety and efficacy of the investigational treatment. Participants, aged 18-75
      years, with probable or definite Meniere's disease will undergo baseline testing to assess
      severity of sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo. During the study, and 28 days
      after completion of treatment, participants will be evaluated for safety (adverse events,
      physical examinations, vital signs and clinical laboratory testing (CBC,serum chemistry).
      Trough plasma levels of ebselen and its major metabolite will be determined using liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) at specified visits. Additionally, plasma will be
      analyzed for selenium at the corresponding visits. The effect of SPI-1005 on hearing and
      balance will be evaluated. Tinnitus (TFI) and vertigo (VSS) will be evaluated at baseline,
      during and study treatment.
