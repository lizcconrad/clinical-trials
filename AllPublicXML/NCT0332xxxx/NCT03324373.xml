  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see what effect the combination of lenvatinib plus
      everolimus has on the tumors in patients with locally advanced and metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma, prior to cytoreductive nephrectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot phase II/proof of concept interventional clinical trial at the University of
      Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, enrolling 13 subjects and lasting approximately 12 months.
      Eligible patients will be treated with lenvatinib and everolimus for 8 weeks prior to
      cytoreductive nephrectomy. A wash out period of 2 weeks is needed between the end of
      treatment and surgery.

      Eligible patients will start treatment with lenvatinib 18 milligrams (mg) orally (PO) daily
      (administered as one 10 mg capsule and two 4 mg capsules) and everolimus 5 mg PO daily for 4
      weeks constituting one cycle. Two cycles of treatment will be administered and after 2 weeks
      wash out period, the patients will go for nephrectomy.

    <intervention_name>Lenvatinib</intervention_name>
    <description>Lenvatinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET.</description>

    <intervention_name>Everolimus</intervention_name>
    <description>Everolimus is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase, downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The mTOR pathway is dysregulated in several human cancers. Everolimus binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, resulting in an inhibitory complex formation (mTORC1) and thus inhibition of mTOR kinase activity. Everolimus reduced the activity of S6 ribosomal protein kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic elongation factor 4E-binding protein (4E-BP1), downstream effectors of mTOR, involved in protein synthesis. In addition, everolimus inhibited the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (e.g., HIF-1) and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Inhibition of mTOR by everolimus has been shown to reduce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and glucose uptake in in vitro and/or in vivo studies.</description>
