  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe asthma affects 5-10% of more than 300 million asthmatics. Ten to twenty percent of
      individuals suffering from asthma do not respond well to current treatment due to the
      complexity of the different mechanisms underlying asthma pathogenesis, and sometimes due to
      an insufficient effect of treatment on underlying airway inflammation. Consequently, some
      asthmatics have poorer quality of life due to: frequent asthma symptoms, regular medical or
      emergency visits, limitation in their activities of daily living, including exercise. It is
      believed that the benralizumab can help to reduce airway inflammation and thus improve
      exercise tolerance in individuals with asthma. The main objective of this study is to
      determine the effect of benralizumab on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) and
      exercise tolerance in moderate to severe eosinophilic asthmatics, in comparison with baseline
      values and a placebo treatment.

      Subjects will receive benralizumab every 4 weeks for three doses followed by a fourth dose 8
      weeks later. On baseline and after 4, 16 and 20 weeks, subjects will be assess for airway
      responsiveness to exercise and exercise tolerance.

    <masking_description>The study will be conducted under double-blind conditions. Neither the subject nor the investigator and clinical site personnel will know which medication is administered. The medication given will be determined according to a randomization table handled by a collaborating IUCPQ-UL pharmacist. Only the pharmacist responsible for preparing the medication for the randomized patients will have access to information on treatment allocations (unblended). Benralizumab and placebo solutions for injection in an accessorized pre-filled syringe (PFS) will have the same packaging.</masking_description>
