  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is the cardinal symptom of acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis, and available
      medical treatments have limited efficacy. Pain self-management programs equip patients to
      minimize the impact of chronic painful conditions on activity, health, and psychosocial
      functioning. The purpose of the current study is to pilot the use of Internet-delivered pain
      self-management course in adults with chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis to generate
      preliminary feasibility and acceptability data to inform design of a subsequent large
      randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) are associated with high
      disease burden across the lifespan. Recurring abdominal pain is the most prevalent and
      distressing symptom. Pain severity reduces health-related quality of life for individuals
      with CP and is associated with increased fatigue, anxiety and depressive symptoms, lower
      general health status, and reduced physical and role functioning. Medical therapies for CP
      pain have limited efficacy. Cognitive-behavioral interventions (CBT) offer safe and effective
      alternatives to pharmacological treatments for pain management. In other chronic painful
      conditions including gastrointestinal disorders, CBT interventions have been effective for
      reducing pain and pain impact including disability and depressive symptoms. CBT is
      traditionally provided by trained psychologists working with individual patients one-on-one
      or in small groups. Access to CBT is limited by availability of providers, with long waiting
      lists at centers offering CBT. The Internet is an ideal medium to provide pain
      self-management interventions that are low-cost and sustainable, and internet-based CBT has
      shown efficacy in children and adults with chronic pain, allowing clinics to greatly extend
      their reach to patients. The purpose of this study is to test the acceptability, feasibility,
      and preliminary efficacy of an Internet-delivered CBT pain self-management course for adults
      with acute recurrent and chronic pancreatitis pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete a 12-item Treatment Evaluation Inventory questionnaire that assesses satisfaction and acceptability of the course of treatment and satisfaction with the outcome of the intervention. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Strongly disagree, to 5 = Strongly agree.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be determined by calculating rates of accrual, drop out, compliance, and missing data. Criteria for feasibility success will be based on: accrual rates &gt;70%, attrition rates &lt;15%, minimal technical difficulties (i.e., reported by &lt;10%), adherence rates &gt;80%, and minimal missing data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report on presence and intensity of pain daily for 7 days at each assessment period. Pain intensity will be assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS), where 0= no pain, and 10 = worst pain. Mean average intensity of the pain reported will serve as the pain measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain-related disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will report their level of pain-related disability daily for 7 days at each assessment period. Questions of pain-related disability are taken from the Brief Pain Inventory and the Pain Disability Index. These measures assess the extent to which chronic pain disrupts aspects of daily life including social relations, work, mood, sleep, eating, and physical activity. All items are scored on a 0-10 NRS, with higher scores indicating greater disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disease specific and generic health related quality of life (HRQOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the 18-item Pancreatitis Quality of Life Instrument to assess for disease-specific HRQOL difficulties. Items are scored on a 0-5 scale where 0 = Not applicable, 1 = Much less, and 5 = Much more. Participants will also complete the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey to assess for general HRQOL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Medication use</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will record their medication use daily for 7 days at each assessment period</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the 4-item Chronic Pain Self-Efficacy Scale. This scale assesses perceived self-efficacy over three factors: pain management, coping with symptoms, and physical function. All items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale where 0 = Not at all confident, and 6 = Completely confident</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psychological distress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the 4-item Anxiety and 4-item Depression subscales of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 Profile to assess for levels of psychological distress over the past week. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = Never, to 5 = Always.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep and Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the 4-item Sleep Disturbance and 4-item Fatigue subscales of the PROMIS-29 Profile to assess for problems with fatigue and sleep over the previous week. All items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging 1 = Not at all, to 5 = Very much, except for one sleep item which is scored 1 = very poor, to 5 = Very good.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Internet-based CBT intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The Internet-delivered Pancreatitis Pain Course consists of 5 lessons: 1) introduction, education, and symptom identification, 2) thought monitoring and challenging, 3) controlled breathing and pleasant activity scheduling, 4) activity pacing, and 5) relapse prevention and goal setting. Participants aim to complete one online lesson weekly for 5 weeks, and have up to 2 months to complete the course. Each lesson has a homework assignment to encourage participants to practice and apply skills. A coach who is part of the Seattle Children's Research Institute study team will make weekly contact with participants in the intervention arm through telephone or secure e-mail, for a period of between 10-15 minutes to encourage participants to work through the Course and apply the skills.</description>
