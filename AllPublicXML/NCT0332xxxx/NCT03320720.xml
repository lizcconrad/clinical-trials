    <textblock>
      The study's goal is to evaluate whether home treatment is an effective and efficient
      alternative to inpatient care for people with acute mental illness. Patients who meet the
      study's inclusion criteria are randomly assigned to either the condition home treatment or
      inpatient care (treatment-as-usual), during one year. Following two years, the two treatment
      modalities will be analyzed in terms of inpatient days, cost effectiveness, rehospitalization
      rate, severity of symptoms and sociodemographics.

      The study's goal is to evaluate whether home treatment is an effective and efficient
      alternative to inpatient care for people with acute mental illness. Therefore, psychiatric
      patients in need of hospitalization who meet the study's inclusion criteria are randomly
      assigned to either the condition home treatment or inpatient care (treatment-as-usual) during
      one year. Home treatment patients are visited by a mobile and multiprofessional care team at
      their homes. Additionally, patients without a health insurance for home treatment and
      patients who are directly assigned to home treatment are included in separate study groups.
      Following two years, it will be checked whether home treatment leads to a reduction of
      inpatient days as a primary outcome. Further outcomes such as cost effectiveness,
      rehospitalization rate, severity of symptoms and sociodemographics will be also analyzed.
