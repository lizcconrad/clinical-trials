      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel group study in healthy female subjects. The study is
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of
      Fulvestrant for Injectable Suspension vs. the reference drug, Faslodex, administered in the
      gluteal muscle.
