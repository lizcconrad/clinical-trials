  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team will conduct a 2 x 2 factorial experiment testing the individual and
      combined effects of two empirically and theoretically relevant sets of behavior change
      strategies on community-dwelling older adults' physical activity. To do this the
      investigators will randomize participants &gt;= 70 years old (n = 308) to 1 of 4 experimental
      conditions. All conditions include an evidence-based physical activity protocol endorsed by
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for use by all older adults, including those
      with frailty and multiple co-morbidities and the commercially available physical activity
      monitor (e.g., Fitbit) to augment intervention delivery. Intervention components that are
      experimental and vary by condition are the sets of behavior change strategies which will be
      combined with the physical activity protocol and the physical activity monitor. Condition 1
      has no specific behavior change strategies; Condition 2 includes an intervention component
      comprised of 5 interpersonal behavior change strategies, such as facilitating social support
      and social comparison; Condition 3 includes an intervention component comprised of 5
      intrapersonal behavior change strategies, such as setting personally meaningful goals; and
      Condition 4 includes both sets of behavior change strategies -- 5 interpersonal strategies
      combined with 5 intrapersonal behavior change strategies.

      To fully examine the effects of these experimental components, The investigators have
      delineated Primary, Secondary and Exploratory Aims:

      Primary Aim: Determine which experimental intervention component(s) increase PA among
      community-dwelling older adults post-intervention: immediately, 6 months, and 12 months.
      Hypothesis: Participants receiving the interpersonal set of behavior change strategies
      (conditions 2 and 4) will have clinically meaningful increases in PA post- intervention (at
      all 3 time-points), compared to participants not receiving these strategies (conditions 1 and
      3).

      Secondary Aim: Determine which experimental intervention component(s)decrease fall occurrence
      and increase quality of life (QOL) among community-dwelling older adults 12 months
      post-intervention. Hypotheses: Participants receiving the set of interpersonal behavior
      change strategies will have clinically meaningful reductions in falls and increases in QOL,
      12 months post-intervention, compared to participants not receiving these strategies.

      Exploratory Aim: Evaluate experimental intervention component effects on targeted
      psychosocial constructs (social support; readiness; self-regulation) and physical constructs
      (functional leg strength and balance), which are theorized as mechanisms of change--and
      whether these mechanisms mediate the effects of experimental intervention components on PA
      and falls. Hypotheses: Receiving the interpersonal behavioral change strategies, relative to
      not receiving these strategies, will elicit increases in targeted psychosocial constructs and
      increases in physical constructs, which in turn will mediate the intervention's effects on PA
      behavior and falls.
