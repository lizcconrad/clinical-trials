  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a noncancerous growth of the conjunctival tissue over the cornea. It is a
      progressive disease that may lead to visual impairment in advanced stages, as well as
      restriction of ocular motility, chronic inflammation and cosmetic concerns. Surgical removal
      is the treatment of choice, but recurrence of pterygium is a frequent problem. In this
      randomized controlled cauterization will be compared with ﬁbrin glue for conjunctival
      autografting in primary pterygium surgery.

    <description>The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) is a 12-question validated questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The OSDI scoring scale ranges from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the more symptomatic relief from dry eye symptoms a patient experiences. Baseline-adjusted scores were tabulated; a negative number change from baseline indicates a perceived improvement in ocular comfort.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cauterization</intervention_name>
    <description>To ensure the stability of the graft during cuttings, four sealing wraps will be installed, which will be removed after cauterisation is completed. Autograft and conjunctiva will be approximated by surgical forceps and will be cauterized using a bipolar cutter (Erbe ICC 50) with a force 1-3 / 20. Forceps will be released slowly to prevent elevation of the graft. The same procedure will be performed 10 times until graft is well firmed. Graft stability will be checked up with a sponge and additional cauterization will be preformed if needed.</description>

    <description>Fiber adhesive (Tissel 1 mL kit4-iu) will be prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. Preparation time will be approximately 10-15 min per kit. Once mixed the fibrin glue is usable up to 4 h. For the purpose of the study preparation of the fibrin glue will be performed by a nurse.</description>
