  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through this study the investigators seek to build up a repository of prostate
      ultrasonography videos and prostate MRI scans to enable research into novel anatomical
      registration techniques. These data will facilitate the development of improved technology
      that enables targeting of tumours seen on MRI using free-hand biopsy techniques, without the
      need for a gantry or overlaid perineal grid.

      The purpose of this study is to explore whether mathematical and computational modelling
      techniques can be used to enable anatomical based real-time image registration for guiding
      prostate biopsies. This would lead to the ability to perform free-hand trans-perineal biopsy
      without the need for supporting gantries or a biopsy grid placed over the perineum. This will
      significantly decrease costs of trans-perineal biopsy, reduce the number of puncture sites
      through the perineal skin - reducing pain and bleeding - and reduce the procedure time.
      Alongside locally developed local-anaesthetic transperineal biopsy techniques it will allow
      targeted biopsy to be taken in the outpatient setting, improving patient convenience, and
      helping health services to meet growing demands on targeted biopsies.

      The investigators aim to create a new method of mapping the prostate using free-hand
      ultrasound, without any additional physical equipment. This may require collaborations with
      approved International groups with particular skills in relevant mathematical or engineering
      techniques.

    <description>Ultrasound images and videos of the prostate will be captured to assess prostate location relative to surrounding structures. Specifically this will mean measuring the distance from the anal verge to the prostate. Unit of measurment is millimeters (mm). This will be taken at a single time-point at the time of general anaesthesia for transperineal biopsy.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects undergoing trans-perineal prostate biopsy under general anaesthesia who have
             had an MRI of their prostate within the preceding 12 months.

          -  Male.

          -  Age 18-100.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Any medical condition, vital sign or laboratory value that, in the opinion of the
             investigator or responsible anaesthetist makes any prolongation of general anaesthesia
             unsafe to the participant.

          -  Patients unable to have an MRI
