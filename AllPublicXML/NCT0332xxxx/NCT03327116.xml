  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with pruritus.
      Methotrexate can be used to treat refractory disease to conventional therapy.

      It will be conducted a single arm trial with twelve adult patients with moderate to severe AD
      on methotrexate for 24 weeks.

      Investigators intend to evaluate the effect methotrexate on cytokines and chemokines involved
      in the inflammatory response, on IgE levels, on pruritus, and on EASI and SCORAD severity
      scores.

      Introduction: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with
      pruritus. Methotrexate (MTX) can be used to treat refractory disease to conventional therapy,
      but there are few studies showing its effect on the profile of cytokines involved in the
      inflammatory response.

      Objectives: To assess the effect of MTX on the cytokines involved in the inflammatory
      response of adult AD patients treated with methotrexate for 24 weeks. As specific objectives,
      investigators intend to assess the evolution of serum IgE levels, the EASI (Eczema Area and
      Severity Index) and SCORAD (Scoring Atopic Dermatitis) severity scores and pruritus in them.

      Methods: It will be conducted an open, prospective study with twelve adult patients with
      moderate to severe AD on MTX for 24 weeks. Each participant is expected to attend 7 visits
      during 6 months of follow-up. In clinical healthy and injured skin, two assessments will be
      performed: 1) mRNA expression of IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A, IL-22, IL-31, oncostatin M receptor
      (OSMR), alpha subunit IL-31 (IL-31RA) receptor, TNF-α, IFN-γ, TSLP, TARC and MDC by Real
      Time-PCR at the initial week and week 24; 2) expression of IL-31, IL-31RA, OSMR, TSLP and
      Ki67 by immunohistochemistry at the initial week and week 24.

      Skin samples from non-atopic subjects will be utilized as controls for the assays, paired by
      gender and age.

      Additional analysis of serum levels of IgE (nephelometric method) at the initial week and
      week 24 of the study will be performed.

      AD severity scores (EASI and SCORAD) will be tested and pruritus will be analyzed by a visual
      analog scale at the initial, week 12 and week 24.

    <description>The SCORAD (Scoring atopic dermatitis) is a severity score used for atopic dermatitis.
To measure the extent of AD, the rule of nines is applied on a front/back drawing of the patient's inflammatory lesions. The extent can be graded from 0 to 100.
The intensity part of the SCORAD consists of 6 items: erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriations, lichenification, oozing/crusts and dryness. Each item can be graded on a scale from 0 to 3.
The subjective items include daily pruritus and sleeplessness. The SCORAD Index formula is: A/5 + 7B/2 + C. In this formula, A is defined as the extent (0-100), B is defined as the intensity (0-18) and C is defined as the subjective symptoms (0-20). The minimal score of SCORAD is 0 and the maximal score is 103 (most severe).</description>
