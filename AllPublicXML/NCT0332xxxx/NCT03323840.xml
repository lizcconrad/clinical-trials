  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore whether routine measurement of blood pressure by community
      pharmacists can improve patient adherence to blood pressure medications. The study will
      utilize an incentivized care approach, in which patients receive a $10 gift card for every
      time they come to the pharmacy for blood pressure management (up to 2 times/month). The
      investigators hypothesize that the simple process of coming in for a blood pressure
      measurement (without any other scripted interventions, counseling, or consultation) will be
      feasible and sufficient to improve adherence to medications. The investigators will also
      collect preliminary data to help estimate how these hypothetical improvements in adherence
      might result in improved blood pressure control, fewer office visits, and (ultimately) fewer
      adverse cardiovascular outcomes (i.e. heart attacks, strokes, etc).
