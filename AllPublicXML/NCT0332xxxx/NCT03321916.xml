    <textblock>
      This is a two armed Single Masked Pilot Study enrolling participants with Macular
      Telangiectasia Type 2 who will be randomized to undergo either a subthreshold photothermal
      treatment or a sham procedure to one eye. The participants will be followed for one year with
      visits at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment (laser or sham). Due to
      the small number of participants enrolled in this study the data will be analyzed by
      descriptive statistics and exploratory figures. Summary statistics will be produced for study
      and fellow eyes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from the participant in accordance
             with the local regulations;

          2. Males/females 21 years of age and older but less than 80 years of age;

          3. Participant must have a positive diagnosis of MacTel Type 2 in at least one eye with
             evidence of fluorescein leakage typical of MacTel or at least one of the other
             features including loss of retinal transparency/hyper-reflectivity to blue light,
             crystalline deposits, right angle vessels, inner/outer retinal low-reflective spaces,
             or hyperpigmentation not involving the center of the fovea, but no evidence of
             intraretinal/subretinal vascular proliferation;

          4. Participant must have an Ellipsoid Zone (EZ, aka IS/OS) break in the study eye between
             0.16 - 4.0 mm2 as measured on SD-OCT;

          5. Participant must have clear natural lenses and pupils that dilate to at least 6 mm in
             each eye. Up to Nuclear sclerosis +1 is allowable.

          6. Participant's best-corrected visual acuity at least 55 letters (20/80) in the study
             eye;

          7. Participant should have reproducible baseline AOSLO image montages at 2 baseline
             imaging sessions with quality suitable to identify a minimum of 7 regions of interest
             (ROIs) at which reliable cone spacing measures can be made in each eye; (if all other
             I/E criteria except this one are met the participant may be enrolled); and

          8. Participant must have steady fixation in the foveal or parafoveal area of each eye,
             adequate pupil dilation and sufficiently clear media to perform multi-modal retinal
             imaging and treatment.

          9. Participant must be able and willing to attend all scheduled visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant is unable to provide informed consent;

          2. Participant is less than 21 years of age or greater than 80 years of age; but less
             than 80.

          3. Participant is medically unable to comply with study procedures or follow-up visits;

          4. Participant received intravitreal therapy for non-neovascular MacTel;

          5. Participant is pseudophakic in either eye;

          6. Participant has nystagmus in either eye;

          7. Participant has greater than 7 diopters myopia in either eye;

          9. Participant has been diagnosed and treated for amblyopia in the study eye;

         10. Participant has significant ocular abnormalities in either eye that prevent retinal
             assessment, including media opacities or cataract (up to Nuclear Sclerosis +1 is
             allowable);

         11. Participant was a study participant in any other clinical trial of an intervention
             (drug or device) within the last 6 months;

         12. Participant has a history of malignancy that would compromise the 12 month study
             survival; or

         13. Participant has, in the opinion of the Investigator, any physical or mental condition
             that would increase the patient's risk of participation in the study or may interfere
             with the study procedures, evaluations and outcome assessments.

         14. Presence of signs of advanced retinal/vascular disease in the study eye, such as CNV,
             haemorrhages or macular atrophy based on OCT or FAF.

         15. Previous macular laser treatment in either eye.

         16. Any previous ocular condition that may be associated with a risk of developing macular
             oedema.

         17. Vitreomacular traction determined clinically and/or by OCT, which in the opinion of
             the investigator contributes to the macular oedema (associated or causing a detachment
             of the fovea) in either eye.

         18. Presence of other macular disease such as epiretinal membrane in either eye.

         19. Ocular or periocular infections.
