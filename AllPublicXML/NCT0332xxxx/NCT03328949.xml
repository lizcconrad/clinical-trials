    <textblock>
      The objective of this post market study is to examine the safety and performance of the
      Shockwave Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy System for the treatment of narrowed coronary
      arteries before the doctor places a stent.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at 15 sites in Europe and up to 120 participants will be followed
      for 30 days post procedure.

      Patients ≥18 years of age scheduled for stent procedure with evidence of significant
      calcified stenosis of left main, or left anterior descending, right coronary artery or left
      circumflex will be eligible to enroll in the study. The primary endpoint of the study will
      evaluate major adverse cardiac events post procedure including 1) cardiac related death, 2)
      heart attack, and 3) intervention to treat the coronary artery that was previously treated at
      the procedure visit.

    <time_frame>1 day post-procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety endpoint is the frequency of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE). MACE is defined as the following:
Cardiac death
MI - defined as a CK-MB level &gt; 3 times the upper limit of lab normal (ULN) value with or without new pathologic Q wave
TVR - defined as revascularization at the target vessel (inclusive of the target lesion) after the completion of the index procedure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Residual stenosis (&lt;50%) after stenting</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedural</time_frame>
    <description>Performance will be assessed by the ability of the Lithotripsy System to produce acceptable residual stenosis (&lt;50%) after stenting with no evidence of in-hospital MACE. Each patient that achieves both of these requirements will be considered a &quot;clinical success&quot;, and the rate of clinical success among subjects will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Angiographic success</measure>
    <time_frame>Procedural</time_frame>
    <description>Angiographic success defined as success in facilitating stent delivery with &lt;50% residual stenosis and without serious angiographic complications. Serious angiographic complications defined as severe dissection (Type D to F), perforation, abrupt closure, and persistent slow flow or persistent no reflow.</description>
