  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anticalin® proteins are engineered human proteins that are able to bind specific target
      molecules. The Anticalin PRS-080#022-DP to be investigated in this study is directed against
      hepcidin and is intended for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease. This pilot Phase 2a
      study shall investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repeated
      administrations of PRS-080#022-DP in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients
      undergoing hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending
      dose, pilot Phase 2a study in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients requiring
      hemodialysis. Eligible patients will undergo screening assessments and PRS-080#22-DP will be
      administered by intravenous infusion. The study will consist of 2 dose cohorts of 4 mg/kg and
      8 mg/kg body weight with 6 patients in each cohort. Using a standard 4+2 design, 4 patients
      in each cohort will be randomized to PRS-080#022-DP and 2 patients in each cohort will be
      randomized to placebo. The decision to escalate the dose will be based on an interim analysis
      of clinical and laboratory safety as well on a comparison with pharmacokinetic data. Safety
      and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics as well as potential immunogenicity will
      be investigated.
