    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the increase in comfort and comfortable contact lens (CL) wear time
      associated with application of TrueTear (active intranasal neurostimulation) compared with
      application of TrueTear sham control (intranasal application which is not electrically
      active) in symptomatic CL wearers.
