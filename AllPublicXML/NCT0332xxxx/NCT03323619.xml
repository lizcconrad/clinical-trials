  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic stenosis is a frequent valvulopathy in Europe and North America. It occurs mainly over
      65 years (2-7% of the population over 65 years). Treatment of symptomatic stenosis is an
      indication of aortic valve replacement. For patients with high surgical risk (EuroSCORE II&gt;
      6), TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) is recommended. This type of procedure
      concerns elderly patients (75-80 years on average in the literature) therefore the anesthesia
      technique must be optimal. The postoperative complications are, on the one hand,
      well-described surgical complications (Cardiogenic shock, bleeding, rhythm disorders, renal
      insufficiency) and, on the other hand, those related to anesthesia which are less well
      characterized. There is no consensus on best anesthesia technique for TAVI procedure
      managment. Between teams practices are different. It may consist of general anesthesia (GA)
      or local anesthesia with sedation (LASed). Elderly anesthesia has specific complications,
      including acute cerebral disturbances (delirium) usually occurring within 24 to 48 hours
      postoperatively and up to 7 days. It is recommended to screen delirium for patients admitted
      in intensive care using the CAM-ICU scale. The aim of the study is to observe the impact of
      the anesthesia technique (GA versus LASed) on delirium in post-operative aortic valve
      replacement with TAVI procedure
