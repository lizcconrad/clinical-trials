  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide real world data on treatment with enzalutamide in
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients.

      The primary purpose is to evaluate overall survival (OS) in mCRPC patients treated with
      enzalutamide who have previously undergone treatment with chemotherapy (docetaxel) (post
      chemo patients).

      This study will also evaluate treatment duration with enzalutamide in patients pre- and
      post-chemo.
