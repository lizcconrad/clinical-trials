    <textblock>
      The alimentation of the premature newborn children is one of main thing concerning of nurses
      and pediatricians in neonatology. The absence of common tool of evaluation of the children
      cause a great discrepancy in prescriptions and the practices of the nursing.The aim of this
      study is to estimate the improvement of the food empowerment of the premature newborn
      children after the introduction of a help tool at the food progress which allows to fit the
      prescription of food(supply) to the capacities of the newborn child.

    <textblock>
      If the importance of feeding premature newborns is a central concern during their management,
      the absence of an evaluation tool leads to a great disparity in their implementation
      (particularly marked by at regular times by the care teams), which can eventually lead to
      oral disorders. The possibility of an assessment of the newborn's skills could allow a
      homogenization of therapeutic proposals and thus a potentially faster progression of dietary
      independence of the newborn. This method could also encourage parental involvement in feeding
      care. The objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of a tool to help food progression
      on food autonomy.
