  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that approximately 20-25% of diabetic patients will have at least one trophic
      disorder during their period. The appearance of a trophic disorder in a diabetic patient is a
      serious complication, indicating that diabetes is often complicated. The consequences are
      serious for the patient with an impairment of his quality of life, but also for society with
      a high cost in terms of health care costs.

      It should also be noted that diabetes remains the main cause of non-traumatic amputation in
      most developed countries, with amputation often preceded by a trophic disorder. In addition,
      20% of amputees are re-amputated at least once a year. Thus, the consequences of diabetic
      foot injuries are important in human, social and health terms and are the subject of
      increased health care spending.

      Many studies have shown that diabetes is a risk factor for dementia, whether it is
      Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's disease or the vascular component or pure vascular dementia.

      However, an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms involved in the management of diabetes
      and in particular in the diabetic foot and its recurrence remains partial and no study has
      integrated the severity of the risk of the foot (evaluated by the podological risk) Specific
      implication of some Cognitive abilities, especially in relation to episodic memory, and
      social cognition integrating decision-making abilities. These specific disorders could have a
      major impact in diabetes follow-up, therapeutic adherence and the risk of developing
      recurrent trophic disorders.

      Thus, the coexistence of diabetes with a mental pathology makes the management of the subject
      more complex and exposes it to more complications.

      In the management of chronic diabetic disease, adherence to treatment is essential. It is
      therefore important to detect the specific effects of this type of personality on the
      prognosis of diabetes and the appearance of foot wounds.

      It should also be pointed out that diabetes is still the leading cause of non-traumatic
      amputation in most developped countries, with amputation often preceded by a trophic
      disorder. Further, 20% of amputees are re-amputed at least once a year. Thus the consequences
      of the wounds of the diabetic foot are important on the human, social and health level and
      are the subject of an increase of the health expenses.

      Many studies have shown that diabetes is a risk factor for dementia whether it is Alzheimer's
