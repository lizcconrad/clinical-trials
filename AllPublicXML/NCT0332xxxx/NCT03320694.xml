      Gestational diabetic mellitus (GDM) patients randomised to metformin or insulin group.Aim was
      to achieve blood sugar levels of Blood sugar fasting (BSF) &lt;5.3 mmol/l and 1 hour post
      meal&lt;7.8mmol/l. Both groups were followed till delivery and outcome studied.

    <textblock>
      75 gm Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) was done in pregnant patients. Blood sugar
      fasting(BSF) &gt; 5.5 mmol/l &amp; 2 hours postprandial &gt;7.8 mmol/l was labelled as GDM. They were
      randomised to metformin or insulin group. Those assigned to metformin group were started
      metformin 500mg twice daily &amp; increased until 2500mg depending on the blood sugar levels. Aim
      was to achieve blood sugar levels of BSF &lt;5.3 mmol/l and 1 hour post meal&lt;7.8mmol/l. If blood
      sugar levels were not controlled, insulin was added. The insulin group was given 3 injections
      of regular insulin &amp; one intermediate acting insulin injection at night subcutaneously. Both
      groups were followed till delivery and outcome studied
