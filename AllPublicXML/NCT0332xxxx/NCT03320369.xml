        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Participant must be able to understand and provide informed consent

          2. Males and Females â‰¥18 to 65 years of age;

          3. Have diagnosis of EG/EGE

          4. Have histologically confirmed active disease &gt; 30 eosinophils/hpf

          5. Symptomatic (have experienced symptoms within the last one months prior to
             enrollment).

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test upon
             study entry

          7. Female (and male) subjects with reproductive potential, must agree to use FDA approved
             methods of birth control for the duration of the study-specific methods may be listed,
             if applicable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability or unwillingness of a participant to give written informed consent or comply
             with study protocol

          2. Secondary causes of gastrointestinal and peripheral eosinophilia

          3. Eosinophilic infiltration isolated to the esophagus.

          4. Pregnancy

          5. Immunodeficiency states

          6. Have been treated with topical swallowed steroids within the last 6 weeks or systemic
             steroids within the last 2 months. For participants unable to be off of topical
             swallowed steroids for six weeks, a 2 week period without treatment with topical
             swallowed corticosteroids would be acceptable if repeat endoscopy has been performed
             demonstrating tissue eosinophilia meeting histologic criteria outlined above at the
             end of the 2 week period.

          7. Have taken immunosuppression medication or immunomodulators within 2 months of the
             study.

          8. Have been on an elemental diet previously for six weeks with follow up endoscopy
             completed.

          9. Have participated in any investigative drug study within 6 weeks prior to study entry.

         10. Unable to complete study procedures including endoscopy.

         11. Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory
             testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose
             additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's
             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or
             interpretation of the data obtained from the study.
