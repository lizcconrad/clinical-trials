  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the trial is to determine the optimal dose of protein per meal in relation
      to enhancing muscle protein synthesis and thereby in perspective counteract muscle loss
      during weight loss. In addition, we aim to determine whether the response to protein intake
      is reduced in women on hypocaloric diet compared to in women on an energy-balanced diet.

      Aim of this project is to determine the optimal protein dose (high quality milk protein) per
      meal in relation to enhancing muscle protein synthesis and thereby counteract muscle loss
      during weight loss.

      The hypothesis is that the optimum dose of protein for women on a hypocaloric diet will be
      greater than when women eat an energy sufficient diet, and also higher than the optimal dose
      previously determined in weight stable men.

      Methods: Forty women (~ 50 years) will be randomized to four groups. Following a five day
      hypocaloric diet (three groups) or an energy balanced diet (one group). The women will report
      to the laboratory to ingest one of three different protein doses. The muscle protein response
      to the different doses of protein will be determined by the muscle protein fractional
      synthetic rates using tracer kinetics.
