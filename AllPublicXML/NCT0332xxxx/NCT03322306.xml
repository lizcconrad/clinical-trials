  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary neurological disorders are relatively common in paediatric neurological practice,
      but it has considerable overlap with adult neurological disorders. It is a group of of
      genetic diseases, most of which with a Mendelian inheritance affecting neurological system.
      Pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases are not fully understood. There is currently no
      effective therapy for most of these diseases. Disease-specific and patient- specific iPS
      cells would provide useful source of cells in culture modeling in these diseases.

      In this study, disease-specific iPS cell lines repositories from hereditary neurological
      disease patients will be established. The cell lines will be registered and make them
      available to other investigators.

      The human iPS is generated by direct reprogramming of human somatic cells. These hiPS cells
      can give rise to most tissue types in the human embryo and possess many of the properties of
      human embryonic stem cells (hESC). The big advantage of human iPS cell over hESC is that it
      circumvents most of the limitations of hESC and remains the pluripotency for regeneration of
      cells and tissues. The unique capacity of self-renewal of iPS can provide unlimited supply of
      pluripotent stem cells for study. The patient-specific iPS cell lines should fundamentally
      eliminate the concern of immune rejection and ethical issues. The disease-specific iPS will
      facilitate the study of the mechanism of nucleotide expansion. It is the ideal medium to
      study the dynamic changes of the expansion from stem cell stage to different differentiation
      stages. It also creates a platform for drug development. The establishment of iPS stem cells
      will also make it realistic for target gene replacement/correction therapy.

      Study subjects will be identified at the members from the Hong Kong Spinocerebellar ataxias
      (SCA) association and neurology clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital. Patients identify based
      on the diagnosis, genetic test results and inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      10ml blood sample for genetic screening will be collected. Skin biopsy will only be scheduled
      if pathogenic mutation was identified by the genetic screening test and generation of iPS is
      considered necessary to study the pathogenic mechanism of the disease.
