      The purpose of this study is to assess the PK of vedolizumab following a single IV infusion
      in healthy adult Chinese participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called vedolizumab. Vedolizumab is being tested to
      treat people who have ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). This study will look
      at the PK, safety and tolerability of vedolizumab following a single IV infusion of
      vedolizumab IV in healthy adult Chinese participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 16 participants. All participants will be assigned to
      receive a single dose of vedolizumab IV 300 mg on Day 1.

      This single center trial will be conducted in China. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 7 months. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and
      will be contacted by telephone, 6 months after single dose of study drug for a follow-up
      safety survey assessment.
