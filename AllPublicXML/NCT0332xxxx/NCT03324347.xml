  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dog-assisted therapy (DAT) is used in several contexts within various areas of health care.
      One documented effect is that the proximity of a dog may lower anxiety in perceived stressful
      situations. Many individuals are afraid to visit the dentist, and someone to the extent that
      they need medication or anesthesia in order to complete their dental treatment. Based on the
      literature and own empirical observations, the investigators believe that dog-assisted
      therapy in connection with dental care may have a positive effect on children with dental
      anxiety or children that avoid dental care. It is desirable to restrict the use of drugs for
      these patients because of associated risk and side effects.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate whether using a specially trained therapy dog
      can have a positive effect on children who are afraid in a dental care setting. Eligible
      participants (n=16) will meet twice at the dental clinic; one treatment session with a
      therapy dog in the dental clinic and one without. The therapy dog will be accompanied by a
      certified dog handler. The investigators will measure physiological variations before, during
      and after the treatment session. The guardian will complete validated questionnaires
      portraying the participant's experience of previous dental care. The participant and their
      guardian will also complete validated questionnaires describing their reactions from the two
      treatment sessions. A descriptive log for each session will be completed by the
      investigators.
