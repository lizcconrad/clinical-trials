  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation (LT) is a well-established procedure for the treatment of end stage
      liver disease. Many improvements in the surgical technique have rendered this major operation
      to be carried out safely. Most important operative innovations after the initial introduction
      of LT in the clinical routine by Starzl include the use of veno-venous bypass in LT, the
      piggy back technique with preservation of the recipients' caval and it's modification
      introduced by Belghiti with side to side cavo-caval anastomosis. Nevertheless little
      improvements have been introduced in the surgical technique for tissue preparation and
      sealing of blood vessels during recipient hepatectomy. Due to end stage liver disease and
      recipients' general and coagulatory condition, the hepatectomy carries the risk of severe
      blood loss which can impair the outcome after LT. Usually the recipient hepatectomy is
      carried out as a combination of sharp dissection of the hepatic adhesions to the abdominal
      wall and the diaphragm and clip or suture ligature of small retrohepatic caval vein branches.

      With advances in surgical procedures and equipment, modern technologies have been introduced,
      which shortened operation time and improved surgical outcomes. Exquisite equipment for liver
      parenchyma transection, such as Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator, ultrasonic dissector
      (USD), LigaSure (LS) and Tissue Link can also be used to reduce hemorrhage in liver
      resection. The ultrasonic scalpel (Ethicon) is a new USD that cuts and coagulates tissue with
      ultrasound, using higher frequencies than an ultrasonic aspirator. This device can also serve
      as a grasper and basically involves a blade oscillating at 55 kHz, producing heat and
      coagulation of vessels. Recently, its use and potential advantages in open liver resection
      have been demonstrated. The main technical advance relates to decreased intra-operative
      bleeding. Results of using USD (Harmonic Scalpel) during recipient hepatectomy showed that
      this method is safe compared with conventional knot tying ligation regarding intra- and
      postoperative bleeding rate. The electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing device LS is another
      alternative, which applies electrothermal bipolar coagulation and dissection in one step. The
      LS dissection device is sealing the tissue first before it is divided (both performed with
      the same device). This may prevent severe bleeding. Furthermore, the sealing device is able
      to cope with the small liver veins which can be sealed and divided safely without the need
      for sutures or clips. Especially the latter could interfere with sufficient &quot;tangential&quot;
      clamping of the inferior caval vein (IVC) for side to side cavo-cavostomy during piggy back
      LT. It was reported that use of LS device for recipient hepatectomy in LT. It was concluded
      that, LS vessel sealing is an efficient method and vessel sealing of caval, portal, and other
      structures can be safely performed in the setting of end-stage liver disease.

      To our knowledge, until now no randomized clinical trial has been conducted to compare
      different dissection methods during recipient hepatectomy. While LS and USD have been proven
      to be used safely in several major surgical procedures, including liver resection, their use
      in liver transplant recipient hepatectomy has not yet been evaluated systematically.

      This trial was designed to compare the potential beneficial effects for the use of the LS
      device and USD for recipient hepatectomy during LT. Furthermore the evaluation of safety and
      practicability of these methods is investigated. Both the duration and the blood loss during
      the total surgery and the hepatectomy phase of transplantation are of interest.

    <masking_description>Blinding of surgical staff is impossible due to differing methods in the three groups. Since the primary endpoint &quot;total blood loss&quot; is recorded during surgery, and secondary endpoints are objective physiological findings, blinding of the subjects is not intended. Therefore the open design is not considered to cause avoidable bias.</masking_description>

    <description>The suction container fluid volume (in Milliliters) is added to the weight (in Grams) of all surgical swabs at the end of the skin closure (A). The difference of the density of the rinse solution (isotonic Sodium Chloride solution) and blood is approximately 0.055 g/cmÂ³. With regard to the exactness of the measurements this difference is considered clinically irrelevant.
The volume of the entire rinse fluid (in Milliliters) that was used during the procedure is added to the known dry weight (in Grams) of the respective number of surgical swabs that were used during the procedure (B). The total BL is defined as &quot;A&quot; minus &quot;B&quot; in Milliliters.</description>
