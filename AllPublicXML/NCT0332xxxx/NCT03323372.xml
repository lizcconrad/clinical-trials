  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized, double-blind controlled clinical study was to evaluate the
      absolute risk and intensity of sensitivity to dental bleaching in adults on the application
      of two different gels based on potassium nitrate and sodium fluoride from a prospective
      randomized clinical study.

      For this study, 56 volunteers who had an equal allocation rate between the groups (G1-control
      and G2-experimental) were selected for this study. Both gels act in the same way, the
      difference between them is the concentration. In both groups, the different desensitizing
      gels were applied to the vestibular surface of the anterior superior teeth with the aid of a
      tray, remaining in position according to the time specified by the manufacturers. In the
      control group, a gel based on 5% potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride was used, while in
      the experimental group, the gel was based on 3% potassium nitrate and 0.25% sodium fluoride.
      After removal of the desensitizing gel, both groups were subjected to bleaching with 40%
      hydrogen peroxide gel for 40 minutes. Patients recorded an occurrence or not of dental
      sensitivity (SD) in a sensitivity diary for 48 hours. A Verbal Evaluation Scale (VRS) and a
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were used for pain assessment. The values were organized into two
      categories: percentage of patients who presented SD at some time of treatment (absolute risk
      of sensitivity) and SD intensity. To evaluate the color before the first bleaching session,
      and after 7, 14 and 28 days, two methods were used: objective evaluation using the
      spectrophotometer and subjective evaluation using two color scales: Vita Classical and Vita
      Bleachedguide 3D-MASTER. An analysis of the data followed the intent-to-treat protocol and
      involved all randomly allocated participants. The absolute risk of SD was compared using
      Fisher's exact test (α = 5%). The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the intensity of SD.

      Student's t test was used to compare the color change. The level of significance adopted in
      all tests was 5%.

    <description>Patients recorded the occurrence or not of tooth sensitivity (TS) in a sensitivity diary. Participants were asked to register if they experienced DS during treatment and up to 48 hours after bleaching. The Analogic Visual Scale (AVS) was used to assess pain. Each item was scored 0-10 (0- no pain and 10- pain as bad as can be).</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked to record their perception of tooth sensitivity (TS) during the first and second bleaching sessions using the five-point Numeric Rating Scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = considerable, and 4 = severe]. Subjects were asked to record their experience with TS during the treatment, up to 1 h after bleaching, from 1 h to 24 h, and from 24 to 48 h after bleaching. They were also asked to record whether their experienced or not TS during the 30-day period after bleaching. As two bleaching sessions were performed, the highest score obtained in both bleaching sessions was considered for statistical purposes.</description>

    <description>Color was recorded before the bleaching procedure, 7 days and 30 days after the end of the bleaching treatment using an objective method (Easyshade spectrophotometer, Vident, Brea, CA, USA). For each evaluation, three readings were performed using the CIELab system parameters, in which: L * indicates luminosity, a * represents color and saturation on the red-green axis and b * means color and saturation on the yellow-blue axis. Color evaluation was done in a room under artificial lightning conditions without interference from outside light. The color was checked at the middle third of the canine.</description>

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Color was recorded before the bleaching procedure, 7 days and 30 days after the end of the bleaching treatment using a subjective (value-oriented shade guide Vita Classic). For subjective evaluation, the 16 color guides of the Vita Classical scale (Vita Zahnfabrik®, Bad Säckingen, Germany) were organized from the highest value (B1) to the lowest value (C4). Although the scale is not linear, it was organized by value representing a ranking for analysis purposes. Color evaluation was done in a room under artificial lightning conditions without interference from outside light. The color was checked at the middle third of the canine.</description>

    <description>In group 1 (G1-control), the operator applied a desensitizing gel based on 5% potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride (Desensibilize KF 2% ®, FGM , Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil) with the aid of a custom silicone tray, which was made from a model obtained from the patient, with a vacuum plasticizer. A small layer of the gel was placed on the surface of the tray that was in contact with the vestibular face of the upper anterior teeth of the participants. The tray remained in position in the mouth for 10 minutes, according to the manufacturer's specifications.</description>
