  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an acceptable surgical strategy determine whether to
      perform radical lymphadenectomy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Investigators
      aim to determine the validity of this technique with our novel tumor targeted fluorescent
      TMVP1-ICG to increased accuracy of SLN mapping.

    <description>The TMVP1-ICG (WuXi AppTec, Shanghai, China) powder was diluted in 20 ml of aqueous sterile water to a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. 0.4ml of TMVP1-ICG solution was injected into the cervix, divided into 3 and 9 o'clock position, in the operating room. During the laparoscopy, the PinPoint S1 Novadaq (PinPoint Endoscopic Fluorescence Imaging System, NOVADAQ, Mississauga, ON, Canada), 30° laparoscopes were used for fluorescent detection.</description>
