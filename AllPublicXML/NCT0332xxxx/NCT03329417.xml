  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators assumed that mirror therapy combined with virtual
      reality technology will provide a better treatment effects than traditional mirror therapy
      for the patients with unilateral stroke. The aim of the study is to examine the difference in
      the treatment effects among the combination of task-oriented training with either virtual
      reality based mirror therapy, mirror therapy or traditional occupational therapy on the upper
      extremity function and brain activity of the stroke patients.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the result of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) for motor function of upper extremity test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (2 points for the detail being performed completely, 1 point for the detail being performed partially, and 0 for the detail not being performed). The maximum motor performance score is 66 points for the upper extremity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the result of Modified Ashworth scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle tone is defined by the resistance of a muscle being stretched without resistance. The MAS scores were distributed across the entire scale, ranging from 0 to 4, that is convenient for the clinician use. The grading of the scale is described as below: 0) no increase in muscle tone; 1) minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion; 1+) slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the reminder (less than half) of the ROM; 2) more marked increase in tone but only after part is easily flexed; 3) considerable increase in tone; and 4) passive movement is difficult and affected part is rigid in flexion or extension.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the result of Box and blocks test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The score is the number of blocks carried from one box to the other in one minute. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the result of Semmes-Weinstein monofilament (SWM) test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Semmes-Weinstein monofilamenttest examines the cutaneous pressure threshold, range from 1.65-6.65. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the result of Motor Activity Log</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 6 weeks and 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-structured interview examine how much and how well the subject uses their more-affected arm for 30 ADLs. Score range from 0-180. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Power Spectrum of the Electroencephalography (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Power spectrum is computed for the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (14-24 Hz) frequency bands. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Cortical Excitability Assessed by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
