  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Music has a potential role in health care. In the geriatric population, music presents a
      non-pharmacological intervention which is easy to implement. Also, music has a potential role
      in order to improve patient's mobility. For example, it was also shown that the rhythmic
      component of music combined with physical exercise can improve gait variability which has
      been identified as a marker of gait instability and a fall predictor. This effect was
      previously shown in older community dwellers as a music-based intervention significantly
      improved gait and balance stability.

      Considering that music was shown to have a positive impact on communication, emotions and
      depressive symptoms this intervention has the potential to make our patients more conscious
      of their environment, leading to an improved mobility.

      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that patients who attend live music sessions (compared to
      controls) will demonstrate an improvement in their mobility measures. This effect could
      potentially be explained by the rhythmic effect of music and by the fact that live music
      sessions lead to an improved mood, communication, emotions, and an improved mobility.

        -  The primary objective of this study will be to determine if participation to live music
           sessions will be associated with an improvement in mobility which will be measured using
           the Times Up and Go (TUG) and gait speed when compared to a control group.

        -  The second objective of this study will be to determine if patients participating in
           live music sessions compared to a control group demonstrate an increase/improvement at
           the end of their music session in their mood (the Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) will
           be used), in their positive emotions (the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) will be
           used) and communication behaviour (the CODEM (tool to assess communication behavior in
           dementia) instrument will be used).

        -  The third objective of this study will be to perform a &quot;feasibility study&quot;. By measuring
           the variation in the different scales which will be used (see the third objective), the
           investigators will be able to determine how many participants will be necessary for an
           eventual larger scale study.

      This will be a prospective open-label randomized control trial. The patients will be randomly
      assigned to a musical intervention or to a television intervention (control group). The
      patients will only attend one session in the context of this research project. Pre and post
      measures will be done.

    <textblock>
      Music has a potential role in health care. In patients with major neurocognitive impairment
      (previously called dementia), several studies have demonstrated that musical intervention can
      improve cognition, in particular spatial and temporal orientation, episodic memory and
      working memory. It was also shown that music may improve quality of life and reduce
      depressive symptoms, and there is growing evidence for the use of music to treat pain and
      anxiety.

      When specifically looking at the geriatric population, music listening presents a
      non-pharmacological intervention which is easy to implement in inpatients with functional
      decline. It was shown to improve mood in both cognitively impaired and intact patients.

      Music has a potential role in order to improve patient's mobility. For example, it was also
      shown that the rhythmic component of music combined with physical exercise can improve gait
      variability which has been identified as a marker of gait instability and a fall predictor.
      This effect was previously shown in older community dwellers as a music-based intervention
      significantly improved gait and balance stability.

      Also, considering that music was shown to have a positive impact on communication, emotions
      and depressive symptoms, this intervention therefore has the potential to make our patients
      more conscious of their environment, leading to an improved mobility.

      Thus, the investigators hypothesize that patients who attend live music sessions (compared to
      controls) will demonstrate an improvement in their mobility measures. This effect could
      potentially be explained by the rhythmic effect of music and by the fact that live music
      sessions lead to an improved mood, communication, emotions, and an improved mobility.

        -  The primary objective of this study will be to determine if participation to live music
           sessions will be associated with an improvement in mobility which will be measured using
           the Times Up and Go (TUG) and gait speed when compared to a control group.

        -  The second objective of this study will be to determine if patients participating in
           live music sessions compared to a control group demonstrate an increase/improvement at
           the end of their music session in their mood (the Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) will
           be used), in their positive emotions (the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) will be
           used) and communication behaviour (the CODEM instrument will be used).

    <time_frame>Start of intervention session and end of intervention session (i.e the first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes of videotaped sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of an observational tool including 2 positive emotions (pleasure and general alertness) and three negative emotions (anger, anxiety/fear, and sadness). The duration of each affect is measured over a ten-minute period and is graded from 1 to 5 (1 =never, 2 &lt; 16 seconds, 3 = 16-59 seconds, 4 = 1-4 minutes, and 5 = &gt;5 minutes).
Will be used to code the first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes of videotaped sessions.</description>

    <measure>Change in Communication Skills at the beginning of the session compared to the end of the session.</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of intervention session and end of intervention session (i.e the first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes of videotaped sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The CODEM (tool to assess communication behavior in dementia) scales will be used. This scale requires a 10-minute observation-period of the participant and uses a scale from 0 to 5 to quantify the communication skills of the participants from 0 to 5 (0 = behavior is not shown during the interaction, 1 = behavior is rarely seen (1-24% during the interaction), 2 = behavior is shown in less than half (25-49%) of the interaction, 3 = behavior is shown in more than half (51-75%) of the interaction, 4 = behavior is shown in almost all (76-99%) interaction situations, and 5 = behavior is always shown (100%) during the interaction). It consists of 15 different items (8 verbal and 7 non-verbal items). For example, eye contact is a non-verbal item.
Will be used to code the first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes of videotaped sessions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients admitted to the Geriatric Assessment Unit of St. Mary's Hospital.

          -  Patients interested in participating in this research (recreational) study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are medically unstable to attend the music or television-watching
             sessions will be excluded from the study.

          -  Also, if patients are deemed to be unsafe by the medical team to undergo a TUG or a
             gait speed assessment, those measures will not be collected. Those patients would
             therefore only fill a pre- and post VAMS and attend the musical or television session.

          -  Finally, the investigators will only consider the first participation to a session in
             our analysis. In other words, patients who have already participated to a music
             session prior to the initiation of this study will be excluded (will not be recruited
             into the study).
