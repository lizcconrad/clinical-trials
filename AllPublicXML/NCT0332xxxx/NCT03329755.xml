    <textblock>
      This study compares the care pathway of melanoma patients treated by immunotherapy in two
      ambulatory care structures. The aim is to measure if a care structure specialized in
      immuno-oncology could rationalize the care of patients.

      This protocol will be based on two different follow-up during the treatment period:

        -  dedicated and coordinated e-follow-up (IUCT-O in Toulouse)

        -  standard follow-up (University Hospital Center in Bordeaux)

      Patients will be followed from the first cycle of immunotherapy until 3 months after the
      initiation treatment.
