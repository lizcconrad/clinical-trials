  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, 2-arm, open-label, multicenter, international phase II trial. A total
      of 196 patients will be included.

      The study will include patients with metastatic Hormone Receptor positive / Human Epidermal
      Growth Factor Receptor (HER2) negative breast cancer with progressive disease after endocrine
      treatment.

      Patients will be randomized (1:1) between two treatment arms: A. palbociclib + fulvestrant
      and b. capecitabine.

             capecitabine. Short-term (&lt;28 days) exposure to mTOR or PI3K inhibitor in the
             (neo)adjuvant setting is allowed.

          2. More than one prior chemotherapy lines for metastatic breast cancer. Previous
             (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy or for radically treated local or regional relapse is
             allowed in addition to one prior chemotherapy line for metastatic breast cancer Note:
             A chemotherapy line in advanced disease is an anticancer regimen that contains at
             least one chemotherapy agent and is given for 21 days or longer. If a cytotoxic
             chemotherapy regimen was discontinued for a reason other than disease progression and
             the decision for its discontinuation was taken within 21 days after starting it, then
             this regimen does not count as a &quot;prior line of chemotherapy&quot;. Chemotherapy regimens
             composed of more than one drug are considered as one line of therapy.

          3. No measurable lesions amenable to biopsy (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, skin rash,
             sclerotic bone etc).

          4. CNS metastases unless asymptomatic and adequately controlled with surgery or
             radiotherapy. Stable CNS disease is defined as CNS metastases or cord compression that

             situ of the cervix.

          8. Active cardiac disease or a history of cardiac dysfunction including any of the
             following:

               1. History of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, or myocardial infarction
                  within 12 months prior to study entry

             randomization.

         10. Subjects with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DHPD) deficiency or previous
             severe reactions to a fluoropyrimidine.

         11. Known abnormalities in coagulation such as bleeding diathesis or ongoing treatment
             with anticoagulants that preclude intramuscular administration of drugs.

         12. Ongoing pregnancy or lactation.

         13. Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.

         14. A previous metastatic tumor biopsy reported to be negative for both estrogen receptor
             and progesterone receptor (i.e. &lt;1% for both), or positive for HER2 status (amplified
