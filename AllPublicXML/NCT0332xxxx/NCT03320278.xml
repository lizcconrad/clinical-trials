  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Difficult intubation is considered one of the most important obstacle increasing mortality in
      anesthesiology. Airway assessment tests are proceeded to overcome these difficulties in the
      pre-anesthetic evaluation. In this study, the Simplified Predictive Intubation Difficulty
      Score (SPIDS) and Thyromental Height Measurement (TMH) were chosen as primary methods to
      predict difficult intubation. Total 155 ear-nose-throat (ENT) and Plastic Surgery patients
      were planned to enroll this study to assess the effectiveness of these tests in predicting
      difficult intubation in 155 in Maltepe University Hospital and Sisli Hamidiye Etfal
      Governmental Hospital.

      The SPIDS of volunteers will be calculated according to their previous knowledge of difficult
      intubation, airway pathologies, head and neck movements, mouth opening, modified Mallampati
      test and thyromental distance. TMH value will be measured with ASIMETO depth device. Finally,
      the SPIDS and TMH values will be statistically compared to predict difficult intubation which
      is determined with difficult intubation score (IDS).

      The investigators would like to evaluate 155 patients, who applied to be operated in plastic
      surgery and ENT clinics, patients between May 2016 and December 2017. The patients will be
      recruited to study consecutively therefore, there is going to be no randomization. The
      patients' height, age, weight, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores will be
      documented. Additionally, their Mallampati scores, thyromental distance, thyromental height,
      mouth opening values will be measured with ASIMETO DEPTH GAUGE digitally. Head and neck
      movement angle measurement will proceed in preoperative evaluation. In the operation room the
      intubation, determination of C-L and IDS are going to be operated by the anesthesiologist who
      is in charge of operating room and he or she will not be informed about airway assessments
      like SPIDS or TMH. The all difficult airway equipment will be readily prepared in advanced.
      Recorded data will be collected by the assistant researcher. The existing difficult
      intubation interventions will be determined by using IDS. The relationship between IDS, TMH
      and SPIDS values will be assessed in the means of predicting difficult airway.

      of predicting difficult airway.

      Measurements:

      Mallampati score: It has four grades and Mallampati 3 and 4 considered predictive factor for
      difficult intubation Thyromental distance (TMD): Short thyromental distance (TMD; &lt; 5 cm) has
      been correlated with difficult direct laryngoscopic intubation in adult patients.

      Thyromental height (TMH): This is a new technique for predicting difficult intubation and its
      accepted cut off is generally 5cm.

      Height/Thyromental distance: Ratio of height in cm and thyromental distance in cm Intubation
      difficulty score (IDS): 0 is easy, 0-5 is slight difficulty and higher than 5 is moderate or
      serious difficulty in intubation.

      The simplified descriptive intubation difficulty score (SPIDS): The maximum score can be 55
      and the total score greater than 55 is considered as difficult intubation. Calculation of
      SPIDS score following parameters is needed.

      apnea, facial malformations, cervical dislocation etc. no is 0, yes 10 is points We would
