  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate whether iovera° treatment prior to Total Knee
      Arthroplasty (TKA) decreases cumulative patient opioid use over the course of 6 weeks
      following TKA while maintaining similar levels of pain relief. The study will also
      investigate whether there is a relationship between patients treated with iovera° and patient
      reported pain and function as measured by KOOS JR., NRS for Pain; use of hospital services
      post-TKA and improved physical rehabilitation as measured by range of motion.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Opioid Consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of opioid pills consumed over a 6 week period following TKA surgery. The amount of pills consumed is determined based on a count of remaining pills that occurs at each follow-up versus the amount dispensed to the subject.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>KOOS JR. Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS Jr. questionnaire consists of 7 questions from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) for Joint Replacement questionnaire. The KOOS Jr. measures patient-reported pain and function. The score ranges from 0-100, with 0 representing total knee disability and 100 representing perfect knee health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Rating Score (NRS) for Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS is an 11-point scale (0 points to 10 points), where 0 points equals &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 points equals the &quot;worst pain&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Get Up and Go (TUG) Test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility. It tests the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 22 to 79 years of age

          2. Scheduled to undergo primary unilateral TKA under spinal anesthesia for primary
             diagnosis of osteoarthritis

          3. Subject is a class I-III on the American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) Physical
             Classification System

          4. Anticipation of discharge to home after inpatient acute post-op phase based on age,
             co-morbidities, home environment, and social support are in favor of discharge to home
             in the opinion of the Investigator.

          5. Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.

          6. Subject is fluent in verbal and written English.

          7. Subject is willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all
             follow-up visits for the duration of the study.

          8. Subject is in good general health and free of any systemic disease state or physical
             condition that might impair evaluation or which in the Investigator's opinion, exposes
             the Subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronic opioid use (defined as daily or almost daily use of opioids for &gt;3 months).

          2. Concurrent painful physical condition, surgery, or musculoskeletal disease that
             requires analgesic treatment during study follow-up that is not strictly related to
             the target knee being treated with iovera°, which have the potential to confound the
             postoperative assessments (e.g., significant pain from other joints, chronic
             neuropathic pain, concurrent or planned contralateral TKA, concurrent foot, neck,
             spine, hip, or other musculoskeletal disease, arthritis, or planned surgery, etc.).

          3. Greater than 15° malalignment (varus or valgus) on pre-operative radiograph.

          4. Previous Myoscience treatment.

          5. Previous Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty. Partial or Total Knee Arthroplasty of the

             branch of the saphenous nerve (ISN) or the anterior femoral cutaneous nerve (AFCN) or
             result in scar tissue in the treatment area.

          8. Any clotting disorder and/or use of an anticoagulant (e.g. warfarin, clopidogrel,

             (81mg or less daily) for cardiac prophylaxis allowed.

          9. Any local skin condition at the treatment sites that in the Investigator's opinion
             would adversely affect treatment or outcomes.

         10. Open and/or infected wound in the treatment areas.

         11. Allergy to lidocaine.

         12. History of cryoglobulinemia

             equivalent (i.e. legal case).

             adequate participation.

         21. Any chronic medication use (prescription, over-the-counter, etc.) that in the
             Investigator's opinion would affect study participation or Subject safety.

         22. For any reason, in the opinion of the Investigator, the Subject may not be a suitable
             candidate for study participation (i.e., history of noncompliance, drug dependency,
