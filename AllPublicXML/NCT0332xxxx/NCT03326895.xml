      This prospective clinical study will compare a powered circular stapler to commercial
      mechanical staplers for performance issues in patients scheduled to undergo colectomy with
      left-sided colon anastomosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Surgical staplers have been utilized in colorectal procedures since the early 20th century,
      with intraluminal staplers used to create the anastomosis since 1979. Successful utilization
      of these devices, whether in open or laparoscopic procedures, requires extensive training and
      experience. Even with experience, device issues such as stapler misfire, incomplete firing,
      low surgeon satisfaction, etc., may occur. In a retrospective study of 349 colorectal
      resections, 67 (19%) procedures had some type of technical error. The most frequently
      reported issues from the analysis were positive leak tests, difficulty placing or removing
      the stapler, and inadequate donuts. Surgeons may also experience psychological or physical
      stress during procedures due to complications, workload, or other factors.

      Patients scheduled to undergo a left-sided colon resection, and who meet study entry
      criteria, may be enrolled. Investigators will perform each procedure using either a
      commercially-available manual or powered circular stapler according to their instructions for
      use (IFU). There will be no blinding. Procedures may be performed open or via minimally
      invasive surgery (MIS) according to institutional standard-of-care (SOC). Use of a hand port
      and robotic assistance are permissible providing an intra-luminal circular stapler is used to
      create the anastomosis. Conversion from laparoscopic to open surgery is permissible under the
      protocol at the surgeon's discretion for the patient's safety.

      The study will be conducted using a staged approach. In Stage 1, surgeons will perform
      procedures according to institutional SOC using their preferred manual circular stapler.
      Surgeons will begin using the powered circular stapler (Stage 2) after procedures with the
      manual stapler have been completed. Surgeons will complete approximately the same number of
      procedures with the powered stapler as were completed with the manual stapler.

      The final scheduled study visit will occur approximately 3-5 weeks post-procedure (routinely
      scheduled follow-up with surgeon). Follow-up by phone is permissible when an on-site visit is
      not planned or is more than six weeks post-operative.
