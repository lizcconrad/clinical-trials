  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study is to evaluation of the clinical efficacy and stability of Information
      and Communication Technology (ICT)- based centralized monitoring system of asthma control
      monitoring in asthma patients. We planed to enroll 100 asthma patients (50 subjects using ICT
      systems, 50 controls). We will monitor the asthma control status, lung function, exacerbation
      rate and stability of ICT systems.

      This study is based upon work supported by the Ministry of Trade, Industry &amp; Energy (MOTIE,
      Korea) under industrial Technology Innovation Program (No. 10059066, 'Establishment of ICT
      Clinical Trial System and Foundation for Industrialization').

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has a multi- center, open- label, prospective and randomized clinical trial
      design. One hundred asthma patients who fill out the informed consent form are registered and
      randomized 1:1 into the ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring group (n=50) or the
      ambulatory follow-up group (n=50). The planned follow-up duration is 6 months. he ICT-based
      centralized clinical trial monitoring group is given home based spirometry and connecting
      system (gateway) equipped with personal identification system. Fingerprint registration is
      required in advance, so that it would be used for authentication before each use of
      spirometry. Symptom score and lung functions (FEV1, PEFR) obtained from gateway is saved,
      monitored, and sent out via a home-monitoring system. In the ICT-based centralized clinical
      trial monitoring group, feedback is sent to both patients and medical staff in the form of
      texts if there is a worsening of symptoms score and/or lung function.

      Subjects are to make office visits after randomization at 4, (8), 12, (16, 20), and 24 weeks.
      (ICT group will not visit at the schedules in the brackets) Each visit requires measurement
      of Questionnaire (ACQ) lung functions.

They send the information to central monitoring system(EDC systems). In case of decreased FEV1 compared with own average FEV1, the ICT based monitoring system send the feedback message to the subject and medical staffs.</description>
