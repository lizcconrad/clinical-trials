  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The European Union's Horizon 2020 project issued a Call for Action [1] in December 2013 to
      design, develop, disseminate and evaluate new IT technologies for use in integrative
      treatment processes, with emphasis on complex adult patient. Assuta Hospital submitted a
      proposal for this call, as part of a broad consortium of 10 participants from various
      European countries.

      The CONNECARE consortium has formulated a general model for integrative treatment, and is
      currently in the technological development stages, to create a smart (supportive decision)
      and adaptive system that supports integrative treatment processes both in the hospital and in
      the community for personalized treatment in complex chronic patients. The development
      includes a significant integrative component of self-care management by the patient and / or
      the primary caregiver.

      Following the completion of the technological development, clinical trials will be held in
      four organizations throughout Europe - Assuta Hospital in Ashdod in cooperation with the
      Maccabi community in Ashdod, two centers in Catalonia and the Groningen region in the
      Netherlands. The purpose of the studies is to assess the impact of the implementation of the
      model, processes and digital tools that will be built during the project.

      The intervention in this study consists of two parts:

        1. Integrative treatment in the community, which includes a close follow-up with a
           coordinating nurse for three months after discharge from the hospital.

        2. Empowering the patient to self-manage his or her health by using applications for smart
           devices.

      The study protocol:

        1. Recruitment of participants during the patient's hospitalization after the patient is
           identified as a complex patient, explanation of the study and signing the consent form.

        2. Evaluation process for the patient, using valid questionnaires, in order to determine
           the baseline level at the entrance to the study.

        3. Distribution of research kit and related accessories and training.

        4. Close monitoring for three months in the community after discharge from the hospital and
           use of the research kit.

        5. Reassessment of the patient at the exit of the study.

    <description>The CONNECARE SMS will rely on a hybrid solution that, besides being autonomous (the patient may use the SMS to monitor and access to her/his data and information), has also a collaborative component (through the interaction with the SACM) to allow participation by clinicians and to provide feedback to them. In so doing, the patient may control her/his activity, receiving recommendations to improve the treatment and to be encouraged in following it.</description>
