  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single arm, Long Term Extension (LTE) safety,
      tolerability and efficacy study of filgotinib in subjects withmoderately to severely active
      PsA.It is estimated that approximately 105 subjects will be rolled-over after they have
      completed the 16 weeks of double-blind treatment in core study GLPG0634-CL-224.Subjects in
      the LTE study will be treated with filgotinib for a duration of 148 weeks. The LTE study is
      concluded with a follow-up visit approximately 4 weeks after the last intake of study
      treatment. Consequently, each subject will stay in the LTE study for a maximum of 152 weeks.

             to the investigator's clinical judgment.

          -  Subjects who discontinued the qualifying core study GLPG0634-CL-224 due to safety or
             tolerability issues.

          -  Subjects who require immunization with live/live attenuated vaccine.

          -  Diagnosis of rheumatic autoimmune disease or inflammatory joint disease other than
             psoriatic arthritis, except for Sjögren's syndrome.

          -  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart
             failure, uncontrolled diabetes, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction,
             unstable angina, unstable arrhythmia or any other cardiovascular condition since the
             inclusion to the GLPG0634- CL-224 study.

          -  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal tract ulceration and/or active
             diverticulitis since the inclusion to the GLPG0634-CL-224 study.

          -  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of possible lymphoproliferative disease including

          -  Subjects with symptoms suggestive of malignancy since the inclusion to the
             GLPG0634-CL-224 study.
