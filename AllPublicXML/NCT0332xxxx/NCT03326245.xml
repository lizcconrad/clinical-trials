      Background:

      Dopamine (DA) is a chemical signal in the brain linked to learning, memory, and habits.
      Stimulant drugs like methylphenidate can increase DA in the brain. Researchers want to
      measure DA with and without this drug. They want to learn how methylphenidate and brain
      dopamine affect body responses, mood, and thinking.

      Objective:

      To better understand the role of dopamine in the brain and the effects of methylphenidate.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18-55 who have used alcohol or stimulant drugs but have no drug dependence.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

        -  Physical exam

        -  Question about medical, psychiatric, and alcohol and drug use history

        -  Questions to see if it s safe to have a PET/MRI scan

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Breath test for alcohol

      Participants will have 3 or 4 study visits. At each visit they will have:

        -  Urine and breath tested for alcohol and drugs

        -  A thin plastic tube (catheter) inserted in each arm by needle

        -  A small amount of radioactive chemical injected through the catheter.

        -  PET/MRI scan. Participants will lie still on a table that slides in and out of a metal
           cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Their vital signs will be monitored.
           They will get earmuffs for loud noises. Before the scan, participants will get the study
           drug or placebo through the catheter. They may also get a sugar pill (placebo). They
           will get a small meal and have blood drawn.

        -  Tests of memory, attention, and thinking.

      Participants will wear an activity monitor on the wrist for one week.

      -  Objectives: The overarching goal of this study is to assess the dynamic association
           between dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R) occupancymeasured by positron emission
           tomography (PET) with [11C]raclopride and brain activity inferred by pharmacological
           magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) in the human brain, and to assess the relative
           sensitivity and specificity of the neurovascular coupling for slow (oral) versus rapid
           (intravenous, IV) stimulant methylphenidate (MP) delivery. Secondary objectives are to
           assess the associations between behavioral measures (heart and respiration rates and
           blood pressure, motor and sleep parameters, and neuropsychological testing variables),
           D2R occupancy and fMRI signals.

        -  Study population: 10 healthy males and 10 healthy females 18-55 years old will be
           included.

        -  Design: Double-blind. Participants will undergo simultaneous PET/phMRI, to evaluate
           dynamic changes in D2R occupancy by DA with [11C]raclopride and in bloodoxygenation-
           level dependent (BOLD) signals, under MP or placebo (PL). The participants will be
           scanned on 3 different occasions: 1) oral-MP (60 mg) and iv PL (3 cc saline), 2) oral-PL
           and iv-MP (0.25 mg/kg in 3 cc sterile water) and 3) oral PL and iv PL, which will be
           carried in different study days with at least 48 hours between them and their order will
           be randomized across subjects. Participants and researchers will be blind to the nature
           of the stimulant drug (MP/PL).

        -  Outcome parameters: The scale factor between the distribution volume ratio (DVR) and the
           BOLD signal in the dorsal and ventral striatum for the slow and fast MP challenges.

             DSM-IV) anxiety disorder or panic attacks. Those with a binge drinking history in the
             last 10 years will also be excluded. Past history of a mental disorder as defined by
             DSM-IV or DSM-5 will be excluded only if it required hospitalization (any length), or
             chronic medication management (more than 4 weeks), and that could impact brain
             function at the time of the study. Binge drinkers are those who being female consume 4

             standard contraindication to MRI/MRS (elf-report checklist).

          -  Cannot lie comfortably flat on back for up to 2 hours in the PET/phMRI scanner.

          -  Body weight &gt; 204 kg (&gt; 450 lbs).

               -  Subjects will not be excluded from enrollment in this study if their urine test
                  is positive for drugs. However, if they test positive on scheduled study
                  procedure days involving study imaging and neuropsychological testing, the
                  procedures will be postponed and rescheduled. We will allow for up to 3
                  rescheduled study days that were the result of positive urine drug screens. If
                  the drug test is positive on the third rescheduled visit, the participant will be
                  withdrawn from the study.
