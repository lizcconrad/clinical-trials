    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to determine:

        -  The safety of LY3305677 and any side effects that might be associated with it.

        -  How much LY3305677 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to remove it
           in healthy participants, including those of Japanese origin.

        -  The effect LY3305677 has on the body, particularly the effect on blood glucose levels.

      This study will last approximately 17 weeks not including screening. Screening is required
      within 4 weeks prior to start of the study.

      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical conditions.
