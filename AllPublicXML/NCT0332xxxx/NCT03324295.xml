  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      cataracts could be cured with eye drops. Some studies reported that in chronic renal failure,
      the occurrence of cataract is rare and the mechanism is unknown. The aim of this research is
      to describe correlation between urea concentration in the serum and aqueous humor and
      development of age related cataract.

      The study was conducted in the departments of Ophthalmology and internal medicine,

      Asyut University hospitals, Egypt. Three groups of subjects were included:

      patients with age related cortical cataracts who are otherwise healthy (cases) and two
      control groups; first systemically healthy subjects with ocular problems other than cataract
      and a second control group of patients with impaired renal functions and are not on dialysis
      treatment and thus have elevated serum urea levels. Slit lamp examination was performed to
      evaluate crystalline lens for opacities. Measurement of serum urea was done for all study
      subjects. Aqueous humor urea concentration was done only for the group of patients who are
      planned to have intraocular surgery. For that purpose, 0.1 ml of aqueous humor will be
      aspirated at the start of routine intraocular surgery.
