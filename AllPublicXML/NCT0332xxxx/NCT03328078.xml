  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label trial of orally administered CA-4948 monotherapy in adult
      patients with Relapsed or Refractory NHL. The trial will be conducted in 2 parts: an initial
      Dose Escalation Phase (Part A) of CA-4948 in patients with Relapsed or Refractory Non-Hodgkin
      Lymphoma, (RR NHL) and a Dose Expansion Phase (Part B) of CA-4948 in patients with RR NHL
      with and without myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutations. During Part
      B, patients will be enrolled regardless of MYD88 mutation status.
