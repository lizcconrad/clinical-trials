    <textblock>
      Medline 2% CHG cloth (Active) - A single cloth from the pack was used per treatment area. The
      investigational test article was applied topically by vigorously scrubbing the skin in a back
      and forth motion for three minutes (and halfway through the 3-minute application time, the
      cloth was turned over) over the treatment area (7&quot; x 10&quot; of the subject's back), and the skin
      was allowed to air dry.
