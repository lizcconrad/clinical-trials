  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether the use of a rapid pleurodesis
      protocol using 10% iodopovidone immediately after tunneled pleural catheter placement
      improves time to IPC removal compared to patients who receive an IPC alone.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be screened throughout the year as part of the clinical referral process to the
      Interventional Pulmonology service at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for the
      management of a malignant pleural effusion. Patients eligible for inclusion based on the
      clinical evaluation will be approached for enrollment. Written consent will be obtained.
      Patients will subsequently undergo placement of a IPC under MAC as per standard clinical
      practice followed by complete drainage of the pleural space. Patients randomized to the rapid
      pleurodesis protocol arm will received 20mL of 10% iodopovidone mixed with 80mL of normal
      saline instilled intrapleurally through the IPC. Patients randomized to the standard of care
      arm will have 100mL of normal saline (placebo) instilled intrapleurally through the IPC. The
      mixture will be allowed to dwell for 2 hours and then completely evacuated through the IPC
      and the patient will be discharged home.

      After discharge, all patients will continue to drain their IPC on a daily basis for 7 days.
      Following this, all patients will continue to drain their IPC on an every-other-day basis
      until total IPC output is less than 50ml per session over 3 consecutive sessions. At which
      point they will be asked to undergo a clamp trial of no drainage for 7 days followed by a
      reattempt at drainage. Patients without return of symptoms over those 7 days and minimal
      drainage afterwards (&lt;50ml) will be seen in the office for possible IPC removal. Patients
      with return of symptoms during those 7 days or more than minimal drainage afterwards (&gt;50mL)
      will be asked to continue drainage until total IPC output is again less than 50mL per session
      over 3 sessions.

      After a passed clamp trial, patients will be evaluated in the office with a bedside
      ultrasound to assess for pleural apposition in 5 of 6 designated points and the absence of
      pleural effusions. If all criteria are met, the IPC is removed. If there is evidence of
      residual effusion, continued drainage will be advised.

      All patients will be evaluated in the office on day 7, day 14, day 30, day 60 and day 90
      after IPC placement. On each visit they will be assessed for pleural apposition with
      ultrasound. At day 30, 60, and 90 all patients will receive a global health related
      questionnaire (EORTC QLQ30) and a symptom questionnaire. At 90 days, complications rate will
      be assessed for the entire study period.

    <masking_description>Subject assignment will be done using randomly generated assignment tables based on stratification by tumor type (Lung, Breast, Other) and assigned 1:1 using random permuted blocks of 4.
Subjects will be blinded to their group assignment to minimize bias on follow up surveys.
Physicians evaluating the patient during the initial visit and on subsequent postprocedure followup will be blinded to subject assignment. The provider responsible for placement of the catheter and delivery of the pleurodesis agent or placebo will not be involved in post procedure followup care
All treatment physicians will follow prespecified protocols in deciding on adequate pleurodesis and timing of IPC removal.</masking_description>

    <description>The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30) will be used to assess global health-related quality of life. This is a 30-item questionnaire validated for use in patients with cancer. The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

    <description>We will use a 5 point Likert scale (5PLS) that has been created for the trial. Patients will be asked to indicate their degree of shortness of breath or chest pain during sitting, walking and lying down/sleeping on that specific day. Thus, a total of 6 scales will be utilized. Point 1 will be described as &quot;no shortness of breath&quot; or &quot;no chest pain.&quot; Point 2 will be described as &quot;mild shortness of breath&quot; or &quot;mild chest pain.&quot; Point 3 will be described as &quot;moderate shortness of breath&quot; or &quot;moderate chest pain.&quot; Point 4 will be described as &quot;severe shortness of breath&quot; or &quot;severe chest pain.&quot; Point 5 will be described as &quot;Worst shortness of breath possible&quot; or &quot;Worst chest pain possible.&quot;</description>
