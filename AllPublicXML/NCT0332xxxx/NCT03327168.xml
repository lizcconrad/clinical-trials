  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the significance of adenosine and A2A receptors in human brown
      adipose tissue (BAT) in vivo. Using positron emission tomography (PET), perfusion and the
      density of A2A receptors will be measured in supraclavicular BAT and other tissues in healthy
      men. The investigators hypothesize, that adenosine can activate BAT, and that adenosine A2A
      receptor density changes when BAT is activated by cold exposure.

      Understanding the mechanisms of BAT activation and the role of endocannabinoids in humans is
      important and beneficial in fighting against the epidemic of obesity and diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenosine is a purine nucleoside released locally in BAT when noradrenaline and ATP are
      released from sympathetic nerves. Recently it was found that adenosine activates murine and
      human brown adipocytes, and recruits beiging of white fat via adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR).
      Furthermore, studies with mice have shown improvements in glucose homeostasis after
      administration of A2AR agonists.

      In this study the investigators use the PET radiotracer [15O]-H2O to quantify perfusion of
      BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT) and muscle in three conditions: room temperature, cold
      exposure and intravenous infusion of adenosine. Another PET radiotracer [11C]TMSX is used to
      quantify adenosine A2A receptor density of BAT, WAT and muscle in room temperature and during
      cold exposure.
