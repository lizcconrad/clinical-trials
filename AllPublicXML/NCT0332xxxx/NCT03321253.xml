      It has been hypothesized that potential effects of laser Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy
      may affect macular pigment as well as choroidal thickness, macular thickness and anterior
      chamber parameters, so it was aimed to investigate possible effects of Nd: YAG laser
      posterior capsulotomy on macular pigment optical density, choroidal thickness, macular
      thickness and anterior chamber parameters in cases with posterior capsule opacification in
      this study.

      This clinical trial was conducted following the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
      The local authorized clinical trials ethics committee approved the protocol and consent forms
      (Afyon Kocatepe University Clinical Trials Ethics Committee, 2011-KAEK-2 2017/172). Between
      2015 and 2016, 38 pseudophakic participants ranging from 45 to 65 years of age and previously
      undergone cataract surgery, no prior Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy and pan-retinal
      laser photocoagulation (PRP), were enrolled in this study. Posterior capsule opacification
      (PCO) diagnosis of patients undergone cataract surgery at least 2 years ago were diagnosed by
      refractive surgery and retina specialists at ophthalmology department of Afyon Kocatepe
      University. Requirements of Nd:Yag laser posterior capsulotomy of each participants were
      decided by consensus of 3 ophthalmologists. After providing information to patients about the
      disease and treatment, patients predicted to show adherence to treatment, were enrolled in
      the study.

      Detailed ophthalmological examinations of all subjects were performed prior to Nd: YAG laser
      posterior capsulotomy intervention. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was evaluated and
      converted from Snellen to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units for
      easiness in statistical analysis. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured by using Goldmann
      applanation tonometer (AT900®, the Haag-Streit Diagnostics, Essex, England). Biomicroscopic
      and fundus findings (by using SuperField NC® non-contact slit lamp lens, Volk optical, OH,
      USA), and gonioscopy (by using Volk® G-4 Four-mirror glass gonio lens, OH, USA) of patients
      were examined by using slit lamp biomicroscopy (SL-D701® slit-lamp biomicroscope, Topcon,
      Tokyo, Japan). Anterior chamber parameters of cases with PCO were measured by using anterior
      segment module of optical coherence tomography (OCT) (The Spectralis®, Heidelberg
      Engineering, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Measurements of IOP and anterior chamber
      parameters, visual acuity and gonioscopy examinations were performed before pupil dilatation;
      then, at least 7 mm pupil dilatation was achieved using 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine
      eye drops at ten-minute intervals. Slit-lamp and fundus examinations, and measurements of
      central macular thickness (CMT), choroidal thicknesses (CTs) and MPOD were performed after
      maximal pupil dilatation. According to biomicroscopic examination 3 ophthalmologists with
      consensus agreed Nd: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy requirement for each case with PCO.

      Proposed procedure, including risks, beneﬁts, and alternatives were discussed with all
      subjects, and all participants signed of informed consent form. Patients had only mild to
      moderate PCO were enrolled in this study to reduce obstacles to measurements. Participants
      who had false-negative acuity predictions because of diffuse PCO, poor pupillary dilation,
      poor patient posture at the slit-lamp examination, poor patient cooperation, senility,
      illiteracy, communication problems, nystagmus, tremor, and fatigue were excluded in this
      study.

      CMT and CTs were measured by using OCT (The Spectralis® OCT2 Module, Heidelberg Engineering,
      Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Enhanced depth imaging-OCT (EDI-OCT) mode of same device was
      used to measure CTs. CTs were recorded as subfoveal CT (SCT), nasal CT (NCT) and temporal CT
      (TCT) represent under the fovea, 3 mm nasal to the fovea and 3 mm temporal to the fovea
      respectively. MPOD measurements were subsequently made by using luminance differential
      thresholds test (Color perimetry technique) (MonPack System, Metrovision, Perenchies,
      France).

      After measurements a refractive surgery specialist carried out Nd: YAG laser posterior
      capsulotomy interventions to patients who were decided to applying Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy
      (Laserex Tango, Ellex Medical, SA, Australia).

      Proparacaine hydrochloride 0.5% eye drop (Alcaine®, Alcon Laboratories, TX, USA) applied to
      the cornea before the procedure as topical anesthetic for the use of contact lens. Abraham
      contact lens (Ocular Abraham Iridectomy YAG®, Ocular, WA, USA) was used during procedure to
      stabilize the eye, accurate focusing, and to improve the laser beam optics. The minimal
      amount of energy necessary to obtain breakdown and rupture the capsule as possible was aimed
      and applied during procedures. Applied energy range from 1 to 2 mJ/pulse opened all capsules
      in this study. Fırstly, cruciate opening was created beginning superiorly near the 12 o'clock
      position and progressing downward toward the 6 o'clock position. Shots were then placed at
      the edge of the capsule opening, progressed laterally toward the 3 and 9 o'clock positions.
      The laser intentionally focused posterior to the capsule to avoid IOL marks. Free-floating
      fragments were avoided because they might remain and cause additional retinal effects.
      Patients that demonstrated free-floating fragments, visually signiﬁcant pits and cracks in
      interventions were removed from study because of potentials to influence measurements.
      Patients that experienced large fragments in laser treatment were also excluded because of
      fragments may settle against the endothelium or angle structures. Applied total energy, total
      number of shots and total duration were recorded for each eye.

      After Nd: YAG laser intervention all subjects were followed up for 4 hours in terms of
      increased IOP and severe acute anterior chamber inflammation. IOPs were remeasured at 1st and
      4th hour. Subjects' eyes had IOP of 27 mmHg or more, and aqueous flares of 2+ or more were
      not included in this study. Brinzolamide 1% ophthalmic suspension (Azopt®, Alcon
      Laboratories, TX, USA) twice a day and ketorolac tromethamine 0.4% ophthalmic solution 4
      times a day (Acular LS®, Allergan, Inc. CA, USA) treatments were started to all subjects and
      used for a week.

      All examinations and measurements were repeated and recorded at 1st week, 1st and 2nd month.
      All patients were told to continue their normal diet and no participants were used
      supplements containing carotenoid during study period.
