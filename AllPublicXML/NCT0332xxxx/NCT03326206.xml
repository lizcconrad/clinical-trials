  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 2009, a programmatic community-based strategy (COPE) has been implemented to address
      health disparities among Navajo individuals living with multiple chronic conditions. COPE
      (Community Outreach and Patient Empowerment) targets individual, family, and health
      system-level factors through four activities: 1) coordination between community health
      representatives (CHRs) and Indian Health Service providers; 2) CHR competency with
      standardized training; 3) a culturally-sensitive health promotion curriculum for patients and
      families; and 4) strong CHR supervision.

      COPE has been implemented throughout Navajo Nation. Enrollment is programmatic; in other
      words, the decision to enroll a patient in COPE occurs independently of whether the patient
      is in this study. Participants receive the COPE intervention in the same manner and
      intensity, whether they are included in this observational study or not.

      The main goal of this observational research is to understand if COPE improves the lives of
      participating community members. The Primary Aim is to assess the impact of the COPE Project
      on changes in HbA1c and other CVD risk factors. Hypothesis: Patients enrolled in the COPE
      program will experience a reduction in HbA1c compared to the control group. Secondary aims
      are: 1) To understand if COPE improves patients' own self-reported outcomes. Hypothesis: COPE
      patients will report better health compared with their own baseline at 12 months. 2) To
      Identify factors associated with increased effectiveness of the COPE Project at the
      individual, community, and health system level using a mixed-model approach. 3) To understand
      diverse stakeholder perspectives on COPE impact and value among CHRs, providers and the
      health care system. Hypothesis: Compared with baseline, CHRs will report greater empowerment
      in their work, providers will report greater confidence in CHRs.

      The observational cohort will be comprised of individuals with diabetes receiving care at one
      of the participating health facilities. Cases include individuals participating in the COPE
      intervention; controls are non-COPE participants identified within the same hospital and
      matched based on similar baseline characteristics. Study findings will improve clinical and
      patient-decision making and the health of marginalized AI/ANs by informing policies to
      promote CHR interventions in rural and underserved communities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study population: The study will take place on the Navajo Reservation and within Navajo Area
      IHS clinical facilities. The Navajo Reservation covers over 27,000 square miles in rural New
      Mexico and Arizona. The proposed evaluation will occur at the six sites, including two which
      are currently implementing COPE as well as four sites which will implement COPE in the next
      two years. The health care centers included in this evaluation represent a mix of federally
      and tribally operated programs and together provide care for over 200,000 individuals. All
      sites use a common suite of software applications to record electronic health care data: the
      IHS RPMS (Resource Patient Management System).

      Study Design: The research is aligned with PCORI's definition of patient-centered research by
      answering questions that will allow patients and other stakeholders to make informed health
      care decisions. This will be completed by incorporating patient input at all stages;
      comparatively assessing the benefits and weaknesses of COPE; capturing the &quot;voice&quot; of
      stakeholders through qualitative methods; choosing outcomes that have been cited as relevant
      to patients' own priorities and decision-making; and studying cross-site variation to capture
      individual and community factors associated with impact. The study will address the following
      questions:

        1. Do clinical outcomes (hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index)
           improve more among COPE participants, compared with similar patients who do not
           participate in COPE?

        2. Do COPE patients experience improvements in self-rated overall health, quality of life,
           empowerment and satisfaction compared with similar patients who do not participate in
           COPE?

        3. As COPE is implemented in six different service units across the Navajo Nation, can we
           identify any factors among patients, CHRs, and hospitals that are &quot;key ingredients&quot; for
           COPE to be effective?

        4. Does COPE benefit the health system and population served from diverse stakeholder
           perspectives including CHRs, providers, and the local health care delivery system?

    <description>Primary outpatient encounters are identified using the Resource Patient Management System (RPMS) clinic variable. It is notable that the clinic variable includes types of health utilization that are not limited to clinic visits, e.g. inpatient, emergency primary, specialty, dental, counseling/behavioral care. Each clinic visit reported in RPMS is counted as one utilization incident for the purposes of this analysis.</description>

For inpatient services, the primary data point is the presence of a DRG code indicating the patient was hospitalized. However, we also included clinic listings for labor and delivery and for observation as inpatient utilization.</description>

    <description>Individuals living with diabetes seen at a study site who were enrolled in the COPE programmatic intervention during the study period. Participation in COPE consists of receiving home visits by a Navajo Community Health Representative (CHR) once or twice a month for a period of at least 12 months. CHRs use structured patient coaching materials to support behavior change. CHRs also check vital signs, monitor blood glucose levels through finger sticks, and facilitate access to appointments and medical refills. CHRs communicate regularly with providers through electronic health record documentation and case management rounds. In-person or telephone communication is be used to address acute issues that may arise.</description>

    <description>The COPE Program is a programmatic model that is designed to support to providers, Community Health Representatives, and patients/family members. Patients are referred to the COPE Program under program auspices. COPE referral and participation is part of routine care at all service units in Navajo Area Indian Health Services, and enrollment is not influenced by study participation. Patients receive the same health care services in the same manner and intensity, whether or not they are not enrolled in this observational study.</description>
