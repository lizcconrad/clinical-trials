      The aim of the study is to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and
      preference-based health utilities of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers in different stages
      of illness. It will also estimate the cost-effectiveness of anti-viral treatments resulting
      from the prevention of the progression of disease from uncomplicated CHB carriers to
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

        1. Patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) have poorer health-related quality of life
           (HRQOL) than the general population;

        2. Patients with more severe stages of chronic HB infections have lower health related
           quality of life and health utility values;

        3. Anti-viral treatment can improve the HRQOL and health utility for patients with CHB
           infections;

        4. The cost-effectiveness of different treatments for chronic HBV infections can be
           directly compared in terms of cost/QALY gained.

      Design, Setting &amp; Subjects: A cross-sectional study and biomathematical modelling will be
      carried out. In the cross-sectional study, patients known to CHB carriers will be identified
      from the registries of the Ap Lei Chau, Aberdeen and Sai Yung Pun General Outpatient Clinics
      and Queen Mary Hospital. The biomathematical modelling will use a simulated cohort of
      patients aged 18 or above with CHB infections who may receive treatment in Hong Kong.
      Published data on the benefit of anti-viral treatments and the cross-sectional study data on
      preference-based health utility values of different stages of CHB infections will be used to
      estimate the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies using Markov modelling.

      Interventions: Each subject in the cross-sectional study will be interviewed. Five strategies
      for management of CHB infections: 1) No treatment, 2) Interferon monotherapy, 3) lamivudine
      monotherapy, 4) adefovir and 5) combined treatment of lamivudine and adefovir, will be tested
      in the biomathematical modelling,.

      Main Outcome Measures: Health-related quality of life measured by the SF-36, preference-based
      health utilities measured by the SF-6D. quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost of
      different treatment strategies for HBV infection.

      Hypothesis: HRQOL and health utilities of patients with different illness stages, and the
      QALYs gained and cost-effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies will be established.
      The results will provide information on the health burden of CHB infections, and evidence on
      the cost-effectiveness of anti-viral treatments in preventing disease progression can be
      directly compared.

    <description>The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. It consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>

    <description>The Short Form-6 Dimension (SF-6D) is a widely used preference-based generic HRQOL measure with a multiattribute classification system consisting of six dimensions: physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, pain, mental health, and vitality. Each dimension is composed of three to five levels. The SF-6D values range from 0.315 to 1, with higher scores indicating better HRQOL anchoring on the 0 (dead) to 1 (full health) scale.</description>
