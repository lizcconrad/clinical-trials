    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of Antibiotic pastes or Calcium hydroxide disinfection on
      healing of periapical pathology and continued root development of infected non-vital immature
      permanent teeth in children.

      In the test group regenerative endodontic therapy (RET) is performed with antibiotics as the
      disinfecting agent, in the control group RET is performed with Calcium Hydroxide as the
      disinfecting agent.

    <description>RET using antibiotics Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole. First Treatment Visit: Local analgesic, tooth isolation, access, pulp extirpation and root canal irrigation with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite. Canal drying using paper points. Delivery of mixture of Bi antibiotic paste (Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole with sterile water). Tooth access sealed with temporary dressing. Second Treatment Visit: Tooth analgesia using plain local analgesics without vasoconstriction, isolation and re-access as described above. Irrigation of root canal system using sodium hypochlorite followed by paper point drying. Initiation of bleeding through insertion of a sterile k-file at a length of 2-3 mm beyond the working length into the periapical tissues. Access sealed using resorbable plug, Biodentine, followed by composite resin.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged 6-16 years of age

          2. Patients who are fit and healthy or with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1
             or ASA 2 medical conditions

          3. Patients with cooperation level that would allow treatment under local analgesia,
             application of rubber dam isolation and taking of intraoral radiographs.

          4. Patients with permanent premolars that have incomplete root formation with an open
             apex of greater than 1mm width as observed radiographically and of single root canal
             morphology (22)

          5. Patients with single rooted immature permanent premolars having one of the following
             pulpal and periapical diagnosis:

             a. Pulpal i. Necrotic pulp ii. Symptomatic and inflamed pulp not expected to heal.
             During attempted Cvek or cervical pulpotomy procedures, if the pulpal bleeding does
             not stop with direct pressure within 5 minutes, pulpectomy will be carried out and the
             patient will be recruited for RET procedures.

             b. Periapical i. Symptomatic apical periodontitis (with or without a radiographic
             apical lesion) ii. Asymptomatic apical periodontitis (with a radiographic apical
             lesion) iii. Acute apical abscess iv. Chronic apical abscess Teeth will be deemed
             non-vital if either are non-responsive to sensibility tests (i.e. Electric Pulp test
             and cold tests), and/or present with signs and symptoms of non-vitality (e.g. swelling
             and abscess).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged &gt; 16 years of age.

          2. Patient with known allergies to Ciprofloxacin (or any fluoroquinolones class of
             antibiotics) or metronidazole antibiotics.

          3. Patients with medical conditions and/or receiving medications that would affect:

               1. Their body's ability to heal e.g. Diabetes; or

               2. Their ability to clot efficiently, e.g. Haemophilia

          4. Patients with risk of developing infective endocarditis or immune compromised
             patients.

          5. Patients with non-vital permanent premolars where root development is already deemed
             to be completed (i.e. foramen size of 0-1.0mm diameter as determined
             radiographically).

          6. Impacted or horizontally tilted teeth.

          7. Concurrent signs of irreversible pathological root resorption determined
             radiographically, e.g replacement or internal root resorption, which could otherwise
             affect the prognosis of the tooth.

          8. Uncooperative patients, or those unable to cope with treatment under local
             anaesthesia, rubber dam isolation and taking of intraoral radiographs.
