      Since capability for suicide involves overriding potential pain, and the opioid system plays
      a strong role in controlling pain perception, it follows that capability for suicide may be
      impacted by the opioid system. The goal of the proposed research is to identify the neural
      network underlying capability for suicide in order to determine if it can be a target for
      identifying high-risk individuals and for intervention.

    <textblock>
      Little evidence exists distinguishing individuals with suicidal ideation (SI) from those at
      risk for suicidal behaviour, illustrating the need for more comprehensive biomarkers for
      clinicians to guide their treatment approach and for new treatment avenues. Current theories
      of suicide have suggested the importance of an individual's capability for suicide in
      predicting suicide attempt or death. Building on this, Yovell and colleagues (2016) provided
      important preliminary data that the opioid system affects suicide risk, but the neural
      mechanisms and their relationship to capability for suicide are unclear. The goal of the
      proposed research is to identify the neural network underlying capability for suicide using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to determine if it can be a target for
      identifying high-risk individuals and for intervention.

        Inclusion criteria for patients:

          -  Age between 18-55

          -  Capability of giving informed consent

          -  Not currently pregnant or lactating (due to potential confounding of brain activity as
             a result of differing hormone levels)

        Exclusion criteria for patients:

          -  Lifetime history of any substance abuse, psychosis

          -  Current use of any opioid acting drugs

          -  Current use of any prescription pain medication

          -  Use of over the counter pain medications within 15 hours of brain scan

          -  For daily users of a benzodiazepine, stimulant or atypical antipsychotic, dose within
             12 hours of brain scan

          -  For as needed users of a benzodiazepine, stimulant or atypical antipsychotic, dose
             within 2 weeks of brain scan. This is because non-daily use will have more
             unpredictable effects on brain imaging results than those who are using these
             medications on a regular basis. The 2 weeks will ensure the drug is not in the system.

          -  Medical condition requiring immediate investigation or treatment

          -  Participation in experimental treatment trials for the study duration.

        Healthy control inclusion criteria: Ages between 18 and 55 years, capable of giving
        informed consent, not pregnant or lactating, no lifetime history of Axis I/II disorders, no
        history of antidepressant or mood stabilizer use, no treatment for acute or ongoing medical
        condition, no use of any over the counter pain medication for at least 15 hours prior to
        the brain scan.
