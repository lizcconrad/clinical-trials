    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess short, mid and long-term clinical outcomes
      in patients with difficult to treat depression (such as patients with treatment resistant
      depression) treated with Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) Therapy as adjunctive therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population under study comprises a real-world patient population with difficult to treat
      depression: patients diagnosed with unipolar or bipolar disorder with chronic or recurrent
      depression who fail to achieve an adequate response to standard psychiatric management.

      The diagnosis of depression and comorbid disorders will be determined based on the Mini
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).

      A minimum of five hundred (500) patients will be implanted with a VNS Therapy System and up
      to eighty (80) sites may participate in this study.

      Enrollment will take maximum 5 years, based on competitive enrollment. For each subject a
      baseline visit will occur between 1 and 6 weeks before implant.

      Once implanted with the device, subjects will be followed-up for a minimum of 36 months and a
      maximum of 60 months.The study may stop when the last subject has reached the 36 months
      follow-up.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint of this study is response defined as reduction in Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of at least 50% from baseline to 12 months post implant.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which is used to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. Each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression. A subject is considered a 'Responder' if they achieved ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score at the Month 12 assessment. A 'Non-Responder' is any patient who did not achieve ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MADRS score at the Month 12 assessment.</description>

    <description>The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR) is a 16-item, subject-completed questionnaire of the symptoms of mood and depression. The total score ranges from 0 to 27. A higher QIDS-SR score indicates a more severe depression.</description>

The Altman Self-rating Mania Scale (ASRM) is a 5-item self-reported diagnostic scale which can be used to assess the presence and severity manic and hypomanic symptoms, most commonly in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The total score ranges from 0 to 20. A score of 6 or higher indicates a high probability of a manic or hypomanic condition.</description>

    <description>Item 10 on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scale assesses suicidal thoughts as representing the feeling that life is not worth living, that a natural death would be welcome, suicidal thoughts and preparations for suicide and is rated from 0 to 6. A score of ≥ 4 ('probably better off dead') is of particular interest.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in suicidality as measured by item #12 of QIDS-SR.</measure>

             diagnosis must be confirmed using the MINI.

          -  Provide written Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved

          -  Currently is receiving at least one antidepressant treatment (i.e., antidepressant
             drug, maintenance electroconvulsive therapy, or formal psychotherapy including
             supportive psychotherapy) or mood stabilizing treatment for bipolar patients (such as
             lithium, anticonvulsants, or atypical antipsychotics).

          -  Able and willing to comply with the frequency of (outpatient) clinic visits and to
             reliably complete all the evaluations as specified in the study protocol.Hence based
             on the nature of their disease, the following patients should not be included:
             patients with mental retardation, current severe or significant substance/alcohol
             abuse, diagnosis of one or more schizophrenia-spectrum or other psychotic disorders,
             diagnosis of borderline or severe personality disorder as determined by clinical
             judgment which, in the investigator's opinion, would significantly interfere with
             subject's participation in the study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        There are no exclusion criteria; the investigator should refer to the (local applicable)
