  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Activities Scale for Kids performance (ASKp) is one of the few self-assessment
      questionnaires in pediatric rehabilitation that measures child perception in performance of
      daily routine activities. ASKp is composed of 30 questions designed to explore activities and
      participation in children and teenagers with musculoskeletal disorders. Scores assess level
      of physical ability, identify appropriate treatment and monitor changes over time. We
      recently undertook the cross-cultural validation to achieve a culturally adapted Italian
      version of ASKp: the Italian version is now to be tested on Italian children.

      The purpose of the study isto test the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the
      ASKp assessment scale, in a representative sample of individuals with PCI.

      ASK p will be administered on a sample of individuals belonging to the population of children
      and / or adolescents with diplegia and hemiplegia as a consequence of PCI. We will perform
      comprehensive descriptive analysis of the data collected as well as the measurement of the
      degree of reliability of the Italian version of the scale. The aim is to obtain an estimate
      of ASKp reliability obtained through transcultural validation.

      Additionally, we will submit the ASKp on a control group of typical development children in
      order to test its ability to discriminate between different skill levels.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>A split-half reliability analysis will be performed by calculating the alpha of Cronbach by removing one item at a time. It will then be assessed which items lower the degree of internal reliability of the questionnaire. Items that reduce internal consistency will be eliminated and the final alpha will be calculated. For a group of children with PCI and for the control group a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the collected data will be performed, representing the distribution of scores obtained by age group.</description>
