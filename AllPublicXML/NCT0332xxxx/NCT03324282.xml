      This study will assess efficacy (based on response rate) and safety (based on grade ≥ 3
      severe adverse effects) of the combination Gemcitabine Cisplatin (GC) + anti-PD-L1 (avelumab)
      in first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer
      patients, after 6 cycles of treatment (or at 18 weeks if less than 6 cycles have been given,
      or earlier if a second line treatment is needed, before this new anticancer treatment has
      been started).

    <textblock>
      Recent results in cancer research highlight the importance of immune checkpoints in the
      control of immune response and provide access to molecules interfering with the inhibited
      immune response during the development of cancer. Drugs targeted against CTLA-4, PD-1 or
      PD-L1 have shown efficacy in various tumor types. In locally advanced or metastatic
      urothelial bladder cancer (MBC), the standard first-line treatment is the association of
      Gemcitabine and Cisplatin (GC). Objective responses and prolonged objective responses have
      been reported with monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 or PD-L1 in MBC patients after failure
      of chemotherapy. Avelumab is an investigational fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal
      antibody. Avelumab treatment did not show unexpected cross-toxicity with chemotherapy when
      studied in phase I / II in patients with different tumor types. So the combination at full
      doses of GC and avelumab seems appropriate.

      The experimental treatment is a combination of GC and avelumab given for 6 cycles. The
      duration of each cycle is 3 weeks (Gemcitabine: dose of 1000 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion
      over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle; Cisplatin: dose of 70 mg/m2 as a slow
      intravenous infusion over 2 to 4 hours on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; Avelumab: 10 mg/kg body
      weight administered Iv once every 3 weeks).

      Patients who have received all scheduled treatments and whose disease has not progressed at
      the end of treatment will enter into disease follow-up. During this follow-up period,
      patients will have disease and safety assessments performed every 3 months. Patients will
      remain in follow-up for up to 1 year from last dose of treatment and will have survival
      follow-up.
