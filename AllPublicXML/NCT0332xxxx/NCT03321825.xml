    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the sensitivity of the Merz Cheeks Fullness Assessment Scale (MCFAS) and the
      clinical relevance of aesthetically pleasing outcomes by detecting changes in cheek
      appearance after Belotero® Volume Lidocaine injection.

      The safety objectives include the identification and description of adverse events (AEs),
      adverse device effects (ADEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), serious adverse device effects
      (SADEs), anticipated serious adverse device effects (ASADEs) and unanticipated adverse device
      effects (UADEs) during the course of the study. Additionally, common treatment site responses
      (CTRs) will be assessed.

    <description>Subject's assessment is based on the entire face. FACE-Q scores are derived from questionaires 'satisfaction with cheeks' (including 5 questions relating to the satisfaction with cheek appearance, answers range from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 4 (very satisfied)), and the module 'patient-perceived age visual analogue scale' (VAS - scale ranging from -15 (15 years younger) to 15 (15 years older)).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Has right and left cheek volume deficit with a rating of 2 or 3 (moderately or
             severely sunken cheeks) on the MCFAS as determined by the blinded evaluator.

          -  2. Has the same MCFAS score on both cheeks (i.e., cheeks are symmetrical).

          -  3. Is at least 18 years of age.

          -  4. Understands and accepts the obligation not to receive any other procedures (i.e.,
             dermal fillers, toxin treatments, facial ablative or fractional laser, microderm
             abrasion, chemical peels, non-invasive skin-tightening [e.g., Ultherapy, Thermage]
             and/or surgical procedures) in the face during participation in the study.

             inflammation with the potential to interfere with the study results or increase the
             risk of AEs.

          -  5. Prior surgery, including midfacial plastic surgery, or has a permanent implant or
             graft in the midfacial region that could interfere with effectiveness assessments.

             fractional laser, microderm abrasion, chemical peels, non-invasive skin-tightening
             [e.g., Ultherapy, Thermage] and surgical procedures) in the midface region within the
             past 12 months or plans to receive them during participation in the study.

          -  10. Facial nerve palsy or history of facial nerve palsy.

          -  11. A history or documented evidence of an autoimmune disease (e.g., scleroderma,

             anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen), or other substances known to
             increase coagulation time (vitamins or herbal supplements, e.g., vitamin E, garlic,
