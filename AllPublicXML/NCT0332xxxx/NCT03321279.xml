      This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a social incentive-based gamification
      intervention to increase physical activity in the 3 months after hospital discharge. To do
      this, the investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized, controlled trial during the
      3-months after hospital discharge comparing a control group that uses a wearable device to
      track physical activity to an intervention group that uses the same wearable devices and
      receives a supportive social incentive-based gamification intervention to adhere to a step
      goal program. Patients will be enrolled during hospitalization from medicine and oncology
      floors into three phases. In phase 1 (hospitalization), patients inpatient step counts will
      be monitored. In phase 2 (week 1 post-discharge), patients will have a baseline step count
      estimated. In phase 3 (weeks 2-13 post-discharge), patients will be randomly assigned to the
      control or intervention group. Patients will be considered enrolled in the trial if they
      complete the run-in periods (phases 1 and 2) and then are randomized into phase 3.

      The enrollment phase will be part of another randomized trial which evaluates the impact of
      three recruitment strategies on patient enrollment. This trial will be completed and unmasked
      to patients before they begin the phase 1 of our study.

      The investigators will also explore patients' physical activity while in the hospital and if
      that differs across floors that have or have not deployed a nursing mobility protocol.
      Changes in patient functional decline and 30-day hospital readmission will also be explored.

    <description>Participants' daily step counts will be monitored for weeks 2-13 after hospital discharge. Participants will have a weekly step goal that increases from baseline by 10% each week of the intervention (12 weeks). Participants will engage in a social incentive-based gamification based on points and levels that leverages loss aversion, which has been demonstrated to motivate behavior change more effectively with losses than gains. Participants will receive daily feedback for the step counts and weekly feedback for levels. Participants will be asked to identify a support partner, who will receive weekly reports with the the participant's points and levels balance.</description>
