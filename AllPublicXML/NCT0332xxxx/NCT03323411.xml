  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a community-based approach, the investigators long-term goal is to empower African
      American family caregivers who are designated healthcare proxies to make informed end-of-life
      treatment decisions for participants with moderate to severe dementia before a
      life-threatening medical crisis occurs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial for efficacy of the Advance Care
      Treatment Program in an African American church-based community model. The investigators
      compared the effect of the experimental and control groups on knowledge, self-efficacy,
      intentions and behaviors from 4 urban African American churches randomly assigned to
      experimental (n=2) or control (n=2) conditions,304 (experimental n=152; control (n=152)
      health care proxies of participants that have advanced stage dementia: (a) were concurrently
      recruited in small classes each with 8-9 healthcare proxies.
