  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich plasma eye drops (E-PRP) for the
      treatment of chronic ocular surface syndrome (OSS) following laser in situ keratomileusis
      (LASIK).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective interventional consecutive case series including 156 eyes of 80 patients affected
      by chronic post-LASIK OSS who were treated with autologous E-PRP 6 times a day as monotherapy
      for 6 weeks. Assessment after treatment with E-PRP included: dry eye symptoms, change in
      corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) and conjunctival
      hyperemia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal fluorescein staining (CFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before LASIK surgery and after the 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Staining using fluorescein will be graded using the modified Oxford scale (7-point ordinal scale, score 0, 0.5, and 1 to 5 (see Appendix 2). On this modified scale, the score 0 corresponds to no staining dots and the score 0.5 to three or less staining dots. A CFS grade of 0 represents complete corneal clearing.
A negative change from baseline will indicate improvement.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dry eye symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Before LASIK surgery and after the 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The symptoms of ocular discomfort (unrelated to instillation of the study medication), burning/stinging, foreign body sensation, eye dryness, pain, will be assessed for intensity by the study patients using a self-administered VAS ranging from 0% to 100%. The symptoms will be assessed separately for each eye and data from the worst eye will be used for analysis.
A decrease in the VAS score from baseline will indicate improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before LASIK surgery and after the 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Best corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) will be measured using the LogMar scale. The patient is seated at 3 or 4 m from the EDTRS or modified EDTRS chart, depending on chart size and must try to read all letters first while covering the left eye, then while covering the right eye.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Conjunctival hyperemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Before LASIK surgery and after the 6 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Biomicroscopy will be performed using a slit lamp. The patient will be seated while being examined grading of the conjunctival hyperemia, according to the following scales:
0 = None (normal).
= Mild (a flush reddish color predominantly confined to the palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva).
= Moderate (more prominent red color of the palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva).
= Severe (definite redness of palpebral or bulbar conjunctiva).</description>
