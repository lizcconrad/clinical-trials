  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A widely used semi-quantitative parameter to assess tumor status is the standardized uptake
      value (SUV). SUV estimation accuracy can be impacted by many variables. Today there still
      exists a significant amount of variability in PET/CT results in test and re-test studies.
      This variability can be introduced by instrumentation and subject-specific factors.
      Variability reduces image quality and increases the required changes in tumor quantification
      to reflect real tumor response or progression.

      PET/CT scanning process requires that the entire net injected dose of radiolabeled tracer is
      administered intravenously as a bolus. The quality and quantification of a PET/CT image is
      highly dependent on the uptake of radiolabeled tracer. Boellaard et al. have indicated
      infiltrations could potentially underestimate SUV measurements by as much as 50%.
      Infiltrations and obstructions are not uncommon.

      Recent studies using a novel QA/QC tool (LaraTM System) for the radiotracer injection process
      revealed that current means to detect infiltration do not completely identify all
      infiltrations/obstructions. Since infiltrations may not be visible in the standard field of
      view (FOV) and since the impact of a peripheral circulatory obstruction may not be visible
      even if an injection site is in the FOV, it is possible for reading and treating physicians
      to be unaware that a patient's image and quantification has been impacted. Additionally, when
      current means do detect an infiltration, they under-represent the severity because they are
      not capturing that infiltrations often resolve during the uptake period. As a result,
      infiltrations or obstructions may cause SUV inaccuracy and could adversely impact staging and
      tumor assessments.

      The purpose of this study will be to characterize the impact of moderate or greater
      infiltrations on standardized uptake values. Patients experiencing a moderate or greater
      infiltration on a routine clinical PET scan will be invited to return for a repeat scan with
      injection performed by specially trained personnel to reduce the risk of repeat infiltration.
      The two scans will be compared to assess for changes in tumor uptake intensity.
