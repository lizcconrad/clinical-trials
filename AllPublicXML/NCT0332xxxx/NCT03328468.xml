  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the breathing intervention, the patients will be randomized into four groups (see figure
      below) to evaluate whether the order of when the breathing intervention occurs matters
      (respectively before or after questions about their perception of movements are asked).
      (experimental design)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will have a one-time visit. The only planned intervention is a one-time
      breathing exercise. The movements scored in AFAS will be tested before and after the
      intervention.

      The protocol for the breathing intervention is as follows:

      The breathing protocol will last 15 minutes. This will be a guided breathing awareness
      session with a registered nurse (PhD student) who is also trained in integrative therapies
      and yoga instruction. The intervention will include having the participants become aware of
      their breath and then regulate breathing to a rhythm keeping the exhale portion longer than
      the inhale. The goal of the breathing exercise is to obtain relaxation. Therefore the
      participants will be encouraged to breathe with a rate and rhythm that is comfortable for
      them.
