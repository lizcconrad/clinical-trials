      Objective: Investigators aimed to evaluate the impact of a high resolution standardized
      laparoscopic (HRSL) cholecystectomy protocol on operative time and intraoperative
      interruptions in a teaching hospital.

      Background: Interruptions of the surgical workflow or microcomplications (MC) lead to
      prolonged procedure times and costs and can be indicative for surgical mistakes. Reducing MC
      can improve operating room efficiency and prevent intraoperative complications.

      Methods: Audio video records of laparoscopic cholecystectomies were reviewed regarding type,
      frequency and duration of MC before and after the implementation of a HRSL which included the
      introduction of a stepwise protocol for the procedure and a teaching video. After consent
      operating team members were obliged to prepare the operation with these resources.
