  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether the expression and production of adipokines
      secreted by the epicardial adipose tissue correlate with the degree of coronary
      atherosclerosis.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether the expression and production of four
      adipokines [adiponectin, omenin-1, resistin and retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4)] secreted by
      the epicardial adipose tissue correlate with the degree of coronary atherosclerosis.
      Specifically, this study aims to investigate whether the expression and production of these
      adipokines is different between two sites of the heart, that are perfused by coronary
      arteries with different degrees of stenosis.

This comparison will be performed in the following clusters of groups:
Cluster 1: NonDM-0 and DM-0 (comparison between territories that are supplied by non-stenosed coronary arteries)
Cluster 2: NonDM-LR and DM-LR (comparison between territories that are supplied by stenosed coronary arteries)
Cluster 3: NonDM-L, NonDM-R, DM-L and DM-R (comparison between a territory that is supplied by stenosed coronary artery and another territory that is supplied by non-stenosed coronary artery)</description>
