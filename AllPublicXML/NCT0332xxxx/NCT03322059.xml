  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to examine whether linking daily activity with charity-based
      incentives motivates cancer survivors to initiate and maintain physical activity. Linking
      daily physical activity goals with a cancer specific charity incentive may provide a uniquely
      salient motivator that promotes increased physical activity among cancer survivors. The
      investigators will examine whether using activity monitors in combination with charitable
      incentives leads to greater increases in physical activity compared to activity monitors
      alone. Target participants includes cancer survivors who are not already active. Physical
      activity (e.g., steps per day, time in moderate-intensity activity) will be examined at
      baseline and following a 12-week intervention period using an activPAL accelerometer. After
      the baseline assessment, both groups will receive a fitbit monitor and informational material
      designed to increase physical activity. Participants in the fitbit+charity group will have
      donations made in their name to a cancer charity if they meet daily step goals. Physical
      activity levels will be monitored using the fitbit device for 6-weeks following the formal
      intervention period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of a 12-week physical activity intervention.
      Fifty cancer survivors will be recruited and allocated to one of two research arms:
      Fitbit+Only Group or Fitbit+Charity Incentives Group. Participants in both intervention arms
      will be asked to track their physical activities using Fitbit One, an activity monitor that
      monitors steps and physical activity and will receive basic educational materials about
      increasing physical activity. Those in the Fitbit+charity incentives Group will raise money
      for cancer charities if they meet weekly step targets.

      The key outcome variable of the RCT is steps as measured by an activPAL accelerometer. Data
      will be collected at baseline and 12-weeks. Fitbit data will also be collected for the
      duration of the 12-week intervention and for 6-weeks following the end of the intervention
      period to have an initial examination of behavior change maintenance (total 18-weeks).
