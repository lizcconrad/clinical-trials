  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few surgical methods to treat male stress urinary incontinence have been assessed in
      comparative, randomised interventional studies.

      Ustrap is a new adjustable-pressure 4-arm device. The artificial sphincter is currently
      considered the gold standard device in this field.

      The aim of this randomised prospective international study is to assess the efficacy and
      safety of the Ustrap® device comparatively with an artificial sphincter (AMS800) in the
      treatment of stress urinary incontinence following prostate removal in cancer patients.
