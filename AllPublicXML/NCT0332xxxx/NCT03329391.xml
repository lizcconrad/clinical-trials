  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, effective management strategies for treatment-resistant
      depression are limited and yet to be developed. However, nursing interventions focusing on
      adherence enhancement, symptom reduction, and stress management may be strategic for a better
      disease management. This study aims to define the rarely-studied concept of TRD under the
      cultural context of Taiwan and to identify new feasible treatment model from nursing
      perspectives. The project will establish important basis on the descriptions of psychosocial
      features and need assessment of people with TRD under experienced psychiatric team
      validation, and also build up a cultural-specific non-pharmacological intervention module for
      effective TRD management in Taiwan. The nursing model of TRD management will promote the
      development of integrative depression care in the future and complement current modalities,
      while providing important evidence-based information for further research and services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The three-year pioneering project will begin with observing the psychosocial characteristics
      and demographic profile of a group of patients with depressive disorders and a sub-group of
      TRD cohort, followed by validating the cultural meanings and recovery constructs of TRD
      through professional and lay focus groups. In the second to third year, we will examine the
      effectiveness of a 6-week, nurse-led psychosocial intervention with group approach in a
      randomized control trial (RCT) compared to the controls receiving usual care with follow-ups.
      Detailed psychiatric assessment and study interviews will be performed at baseline, 3, 6, and
      9 months after the intervention by a senior psychiatrist and a research assistant using
      standardized operation forms.Structured measurements will be utilized to collect primary
      outcome variables of psychological distress, suicide risk and resilience as well as secondary
      outcome measures of quality of life, community reintegration level, perceived satisfaction,
      and main clinical variables (e.g., treatment adherence, service use such as ER/OPD attendance
      or hospitalization days). The control group receives usual care of pharmacological therapy
      provided by the psychiatrists in the Psychiatric Department.

    <measure>Change of score of the Brief Symptom Rating Scale(BSRS-5) for psychological distress level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and follow up sessions on 3,6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The full scale contains five items of psychopathology: (1) anxiety; (2) depression; (3) hostility; (4) interpersonal sensitivity: inferiority; and (5) insomnia. An extra question &quot;Do you have any suicide ideation?&quot; is added at the end of the scale. It is a 5-item Likert scale (scores of 0 to 4) for assessment of psychological distress level by self-report of by interview. The rating of symptoms is based on a 5-point scale: 0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, moderately; 3, quite a bit; 4, extremely. Total score will be calculated based on the 5 questions with a maximum score of 20, where a higher score indicates poorer mental health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ) for participants' reintegration progress</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up sessions on 3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>CIQ consists of three domains: home integration, social integration and productivity. The scale contains 15 items. The home integration subscale is made up of 5 items at which each item is scored from 0-2, where 2 indicates highest degree of integration. The Social Integration subscale consists 6 items with the same scoring method mentioned above. The productivity subcale consists of 4 questions with a total points of 7. Scores of these subscales are then added up as an overall CIQ score. Maximum score is 29, which represents maximum community reintegration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of score in Brief Resilience Coping Scale (BRCS) for tendencies to cope with stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and follow up sessions on 3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 4-item measurement tool designed to assess the ability of an individual to cope with stress in a resilient fashion. The response consists of five options at which 1 means the statement &quot;does not describe you at all&quot; and 5 means &quot;it describes you very well&quot;. The score is then added up. 4-13 indicates low resilient copers; 14-16 indicates medium resilient copers; and 17-20 indicates high resilient copers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of score in 9-item Concise Mental Health Checklist (CMHC-9) for suicide risk assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment and last follow up session</time_frame>
    <description>It is consisted of two subscales, which are the Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5R) and Chinese SAD PERSONS Scale (CSPS) measuring psychopathology and key suicide risk factors respectively. The BSRS-5R consists of 5 items same as the BSRS-5, only that the answer is modified to yes/no responses instead of 5-point Likert Scale. The responses are coded into 1/0 respectively and the total score ranges from 0 to 5. The CSPS is a 9-item self-reported checklist design to evaluate suicide risk and assists decisions about hospitalization for ED patients. It contains three demographic items and six suicide risk items. The coding of the score is same as the BSRS-5R. After deleting three demographic variables and redundant items of delusional thought and severe suicide attempt, the two subscales are merged together, with a total score ranging from 0 to 9.</description>

    <measure>EQ-5D questionnaire for quality of life.</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up sessions on 3, 6, and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a self-completed questionnaire which contains five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain-discomfort, and anxiety-depression. The level of function in each dimension is classified into three degrees of disability, which is level 1(no disability), level 2(moderate disability), and level 3(severe disability). These responses will then generate a 5-digit descriptor ranging from 11111 indicating perfect health to 33333 indicating worth possible state. It is accompanied by a visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) which ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).</description>

    <measure>MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The scale contains a ladder illustrations, ranging from 1 to 10. There are two versions of ladder, the society ladder is a global measure of subjective social status and demonstrate an individual's place in the social hierarchy; the community ladder assesses how individual see themselves in the ladder considering the community they are living in. Those with higher living standards will be on top of ladder and vice versa.</description>
