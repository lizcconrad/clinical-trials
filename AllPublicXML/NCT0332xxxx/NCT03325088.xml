  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory respiratory disease affecting 6 to 7% of the French adult
      population and responsible of 1000 deaths in France every year. Many anti-inflammatory
      treatments are available but few had been developed to target
      hyperresponsiveness.Investigators and searchers of the Institut du thorax have recently
      demonstrated the main involvement of Rac1 monomeric G protein in the contraction of airway
      smooth muscle cells. They show that Rac1 is expressed in the airway smooth muscle cells in
      mice and its activity is increased in the bronchi of asthma induced mice sensitized to
      House-Dust Mite. They further demonstrate that Rac1 inhibition in mice by nebulisation
      reduces airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary inflammation. Investigators and searchers of
      the Institut du thorax would like to seek whether targeting Rac1 would be interesting in
      asthmatic patients. Primary objective of this study is to determine if Rac1 expression and
      activity in airway smooth muscle cells are increased in asthmatic patients compare to
      controlled samples (deceased donor samples). Secondary objective is to determine whether
      there is a correlation between Rac1 activity and asthma severity.

      If Rac1 activity in airway smooth muscles is indeed increased in asthmatic patients depending
      on asthma severity, Rac1 could be a potential target to treat airway hyperresponsiveness.

      Patients will be openly labeled in one of the following group

        -  21 patients with severe asthma, without oral corticosteroids treatment.,

        -  21 patients with mild to moderate asthma without treatment,

        -  21 controlled samples from smooth muscle cells of non-asthmatic deceased donor Bronchial
           endoscopy with bronchial biopsies will be assessed in all asthmatic patients, Control
           samples will be obtained from tracheobronchial rings of cadaveric donor. Expression and
           activity of Rac1 in airway smooth muscle will be determined by immuno-staining on
           paraffinised biopsies.

      Patients will undergo two study visits (D0: inclusion visit, D15: exploratory visit) and one
      phone call at D21.
