    <textblock>
      This randomised-controlled trial will assess the effect of an early intervention on the
      social-communicative abilities and brain activity of preschoolers with autism spectrum
      disorder (ASD). The childrenÂ´s social-communicative abilities and the related brain activity
      will be evaluated at three time points: before the start of the intervention
      (pre-intervention), immediately after its conclusion (post-intervention) and several weeks
      after its conclusion (follow-up).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that parent-implemented interventions are effective in improving
      the social skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). With the present project
      we want to investigate the brain activity changes that are at the basis of the changes
      observed in the children's behaviour. More specifically, we will assess the effect of Project
      ImPACT, a parent-implemented intervention, which teaches parents techniques to stimulate the
      social-communicative abilities of their children.

      The intervention is suitable for preschoolers with a diagnosis of ASD and consists of 18
      sessions of maximum 2 hours each, one session per week, delivered by trained therapists of
      the home guidance services in Flanders. Children with a diagnosis of ASD (or children who are
      suspected of ASD) between 1,5 and 4 years old and their parents will participate in the
      study. They will be randomly assigned to the ImPACT intervention or treatment as usual. We
      will assess the effect of the intervention on the children's social-communicative abilities,
      and on the neural and biological correlates of these abilities.

      The families will be invited to come to the Faculty of Psychology and Pedagogical Sciences at
      three time points: before the start of the intervention, immediately after the end of the
      intervention (which is expected to last 18 weeks) and 12 weeks after the end of the
      intervention.

    <description>Project ImPACT will be provided in 18 weekly intervention sessions, during which parents will learn how to stimulate their children's social imitation, social engagement, language and play skills. First, parents are taught techniques that promote interaction with the child (one technique per session, through demonstration and coaching). In the second half of the intervention, parents are taught direct teaching techniques, e.g., to promote language or play, again by means of demonstration and coaching. After completion of the program, families will receive guidance every 2-3 weeks for an additional 12 weeks, during which the support will generally not focus on social-communicative abilities, although ImPACT follow-up sessions might be given if necessary.</description>
