  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was prospective, randomized. Patients with cancer pain were evaluated, one group
      receiving methadone with morphine and another group receiving morphine as the only opioid.
      Pain intensity, total morphine dose and adverse effects were evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioids are the most important analgesics for the relief of cancer pain. In addition
      tolerance and hyperalgesia may ocurr as a consequence of treatment with these drugs.
      Medications for pain relief may also cause increased pain. NMDA receptor blockers may prevent
      or reduce the development of hyperalgesia. Methadone is a weak NMDA receptor antagonist and
      therefore its association could prevent hyperalgesia. The primary endpoint of the study was
      whether the administration of low dose methadone associated with morphine promotes better
      analgesic effect in patients with cancer pain, And secondarily to assess whether there is a
      reduction in the total dose of opioid needed for pain relief, and whether reduction of the
      opioid-related adverse effects occurs.
