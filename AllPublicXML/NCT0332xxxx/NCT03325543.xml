  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is a conservative treatment, currently considered as
      first line for women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). However, in practice, about 30
      to 50% of women are unable to perform the correct contraction of the pelvic floor muscles
      (PFMs). When requested to perform the muscle contraction, the contraction of the gluteal
      muscles, hip adductors, or abdominal muscles is observed initially, rather of contraction of
      the levator anus muscle. Some factors make it difficult to perform the contraction of the
      PFM, such as its location on the pelvic floor, and its small size, followed by a lack of
      knowledge of the pelvic region, as well as its functions. Associated with these factors is
      the use of the muscles adjacent to the PFM, as previously mentioned. In order for women to
      benefit from a PFMT program for the treatment of SUI, the awareness phase of PFM can't be
      omitted, since the literature is unanimous in stating that pelvic exercises improve the
      recruitment capacity of the musculature, its tone and reflex coordination during the effort
      activities.

      Research Questions: The objectives of this study is to test the hypothesis that the provision
      of verbal instructions about the anatomy and function of PFMs associated with the use of body
      techniques awareness and vaginal palpation helps in learning the correct contraction and
      improves the function of the PFMs.

      Design: A single-centered, double-blind (investigator and outcome assessor) randomised
      controlled trial with two physiotherapy intervention groups.

      Measurements: The primary outcome measure will be the EMG activity of the PFMs, gluteus
      maximus, hip adductor, and the group formed by the abdominal transverse (TrA) and internal
      oblique (IO) muscles during rest and maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). The secondary
      outcome measure will be the PFM function (vaginal palpation and visual observation), posture
      assessment (software SAPO), and self-efficacy scale for practising PFM exercises.

    <time_frame>Questions about the expectation of results will be applied in the first week and after the fourth week of intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is composed of 17 questions in the visual analogue scale format with responses ranging from 0 (not confident) to 100 (most confident). Thirteen questions refer to self-efficacy and four questions to expectation of results. The final result is obtained by averaging the items, which ranges from 0 to 100, where higher values are equivalent to more beneficial action of self-efficacy / expected result of the training of the PFM.</description>

    <description>The treatment program is based on the motor learning concepts of PFMs. The steps of learning a correct muscle contraction will be separate into four levels: 1. Understand 2. Search 3. Find 4. Learn. Feedback from the PF is mandatory. The intervention program will last four weeks, and will contain four outpatient consultations (1 session per week) lasting 60 minutes each session.</description>
