      To study, prospectively, the association between dietary patterns and risk of health outcomes
      (cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine, neurological, skeletal muscular, cancer) in cohort
      study of 116,671 women age 24 to 44 years at baseline in 1989 (the Nurses' Health Study II;
      NHS II).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health status and lifestyle information was self-reported on a questionnaire at baseline, and
      on questionnaires distributed to participants biennially thereafter. Dietary intake data was
      collected in form of a comprehensive, 131-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ),
      distributed among participants every four years. The response rate remained over 90%. Dietary
      data was validated using biomarkers, health status data using medical records.

      Dietary pattern scores were derived from FFQs using cumulative average whenever possible from
      years preceding the outcomes.

      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate associations between
      dietary pattern scores and health outcomes, except in case of pregnancy complications (such
      as gestational diabetes mellitus/GDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy/HDPs) where
      multivariable logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations, with an
      exchangeable working correlation structure to account for correlated outcomes between
      pregnancies.

        The Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II) is a prospective cohort established in 1989 that
        includes 116,671 female registered U.S. nurses, aged 24-44 at baseline. Mailed
        questionnaires were administered biennially to collect data on medical and lifestyle
        factors, with a follow-up rate exceeding 90% for each 2-year cycle. Comprehensive food
        frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were distributed every four years to collect data on
        dietary intake.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All women without history of chronic disease and/or primary outcome at the time of
             recruitment. Women contribute person-time until a first diagnosis of the primary
             outcome or until the end of follow-up.

          -  All women who reported a singleton pregnancy between 1991-2001 (data on pregnancy
             outcomes was collected on biennial questionnaires until 2001, since majority of women
             exited the reproductive age by then) (only for maternal outcomes)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  women with a history of chronic disease (type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or
             cancer) or other disease studied as the primary outcome

          -  women with a missing or incomplete FFQ (more than 70 out of 131 items missing, or with
             caloric intake &lt;800 kcal/day or &gt;3500kcal/day) prior to endpoint.

          -  women with missing data on the primary outcome on biennial questionnaire.

          -  twin/multiple pregnancy (only for maternal outcomes)
