  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
      an individualized group based exercise and education program supported in the community to a
      control group of usual care in preventing back pain flare-ups and to mitigate the negative
      consequences of subsequent episodes if they occur.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives are to:

      â€¢ To compare the effectiveness of the two interventions in preventing an activity-limiting
      LBP flare up at 12 and 24 months.

      Secondary objectives are to:

        -  To compare the effectiveness of the interventions in mitigating the negative
           consequences of LBP.

        -  To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions in preventing activity-limiting
           LBP flare-up.

        -  To identify subgroups of individuals that may best respond to each one of the two
           interventions.

      Exploratory objectives include:

        -  evaluate the fluctuating nature of back pain using a smart phone application to collect
           pain measures once a week for 1 year (trajectories will also be evaluated to compare
           between group effects)

        -  assess adherence to physical activity using activity monitors.

        -  evaluate the relationship between activity levels and flare-ups as a method for
           understanding pain triggers and impact of activity pacing.

    <masking_description>Given that this is an exercise study blinding of participants and those delivering the exercise program will not be possible. Outcome measures will be collected by an investigator not aware of treatment allocation, but most outcome measures will be self-reported and thus, true assessor blinding will no be possible.

    <measure>Activity limiting flare-up</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>flare-up is an increase in pain levels of greater than or equal to 3 on a 0-10 numeric pain scale. The LBP international consensus on minimal important change in pain is 2 on a 0-10 scale and thus a change of 3 is likely be clinically important.15
activity-limiting LBP will be measured using an adaptation of the item PI9 of the PROMIS item bank. (How much did LBP interfere with your day to day activities?) A score of 3 or greater (representing somewhat impact) on a 1-5 scale will be considered as activity limitation.
Participants will fit the criteria for activity-limiting flare-up if pain increases at least 3 points AND pain is identified to be limiting on the PI9 as described above.
Flare-up will be collected once a week for 1 year</description>

    <description>This arm will begin with PT assessment. Following this, participants will meet with a specialist who will design an individualized physical activity program. Classes will include warm up, 40 minutes of individualized exercises and a cool down that will include back pain specific exercises including core strengthening. The first 4 weeks of exercise will include a 30-minute education program. Education comprise information on back pain, efficient use of the back during daily activities, self-management, self-efficacy and pain neurophysiology. Classes will run for a 12-week period. Participants will be encouraged to attend the exercise facility at least 3 times a week. An activity monitor will be provided to all participants. We will use group classes to facilitate the development of social support.</description>

             following a course of treatment for LBP (pain in the area between the 12th rib and
             buttock crease)

          -  Have non-specific LBP which is pain not attributed to a specific diagnosis such as
             sciatica, ankylosing spondylitis, vertebral fracture, etc.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Participants will be excluded if they meet the following criteria:

          -  Ongoing high pain intensity, defined as pain intensity of 6 or more on a 0-10 point
             scale. The cut off of 6/10 is used in the literature to dichotomise low/moderate to
             high pain intensity.

          -  Co-morbidity preventing participation in physical activity evaluated using the
             Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) from the American College of Sports
             Medicine guidelines
