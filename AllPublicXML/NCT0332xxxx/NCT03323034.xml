      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when giving
      together with irinotecan hydrochloride and temozolomide in treating patients with solid
      tumors or lymphoma that have come back after a period of improvement or that do not respond
      to treatment. Pevonedistat and irinotecan hydrochloride may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      pevonedistat, irinotecan hydrochloride, and temozolomide may work better in treating patients
      with solid tumors or lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      pevonedistat administered as an intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, 10, and 12 of a 28-day
      cycle (cycle 1), and on days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21-day cycle (cycle 2 and beyond) in
      combination with irinotecan hydrochloride (irinotecan) (administered as an intravenous
      infusion on days 8-12 of cycle 1 and days 1-5 of cycles 2+) and temozolomide (administered
      orally on day 1 alone and on days 8, 10 and 12 in cycle 1 and days 1-5 of cycles 2+) in
      children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS)
      tumors and lymphoma.

      II. To define and describe the toxicities of pevonedistat administered on this schedule.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of pevonedistat in children with recurrent or
      refractory cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of pevonedistat within the confines of a
      phase 1 study.

      II. To assess the biologic activity of pevonedistat.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of pevonedistat.

      Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 10, and 12,
      temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 8 -12, and irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes
      on days 8-12 of course 1. Beginning at course 2, patients receive pevonedistat IV over 60
      minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5, and irinotecan hydrochloride
      IV over 90 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for course 1 and 21 days for
      subsequent courses for up to 17 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

             since last dose of corticosteroid

          -  Patients who are currently receiving another investigational drug are not eligible

          -  Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents are not eligible

          -  Patients must not have received enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants for at least 7 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Patients who are receiving cyclosporine, tacrolimus or other agents to prevent
             graft-versus-host disease post bone marrow transplant are not eligible for this trial

          -  Patients who are receiving any investigational agent other than pevonedistat,
             including but not limited to androgens, supraphysiologic doses of corticosteroids,
             erythropoietin, eltrombopag, or romiplostim

          -  Patients who have received drugs that are strong or moderate inhibitors and/or
             inducers of CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to enrollment are not eligible; while on
             study, the following BCRP inhibitors (cyclosporine, eltrombopag, gefitinib) should be
             avoided if possible, and concomitant use of UGT1A1 inhibitors, such as diclofenac,
             ketoconazole, probenecid, silibinin, nilotinib and atazanavir, should be avoided
             because of potential for increased irinotecan toxicity

          -  Patients who have an uncontrolled infection are not eligible

          -  Patients who have received a prior solid organ transplantation are not eligible

          -  Patients with known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive are not eligible

          -  Patients with known hepatitis B surface antigen seropositive or known or suspected
             active hepatitis C infection are not eligible; NOTE: patients who have isolated
             positive hepatitis B core antibody (i.e., in the setting of negative hepatitis B
             surface antigen and negative hepatitis B surface antibody) must have an undetectable
             hepatitis B viral load; patients who have positive hepatitis C antibody may be
             included if they have an undetectable hepatitis C viral load

          -  Patients who in the opinion of the investigator may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study are not eligible
