  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the impact of pre-test video education and
      post-test genetic counseling as compared to in-person pre-test genetic counseling in males
      with advanced prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be randomized to either pre-test video education and post-test genetic
      counseling or in-person pre-test genetic counseling. Outcomes evaluated are: prevalence of
      germline mutations, uptake of genetic testing, satisfaction with testing, knowledge of
      multi-gene panels, distress, result disclosure to relatives, and the impact on personal or
      family medical care. Through this study, the investigators will learn about the inherited
      causes of prostate cancer, and how and when genetic testing should be offered to this
      population.

    <measure>Genetic testing satisfaction score</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of post-counseling/video pre-result disclosure and at 1 month post-result disclosure</time_frame>
    <description>A validated survey of participants' satisfaction with the genetic counseling and testing process will be used. For the survey at the time of post-counseling, the survey for the video education arm consists of 8 questions and the genetic counseling arm contains an additional question about perceived length of the visit. The parameters for measurement are &quot;disagree strongly&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;neither agree or disagree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, and &quot;agree strongly&quot;. At the time of 1 month post-result disclosure, an additional set of 5 questions will be added. Four of these five questions will be evaluated using the previously described parameters. The remaining question will be answered by the response options: &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;I did not get the packet&quot;. Survey responses will be re-coded on a numerical scale consistent with the standard Likert scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment score and subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 4 months post-result disclosure</time_frame>
    <description>MICRA is a widely used validated 25-item measure that assesses psychosocial consequences associated with genetic testing for cancer. Section 1 contains 3 sub-scales: the Positive sub-scale (4 items), the Distress sub-scale (6 items), and the Uncertainty sub-scale (9 items) and two other items that do not fit into either sub-scale. Section 2 contains two items for participants who have children. Section 3 contains 2 items for participants who have/have had cancer. Responses are indicated on a 4 point scale for experiences in the past week. A higher score in the sub-scales or total scale indicated greater distress. The positive sub-scale is reverse scored to reflect this.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge of multigene panel testing score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months post-result disclosure</time_frame>
    <description>A 24 item investigator-developed knowledge scale applicable to this population was developed through an expert panel and in-depth patient cognitive interviews to determine if participants are able to recall key core components about multi-gene panel testing. Each item provides three choice answers: &quot;agree&quot;, &quot;disagree&quot;, or &quot;I don't know&quot;. Knowledge will be scored on the number of &quot;correct&quot; responses where higher correct responses represents more knowledge of multigene panel testing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family communication for those who tested positive for a genetic mutation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 and 4 months post-result disclosure</time_frame>
    <description>For those participants who have tested positive for a mutation, 5 items will be asked pertaining to disclosure of genetic testing results to relatives that are derived from previous literature.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intent to disclose genetic test results</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-result disclosure</time_frame>
