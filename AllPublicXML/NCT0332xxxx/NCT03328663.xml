      of life and mood of caregivers of patients undergoing stem cell transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether a psychological intervention can make the
      experience of being a caregiver more manageable by improving the participant's quality of
      life, mood, and caregiving burden during the participant's loved one's transplant process.

      The psychological intervention will entail six visits with a trained clinician and will take
      place during the first three months of the participant's loved ones' transplant process. A
      trained behavioral psychologist or social worker will meet with the participant or talk with
      the participant over the telephone or video conference for 45 minutes at a time to discuss
      the participant's caregiver experience and to help the participant develop effective skills
      to support the participant's loved one as well as participant over the course of the
      transplant.

      The study will use a series of questionnaires to measure the participant's quality of life,
      mood, and overall caregiving burden. Study questionnaires will be completed in the hospital
      or clinic. The participant will also have the option of completing these questionnaires
      remotely through a secure web link, over the telephone, or in a mailed paper copy.
