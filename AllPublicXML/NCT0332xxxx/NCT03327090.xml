      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of the Kinesio Tape facilitation technique on
      the muscle power performance of elite weightlifters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most sportsmen require the power of muscles for their performance. Weightlifting exercises
      such as the snatch or clean and jerk and their variations are frequently included in the
      power training programs of athletes who contest or participate in sports that need muscle
      power. The weightlifting exercises require athletes to accelerate the weight throughout the
      whole second pull phase, causing the barbell to be raised overhead and the athlete's body
      into the air, a movement in which the feet leave the platform. Furthermore, the movement
      patterns of the weightlifting exercises are mostly considered to be similar to athletic
      movements in different sports such as jumping and sprinting in soccer and basketball.
      Empirically, the kinetic qualities of the second pull phase are similar in both weightlifting
      and jumping movements. The role of the sport physical therapist is not restricted only to
      rehabilitation and injuries prevention, but they can also contribute to the performance of
      the athletes in a different aspect. Therefore, finding tools which may improve the muscle
      power of the weightlifters could increase the success in performing the sport-specific
      movements with higher loads. This could make the difference between winning or losing a
      competition. Thus, if it could be proven that the Kinesio Tape has the capability to improve
      muscle power, it could be used as a tool by the physiotherapist, either for enhancing the
      athlete's performance or for accelerating the last stage of the rehabilitation and,
      therefore, decreasing the number of absent days of athletes from training or matches due to
      injury.

    <description>The Kinesio Tape original brand was used in this study (Kinesio® Tex GoldTM finger print, black, Georgia, Albuquerque). The application of the experimental Kinesio Tape was as Dr. Kenzo Kase demonstration for muscle facilitation (Kase. et al., 2003):
Gluteal maximus muscle.
Quadriceps muscle.
Gastrocnemius muscle and soleus muscle (triceps surae).
The tape was in tension (15%- 35%) and the muscles were stretched during the application.</description>

    <description>Same tape brand was used, but different application techniques were utilized for the three muscles.
Gluteal maximus muscle.
Quadriceps muscle.
Gastrocnemius muscle and soleus muscle (triceps surae).
There were no tension on the tape and no muscle stretching during the application.</description>

    <description>Kinesio Tape: An elastic therapeutic tape, which mimics the skin's thickness. It is a cotton, porous fabric and acrylic adhesive, which is non-medicated and free of latex. The Kinesio Tape is applied in a specific manner to enhance muscle function, increase circulation, decrease pain and improve proprioception.</description>
