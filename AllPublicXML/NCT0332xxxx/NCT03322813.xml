    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess the safety and feasibility of using the ExAblate, Type 2 to
      temporarily disrupt the blood brain barrier in non-enhancing suspected glioblastomas. The
      ExAblate Model 4000 Type-2 is intended for use as a tool to disrupt the BBB.

      This study is a prospective, single-arm, non-randomized, open-label feasibility study to
      evaluate the safety of focal BBBD using the ExAblate® 4000 Type 2 system. Up to 15 subjects
      with suspected glioblastoma who are scheduled to undergo brain tumor resection may be
      recruited for the study. Only patients that have a non-enhancing tumor components in a
      non-eloquent region of the planned standard-of-care resection volume will be eligible. Up to
      4 centers may participate in this study.
