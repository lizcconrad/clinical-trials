  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asherman's syndrome is characterized by the presence of intrauterine adhesions (IUA) as well
      as symptoms such as amenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, pelvic pain, and infertility. The gold
      standard for the treatment of intrauterine adhesions is hysteroscopic intrauterine adhesions.
      The recurrence of intrauterine adhesions is a major challenge in clinical practice. It has
      been reported that dried biological aminion graft was used to prevent adhesion after the
      operation of intrauterine adhesions. Intrauterine balloon can reduce the recurrence of
      adhesions after operation. Does the combination of balloon and amniotic products can improve
      clinical outcomes? Therefore, this study was conducted.

      The diaposable balloon uterine(a special intrauterine balloon) is usually inserted into the
      uterine after a hysteroscopic adhesiolysis and removed after on the 7th day after surgery.
      Another group, the diaposable balloon uterin and dried biological amnion will be inserted
      into the uterine after a hysteroscopic adhesiolysis and removed after on the 7th day after
      surgery.Several investigators demonstrated its favorable effect in the recurrence of adhesion
      after the treatment of intrauterine adhesion. Disposable balloon uterine stent is specially
      designed to fit into the cavity of the uterus, and usually removed on the 7th day after
      surgery.
